00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,880
This week, the team behind Rage 2 lean into Walmart Canada's League with some advice

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,760
in all its pastel spray-painted glory.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
This is just one embargo to turn Lemons into Lemonade.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,000
every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,040
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,680
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 774, oh, title's wrong on Twitch,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,460
for this April the 28th of 2019.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,300
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, welcome back to the show this week,

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,720
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Oh, hi.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
Hello, how are you?

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,320
So you had a week off and how did everything go with that?

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,700
It was really good.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,960
It was the 40th anniversary for the San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and it was

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,920
also our conclave so we had nuns from all over the world.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
I had a super fun time hanging out with French nuns.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,440
They were cool and we actually had a satyr for Passover in the middle of Hamburger Mary's.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Oh, that's really cute.

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,660
It was a really fast satyr and I had been holding onto the bag of stuff through like

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,340
the Pink Moon ritual and all kinds of stuff that was happening and we just had a great

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
time.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,340
It was really fun.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,100
I didn't go on like some of the big events but I went out for what I could and then I

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,820
had my birthday on Friday last week.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Happy birthday.

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,100
Thank you.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,380
And I went to the Cherry Blossom Festival and got way overwhelmed with humans but I

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,460
went to look at the Paper Doll exhibits and I watched JD play Karta and I ended up kind

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,420
of playing a little bit with him over his shoulder just because I could read decently.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,220
And what's funny is that the people there, you can read, I'm like, a bit, a bit, see

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
that much?

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,220
Yeah.

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
It's enough to squeeze Pikachu's head.

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,220
But yeah, it was pretty fun.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,220
We had a good time.

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,620
It was great hanging out with JD.

39
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,700
I made good friends with their roommate Connie.

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,020
She gave me a Lolita dress that fits me perfectly.

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,020
It's beautiful.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,020
How fun.

43
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,680
It's nice to make new friends through friends and all that.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,100
I wore a full Lolita at the park, at Dolores Park.

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,440
I mean, in a way, you and I became friends through mutual friends at the time.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
So hey, it's a meeting, meeting friends through friends is the best way to do it.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Nord stuff.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Nord stuff.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,860
Also a friend that we met around that same time many years ago.

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,920
Say hello to Techmaster Loki here in studio with us.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Hello.

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Hi, how are you?

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm fine.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Are you enjoying this lovely soundtrack we have coming from next door's party?

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Yes.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Someday I'll be invited to the party.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,240
So here's the deal, which by the way, we can't see Loki a little bit when you lean too far

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
forward.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
We don't need to see me.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
It's fine.

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
You saw me last week.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Most of the time.

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm just working on shit.

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
So here's the deal.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
And I hope it's not picking up on the mics.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,040
I don't think it is because the mics gain, and you see this on Twitch, we have to get

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
really close to the mics.

68
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,880
So I don't think the music, but let me tell you, if you were sitting in this room, you

69
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,800
could pretty much hear the song like it was playing softly on the TV or something.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Our neighbors are having some type of raging party next door.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
I don't know what there is to celebrate.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
I don't know if it's like Game of Thrones or Avengers Endgame.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Everybody's dying.

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Whoa.

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,480
I think it's probably just like, maybe it's a, maybe it's early Cinco de Mayo, but like

76
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
I literally, okay.

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,080
So I literally like right at the end of Bobby's show there, right before he called us, I actually

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,120
had to send Bobby a message that says, don't call me yet because I need to go next door.

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
We have like an urgent situation.

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Cause it was even worse.

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,320
Like it was louder a minute ago.

82
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,520
And like, I knew I like, like, I'm like Jamie's closest to the window.

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
It's going to drive her bonkers.

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,720
I can't hear the music down, especially since I've been fighting off a headache all day.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,760
So I was like, all right, I'm just going to go over.

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,760
So I went over there and like the, the fence was wide open.

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,360
So I just walked right back there, invited myself to their party.

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,200
And it was just like, hi, I'm the neighbor.

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,320
We're trying to do some recording, you know, and I asked nicely and they did, I mean, it's

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,000
still loud, but they definitely turned it down from where it was at, but yeah, good.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,520
I'm glad you guys in chat.

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Can't hear it.

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,160
And of course we don't want to hear this shit.

94
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I know.

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
It's just boom.

96
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Anyway.

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Of course we do tape live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network at six o'clock Pacific,

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,440
nine o'clock Eastern every week, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,560
And we're, he's always kind enough to have us on at the very end of the show, even when

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,040
I have to tell him, Hey, hold on a minute.

101
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,600
I have to go be that crazy old man that yells at the neighbors to get to turn down that

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
racket.

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
So they're on the roof.

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I mean, are they up on the roof?

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
They were on the roof.

106
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Yeah.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Is that where they smoked their marijuana?

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
No, they were dancing.

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Because you know, because you know, it's a party and we're crazy.

110
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,240
I hope they die.

111
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
You know?

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
No, don't.

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
We don't.

114
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't.

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I don't need a scene over at the neighbor's house.

116
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
You don't need a scene.

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Yeah.

118
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Girl.

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
I can make a scene.

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Anyway, you are making a scene over there.

121
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
What do you need to tell the Twitch?

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,080
And I apologize to the podcast folks, cause you can't see all this vibrant color and like

123
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,280
tissue paper and cards and all these things that, so you are, you're not wrapping your

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
own gifts.

125
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
No, no, no.

126
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,200
So, and y'all need to sign the card for mama, but, um, I will on a break, not while we're

127
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
trying to do a show.

128
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,800
It's Charlotte's birthday as in the Mel's little girl.

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
She's going to be one.

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
So of course she won't remember any of this shit, but I got her a little cute toy and

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,560
some sensory goods and um, I got stuff for mom too cause mama could probably use some

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
chocolate.

133
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes.

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Oh, that's very kind of you.

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,840
She, she works really hard and really, I usually say like the first birthdays are really more

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,520
for mama and daddy than the baby because the baby is going to go, Ooh, I can smash

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
this.

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
And then that's it.

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,840
I think, I think she had mentioned something too about not to like spoil everything at

140
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
this upcoming party.

141
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Sorry.

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Sorry if you're listening.

143
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Um, but I think she mentioned that the baby was getting their own cake.

144
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,000
I think this is the thing they do.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,480
Like you get a cake, just a little like, it's like the, the one slice you might buy at the

146
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,120
supermarket and that's specifically for the baby to smash while everybody else eats the

147
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
real cake.

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Well, right.

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,080
Usually it's, uh, I think we've done like a cupcake or like a smaller cake, but yeah,

150
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,540
cause they're babies and they have no motor control and they're going to smash it into

151
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
their face.

152
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Sure.

153
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,680
So it's, it's just like, Oh, like how gross he is or she is to show them when they're

154
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
18 and put in the high school yearbook.

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Yeah, sure.

156
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
That's still a thing people do.

157
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Right.

158
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
I don't know.

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Is that a, my show my age again?

160
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
You never did that in my yearbook.

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Really?

162
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
No, they did it in our yearbook and no one gave a shit.

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,000
My mom always threatened to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,920
She always, she always said, I'm going to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook if

165
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,080
you don't behave because I guess they, you know, cause this is this, I mean now it sounds

166
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,320
like kind of, but in the seventies, this is what people did.

167
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Uh, when I was like a year old, I was running around the backyard completely buck ass naked

168
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,820
and somebody decided to take a picture of me with just a little fig leaf holding up.

169
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,120
So um, yeah, so luckily that picture did not get put in the yearbook cause you know, Travis

170
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,720
Donovan would have put it all over the air when he had a show.

171
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,480
Uh, so that picture, um, is probably still at my parents' place and uh, if I have anything

172
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
to say about it, we'll be burned.

173
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,920
But I was like, I was a year old, come on.

174
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,720
So uh, they, they picked a different picture instead.

175
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,400
Probably something, I think me on the computer at five years old and there's a picture of

176
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,520
me at five years old sitting next to the Commodore 64 being such a nerd.

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,640
I just have the, just the default senior picture that we had to take next, leaning against

178
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
the tree, you know?

179
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Oh yeah.

180
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
We didn't have anything like that.

181
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,800
They put us in these like half dress things from the waist up and the men in like, like

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,080
suit bibs and took our picture with that and it was just in front of like some stupid nineties

183
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
background screen.

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
But I was like, I don't care cause it's black.

185
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
It was goth.

186
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
That's all you needed.

187
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
All right.

188
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Anyway, uh, we are of course a show that talks about video game.

189
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Believe it or not.

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
I mean it's a long show though.

191
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,160
So sometimes we get into our personal lives too.

192
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,880
Uh, we talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

193
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
So let's get into some video game talk.

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,640
And besides my senior year, I was working on yearbook staff, so none of that shit would

195
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
have slid by.

196
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Well okay.

197
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,680
My senior year, a video game that came out that, uh, everybody was talking about was

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Mortal Kombat on the Super Nintendo.

199
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,640
And that's when they replaced all the blood with sweat, right?

200
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,600
So here we are so many years later where that would have been like 96 and now here we are,

201
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,880
maybe that was even like 95 might've been before my senior year.

202
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,160
But here we are all these years later now in 2019 and we are now on the, if you can

203
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,720
believe it, 11th Mortal Kombat game came out this week, Mortal Kombat 11.

204
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,240
I watched the whole, uh, story mode.

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Yeah.

206
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,720
I think a lot of people have been, uh, kind of playing that on Twitch, the story mode.

207
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,920
I know, I know Alan's kind of been watching the story mode as well, which, um, that must

208
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,240
be a thing that developers don't like so much.

209
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,080
So I was just like, thank you.

210
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,200
I kind of dug how they did it because the rest of this was like, what the hell were

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,000
you thinking in all the previous Mortal Kombat, at least what were you thinking?

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
So I'm pleased with this one.

213
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,560
The last Mortal Kombat game I really played was nine or the, the reboot, if you will,

214
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
that they just called Mortal Kombat.

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,080
Um, and I liked how they kind of redid the story and you went through the first three

216
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,160
games again, but it was with a, with a twist and, um, yeah, well the game is how old at

217
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
this point, I'm not going to be spoiling anything.

218
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,320
Uh, basically Raiden has a vision and so it kind of goes back and small corrections happen

219
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,620
that caused this, like, you know, that butterfly effect sequence of events that change things.

220
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,580
We turned the blood, the sweat, and then it just went right from there.

221
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,900
So anyway, uh, and I, those of you guys have been listening to orange on studio for a while.

222
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,320
No, like this last, like I played Mortal Kombat nine and I was like, okay, this is fun.

223
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,740
It's a little nasty, but whatever.

224
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,820
And then around the time of this last, this Mortal Kombat X, which the 10th game and they

225
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
called it X, uh, even though I know that's one of Jamie's pet peeves, but no, because

226
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,700
when people talk about an iPhone X, it's an iPhone 10 in marketing, right?

227
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
Or Final Fantasy 10.

228
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,220
But in, but in the case of nether realm, they said, we know it's Mortal Kombat 10, but we're

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,580
calling it Mortal Kombat X.

230
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,100
So they like specifically said, this is the name.

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,380
So, um, that was the game when I started to see the fatality of it.

232
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,920
So I was like, all right, look, this is a bit much.

233
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,420
So I kind of, I ended up just kind of when you turned into your mom, I also just kind

234
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,880
of just ended up passing on the game.

235
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I didn't.

236
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,940
So the 11th game came out and you know, Alan really loves this stuff and he'll show me

237
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
the YouTube.

238
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,940
He'll make me watch the YouTube and I'll watch it.

239
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,340
I saw the one just today where the dude kicks somebody into a big sand pile and then like

240
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,860
rips off the whole front of the it's gross.

241
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
It's so disgusting.

242
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
But here's the thing.

243
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,740
I actually kind of thought about it.

244
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Okay.

245
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,180
I actually considered buying Mortal Kombat 11.

246
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
I really did.

247
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,040
Even though I'm, I'm kind of like, I think I might be over it.

248
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,480
I still like it as a fighting game, which is why I really like injustice and injustice

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,400
too, because that is basically Mortal Kombat, but without all of that.

250
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Right.

251
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,160
And it's, you know, it's Batman and all the, all his friends.

252
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
So, you know, it's a little bit different.

253
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,560
So I like the injustice games quite a bit actually.

254
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,980
But I thought about getting Mortal Kombat 11 because I was like, you know what?

255
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,960
I don't have to do the fatalities.

256
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,560
And even if I see one online, whatever, like it's, I think we blow it out of proportion

257
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,540
a little bit on this show, how sensitive I really am to that stuff.

258
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,700
It's not like I can't like just roll my eyes or, you know, look away if it's that nasty.

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,020
It's like, whatever.

260
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,340
But I got to tell you in hearing some of this stuff about Mortal Kombat 11, I, I, I had

261
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
pause.

262
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,540
I didn't end up wanting to drop $60 on this game.

263
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,940
After all, I kind of ended up having pause with that.

264
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,780
And part of that is this controversy going on with the grinding and the difficulty of

265
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Mortal Kombat 11.

266
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,100
Uh, I don't know if you're up on this as well, Loki, or what you've heard about this dark

267
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,180
Sakura because you said you were interested in this game to dark soccer, right?

268
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,940
Well, because as to my favorite lady voice actors in it, well, I know it ain't Ronda

269
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Rousey.

270
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
No.

271
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Oh, that she wasn't bad as Sonia.

272
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Really?

273
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,260
You're the first person I've heard say anything remotely kind about her performance, but Jennifer

274
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
Hale is Kronica.

275
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Okay.

276
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Well, okay.

277
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,460
And Cetrion is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

278
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Really?

279
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Yep.

280
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Oh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

281
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,020
Can't you just tell it from hearing her because she uses the same very sultry singing.

282
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
I didn't watch the story mode.

283
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,780
Like she, she talks like she does in the songs in silent Hill.

284
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Interesting.

285
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,780
Well, that's pretty cool.

286
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Yeah.

287
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Three and four.

288
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
Sorry.

289
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
I should have said, so here's the thing.

290
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,820
Most everybody is like, you know, it's a good game.

291
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
It's Mortal Kombat.

292
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
It's a good fighter.

293
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Yes.

294
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,500
It's gross and over the top, but if you're playing Mortal Kombat, what all do you expect

295
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
now?

296
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Whole thing.

297
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Right.

298
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,220
And I'm not talking about, there was, there was a review controversy that came up on discord

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,940
about how one particular, um, reviewer said, uh, the fatalities were too much.

300
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,100
But I, and then he went, the, the reviewer actually went back and corrected it to say

301
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,360
the fatal blows because I think they were actually talking about that mechanic that

302
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,620
replaced the x-ray attacks from the last game I played.

303
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Yeah.

304
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Yeah.

305
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,440
And I was like, all right, well like in that context, I think the dude, but like of course

306
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,340
everybody on Twitter is like, if you can't handle fatalities, what are you doing playing

307
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,840
Mortal Kombat?

308
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,620
And honestly, I got to say this.

309
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,340
I think one of the reasons even I got burned out on the fatalities, like when I enjoyed

310
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,360
fatalities and they made me laugh, like Mortal Kombat two, they were very cartoony.

311
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,460
They were very stupid and they were very fast.

312
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,460
That was the thing, right?

313
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,900
Like uppercut fall in the pool of acid skeleton comes up, set up, execution done, right?

314
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
It was fast.

315
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
It was done.

316
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,060
And now in like Mortal Kombat 11, these, these fatalities, they're drawn out.

317
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,060
They're excessive.

318
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
It is.

319
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
It isn't open.

320
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
What is this?

321
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
Knights of the round?

322
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
It is.

323
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
It's Knights of the round of death.

324
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
It is immortal combat.

325
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,900
And I got to say, like, I kind of had that epiphany this week.

326
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,940
I'm like, I think that may actually be a part of the problem I'm having with the fatalities

327
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,820
is it's just so fucking drawn out and you know, it's this big thing.

328
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,420
So when I initially read the review and even I was reading it in the context of like fatalities

329
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
are too much.

330
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm like, actually, if you think about it, that maybe the fatalities are just too fucking

331
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,760
long and just like, like, just maybe we've hit that line of like, it just wrap it up

332
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
already type of thing.

333
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,060
Like I can actually, I think the reviewer is free to make a point.

334
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,900
It's not like they take the game out of it or said like seven out of 10, too much water.

335
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,540
I think they ended up giving it a four out of five at the end of the day.

336
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,100
So you know, whatever anyway, but here's, and here's the real problem.

337
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,520
Why reviewers are deducting a star.

338
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
This is the real problem.

339
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,480
And the thing I think is worth talking about fatality thing, whatever y'all are going to

340
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,400
have opinions on that, we're all going to have to agree to disagree on how I feel about

341
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
the violence and all that stuff.

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,840
But it's this thing about the towers of combat in Mortal Kombat and the currency that you

343
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,080
get from these towers of combat that allow you to go to the crypt.

344
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
And the crypt was in previous Mortal Kombat games.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,880
Like I remember a Mortal Kombat game I had on GameCube, I don't know if it was Deception

346
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
or Deadly Alliance.

347
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,400
And you go into the krypt and you can unlock, but you could go on the internet and look

348
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,600
at the FAQ and it would tell you exactly what's in every gravestone in the crypt.

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,960
So you would just go get what you want.

350
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,760
And that's that you can't do that in Mortal Kombat 11 because they've randomized everybody's

351
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,040
prey and some of the currency that you use.

352
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,760
You get, you know, you get from playing the game, which you have to play a lot of the

353
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,640
game and you get it in these, these time towers basically, and they're rotating challenges,

354
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,080
but it sounds like a lot of the challenges, and again, I'm going to fully admit I haven't

355
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
played the game.

356
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm only going off of what I read on the internet.

357
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,880
And I want you guys to chime in, especially if you have played, is it sounds like a lot

358
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,480
of these challenges are bullshit, like, you know, projectiles getting put, like things

359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,480
that kind of cancel each other out and don't make sense.

360
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
And it's really hard.

361
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,860
And so it's kind of nudging you to buy the currency to go in the crypt.

362
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,160
And then it's like, you got to spend a ton of money to do this when it's a little bit

363
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,720
shady on when you consider the fact that you've already dropped 60, 70, maybe a hundred dollars

364
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,080
if you bought the version already has the DLC on this game in the first place, it's

365
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,440
like, it just wants more money from you.

366
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Right.

367
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,760
And now when I, Alan and I were discussing this earlier this week and he said, well,

368
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,080
I mean, how's that different from Overwatch?

369
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,140
Nothing you're getting in the crypt is, you know, anything but cosmetic.

370
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,760
And it's just like loot boxes and Overwatch.

371
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Right.

372
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,800
And I'm kind of like, whatever, whatever.

373
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,260
But I mean, it's, it still feels like it's almost like the difficulty of it has left

374
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,300
it to be a little bit exploitative almost now, to be fair.

375
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,380
And I'm sure, and I, I'm not even looking at chat just yet.

376
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,460
I need to bring that up because I'm sure some of you have comments to be fair.

377
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,260
And nether realm has come out this week and mentioned, we hear the feedback.

378
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,660
We know it's too difficult and they are starting to put out some patches that are a going to

379
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,760
tone down the difficulty of this a little bit.

380
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,500
And B I think it's going to reward players that already have the game with some like

381
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,940
currency, just like free currency as a, you know, thank you for putting up with this bullshit

382
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
type of thing.

383
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,940
You know, a Goodwill gesture, but it's not going to be enough currency to buy everything,

384
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,700
but it'll be enough to kind of like get a taste.

385
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,100
So they're, they're kind of trying to balance that, but you know, I'm pretty sure these

386
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,980
games are pretty extensively tested and so forth.

387
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,740
You've got to think they didn't know that some of this was way too hard going into it.

388
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Like are the testers just too good at the game?

389
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,940
It's weird that they didn't figure that out before the game hit the market.

390
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,940
What's up with that?

391
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Any of you guys have thoughts on that?

392
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Oh, they knew.

393
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
They knew.

394
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,940
Well, first basically it's to push it as far as they can and it's, it's based on backlash

395
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,640
really cause they can adjust that stuff on the flyer, make adjustments to it to kind

396
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,820
of balance out the grind versus whatever, but in the end it's to basically, I'm assuming

397
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,140
they sell the currency as well.

398
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,740
You can grind for it or you can buy it.

399
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,660
And so the whole point is to make it inconvenient so you want to buy it.

400
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Okay.

401
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,780
And I need to, I need to correct something that in the way I explained it, thank you

402
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
chat.

403
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,240
And again, I said from the beginning, I haven't played the game and these are some of my reservations

404
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
about it.

405
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
This whole Crip thing.

406
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,620
So I'm being corrected that the currency isn't to unlock things in the crypt.

407
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,340
So a fifth dream today says you can't buy the currency.

408
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,940
It's not possible.

409
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,020
And a shad stars X and chat saying, yeah, currency is impossible to buy.

410
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,500
Fifth dream says you buy the crystals to pay for a random selection of cosmetics.

411
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,480
So you're not using the currency that you buy to open the stuff in the crypt.

412
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,480
You use it to buy, essentially, it sounds like a loot box.

413
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,400
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I, even though you guys are getting me on a technicality,

414
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,240
I mean, come on, they're still encouraging you to use currency to get stuff, right?

415
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,200
And you see all these articles about, Oh, if you want to buy stuff, it's thousands of

416
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,640
dollars to get all the other DLC characters too.

417
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
So that's going to be a thing that's coming as well.

418
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm sure this had a season pass.

419
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
So there's, there's a lot of nickel and diamond going on here.

420
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,720
That's just, it's, that's gaming nowadays.

421
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,000
And ultimately, you know what, now we're back with where I was at with mortal combat X because

422
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,960
all my drama about fatalities and that aside, I almost wanted to pick up mortal combat X.

423
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,200
I ultimately didn't do it cause Alan got it.

424
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,800
So I didn't have to, um, but I almost picked it up, but I was like, you know what, I'm

425
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,600
going to wait for the inevitable end of the year edition or, or year gold year edition,

426
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
right?

427
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Game of the year, the year that's it.

428
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,260
You cause you know, and it's the same thing will happen here too come.

429
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,240
And especially with it releasing kind of early this year, come November, they're going to

430
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,760
put out a version that has all the DLC already included some of this cosmetic currency stuff

431
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
and the base game.

432
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,920
And that will cost maybe 50, 40 who knows, who knows?

433
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Sales.

434
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Absolutely.

435
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,820
It'll be like half off probably in a few months.

436
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,280
So I just, I don't feel the need to buy it now.

437
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,420
And it's kind of, and I'm going to, I'm just putting it out there just because I feel it's

438
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,680
worth saying if I hadn't heard about all this nickel and diming stuff, you know, DLC characters

439
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,400
is one thing, but all this, I probably, I probably would have done it, but now I'm pausing

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
a little bit.

441
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,160
Now I'm pausing to say like, maybe I'm going to wait until I get a little more bang for

442
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,200
my buck for that 60 bucks.

443
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Yeah.

444
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Thoughts.

445
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I mean, where, where's your head out with Mortal Kombat?

446
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Loki.

447
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,280
I don't know if I'm not interested in it at all.

448
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,760
So it makes no difference to me what it costs.

449
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
So I don't want to play it.

450
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,440
I, I'll be honest.

451
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,360
I don't really have the, the hand strength to play a fighting game well anymore.

452
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,720
Um, so for me, I I've gotten everything I want to see watching on YouTube, you know,

453
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,800
if they did like, here's the movie version of it.

454
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,880
That's a whole nother thing though, is about now it's, it's interesting because I feel

455
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,640
like Mortal Kombat, I've heard more than any other game recently about how people are kind

456
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,760
of just playing it on YouTube essentially, which to be fair, kind of lends credit to

457
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,880
maybe why Netherrealm feels they've got to really milk the people playing it for a little

458
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,280
extra cash here and there is because they're losing money on people just kind of watching

459
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
the story.

460
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,120
I don't think you're doing anything wrong, but it's just a reality of gaming in 2019.

461
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,600
And how do we make a game that makes money anyway?

462
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Somebody buy me time because I want to, because the chat is saying, okay, go ahead.

463
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Yeah.

464
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,000
But I'll be perfectly honest.

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,360
Um, I, I don't necessarily see it that way because really most of the people who are

466
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,400
going to be interested in playing it are putting out the money there and are buying the DLC.

467
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,080
You know, it's like the same model where you have, um, in fact, we were talking about

468
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,200
this at work just the other day where, you know, you've got all these free to play games

469
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,440
and you know, you have 80% of the people out there who are not buying, you know, extra

470
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,400
points or extra time or anything.

471
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,440
And then you have the rabid 20% that are putting out all the money.

472
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,280
And so they, they should take into account their in their price point, the portion that

473
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
is going to pay for it.

474
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,160
You know, you are going to have freeloaders like me, and then you're going to have people

475
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,880
who are just base game and then you're going to have the people who are going to put out

476
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,760
the money because they're enthusiasts.

477
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Okay.

478
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Let me make sure I represent this correctly.

479
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,400
So I'm just going to read, I don't usually do this, I'm going to read word for word from

480
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
this article.

481
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,080
So I'm going to give credit to VG247.com.

482
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Thank you.

483
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
I'm, but I just, I want to make sure we get it right.

485
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Okay.

486
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
So here it is.

487
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,960
So, uh, it will cost you plenty if you want to acquire every skin available in the game.

488
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,960
There are 23 characters presently in each offer 60 different skins.

489
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,360
According to someone who did the math over on Reddit, a poster crunched some numbers

490
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,640
and according to the math, it will apparently cost you $6,440 in real money to buy every

491
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,800
skin currently available.

492
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,760
Four of the skins can be unlocked by playing through the character tutorials, story and

493
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,280
basic towers that leaves 56 skins to unlock skins are unlocked just by playing the game

494
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,280
or they can seemingly be purchased using in game currency called time crystals.

495
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,880
Time crystals can also be earned through gameplay, but seem to amass slowly.

496
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,400
If you are the impatient sort or just really want a particular skin, you can purchase 500

497
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,640
time crystals through the in game store for $5, which is what each skin runs on average,

498
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,600
but you still may not get the skin you want as they appear on a rotational basis.

499
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,480
Every six to eight hours, a new set of five skins will become available on the store supposedly

500
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
wants to leave.

501
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,800
Once they leave the store, well prepare yourself for a grind fest.

502
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,960
He goes on, the poster went on to say that he earned 760 time crystals after playing

503
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,440
the game four hours.

504
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,000
If you wanted to unlock every game skin through gameplay alone, it would take 3,390 hours

505
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,720
of play time and cost 644,000 time crystals.

506
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,100
So I don't think I misrepresented that because I said you can either play the game and amass

507
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,440
things slowly or they're tempting you with this pay to unlock it right away, right?

508
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,200
And this is not something exactly unique to Mortal Kombat 11 either, right?

509
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,600
We've seen this in other games as well.

510
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Yes, we have.

511
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,760
And it's the whole fear of missing out.

512
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,880
So they, that's why it's on a limited time basis and they rotate amounts because it's

513
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,200
like, Oh my God, that's what I want.

514
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
And I got to get it right away.

515
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,880
Ah, ah, well, I guess I better buy some stuff to unlock the thing that changes something

516
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
slightly.

517
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Okay.

518
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,720
So they are okay.

519
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,600
So chatters are jumping in like Renji to do want to say, you can't buy all the costumes,

520
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
right?

521
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Because the rotational thing.

522
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,120
So you would, you know, you'd have to be patient and you have to, what?

523
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,960
So can you not grind it out in the crypt then?

524
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
That was the impression I was getting is that the other way to get the costumes is just

525
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
get them in the crypt randomly.

526
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,760
I thought that was apparently it's been already being patched out or well, right.

527
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
And I said that at the very beginning, they're already addressing some of this with a patch.

528
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,460
But my big question was, how did they not figure out that some of these grindy things

529
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,700
were a bit too much in some of the early testing that they did?

530
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,480
You know what, it kind of makes you go, are they, do they really, or are they just doing

531
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,260
it because there's enough bitching on the internet that you have people like me that

532
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,700
are sitting there going, I was going to buy it.

533
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,580
But when I heard about how grindy it was, I thought maybe not because it's the people

534
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,160
are testing the game, aren't paying real money to unlock the stuff.

535
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,460
So they're just testing the functionality of it, not whether, you know, it's annoying

536
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,960
as crap.

537
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,260
And also this also begs the question with you guys having to kind of explain it and

538
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
read the article.

539
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,740
Why is this so fucking complicated in the first place?

540
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,080
Like it's complicated to make people not want to think about it.

541
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,440
So Oh, so that people don't think about the distraction it's, I mean, a lot of these things

542
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:33,580
are set up in this particular, like almost like a psychological manipulation where they

543
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,260
know that a customer isn't going to stop and do the math.

544
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,100
And the average customer will not stop and do the math on all of these things.

545
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,000
They won't sit and look at the probability.

546
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,380
And at the end of the day, they're like, Oh, I can give it a chance.

547
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,360
It's like playing a lottery, right?

548
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Really it is.

549
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,920
Well, you know, and it's interesting addicted to the gambling because you know, what I think

550
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,460
of is I think of the Microsoft points and yes, I realized they've retired the points.

551
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,160
They did that several years ago, but y'all know when the Xbox three 60 first came out,

552
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,240
you bought Microsoft points and it wasn't one point was one penny.

553
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,200
And it was almost the exact way you phrased it.

554
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,700
You bought, I think it was, did you get less fuck, what was it like 400 points for $5 or

555
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
something like that.

556
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Right?

557
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,580
So it was, yeah, 400 points for $5.

558
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,900
So you, so you, you would buy things for 400 points and maybe that your brain would think

559
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,620
that was about $4, but it really was $5.

560
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,660
Most people aren't thinking through the math again.

561
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,700
Microsoft has changed that, but I mean, it does go to show our industry has kind of been

562
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
here before a little bit.

563
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:41,440
It's a little deceptive, but at the same time, it's, I reckon to them the financial deception,

564
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,680
you know, it's not like a blatant deception, but, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking

565
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:55,000
of a misleading, a little bit of misleading, you know, it's there.

566
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,640
If you want to stop and look at it, it, it, if you give it a first glance and you're thinking

567
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,140
with that common sense, 400 to five.

568
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:08,500
So I'm actually paying, you know, um, like a dollar, a dollar 10 or a dollar, you know,

569
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,420
whatever per, per point or, you know, per a hundred point or whatever it is.

570
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,820
Um, then logically it's there in front of you.

571
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,420
They haven't hidden a thing and just using that particular example, but when you are

572
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:29,360
going to then use the points in the store, it's not giving you that point of comparison.

573
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,460
It's not putting a dollar figure on it.

574
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,140
You are using the points at that point that you have already paid for.

575
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,780
What you paid for them is inconsequential for how you're spending the points.

576
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,620
And that's where the misleading comes in.

577
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:47,100
I don't want to call it a blatant deception cause it's not a blatant mortal combat deception.

578
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,700
Keep that up.

579
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,820
We'll have a mortal combat annihilation, total random tangent aside.

580
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,500
I was trying to let you, the chat room saw me trying to get Louise.

581
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Is it just me?

582
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,200
The music over there just suddenly like drop off very much, very much has dropped off.

583
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,240
I wonder if there's, see if you can see flashing blue and red lights to the window or if somebody

584
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
else went over there.

585
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Finally, I'll, I'll go take a look, go see if I'm going to look, go see the cops are

586
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
here.

587
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,440
Let me bring my tea with me so I can sip it in your yard.

588
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
You don't, don't make it obvious.

589
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Don't just peek through the window.

590
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,400
Be that, be that, be that old lady peering through the windows.

591
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,060
Let's go see if they're on the roof.

592
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,720
Maybe someone finally died.

593
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,220
No, cause I can hear the music going a little bit.

594
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,180
It's just like way down from what it was.

595
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,380
Anyway, I can't believe she went outside.

596
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,380
Anyway.

597
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,780
Um, some other comments from chat, uh, Chad stars it, who I know has been playing mortal

598
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,700
combat 11 and would probably be excited to hear if I actually finally got in and played

599
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,260
it, uh, said it's all artificial time barriers to make you sink way too much time into this,

600
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,900
which is where I see most people get mad about this game.

601
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,860
Plus the difficulty in the towers and the randomness of the crypt.

602
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,420
And fifth dream today says, what's the verdict?

603
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,840
I didn't see any lights, but I did see people start to walk out.

604
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Oh, so maybe parties already may just be over.

605
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,840
Maybe they're done with their day drinking.

606
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
All right.

607
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,440
Well, game of thrones is on, I guess maybe for some, who knows?

608
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,400
I hear the not that you should change the channel.

609
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,960
You can DVR it or use HBO.

610
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Go.

611
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
I can hear the music.

612
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah, it's, it's still there.

613
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
It's just like way down.

614
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Anyway.

615
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
All right.

616
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Shut up about the neighbors.

617
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
No one can hear it.

618
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I know.

619
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
I know.

620
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
But it's just, you guys, you guys don't understand if you were here in the studio, it'd be driving

621
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
you bonkers.

622
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
All right.

623
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,540
Fifth dream today says I view microtransactions like impulse purchases at the store, grab

624
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,340
a candy bar, a magazine, get fries with that.

625
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
How often a week?

626
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,620
Well, $5 now.

627
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,660
And then it's the same thing.

628
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,900
Very interesting.

629
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Very interesting.

630
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Anyway, now something else to note about this whole ordeal.

631
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,260
One other thing I want to talk about when mortal combat is that, you know, modders are

632
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,980
going to mod, right?

633
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,940
Hackers going to hack modders going to mod.

634
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
This is a little bit of both.

635
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,460
I don't know if you would call this a hack or a mod.

636
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,080
I guess technically it's a mod.

637
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,440
But anyway, there are characters that appear in Mortal Kombat 11 story, Cyrax and Sektor.

638
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,480
I know those names from Mortal Kombat 3 way back in the day, right?

639
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
The robot ninjas, right?

640
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,280
So apparently they show up in the story, but they are not actually playable as part of

641
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,280
the roster, which Mortal Kombat's done this before.

642
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,040
I remember Mortal Kombat 9 had Rain, and Rain is awesome, but Rain was in the story, but

643
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,200
you couldn't play Rain as a selectable character.

644
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,060
I'm sure somebody on the PC back then made it able to play Rain on the PC.

645
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,700
Sure enough, what's happened now?

646
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,340
Somebody has enabled it so that you can play Cyrax and Sektor on the PC with their new

647
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,240
character models, all the moves and all that stuff.

648
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,220
This also goes for the boss character, the boss character of course, Kronika in the game.

649
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,660
You can actually play as Kronika thanks to this mod as well.

650
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,380
Although for Mortal Kombat to not allow you to play the boss characters is not as unusual.

651
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,360
That goes all the way back to Goro in the first game.

652
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,680
They just don't want you to play something that's going to be completely unbalanced.

653
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,520
It sounds like Kronika, that might be a little bit of the issue there as well, but surprise,

654
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,160
surprise, that the PC players have already managed to move the boss.

655
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,520
So do they have all their moves, or is it just kind of mimicking other...

656
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
No, they have the...

657
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,080
Because in the story they do these moves.

658
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,680
So the yellow ninja does the bombs that throw...

659
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,160
Sorry, I can't remember the difference, but throws out the bombs, right?

660
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,940
I think Cyrax has the bombs and Sektor has the missiles.

661
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,820
So they have those types of moves.

662
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,580
And they don't look like pallet swaps either.

663
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,700
At least when I looked at it, they did look different.

664
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,420
So yeah, it's interesting.

665
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,740
And people are wondering if it's, oh, is it DLC?

666
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,260
But apparently the DLC list is leaked and I do not believe these guys are on the DLC

667
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,400
list.

668
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,180
So just like in Mortal Kombat 9 with Reign, it appears that there are no plans to make

669
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,180
these characters playable.

670
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,520
That's clearly true because they could have them on the list as like characters.

671
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,360
Like if there's a list of all the characters in the game and they may not suspect that

672
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,240
they're DLC because they're technically in the game as story characters, it doesn't mean

673
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,800
that they can't have them as also DLC playable characters.

674
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,960
So maybe?

675
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,800
I guess we'll see.

676
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,840
Some folks in chat are chiming in as well about a reptile in Mortal Kombat 1 being a

677
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,680
very hidden thing that you could fight, but you couldn't really play as.

678
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,060
Although wasn't there a thing, wasn't there like a code or something you did on Super

679
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
Nintendo?

680
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,060
It was a Game Genie.

681
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,060
That's probably a Game Genie code.

682
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,740
Yeah, where like you could play as reptile, but you had to really jump through hoops.

683
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,800
And all reptile was in the Mortal Kombat 1, all reptile was was Sub-Zero and Scorpion

684
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,340
stuff at the same time.

685
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,540
That's all reptile was.

686
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,700
Reptile didn't get the stuff like the ball that makes, you know, the acid spit and all

687
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
that stuff.

688
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,460
That didn't come to Mortal Kombat 2 when they made reptile his own character.

689
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,280
So believe it or not, guys, I used to the old school Mortal Kombat games.

690
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,840
I used to love those games.

691
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,200
I loved like Mortal Kombat 2, especially Katana, Molina.

692
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
You know it.

693
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I played that.

694
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I still remember this day.

695
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Katana.

696
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Finish him.

697
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,080
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick, easiest fatality

698
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
in the world.

699
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,700
Just slam the block button, high kick.

700
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,320
That's the fan chopping off the head.

701
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,040
But it's it's two seconds and then it's over.

702
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,920
And it's cartoony and stupid.

703
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,580
And yeah, Fifth Dream says there's always seasons two and three or excuse me, there's

704
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
always seasons two.

705
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,100
And he makes that bunny face.

706
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,900
But that comment very well could be seasons two and three.

707
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,640
Shad Starsick says, I'll take a season two if I get characters I want.

708
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,100
So Tiger Claw also with a random aside here, but I think this is is a worthy note.

709
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,640
Tiger Claw mentioning that Arcade One Up has, you know, they're doing all those stand ups

710
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,580
that kind of look like a Mortal Kombat one.

711
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Well, they're there.

712
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,360
They just announced recently they're doing a Mortal Kombat one.

713
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,980
They're going to do a Mortal Kombat one, two and three all in one cabinet.

714
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,320
And y'all ready for a twist?

715
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,440
That's the one I kind of want, like really bad.

716
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
Like I think having a Mortal Kombat one, two and three little mini cab, I think that would

717
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
be fun.

718
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Mortal Kombat two is the best, though.

719
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
No, it really is.

720
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It's my favorite.

721
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
I do have a soft spot for Mortal Kombat three.

722
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Mortal Kombat one I don't think is very fun to play anymore, just because I think it got

723
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,480
superseded by the later game.

724
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Slow.

725
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,960
Yeah, it's kind of it's kind of clunky.

726
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,420
But it's like, all right, we respect it for what it is.

727
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,620
We tip our hat, you know, but then it's like, OK, Mortal Kombat two is like superior in

728
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
every way with the characters.

729
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,460
Yeah, in every way.

730
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
So anyway.

731
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Yeah.

732
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,540
And Tiger Claw says the Mortal Kombat three is ultimate Mortal Kombat.

733
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,740
And that game was just fun because of all the freakin characters.

734
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,780
There were so many characters in that game.

735
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,580
So it's interesting now that, you know, Mortal Kombat style back a little bit.

736
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,080
What if they did a Mortal Kombat tag?

737
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Like tag tournament?

738
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Kind of.

739
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah.

740
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Or like a tag team?

741
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Yeah.

742
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
Wasn't that a mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat?

743
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,920
I don't remember because I didn't really play too much of Ultimate.

744
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,960
I thought there was a 2v2 in one of those Mortal Kombat three clones.

745
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Maybe it was a home version only or something like that.

746
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,680
Maybe somebody in chat knows what I'm talking about.

747
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,800
But I really feel like the tag team thing was in one of the games.

748
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,280
It might have been a Mortal Kombat cross Tekken.

749
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,480
Well, they they for it to for what it's worth, Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe was

750
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
the thing.

751
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
It was kind of their response.

752
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,900
They also made injustice.

753
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Yeah.

754
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,860
Well, that's I think where injustice came from.

755
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,620
And minor spoiler alert about the DLC.

756
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,860
But I would imagine most of you have heard by now, but if you don't want a minor spoilers

757
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,780
get forward 30 seconds, apparently Joker, not persona Joker, but or Mass Effect Joker,

758
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,500
but Joker from DC is in the DLC.

759
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,140
So that's kind of interesting in a way, especially consider all the fatalities because they kind

760
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
of censored.

761
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,200
They made him brutalities in Mortal Kombat DC Universe.

762
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,080
I remember it was like Joker had the gun and he'd point the gun at the head, but the camera

763
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,480
zoomed just enough so that it was out of range by the time he pulled the trigger so he couldn't

764
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
actually see it.

765
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,540
So that was the type of stuff that Mortal Kombat DC Universe did.

766
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,680
So anyway, OK, Loco Poco says Mortal Kombat nine had two versus two.

767
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
I knew there was a game.

768
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
I played it in.

769
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Thank you, guys.

770
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,760
Sia Tabiri suggests King of Fighters and Mortal Kombat.

771
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,120
Hey, I'd be into that.

772
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Yeah.

773
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,380
So there you go.

774
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
So Mortal Kombat 11.

775
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,720
So again, I apologize that we haven't all gotten our hands on it, but I think it's it's

776
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,540
also worth discussing here.

777
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,540
You know, we all hold down day jobs.

778
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,300
This podcast is a labor of love.

779
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,580
You all know that we have to be picky and choosy about how we spend our money to like

780
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
we're not getting comped.

781
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,500
All these games from some some very sweet indie studios and so forth have done that

782
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
here and there.

783
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,860
But, you know, as far as Triple-A title goes, we don't get those for free.

784
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,460
So we have to think about how to spend our money, too.

785
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,480
And do I want to drop sixty dollars on Mortal Kombat 11?

786
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
I don't know if I want to right now.

787
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I don't know.

788
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
We'll see.

789
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
I feel like my husband will inevitably get it again.

790
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,520
And then because he gets paid in a couple of days.

791
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,320
So I bet he'll buy it and then I don't have to worry about it.

792
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,400
That's always that's always a nice, nice way to do it.

793
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
All right.

794
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,060
Anyway, let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week

795
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,780
in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about what we have, if not Mortal

796
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Kombat, then what?

797
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,400
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

798
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm playing this crap.

799
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Y'all see it?

800
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,620
No, but the podcast listeners sure can't.

801
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,980
Yeah, that's well, yeah, that's I'm playing idle pouring and playing I'm playing Ingress

802
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
again.

803
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,980
We took the work portal.

804
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,860
I still need more stuff for the anomaly.

805
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
We are.

806
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
What else am I doing?

807
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Yeah.

808
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,920
Pokemon Go.

809
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,040
I'm playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp because a super freaking one in Animal Crossing.

810
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,900
I played DDR last week.

811
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,220
I actually played Superstar and failed it because, you know, I haven't played in a long

812
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,900
time, but I did pretty OK.

813
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,020
I like some of the mid difficulty ones.

814
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,980
It was how did you just get my bearings again?

815
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
But it was fun.

816
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,300
I played a game with JD that was really fun.

817
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,020
And then I played like some piano keys game.

818
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,220
It's like a ticket spitter, but it was kind of fun, too.

819
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,420
It was like really super easy.

820
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,560
Is that what like the supersize piano keys or whatever?

821
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,720
It's like just like a single, you know, like a half octave.

822
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
It was pretty fun.

823
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah.

824
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I like that gigantic one.

825
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
They have around one that.

826
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Well, we played at Dave and Buster's.

827
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
OK.

828
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Yeah.

829
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
We also.

830
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:19,120
I didn't really play a whole lot else because it's just too busy all that week, but I'm

831
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,560
playing my phone stuff and, you know.

832
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,140
We got a Dr. Who pinball.

833
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:32,100
We we traded monopoly stir monopoly and got a Dr. Who.

834
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,840
And it turns out that one of our boards is bad.

835
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,020
So Dan is ordering anyone to put it back in.

836
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,020
I mean, it's just one board.

837
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
So it's fine.

838
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,500
It's not I think that super crazy.

839
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,640
But Dr. Who is a really good pinball with like one of my favorite multi balls.

840
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,260
And so I played the shit out of that.

841
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,180
And then, of course, more Ghostbusters, which we have Ghostbusters pinball.

842
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Yeah.

843
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,720
I think a lot of our audience is going to be jealous that Dr. Who acquisition, in fact,

844
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,200
Bobby Black Wolf is saying Dr. Who pinball is one of my is my one holy grail.

845
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,320
If I could have one table in my house, it'd be that one.

846
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,640
Then, Bobby, I will take pictures and put them up for you.

847
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,000
Our play field is immaculate.

848
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
It's been fully restored.

849
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,960
Our side art is not so great.

850
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,660
It could use some touch up.

851
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,300
But the board plays like brand new board, like it was a home use only, which I'm pretty

852
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,020
sure it wasn't home use just in some of the wear and tear on some of the ramps.

853
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,380
But the board, the play field has been fully restored.

854
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,380
It's really nice.

855
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,400
We need to go record a midpoint break at your house at some point with some pinball.

856
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Yeah.

857
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
We need like three fucking cameras for it.

858
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
We'll figure it out.

859
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Yeah.

860
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:39,240
But at any rate, that's been been my gaming weeks since I was sure it's in a boot.

861
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Loki, how about you?

862
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,800
How was your gaming week?

863
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,540
I didn't play a whole ton of things.

864
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,040
I tried out.

865
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,840
Well, first off, I finished building the last few things for the Labo VR stuff.

866
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:57,640
So I built the thing called the wind pedal and there's like a elephant thing, which

867
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,900
you can use to draw and stuff.

868
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
It's all right.

869
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,460
It hasn't worked out great.

870
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,140
It's hard to tell depth on it, but it is what it is.

871
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,320
And then the wind pedal things kind of it's all right.

872
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,940
The mini game that they have with that, it works better though with the bird though,

873
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,680
because it makes your bird go faster.

874
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,340
So that's kind of cool.

875
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,420
And I beat the bird game.

876
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
And what else?

877
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:29,300
I tried the Labo VR stuff for, um, Mario Odyssey and that was really lame.

878
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,080
So yeah, unfortunately I won't be playing much of that.

879
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,800
My son likes it, but I completely expected the Nintendo VR stuff, which I think is coming

880
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
up later.

881
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
So maybe we don't want to get in too much into it.

882
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I was completely expecting the Nintendo VR stuff was going to be more cute than it was

883
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,560
going to be like actual like depth to it.

884
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
You know what I mean?

885
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,320
Well, it's, it's just like all the other stuff.

886
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,480
I mean it more the, the Super Mario Odyssey stuff is basically you're running around with

887
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,120
a fixed camera basically.

888
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:06,060
So you have, you're just kind of like different levels and get to find three things and like

889
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,840
collect a hundred coins and you're just going around as a fixed camera.

890
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,040
So it's like sometimes Mario gets really far away from you and I don't know, there's just

891
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,480
not much to do in it and the, the 3D effect and it's just not that great.

892
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
It's okay.

893
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Um, I did pick up the finally, um, Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son's been wanting

894
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,080
that for a while now.

895
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,280
So it's such a good game.

896
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Um, I picked that up.

897
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,840
You had it on Wii U, right?

898
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
I had it on Wii U.

899
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,520
I never played it though on Wii U very much.

900
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I did.

901
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
Okay.

902
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,960
I only played like five, 10 minutes.

903
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,280
We did not go all this time without you like ever playing Breath of the Wild.

904
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,480
No, I've played Breath of the Wild, but I just haven't played it for a very long time.

905
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Got it.

906
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,520
Um, but my son likes playing that when we go to the, um, GameStop or whatever the demo

907
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
station.

908
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,560
So I'm like, Oh, we just buy the damn game and like then complete through the whole game.

909
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,040
So I finally bought it and then he doesn't want to play it.

910
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,120
So we ended up learning Julian, our Wii U so he could play through Breath of the Wild.

911
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,880
He's been too busy playing Roblox crap.

912
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,080
So you know, whatever he plays this doing all that coding stuff, right?

913
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,000
Well, no, it's because he likes the Roblox stuff.

914
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,440
So he's been playing this Five Nights at Freddy's sim thing where he, he's, he gets, uh, be

915
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,440
the animatronics or something.

916
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
I don't know.

917
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,720
He won't shut up about the goddamn game.

918
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,680
So he plays that in Raft and, uh, not Fortnite though.

919
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,000
Cause I haven't told him like, Hey, the Thanos stuff came back.

920
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,320
You know, he's like, um, you should introduce him to Pirate 101 seriously.

921
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,040
Cause Julian is still playing this game six years later.

922
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,360
So I don't know, but yeah, so that's pretty, Oh, and the Pokemon go a little bit.

923
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Sorry.

924
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
I'm ruining all your stories.

925
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
I know.

926
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,400
Um, no, I'm just going to say, I'm actually saying, Oh shit.

927
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,880
Because I'm apparently has short, but Oh Ray, all of this happens to me.

928
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
I know.

929
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Right.

930
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,920
Can you, can we, Oh, you can use my mic to finish your stuff.

931
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,160
Here you go.

932
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,480
We just need new mics.

933
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,040
Maybe that's what I should buy.

934
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:24,200
Um, so yeah, so I just played basically that stuff this week and then is it gone?

935
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Is it gone?

936
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
No.

937
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,560
Yes, it's gone.

938
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
It might be me.

939
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,640
I'm just very buzzy.

940
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
I'm electric.

941
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Yes.

942
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:54,840
Everyone's going to complain because it's me anyways, so last week I didn't touch anything.

943
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
It's back.

944
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
All right.

945
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
I guess I just have to leave the show.

946
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
We're just out of mics.

947
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
Figure it out.

948
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,600
No, but here, here take my mic.

949
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
So that's it.

950
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm pretty much done.

951
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,000
I didn't really play that much else other than that.

952
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,520
I did work on, um, some of my game, which I can talk a little bit about what I've been

953
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,840
working on and be just in specifics.

954
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:25,820
So I've been working on a health bar that mimics, um, like the Capcom fighting or not

955
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,120
fighting games, but beat them up games.

956
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:34,240
You know, the ones that like change color from, uh, I think it goes like white, purple,

957
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,780
blue, green, yellow, and then counts down.

958
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,760
So I've been working on that, but I'm not going to tell you for what and something necessarily

959
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
a beat them up.

960
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,240
There you go.

961
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,200
That's all I'm going to lose.

962
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
It's your mic.

963
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Uh, it's all the mics.

964
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,920
All right, I'm done.

965
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,080
Here you go.

966
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,640
Here's your mic.

967
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,200
I blame gremlins.

968
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,480
Someone said the Mogwai after midnight, you know, they're gremlins.

969
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,120
So you're going to have to share with me now.

970
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Loki.

971
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
All right.

972
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,480
I think we're, I think we're getting, we're do a shopping trip.

973
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,200
Yeah, it's going to have to happen.

974
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,440
Just don't let me forget this week that cause I can't, I, the first time this happened,

975
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,120
I said, you know, I'm just going to buy cause we've been using these hand-me-downs for a

976
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,120
little while now.

977
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,240
They've probably gone through their life.

978
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,960
So I keep saying, Oh, we're just going to buy a new set and then something comes up.

979
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I forget to do it.

980
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,440
So just at some point this week, remind me Thursday night when I'm off work.

981
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,800
So you and I are going shopping when you were off work, you and I are going shopping cause

982
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I'm off on Thursdays.

983
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,120
So anyway, Loki, we're going to have to try to share tonight best we can.

984
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,620
So we'll, we'll do our sharing is caring, right?

985
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,240
So anyway, or I could try it, but the problem is, see, here's the thing you say it's, well,

986
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
we did sub out.

987
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
You know what?

988
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
I could try subbing out my cable.

989
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,680
Because we did sub out your cable and we didn't need to.

990
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,600
So I should be able to pull up the cable that you have before.

991
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Yeah.

992
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Live tech issue.

993
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Rob's going to pull it out live on air.

994
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm going to try to fix my mic issue live on air.

995
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
We'll see.

996
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,440
Um, anyway, but first I want to talk about my gaming week.

997
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,080
So during my gaming week this week, I, uh, played still more final fantasy 14.

998
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,160
I have every healer at level 70.

999
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,480
I've hit everything on max level.

1000
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,040
I can't remember if that was something I did yesterday right before the show or not, but

1001
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,600
that was the thing I did this week.

1002
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,940
And then I was playing the final fantasy 15 crossover event when I finished all that.

1003
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,120
And I did the Easter event and, um, I've just been trying to up the gear level on my character

1004
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,680
because now you can get 900 tombstones in a week.

1005
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,960
So I've just been kind of grinding away.

1006
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,660
I even did PVP today, which I don't usually do, but I was just, you know, grinding for

1007
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,040
extra tombstones so I could kind of catch up on some of the last time I've been having

1008
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
on Final Fantasy 14.

1009
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,680
I am still playing Borderlands game of the year edition.

1010
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,560
Um, I got to the second area, but just to, just to show you how, like, uh, how, why it's

1011
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,040
taken me so long to get through it, I just dinged the achievement for completing every

1012
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,320
single quest in Arid Badlands, that first zone.

1013
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,480
So now I'm in the second zone because that's how I roll is I do like every single fricking,

1014
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,220
uh, thing.

1015
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,080
So there you go.

1016
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,960
By the way, speaking of MMOs, Star Trek Online is going to start happening this week and

1017
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
I might even stream it.

1018
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Oh, fun.

1019
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,280
What made you decide to get into that?

1020
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,160
Well, I've missed playing it a whole lot.

1021
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,480
Um, I just was also going back and reading on the Wiki and finding how many original

1022
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
series voice actors they've got.

1023
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,400
Well, by original series, I mean the TV series, you know, up to deep space nine and all that.

1024
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,600
And there's a lot of good deep space nine content, which is usually where my characters

1025
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
hang out.

1026
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,680
So I figure it's time to dust off the old rear Admiral and see what I can do with her.

1027
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
All right.

1028
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,560
So anyway, um, that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

1029
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,080
I'm going to hand the mic back to Loki and I'm going to try to sub out a cable here,

1030
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,640
live tech repair, but that's the joy of doing a live show.

1031
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,720
It makes for interesting TV.

1032
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,720
It is what it is.

1033
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
It interesting.

1034
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,760
She also knows to complain about watching you run around.

1035
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
All right.

1036
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,400
Well anyway, yeah, I keep like bending over.

1037
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
See my plumbers.

1038
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Everyone.

1039
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Look at Rob's butt.

1040
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
Anyway.

1041
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
No, don't.

1042
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Um, anyway.

1043
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Uh, it will.

1044
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
And the thing on top of that too is that I've been losing weight.

1045
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,920
So my pants are already like not staying on so much.

1046
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
We promise not to.

1047
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,920
I'm down five pounds.

1048
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
Where was that?

1049
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Yeah.

1050
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,920
All right.

1051
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,680
Anyway, I'm going to hand the mic to Loki and just, you have to excuse me on Twitch

1052
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,120
while I dig around like crazy trying to fix the other mic.

1053
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,040
That's okay.

1054
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
So how about some news Loki?

1055
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,880
I guess we'll talk news.

1056
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,160
So the 3DS is going away because it is, it's just inevitable.

1057
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,160
It's time.

1058
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,280
So apparently Nintendo held a briefing for their investors, which they talked about,

1059
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,320
um, that it would continue the 3DS business, but it was preparing for new software release

1060
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,920
and, uh, for 2019 and beyond.

1061
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,600
But, um, basically said that, you know, there's not really a lot in the pipeline other than

1062
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,640
a few more games for the system.

1063
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,000
Um, nothing basically said we have nothing new to announce regarding, uh, first party

1064
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,240
software for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.

1065
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,420
We can't confirm that new software is coming from third party publishers.

1066
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,120
So third parties will support, but it looks like all the first party support is going

1067
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,360
towards the switch right now, which makes sense.

1068
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,000
So I have two handhelds out there to compete with each other.

1069
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Right.

1070
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,240
And I mean, I know that they had, um, shot down some rumors about news.

1071
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,080
I think we may have talked about last week about new switch hardware that was rumored,

1072
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:28,520
but, um, that's been kind of shot down as far as like a smaller switch that's going

1073
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,680
to be coming out.

1074
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,120
So I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they actually announce.

1075
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,840
Maybe at E3 we'll learn something or maybe later on.

1076
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,800
Um, I think there will be a new revision to the switch at some point, but I'm not sure

1077
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,320
about a smaller version.

1078
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,400
I can't even imagine what they would do with, how would they would do a smaller version

1079
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,400
of the switch?

1080
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,160
Well, the, they could go down as low as any one of the DS screens, you know, and still

1081
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
have it work.

1082
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,000
But with the joy cons, I don't know.

1083
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That'd be just really weird.

1084
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We'll see.

1085
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:04,600
Um, but yeah, so no first party support, unfortunately, um, going forward aside from the already

1086
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,080
announced games.

1087
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,640
Um, but I guess that means a lot more games coming to the switch, hopefully excite truck

1088
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
is one of those.

1089
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,500
I'm not holding my breath though, but, um, you and your excite truck more like Nelly

1090
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,560
and excite truck, or just bring like some support for Wii games, like some of the Wii

1091
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,080
games that use like a tilt, I guess some of those games might be a little bit hard to

1092
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,640
play, but yeah, you probably could play that game, has the same number of buttons.

1093
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,040
It's not impossible.

1094
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah.

1095
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,280
So I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see, um, what they announce.

1096
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,000
But 3DS stuff, of course, um, from third parties.

1097
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,760
So I know that they support like the DS stuff for a long time, so I'm sure we'll, we'll

1098
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
get some new games pretty soon.

1099
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,000
Completely off topic and this is stupid, but every time I or someone says it's not impossible,

1100
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,480
Tom Jones starts appearing in my head.

1101
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:03,040
Instead of, you know, instead of seeing it, it's not impossible, my brain's doing remixes.

1102
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
What do we have?

1103
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,480
Just seeing if they can still hear it or what's going on.

1104
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,480
Is it busy sounding?

1105
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,480
Yeah.

1106
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,480
They say it's really bad.

1107
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
They don't have to edit the podcast.

1108
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
Oh, that's not good.

1109
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,480
We'll just share it.

1110
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,480
We'll just share.

1111
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,480
It's fine.

1112
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
That's okay.

1113
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,120
That means that Rob and I can go shopping and, or Matt, if you are off, you can go shopping

1114
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
with us too.

1115
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,120
We all go shopping.

1116
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,440
I'm off for the next two days.

1117
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,440
I'm off Thursday for, well, I wanted to take time off on Friday, but then I got called

1118
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,400
back into work because only I can solve problems apparently.

1119
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,440
And then it just all went downhill from there.

1120
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,160
How do you solve a problem like Loki?

1121
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,300
I had the worst back massage the other day.

1122
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,520
Like it jacked up my back.

1123
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,240
I hope you didn't tip.

1124
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
I did.

1125
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
All right.

1126
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,360
I was a massage therapist and if I gave a bad massage, I wouldn't expect a tip.

1127
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,520
I'm going to attempt to move on to the next story here while I'm, I believe it or not,

1128
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,960
I have more cords to test and more mics to try.

1129
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,040
So we'll see if I can get through this, but anyway in the meantime, do not mix up my piles.

1130
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,040
That is all broken.

1131
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,040
Okay.

1132
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,560
Anyhow we're going to move on to a story that talks about something that's got a lot of

1133
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,160
people talking in the industry, especially, um, you know, the past couple of years, I

1134
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,160
think you've heard more and more talk about, does this gaming industry need to unionize?

1135
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,080
And one of the things that's very controversial in the industry is crunch time.

1136
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,680
And the reason why I think this is relevant right now is because we've had a couple of

1137
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,060
stories this week, this very week that have discussed crunch time in the industry and

1138
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,400
how it is affecting things that are going on.

1139
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,200
And one of them has to do with the mortal combat development cycle and mortal combat

1140
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
11.

1141
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,240
Um, so a report came out this week that talked about, it was actually some allegations on

1142
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,320
Twitter, apparently from like a former developer who said, um, on mortal combat nine crunch

1143
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,300
time officially began after new year's day 2011 of course we did a bit of pre crunch

1144
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,980
before that just to make sure we were in a good spot for crunch.

1145
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,360
This was on schedule documents.

1146
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,720
This was not a wink, wink, nudge, nudge, passionate, hardworking thing.

1147
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
This was mandate.

1148
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,900
And that was according to James Longstreet who was a software engineer at nether realm

1149
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,900
for two years.

1150
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,940
I took one day off between January 1st to 2011 and the day, the day one patch was approved.

1151
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,900
It was my birthday and it was on a Sunday, so it was okay if I was just on call.

1152
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,900
So yeah.

1153
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Wow.

1154
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,420
Um, a lot of time going into this stuff and even, uh, some of our folks who've worked

1155
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,380
in the industry in our chat, uh, shad stars, like in our chats as I remember doing crunch

1156
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:41,020
time at Konami on ultra mix two, nine to 11, Monday through Friday, nine to five Saturday.

1157
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,980
That happened for only a couple of weeks though.

1158
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,100
But in California, it's illegal to have mandatory overtime.

1159
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:54,820
I don't, I think you can pay as long as you pay for it, but I know you cannot make a company.

1160
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,980
You cannot make overtime mandatory.

1161
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
Well, right.

1162
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,100
And they don't make overtime mandatory.

1163
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:05,020
The way it works is they basically say, you know, they kind of make it seem like you're

1164
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:10,020
not going to be a team player if you don't put in these hours and they're not saying

1165
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,140
and they're saying it's optional of course, but then when it comes time to being rehired

1166
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:20,860
after the, your time is up as a contractor, you're going to be less likely to be hired

1167
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,500
if you don't take that time.

1168
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,820
That's only for contractors.

1169
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,640
If you were a regular employee, which some people are, they're supposed there.

1170
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,580
It's actually, I think illegal to have punitive, uh, measures for people who don't work quote.

1171
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,260
Most of them are contractors though.

1172
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,780
And I'm also sorry to say what we're hearing here is, is exactly what you're saying shouldn't

1173
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,780
be happening.

1174
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,780
Punitive measures and pressure.

1175
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
Exactly.

1176
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,980
So what they're doing is they're breaking California labor law in California.

1177
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,260
Uh, I don't know if nether realm is, nether realm is in these other places.

1178
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,100
And I honestly, from, from what Shane is saying is much different.

1179
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,480
I mean, even though, you know, you got two weeks of these crunch time, that seems much

1180
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,340
more like at least it's like planned out, you know, exactly that kind of like what time

1181
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,900
period is as opposed to what we're hearing here where it's like months and months at

1182
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,900
a time.

1183
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,420
And, uh, Fortnite is the other big one we're hearing about is that, you know, Fortnite's

1184
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,820
been super successful, but because they're doing patch after patch after patch that these

1185
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,220
guys are in like a nonstop crunch.

1186
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,460
And so what's really frustrating to me about this whole thing and reading it is that it

1187
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,280
sounds like, and isn't this, isn't this the way it always goes, right?

1188
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,560
Is that the supervisors and managers are barely doing any of it.

1189
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,320
It's all, they're the ones that are leaving because it's the, you know, that their job

1190
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
is to supervise and manage.

1191
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,120
They're not the ones that are actually putting in the work, but then go figure this time

1192
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,040
as it goes on and on and on for months and months, we're talking about much more than

1193
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
two weeks.

1194
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,160
It's going on and on for months and months is that people feel like, like that less time

1195
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,280
at the time isn't being as effective than that.

1196
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,840
They're sitting there for hours waiting for a new build and so on and so on.

1197
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,160
It's just, it's really kind of gross and I think that's why a lot of this stuff is kind

1198
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:06,640
of coming to light now, but it's also a double edged sword because you know how gamers are

1199
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,640
in this industry.

1200
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,000
If they don't make certain deadlines, that game's got bugs that aren't fixed, it's going

1201
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,800
to get torn the fuck apart online.

1202
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:21,740
That's why I super, though I'm supportive of workers unionizing to improve those conditions

1203
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,680
and to remove this expectation from the industry.

1204
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:37,960
Especially since we've had so many other unionizations occurring, especially for example, our teachers

1205
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,880
as of late, you know, and if you know your history, you know that here in the US, companies

1206
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,240
were quite abusive of their employees until unions made those changes.

1207
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,600
So I'm fully in support of the industry unionizing, absolutely.

1208
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
No hesitation.

1209
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,080
And it sounds like there's just some kind of like a lot of like piss poor jobs planning

1210
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,120
and so forth.

1211
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,000
And I think if the supervisors and managers aren't there during all of this time, that's

1212
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,320
kind of bullshit for one, you know, like, I don't know, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm being

1213
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,800
naive on how corporate culture, but certainly I've been in the positions where I have to

1214
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,400
work overtime, but it's, you know, planned out.

1215
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,320
It's not nonstop.

1216
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,560
I'm able to have time to adjust things so I can, you know, and usually all the companies

1217
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,320
that have made me do it have been pretty good where it's like, if you put in a lot of time,

1218
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,280
it's like, we're just going to give you a free day off later once the thing is met.

1219
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,360
You know, it's been reasonable, much more reasonable as opposed to, well, if you don't

1220
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,200
do it, you know, you're going to get a nasty review next time you have a one-on-one or

1221
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,880
what have you, you know, or there's, we could just fire you and there's 10 million of you

1222
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,360
out there looking for a job in the industry and all that crap.

1223
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,720
Well, the other thing is they also don't expect people to know the labor laws in their state

1224
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,920
either, to know them well, to know them well enough to be able to bring them into a conversation

1225
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
to protect themselves.

1226
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
No.

1227
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,320
Anyhow, also it should be mentioned, I noticed Bobby is kind of alluding to an Apex story.

1228
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,520
It should be noted that, you know, Respawn has kind of said some things sort of in response

1229
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,680
to this because they outlined how they were going to handle Apex updates going forward.

1230
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,600
Drew McCoy stressed in an update that he wrote about where the team is going, that the battle

1231
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,360
royale game will still be alive and thriving, but they were not going to pursue updates

1232
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:32,960
so aggressively that it will require crunch time that can prompt burnout or worse.

1233
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,600
So if you want to make a long story short, he's saying you're going to be waiting longer

1234
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:42,040
for Apex updates because we're not putting our team through crunch and TBH, I'm good

1235
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,120
with it.

1236
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
Like that.

1237
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,400
People need to learn some fucking patience.

1238
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,480
And you also know you're going to get quality stuff.

1239
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,360
Whereas, you know, we heard a very similar story not that long ago that involved BioWare

1240
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,280
and look where that crunch got them with Mass Effect Andromeda and all the issues that it

1241
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,280
had.

1242
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,080
And they're still behind in Anthem updates as well, their roadmap that they put out there

1243
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,920
of all the things that they're going to add to the game.

1244
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,920
They haven't even come close to doing that on time.

1245
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,760
Now Bobby in chat to read his full comments said that the consumer response to Respawn

1246
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,400
saying that they won't crunch for Apex Legends, so they won't get any updates until the next

1247
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,160
patch was, well, looks like you don't care about the game.

1248
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,480
Like Epic going back to Fortnite where they respect me and give me content constantly

1249
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,640
will allow me to say, not this consumer, fuck that.

1250
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:36,060
And I think what we as gamers can do is we can embrace companies that say that this is

1251
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,480
going to be the policy and say, you know what?

1252
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
It's okay.

1253
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,060
Oh, a game is going to take a little longer to come out.

1254
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,060
It's okay.

1255
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,620
People only care about themselves.

1256
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah.

1257
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,460
So to that, I say, if you're those gamers, you're causing this problem.

1258
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,620
Screw you.

1259
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,540
Like you sit down and shut up, make your own fucking game, see how easy it is.

1260
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,580
That's what I say to those gamers that, you know, are not gonna, you know, say, oh, you

1261
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,580
don't care about me.

1262
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,060
You need to stop being part of the problem.

1263
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,060
Yeah.

1264
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,060
You know what it is.

1265
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,660
So, um, and I, so what I can do for the industry is to those gamers, I can say, I will fight

1266
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,840
you.

1267
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,980
Not literally, obviously, because I don't want to get banned from Twitch.

1268
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,820
I'm using hyperbole.

1269
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,740
I will cooking mama fight you.

1270
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,740
I play dirty.

1271
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,940
I will challenge you to a kitchen battle royale.

1272
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,860
I am the iron chef.

1273
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,860
So but here's the thing.

1274
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:31,340
And you know what guys hasn't Nintendo delayed smash brothers games a million times.

1275
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,660
Wasn't Zelda delayed twice.

1276
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,260
Didn't grand theft auto get pushed back?

1277
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,220
Aren't they quality products?

1278
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:42,100
And those games came out a okay at the end of the day and we're all just fine for it.

1279
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,340
I'll point this out.

1280
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:48,380
How many people go to buy a shelf at Ikea and it's next to say one that was built in

1281
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:54,780
the fifties by hand, which shelf falls apart sooner than you Ikea piece of shit.

1282
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,780
The things that were, that people took their time with, built sturdy and used good material.

1283
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,940
Those are the things that are still standing.

1284
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,700
You know, how about all these old houses down in the, in the deep south, you know, we're

1285
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,140
back East, these buildings that have been around since the 17 hundreds.

1286
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,500
They're still standing.

1287
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,500
Why?

1288
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
Quality material, quality effort, quality time.

1289
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,780
They didn't roll them out on a cookie cutter.

1290
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,620
The same thing goes with your games.

1291
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,100
What games are we still playing today?

1292
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,900
The one for our classic names are playing the ones that people put time and real effort

1293
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:31,100
into and didn't just whip it out, you know, because it was going to be a moneymaker, right?

1294
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:36,340
They put a lot of effort and made sure when it was ready for release, it was ready.

1295
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,340
Yeah.

1296
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,340
Anyhow.

1297
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,540
Um, so, uh, and I want to, I didn't get off my lawn.

1298
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,660
I didn't think to really define this better, but in our chat, there's even a little bit

1299
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
of confusion.

1300
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,660
What does crunch really mean?

1301
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,720
Um, because I, Kaijuta says, I thought crunch meant like numbers, coder updates.

1302
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,260
So is crunch the rush and yeah, crunch crunch is like the slang term they give to this mandatory

1303
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,420
overtime just heard in general crunch time.

1304
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,420
It's it's the time that you have to finish stuff up before your deadline.

1305
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,100
Sometimes, you know, remember everybody's got their different backgrounds and that's

1306
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,540
like a fairly classic term that's been around since the fifties.

1307
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:16,020
Well I'm thinking like, I think the term comes from like a college students crunching for

1308
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,020
like an exam.

1309
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,020
I know I've heard that before.

1310
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:22,660
So yeah, I've always used it in regards to my deadlines, you know, Hey, I'm sorry, I

1311
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,660
can't go out.

1312
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,980
It's crunch time on this poster.

1313
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,980
You know?

1314
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
Yeah.

1315
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,320
So if you have never been around people that use that word, you may not know it.

1316
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,700
So I'm, I'm happy to define those types of things so that we all understand what the

1317
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,780
industry is doing to the people that make our games.

1318
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,420
So anyhow, I think we should move on though, Dark Soccer.

1319
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,900
You have other news out of Epic, right?

1320
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,100
Yeah, greedy fuckers.

1321
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,100
Kidding.

1322
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,100
Maybe.

1323
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:56,700
The Epic Games dude, Tim Sweeney, tweeted that the company would end its exclusivity

1324
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:02,700
agreements if Steam raised its revenue cut for developers.

1325
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,380
The direct quote, if Steam committed to a permanent 88% revenue share for all developers

1326
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:13,060
and publishers without major strings attached, Epic would hastily organize a retreat from

1327
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:18,980
exclusives while honoring our partner commitments and consider putting our own games on Steam.

1328
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,380
So basically you don't get it on Steam because we don't give them money.

1329
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,380
That's it.

1330
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:33,460
Unless, you know, the other thing is then, you know, is it that they want to be guaranteed

1331
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,100
making a certain amount of revenue to cover the cost of putting it on Steam, but I don't

1332
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,100
know.

1333
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,100
It's kind of shady.

1334
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,900
It just, it just seems really icky.

1335
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,420
And then he said in a followup, such a move would be a glorious moment in the history

1336
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:54,140
of PC gaming and would have a sweeping impact on other platforms for generations to come.

1337
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,780
And then stores could go back to just being nice places to buy stuff rather than game

1338
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,120
developer IRS.

1339
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,980
This is the weirdest flex.

1340
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,420
Like this is the weird, I don't know if I can think of a time in the gaming industry.

1341
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,040
Maybe y'all want to correct me, but I'm not sure if I can think of a time where one company

1342
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,140
is essentially trying to bully another company into what to do and how to set its revenue

1343
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,140
is and all this other stuff.

1344
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,340
It's a really weird flex.

1345
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,740
It reeks of like 1920s business practice.

1346
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:29,340
You might try to claim that maybe when PlayStation Sony got up there on stage at E3 and undercut

1347
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:33,880
Microsoft by a hundred dollars, but they didn't exactly get up there and say, but if Microsoft

1348
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,300
will do this, then we'll cut the prior.

1349
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,700
I don't, you know, I just, it seems really, this whole thing is very bold and you know,

1350
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,540
here's the thing, Tim Sweeney, I appreciate you for what you've done for the industry,

1351
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,740
especially like ZZT and all that stuff.

1352
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,740
You know, I have a lot of love for that game and all this stuff, but honestly, when it

1353
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,880
comes to stuff like this, you just got a big spotlight showing on you with this crunch

1354
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,000
time stuff and everything that, you know, the Fortnite staff is going through.

1355
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,300
So making himself out to be a really big bully miser sort of Scrooge, in my opinion, fix

1356
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,980
your own shit before you tell other companies how to fix theirs.

1357
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,140
Like I know you might think you're trying to get gamers on your side by flexing your

1358
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:15,320
dick like this with this whole trying to, you know, well, if the steam would come down

1359
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,160
to the rate, you know, the word pan and all this stuff, I just, you need to fix your

1360
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,360
own fucking problems first.

1361
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,880
Don't, don't throw rocks when you live in a glass house.

1362
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,000
It's honestly some Wall Street in the recession level bullshit.

1363
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You know what I mean?

1364
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,440
That, you know, he's like, we've got all this power.

1365
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,840
We've got so much over the industry right now that it would do, do you well to be on

1366
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,560
our good side and do business the way that we want to, which is exactly what the banks

1367
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,640
were doing with the government at that time.

1368
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,440
And when you put these two stories side by side, which is why we did that in our show

1369
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,440
world tonight.

1370
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,120
When you put these two stories side by side, it kind of gets gross.

1371
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:00,040
It's grosser and grosser, honestly, because it's like, well, Epic, we got the costs down

1372
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
and all that.

1373
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,080
At what cost, Epic?

1374
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,240
At what cost?

1375
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,960
There's no morality anymore in business.

1376
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,440
I mean, well, there wasn't really morality in business anyway, but this is why we have

1377
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:17,760
to have regulations and have them kept in check or else they're going to do this shit

1378
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,000
on a larger scale.

1379
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,720
You know, people like, oh, you leave business unregulated, then they're going to do the

1380
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
right thing.

1381
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
Bullshit.

1382
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
They won't.

1383
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
You want some examples?

1384
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,080
Look to the early business models of US.

1385
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,960
And to be clear, I am all for steam having competition.

1386
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,240
And I honestly, I don't think I've said a bad thing about the Epic game store on the

1387
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:45,280
show previously, you know, when it comes to this whole price war thing going on in

1388
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,760
the exclusives and all that stuff, that is capitalism, I suppose, love it or hate it.

1389
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,240
That is the competition that would allow both of these companies to thrive and so forth

1390
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,800
where I have a problem.

1391
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,840
And what's making me kind of come out here and say, you know, Tim Sweeney dial it back

1392
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:07,720
is when now he's trying to like, he needs to let these negotiations and let these price

1393
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,240
reductions and so forth.

1394
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,680
He needs to let that do the talking.

1395
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,200
He needs to not come out and say, oh, but if valve does this, then we'll even give them

1396
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,760
our games to put on the store.

1397
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,480
And he's like, so trying to get that rabble rabble.

1398
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,840
We're the good guys here.

1399
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,840
And if they just, if they, if the bad guys would just turn around and do what we're doing,

1400
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:33,320
because we're all about the developers that did it, well, guess what?

1401
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,220
What about your own developers?

1402
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,760
Are you really the good guy there?

1403
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,360
Well, especially think about how much work that's going to cause for their developers

1404
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,920
bringing it out on another platform.

1405
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,120
I mean, seriously, they're the he's really painting himself out to be just like, you

1406
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,960
know, a twirling mustache, you know, bad businessman.

1407
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,240
But if you make is easy to I'll shut the fuck up.

1408
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,280
No, you won't.

1409
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,320
And that, though, that type of shit, though, in all seriousness, is what businesses rely

1410
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,640
on is like, hey, here's your bone.

1411
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,640
Are you happy now?

1412
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,920
And trying to just, you know, I'm not really going to say I would make a game in ZZT about

1413
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,000
how to treat your workers.

1414
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,760
That's that's the that's the petty crocker I aspire to be.

1415
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,960
The thing is, is that all of this is what we have going on in the government right now.

1416
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,000
A lot of smoke and mirrors.

1417
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,480
Oh, this big, terrible shit's going on.

1418
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,560
But here's this thing to distract you.

1419
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,440
And that's that's what the company.

1420
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,640
I didn't do it. I'm not lying.

1421
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,040
You're lying. I didn't do anything.

1422
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,480
Well, by the way, did you read it?

1423
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,120
I didn't do anything. I'm not lying.

1424
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,560
You're lying.

1425
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,560
Stop talking over me, please.

1426
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:44,840
But by the way, you know, with all of this, this is the you know, I'm sure this is really

1427
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,880
bad, but look at this other bad thing that's happening.

1428
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,680
That doesn't make the one bad less bad.

1429
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,600
And the companies are trying to do this shit, too, because we have an enabler.

1430
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, if steam would just stop having such a punchable face, we'd

1431
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:04,120
stop punching them. But you know what, to be fair, and I know you're just saying that very

1432
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,840
tongue in cheek, but to be fair, like we have heard from folks on this show that say at

1433
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,720
the end of the day, even if they're getting less of a cut from steam, there's things that

1434
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,040
steam offer them that are more attractive right now.

1435
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,240
Right. Haven't we had folks that have said, I still prefer steam because of the integrated

1436
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,280
leaderboards, the online that's there, you know, these other things that steam will do

1437
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,560
that maybe that is worth it to them to have that greater cut of the game.

1438
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,600
And that's fine. That's a developer's choice to make at the end of the day.

1439
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,080
Right. So competition.

1440
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,120
That's great. Competition is good.

1441
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:41,440
I mean, especially it's pretty much the model for capitalism right there.

1442
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:49,080
But at the same time, again, they need to not pull those bullying tactics to try to get

1443
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,320
the companies to do what they want them to do.

1444
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:57,800
They should let it the market control itself in terms of making that competition saying,

1445
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,160
hey, this business practice is working better.

1446
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,960
Maybe we should modify our model.

1447
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,440
Instead of, you know, online bullying.

1448
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,600
Sia Tabiri, and I'll let him have the final thought here in our chat, says that's part of

1449
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,560
the problem with the 24 hour news cycle.

1450
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,280
There's too much going on out at the same time.

1451
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,280
And by the time there's any actual understanding of what's going on, people are tired or

1452
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,120
no longer interested because it's been repeated and pulled in 50 different directions.

1453
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,160
And, you know, you might think that comments about politics and it very well could be.

1454
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,560
But I think that comment also very much applies to social media and gaming.

1455
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,600
And, you know, gaming blogs and Twitter and Facebook and so on.

1456
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,200
I agree with absolutely applies.

1457
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:46,680
So are we're so used to having everything just instant and that's well and not not to go

1458
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,560
too crazy on this.

1459
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,960
We can move on after this, but it's also having a psychological effect on on how we

1460
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,360
translate information on how we disseminate it.

1461
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,160
But I think it's also going back into that instant gratification I was talking about

1462
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,240
earlier, how everyone wants their stuff now.

1463
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,760
There needs to be a big change, but that's a topic for another day.

1464
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,360
All right, so this is pretty awesome.

1465
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:18,200
So as I mentioned, I just picked up Breath of the Wild for the Switch and I still haven't

1466
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,600
got a chance to play with the Labo VR mode, but there may be a better way to do the

1467
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,920
Labo VR.

1468
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:32,760
And actually, if you don't have Labo VR, but you have a PlayStation VR, you may actually

1469
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,120
get to play it in VR with both.

1470
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,360
So how exactly will you be able to do this?

1471
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:47,000
Well, it's a little bit of it's a little bit of some complicated, I guess, rearranging of

1472
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,680
cables, but you can do it.

1473
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:55,640
So what you basically do is you reroute the video signal from your Switch into your

1474
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,480
PlayStation VR breakout box.

1475
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,880
And then with changing some of the cables around, you can actually get to output to your

1476
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,280
TV and to the VR headset.

1477
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:09,480
And because the VR mode works when docked, which I'm sure is just an oversight by the

1478
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,720
folks at Nintendo, that now you can actually kind of play it in at least 3D on the VR

1479
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,840
headset. So, yeah.

1480
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,600
Sorry, I just have to jump in with a chat comment because Bobby is and he was talking a

1481
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,800
little bit about Zelda VR on his show tonight, but he's saying you don't want to play Zelda

1482
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,720
in VR, trust me.

1483
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,600
And he's talking about that it kind of makes you sick, like it's just it's just not very

1484
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,760
good the way it's done.

1485
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,560
And I'm sure it probably has to do with the fact that, you know, it's really meant to be

1486
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,480
done in like short spurts as well.

1487
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,160
But it just it really just sounds like it was kind of like an afterthought.

1488
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:47,320
And it's just like like even though, lol, we can hack it to run on the PlayStation VR, it

1489
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,880
really just sounds like it's just not worth your fucking time.

1490
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,560
I'm still going to try it once just for the hell of it, because why not?

1491
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,080
Because I have a PlayStation VR, it's not being used for anything.

1492
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,960
Just don't eat lunch first.

1493
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,240
I don't know, the motion stuff doesn't really bother me too much, like just like how they

1494
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:11,240
had I used to play on the Gear VR, the Minecraft on there and they have, OK, you can

1495
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,960
teleport around or you can move around.

1496
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,720
We don't recommend the moving around because it might make you motion sick.

1497
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,080
And I'm just like, I'm running all over the place.

1498
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,240
And it just it doesn't bother me too much.

1499
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,000
So we'll see.

1500
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,120
And I'm sure that there's no head tracking with it because obviously it's just the video.

1501
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,120
So the video would be in 3D, but I don't know.

1502
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,520
It I'll try it once and then I'll be done with it.

1503
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,320
Well, Bobby is saying you wouldn't try it because you don't like puking, but also it's

1504
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,720
saying is it's a jittery frame rate seems to be the really big problem.

1505
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,640
And I can see I can see where that gets really annoying really fast.

1506
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,480
And it just it really just feels like this whole thing was tacked on us.

1507
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,560
And afterthought, yay, cute.

1508
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,200
But like seriously not.

1509
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,120
I have a feeling most people are going to be in the try once cap like, you know, somebody

1510
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,880
can say don't do that. You shouldn't do that.

1511
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,800
But of course. And Bobby, you know this.

1512
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,040
You tell somebody don't do that.

1513
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,920
It's make you sick. And what's somebody going to say?

1514
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,680
I'm going to do it because somebody told me not to and fuck the law feeling cute.

1515
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,480
Might throw up later.

1516
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:20,800
But I mean, that's fine if you don't want to do that, at the very least, you got some

1517
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,120
better load times out of it because apparently people are finding that the load times have

1518
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,080
been reduced thanks to this newest update.

1519
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,760
So you can enjoy that.

1520
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:36,720
And I guess that's also working out good for the speed running community because it's

1521
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,400
cutting down their times as well because there's less load time.

1522
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:40,760
Neat.

1523
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,720
All right, well, let's talk about other Nintendo stories, and this one is kind of putting a

1524
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:52,400
definitive foot down on some rumors and things that we've been hearing previously is that

1525
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,520
Nintendo was going to show off some new hardware at E3 this year.

1526
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,360
At first it was there's going to be a more powerful and a less powerful Switch console.

1527
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,440
And then that got dialed back last week.

1528
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,240
The rumors were, well, now they're just going to do the less powerful one because the more

1529
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,440
powerful one's not ready yet.

1530
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,720
Well, guess what? Now, Shuntaro Furukawa, that is Nintendo's president, has come out and

1531
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,320
basically put his foot down and said none of that.

1532
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:21,320
So in a meeting with investors, he mentioned that the company does not have plans to

1533
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,920
announce any new hardware at E3 this year.

1534
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,120
That is not happening.

1535
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,240
So that was from Twitter.

1536
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,600
Basically, during an investor conference call, a person from Reuters who is on Twitter

1537
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,600
says Nintendo CEO says no plan to announce new hardware at E3 show.

1538
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,640
Nintendo CEO said nothing announced on possible new hardware, but it is always

1539
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,520
developing hardware internally.

1540
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,160
That part's not really news because we've said this a million times before.

1541
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,600
The minute the PlayStation 4 came out, Sony was already working on PlayStation 5.

1542
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,840
That's how long these types of things take to develop.

1543
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,720
So is Nintendo working on a different Switch console?

1544
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,080
Oh, abso-fucking-lutely.

1545
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,520
Is there more than one of them based on these rumors?

1546
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Probably. Is it happening this year?

1547
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,880
Well, sounds like nope because they just they just came out very for the president.

1548
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,040
Nintendo said ain't happening.

1549
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,080
Well, they didn't say specifically E3.

1550
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,720
So maybe they'll do their own direct.

1551
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,640
They could. They could do something, you know, around the time of Tokyo Game Show or

1552
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,720
something like that. I know Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, but that hasn't

1553
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,680
stopped them from doing announcements around that time.

1554
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,760
But I I think the good news out of this is that this means that E3 well, for one, I'm

1555
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,200
I'm totally OK with the Switch having another year just as it is like I wasn't all

1556
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,880
about the hardware refresh right now.

1557
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,400
So I think a hardware fresh in another year will be even better and it'll be more

1558
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,080
attractive to want to buy at that time.

1559
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,640
But that means E3 is going to be all about the games.

1560
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,640
So I'm really hoping and Dark Sakura are relevant to your interests.

1561
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,600
Animal Crossing ought to dominate the conversation at E3 this year, along with I

1562
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,440
wish along with, I assume, Metroid Prime 4.

1563
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,400
And we should get an E3 that's going to be games, games, games, games and less about

1564
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,720
hardware since now they're not going to be trying to sell new consoles.

1565
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,040
So that will be I don't think this is such bad news at the end of the day, to be

1566
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,360
honest. Now, OK, you know, other other thoughts, though.

1567
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,360
Shad Starzik in chat says, I was hoping to get a new revision for Pokemon.

1568
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:25,440
That's an interesting perspective because, you know, Pokemon would be a great time to

1569
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,520
pair up with new hardware, and I think that's why a lot of people were thinking

1570
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,040
Nintendo might go in the direction of a smaller Switch console.

1571
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:37,160
After all, was it Pokemon X and Y or was it Sun and Moon when the 2DS came out?

1572
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,240
Right. I think it was X and Y.

1573
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,840
The 2DS came out right when like X and Y came out.

1574
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,680
And that was kind of a thing to try to put out, like a lower budget model for the kiddies

1575
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,960
that want to play Pokemon.

1576
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,360
Although is it really just kids to play?

1577
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,760
I don't know. I think it's just me looking at my Twitter feed on who all wants to go see

1578
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,440
Detective Pikachu next week is definitely kids and adults.

1579
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,440
It's yeah, for sure. Let's go.

1580
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,880
I didn't even like I haven't seen Endgame yet.

1581
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,320
I don't mean to see that, too.

1582
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,600
Girl, I haven't seen a Marvel movie since the first Avengers.

1583
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,800
Captain Marvel is great.

1584
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,600
So I'm sure it was. And Black Panther, I'm sure was great, too.

1585
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,360
I haven't seen any of them since.

1586
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,640
I just it's not that I have anything against this particular movie.

1587
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,240
I've been treating all the movies the same.

1588
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,440
I just haven't had time. But I do really want to see Detective Pikachu.

1589
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,520
I will say that I just I'm just I'm really hoping and praying they didn't fuck this up.

1590
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,760
And, you know, there's there's that buzz online that's saying that some of the early

1591
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,520
press screening reviews are saying they didn't fuck it up.

1592
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,240
So we'll see.

1593
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,640
Grain of salt, grain of salt.

1594
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,720
Anyway, SSU 100 Matt says, I would like to see them talk and show more Nintendo online

1595
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,480
exclusive stuff, you know, that would definitely be an asset and something to help

1596
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,200
sell more Nintendo online stuff.

1597
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,800
Maybe E3 is the time they're going to put out the Super Nintendo stuff.

1598
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,360
I would sure make a lot of sense.

1599
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:59,080
But also, I think Tetris 99 has turned out to be a much bigger deal than anyone thought

1600
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,120
it would be necessarily.

1601
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,680
So I would expect we're going to see something else, something that's like small but powerful,

1602
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,640
like Tetris 99 kind of was for the online setup.

1603
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,640
I don't know. We'll see.

1604
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,520
Loki, what are your thoughts on all this?

1605
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,040
I just hope there's some good game announcements.

1606
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,680
I'm sure they'll show more of the new Pokemon games.

1607
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,320
And of course, Animal Crossing, but I guess I just want to see what else is coming up.

1608
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,000
Metroid, too. I don't know.

1609
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,000
We'll see.

1610
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,600
All right, let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

1611
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,560
We're going to get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit.

1612
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,080
But first, I actually found this like super randomly, too.

1613
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:42,960
But it was there's this hacking that took place in 2018 that targeted the Asus Live update

1614
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:49,120
tool. So it would affect various pieces of software with malware as it was figured out.

1615
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:55,720
Basically, there's reports from ESET and Kupersky that says the same group is also

1616
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:03,240
responsible for infecting a video game development tool that has infected several video

1617
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,200
games on the programming level, meaning it's not because they're bootlegs, you're

1618
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,480
downloading it from any third party source.

1619
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,280
The direct versions of these are infected.

1620
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,480
About 92,000 computers were exposed to malware.

1621
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,600
They're all PCs.

1622
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,880
But to be to be fair, all the or not all of it, but the majority of it so that our

1623
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,000
listeners don't get freaked out.

1624
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,960
The majority of this is happening in...

1625
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,720
I was going to be getting to that.

1626
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,320
Just making sure, because I'd be freaking out, maybe.

1627
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:40,360
I know. Basically, it did occur mostly in Asia, especially in Thailand.

1628
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,560
But there have been more reports outside of the region.

1629
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,480
Two of the studios who were affected in particular are Electronix Extreme and Zepetto.

1630
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:56,760
Their games affected was Infestation and Point Blank.

1631
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,920
All one word, not to be confused with the Namco one.

1632
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,600
And so if you've got those games, just be careful.

1633
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,200
Run a malware search on your computer.

1634
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,840
The malware does not affect functions on computers that are set to use simplified Chinese.

1635
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:17,480
So that means that likelihood, that means that it was a Chinese developer that put out

1636
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,720
that particular bit of malware.

1637
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,680
And it actually spreads.

1638
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,040
I mean, like I said, normally malware will spread through third party tampering

1639
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,680
afterwards when you're getting a bootleg game.

1640
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,080
But in this case, it is all through the legitimate copies of those particular games.

1641
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,040
Those two in particular.

1642
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,040
So just be careful of them.

1643
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,400
Interesting. You know, I was just I was kind of thinking while you were talking about that

1644
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,360
when we talk about like game development and thinking about like where games are headed.

1645
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,840
Isn't it going to be interesting, though, when we start getting into more cloud gaming

1646
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,360
where it's not necessarily going to be something that you necessarily download on your

1647
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,280
own computer or laptop or other device that you're playing games on anymore because so

1648
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:58,160
much, you know, between Stadia and, you know, and so forth will be up in the cloud.

1649
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:02,840
Look at the source. And people what people just say, oh, the cloud, whatever, is that

1650
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:10,240
these particular services are highly encrypted and meant to work on the device that they

1651
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:16,360
connect to. What you have on your computer will not affect the cloud based service.

1652
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,240
What they're going to deliver is what they deliver.

1653
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:26,000
Even if you had and I know this from experience, even if you had like a bajillion pieces of

1654
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,560
malware on your computer, it's not going to affect the content that you put on a cloud

1655
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,520
based service because they have their own local protection and local encryption.

1656
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:42,080
Right. So and so my kind of whole point is that this method of attack is not going to be

1657
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:48,560
able to really work on the cloud, although I'm sure I'm sure there are evil people out

1658
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,000
there, for lack of a better term, that would love to hack the cloud.

1659
01:22:52,200 --> 01:23:00,000
Absolutely. And again, the Amazon Web services and these big Web providers.

1660
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,400
Right. Keep in mind, it's not a the cloud.

1661
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,720
It is cloud service for this provider.

1662
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,720
The cloud is a concept.

1663
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,920
Not really. Not really.

1664
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:17,800
The cloud itself, the term of a cloud is going to refer to each individual service when

1665
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,560
people say, oh, I don't trust the cloud.

1666
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,520
Well, which one do you not trust?

1667
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,240
Is it Google services?

1668
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,440
Is it iCloud?

1669
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,080
Is it going to be Microsoft's cloud based service?

1670
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,720
Is it going to be Amazon's cloud based service?

1671
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,040
Which fucking cloud are you talking about?

1672
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,080
There are how many clouds in the sky?

1673
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,560
Well, I'm afraid the cloud is going to rain.

1674
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,880
Which cloud? Is it the black one over there that looks like it's going to rain?

1675
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,040
Or is it this white fluffy one over here that's doing jack shit to you?

1676
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,280
I don't like cloud either.

1677
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,120
His hair is too big.

1678
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,640
Girl, but I'm saying is that people have this, like, concept of a cloud and it's not a

1679
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,800
concept anymore.

1680
01:23:54,120 --> 01:24:00,560
It is a working system for each provider of this cloud service.

1681
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,880
You're the cloud is not something up in the air.

1682
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:09,760
It's a computer sitting a computer server sitting in some closet in whatever company's,

1683
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,520
you know, IT location.

1684
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,000
I got to read some good comments from our chat here.

1685
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,360
Bob Coffee in chat says it's like the claw from Toy Story, only it's the cloud.

1686
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,880
Bonds 006 in chat says, thank you, Jamie.

1687
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,200
So many times I hear people say that exact.

1688
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,480
I don't trust the cloud.

1689
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,720
Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that.

1690
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,560
But but you'll put all your money in a bank.

1691
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,080
You don't trust the cloud, but you put all your money in a bank.

1692
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:41,400
Same diff. Well, on top of that, most of our money isn't physical money, per se.

1693
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,840
It's in line with money is just a concept.

1694
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,760
Well, it's how it's becoming, at least here.

1695
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:54,920
I know in other countries they're still very much, you know, physical money based, but a

1696
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,760
lot of our fundage is, you know, people were like poo pooing on cryptocurrency.

1697
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:08,440
But how much of your do you get a do a lot of people get a physical cash sum of money

1698
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:14,560
into their hand and individual bills and coins that they are going to then put in a box

1699
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,360
somewhere to save? Or are you getting direct deposit?

1700
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,840
Are you getting a check? You're getting a representation.

1701
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,160
That's anyway.

1702
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:26,040
No, it's fine, because a Bobby, but not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but Bobby

1703
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,520
Black Wolf in chat says money here is just a concept.

1704
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:31,600
Yes, it only has value because everyone agrees it has value.

1705
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,280
Social contract. You you just defined Bitcoin.

1706
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,880
Exactly. That's what I brought up.

1707
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,200
Cryptocurrency is the same difference, really.

1708
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,040
You know, it's just the only reason that cryptocurrency was having such a thing is

1709
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,240
because they told you flat out, no, this is your virtual money.

1710
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,960
You know, they don't need to have cryptocurrency because their own currency is

1711
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,640
digital. You can pay me and Travis Donovan fun bucks if you want, but the bummer is

1712
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,880
Starbucks don't take it.

1713
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:07,920
Exactly. We have no need for cryptocurrencies because our currency is already in the

1714
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,120
ether. Shouldn't OLR have a currency, though?

1715
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,160
Carl, do you know what a actual tax burden that would be for us?

1716
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,840
Just we would have to register as it was a joke.

1717
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,240
It was it was just a concept.

1718
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,360
All right. Anyway, I know, but you know me.

1719
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,320
I think actual logistics when for half a moment, I think something might be a good

1720
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,520
idea. All right.

1721
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,200
Well, before we scare people too much, let's move on to our next story.

1722
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,840
Loki, I would, by the way, be paid in blood or in just Questbuster, just saying.

1723
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:41,880
Well, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Game Boy, as we talked about last

1724
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:51,640
week, there was this wonderful post by GitHub pointing out this GB Studio by, I

1725
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,080
guess, Chris Molti or Moltby.

1726
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,200
Yeah, Chris Moltby.

1727
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:03,000
So what he did is he created this he created a game for a game jam called

1728
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,200
Untitled GB Game.

1729
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:11,800
And with that, he also built tools to basically build Game Boy ROMs without any

1730
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:17,720
coding. And so he's actually releasing those tools to allow anybody to go ahead

1731
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,280
and make stuff with it.

1732
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,600
You can make actual Game Boy ROMs.

1733
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:27,440
So if you're interested in checking it out, you can go download it at GB Studio dot

1734
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:36,120
dev. And yeah, and it looks like it's pretty straightforward as far as like an

1735
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,040
editor for games and stuff.

1736
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,440
And maybe you can make something out of it.

1737
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,840
And it looks like he made an adventure game out of using those tools.

1738
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,840
And I think that's pretty cool to be something fun, kind of fun to mess around

1739
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,600
with. And since it actually makes real Game Boy ROMs, that'll be handy when that

1740
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,880
Game Boy Classic Edition comes out someday.

1741
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,000
So, yeah, I'm going to check it out.

1742
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,440
Are you going to start and never finish a game in GB Studio?

1743
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,440
Probably will never start.

1744
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,000
I think I think it's great, though.

1745
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,760
I love it because we kind of have there was this and there was something at GDC

1746
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,120
about the NES and you can make your own game.

1747
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,280
So I'm kind of loving this whole like, hey, it's like the Unreal Engine, but you

1748
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,240
make Game Boy games with it or you make Nintendo games with it.

1749
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,640
Speaking of Unreal Engine, when you're talking about ZZT earlier, I was

1750
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,840
wondering, like thinking about, oh, man, wouldn't it be awesome if they, like,

1751
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,120
remastered ZZT in the Unreal Engine?

1752
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:36,240
It's just super, like, super well textured and lit text characters.

1753
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,080
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1754
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:45,880
Something else I think some people are going to be hyped about is the upcoming

1755
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,120
mobile title, Mario Kart Tour.

1756
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:52,040
Mario Kart Tour is anticipated in the summer of 2019.

1757
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:57,160
But if you want to get your hands on it early, they are opening up a beta test.

1758
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,760
So you can sign up for a beta test from now.

1759
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,920
It already started through May 7th.

1760
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:08,440
And the beta test is planned from May 22nd through June 4th.

1761
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,960
So I bet we're going to get a lot more information about what Mario Kart Tour

1762
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,480
is around that time when the beta opens up.

1763
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:20,920
Unfortunately, though, the beta is limited to Android, so it will not be a beta on

1764
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,480
the iOS platform.

1765
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:29,120
I'm going to assume that could be because I cannot remember the name of the

1766
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,080
application that allows you to beta test over there.

1767
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,800
But I used it because Niantic, you had to have the test wheel or something.

1768
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,040
I don't remember the name of the app, but there's like a there's a side app that you

1769
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,000
load on your phone that allows you to basically run the beta test stuff.

1770
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,120
And I think you're limited to like a thousand deploys or something like that.

1771
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,640
I want to say that's the thing I've heard somewhere.

1772
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,440
So I imagine that Nintendo does not want to just open that up for an open beta test.

1773
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,520
They're probably still testing on iOS, but they're probably just doing that

1774
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,360
internally instead.

1775
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,280
They're going to open this one up.

1776
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:01,680
They're stress testing to Android will probably be a little bit easier to get it

1777
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,480
out there to folks.

1778
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,640
So that is my thought anyway.

1779
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,920
I certainly don't know anything concrete on that.

1780
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:11,160
So but I imagine those because you're the only Android person here, right?

1781
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,400
So maybe are you going to sign up for that?

1782
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,520
You can check out the already did or he did it.

1783
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,720
So all right.

1784
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,040
Cool. All right.

1785
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,040
Well, let's move on.

1786
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,880
We're going to take a trip down memory lane.

1787
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,160
We're going to go back to a time when you didn't beta test games.

1788
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:28,000
There was no there was a you know, if something screwed up in-house testing, it

1789
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,640
was a feature, not a bug.

1790
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,200
It's the classic game of the week.

1791
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:36,760
And Dark Soccer is going to walk us down memory lane and visit a classic game from

1792
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,640
her vault, her archives.

1793
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,960
And this is an interesting one you picked this week.

1794
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:41,880
I think Dark Soccer.

1795
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,600
I tried to go for something a little bit different.

1796
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,120
It's actually a game I didn't get a lot of play in myself.

1797
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,080
I played the sequel a good bit more than this one.

1798
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,440
All right. Well, I want to hear all about it.

1799
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,520
What is the classic game of the week?

1800
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,520
The game is Pool Radiance is one of the AD&D games.

1801
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,120
If you don't know, it's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.

1802
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:02,600
But it's a role playing video game that's put out by Strategic Simulations Inc.

1803
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,120
SSI in 1988.

1804
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,040
So some of you didn't exist.

1805
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,080
And that makes me sad.

1806
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,640
It is the first of TSR's AD&D games.

1807
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,120
This is back when TSR owned Dungeons and Dragons.

1808
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:25,160
But it was the first adaptation of the tabletop game for a home computer.

1809
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,480
It was the first episode in a four part series of these.

1810
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,760
It was the gold box series that used the game engine that was created for this one.

1811
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,520
And it was used in later D&D titles, including Neverwinter Nights.

1812
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,800
But the game is Pool Radiance.

1813
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,640
It takes place in the Forgotten Realms.

1814
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,560
If anyone did, you know, Forgotten Realms D&D.

1815
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,600
I didn't do a lot of Forgotten Realms myself.

1816
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:53,560
I played a little bit in it on tabletop, but mostly it was it was...

1817
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,880
What did I play? Oh, Planescape and...

1818
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,600
Great. Now I can't remember.

1819
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,880
Dragonlance because I love Dragonlance.

1820
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,760
Anyway, just a quick note, too, for those that are watching on Twitch and you can hear

1821
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,880
the background noise as well.

1822
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,160
I'm sure Darcic will talk about the multi platform, but you're going to see the Amiga

1823
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,360
version of this for a couple of minutes.

1824
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,360
It's going to flip over to the NES version here in a moment.

1825
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,520
OK, because, yeah, it's hard to find gameplay that people aren't blabbing over.

1826
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,760
Well, we took that gameplay and then we just put the soundtrack music over it.

1827
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,840
So it worked out. Yeah, we're easy that way.

1828
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:37,960
Anyway, it takes a part in around the port city of Flann, P-H-L-A-N, Flann.

1829
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,880
You can make your party up to six characters.

1830
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:46,800
You decide your race, your gender, your class and your ability scores.

1831
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,120
You basically are just doing questing, really, because isn't that what D&D is?

1832
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:58,320
Where you go on a quest and you do shit and then you get money for it and then you try

1833
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,760
not to die when a dragon shows up.

1834
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:06,120
But at any rate, you move around from the various characters, you know, for various

1835
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:11,640
areas, you battle, you know, enemies as you do, and then you grow with experience points

1836
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:16,120
that let you increase your capabilities again, just like D&D.

1837
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,880
And then you have different perspectives in the games.

1838
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,760
You usually start with a first person perspective, with the screen divided into

1839
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:30,880
sections with pertinent information, and then combat is done in a top down what's

1840
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,560
called video game isometric view.

1841
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:38,280
At any rate, it was a very well received game for what it was.

1842
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:44,320
Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for best fantasy or science fiction computer game of 1988.

1843
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:51,000
Some people said it was a little bit too similar to other games, but the graphics and its role playing

1844
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,120
and combat aspects were very, very, very well lauded.

1845
01:33:54,120 --> 01:34:00,280
And of course, you could export your player characters from Pool of Radiance to the

1846
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,440
subsequent games in the series.

1847
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:09,960
And it used that same AD&D set, so this was more like 1.5 era of D&D, maybe second edition.

1848
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,440
And then, of course, you know, you had your exploration mode that uses that first person perspective.

1849
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:21,280
You had, you know, different characters that you would meet, you would see your people lined up,

1850
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,240
you had your character stat information.

1851
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:30,320
In combat, it was diametric projection, where you would decide the actions that the character

1852
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,880
would take place in each round.

1853
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,120
Of course, you know, designed by your hit points, you would have different combat options,

1854
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,240
depending on class, like your melee and ranged weapons.

1855
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,640
Magic users have spells.

1856
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,360
Thieves can do backstab by positioning themselves.

1857
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:49,520
So it had like all kinds of different points from multiple different types of game systems.

1858
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,720
But again, it was set in Forgotten Realms in the around the city of Flann.

1859
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:04,640
It was located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, along the Beren River between Zentilkeep and

1860
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:10,160
Melvant, if anyone still remembers their geography from Forgotten Realms.

1861
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:16,160
So at any rate, it was, again, the first game built on AD&D rules.

1862
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:22,600
The scenario was created by several of the big TSR designers, Jim Warr, David Cook,

1863
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,720
Steven Winter, and Mike Brault.

1864
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,920
And then it was programmed by the special projects team at SSI.

1865
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:38,240
It was meant to be, it was actually created to play on Apple II and Commodore 64.

1866
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,000
And then the game engine was used again for other series that were in the Gold Box series.

1867
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:51,960
It actually did have books that came out later, so it brought out more manuals.

1868
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:59,600
And it brought information from some of the other core D&D books, including The Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II.

1869
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:08,600
And then, of course, there were books that came out afterwards, but there also were so many different versions that came after that.

1870
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:14,080
So it was first on Commodore 64, Apple II series, IBM PC compatible computers at the time.

1871
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,600
It was announced for Atari ST.

1872
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:25,720
The Mac version came out in 1989, and it had a slightly different interface that was meant to work on the black and white Macs as well, like the Mac Plus and Mac Classic.

1873
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:33,960
And then there was also an Amiga version that came out, as we were looking at, PC 9800.

1874
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,960
In Japan, it had a fully translated version and had full color graphics.

1875
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:45,160
There was the version on the NES that came out as Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Pool of Radiance in 1992 when it came out.

1876
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:51,680
And it was the only version to have a complete soundtrack that was composed by Toda Seiji.

1877
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:59,400
And he was also signed to Pony Canyon's label at the time, so there was a soundtrack release.

1878
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,440
The same soundtrack also came on the PC 9801 version.

1879
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:10,800
The Amiga version had extra music, but while the other versions just had like one song that would play through it.

1880
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:19,160
It came with a 28 page booklet that talked more about the concepts behind it and the character creation, just the how to.

1881
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:27,200
This is a 38 page adventure journal that had the game's background, so it really came with just a bunch of stuff for those PC versions.

1882
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,680
Back in my day before I had to go to an Internet site to see it all.

1883
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:37,680
Well, and then there was a copy protection that used lined up pictures, so you had to use a decoder wheel.

1884
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,720
And after three unsuccessful attempts, the game would shut itself down.

1885
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:43,280
So there were later versions.

1886
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:52,960
The other ones that came out was Curse of the Azure Bonds in 1989, Secret of Silver Blades in 1990, and Pools of Darkness in 1991.

1887
01:37:53,600 --> 01:38:01,440
There's also a game called Hillsfar that was not in the Pools of Radiance series, but it was another D&D game.

1888
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,040
And it actually, all these games got good write ups in Dragon Magazine as well.

1889
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,040
You can import your Pools of Radiance characters into Hillsfar as well.

1890
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,960
But they were just reduced to basic levels and didn't have any of their magic abilities or magic content.

1891
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,080
It was really just such a big package, Pools of Radiance was.

1892
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,120
And then, of course, there were novelizations that were released as well.

1893
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:36,520
D&D put out a game module called Ruins of Adventure that used the same adventure scenario in Pools of Radiance, including the plot, everything.

1894
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:45,080
And it actually has clues that would be useful in the computer missions as well.

1895
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:54,000
And then, you know, Ruins of Adventure had linked many scenarios, which the whole thing is the core of Pools of Radiance.

1896
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,200
So it was very, like I said, very, very well received.

1897
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:06,440
And of course, it was compared to Might and Magic and Bard's Tale, both use very similar formats.

1898
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:18,680
But in the long run, this game was really considered just one of the, I'd say, cores of that tabletop style of computer gaming.

1899
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:25,160
And really, it was just, you know, one of the best.

1900
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:31,800
And then, of course, the one that I played the most of, though, and I might bring this up later, was Pools of Radiance, Ruins of Myth Draenor.

1901
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,400
So that came out in 2001 as released by Ubisoft.

1902
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,000
So, but we'll go into that one for another classic game.

1903
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,000
All right. But there you go.

1904
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:43,720
There it is.

1905
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:44,360
Pools of Radiance.

1906
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,440
Your classic game of the week.

1907
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,840
Where my D&D nerds at?

1908
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,320
Second edition for life.

1909
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,400
You got some people in chat that are shouting you out from that pick.

1910
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,040
Yeah.

1911
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,000
I remember that.

1912
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,440
That was a huge series.

1913
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,080
It really was.

1914
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,000
Like on the home computing systems.

1915
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,040
You're a Commodore dude.

1916
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,600
I didn't even realize, oh yeah, I remember all those games on Commodore.

1917
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:01,560
I didn't really play them.

1918
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,840
I didn't super get into them.

1919
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,680
Ultima was more my jam.

1920
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:13,200
But I digress because, well, it was really the NES versions of Ultima that sucked me in because I played Ultima Exodus and Ultima Quest the Avatar.

1921
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,520
I played those games on NES.

1922
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:20,120
But what's funny is that as much as I was well aware of the AD&D series on computer, I never knew there was an NES version.

1923
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,640
I somehow missed that they ported that to the Nintendo at one point.

1924
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,600
And it came out, you know, a couple of years later.

1925
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:36,720
So, yeah, it was very late in the the line of, you know, the Nintendo stuff and that is in the series of the game.

1926
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,120
That is.

1927
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:43,240
And I think you referenced it in your spiel, but that is early, early Ubisoft that we're looking at basically with that.

1928
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:53,360
And that's kind of like I said, Ubisoft had the licensing for the release of the Ruins of Mythtron or later, which now when any Forgotten Realms thing that I

1929
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,840
did, Mythtron or was the shit.

1930
01:40:56,160 --> 01:41:02,080
It's really interesting how many of those companies from back in the day are actually still around, especially when you look at the rest of the world.

1931
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,680
And it's like, wow, all the stores we shop that as a kid are closing.

1932
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,160
But Ubisoft still around Activision, still around.

1933
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:13,880
ECA dropped the C at some point, became EA, but they're still around.

1934
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:19,520
So it's just kind of interesting how a lot of those like old school computing game makers run at computer entertainment.

1935
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,080
They were.

1936
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,000
And they put out like a piano construction set and pinball construction set.

1937
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,280
Those are racing deconstruction set.

1938
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,880
And they had a whole bunch of games.

1939
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,840
Those are my jam back in the day.

1940
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,840
So anyway, but I digress.

1941
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:45,440
Let's well, actually, I'm glad you brought up Commodore a little bit here because our break tonight has to do with Commodore 64 and a recent like kind of homebrew type

1942
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,720
demake, if you will, that's been going around a lot.

1943
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,720
This past couple of weeks.

1944
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,320
So I decided to take a closer look in this quick little break segment tonight.

1945
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:54,640
Enjoy.

1946
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,200
OK, hello, everybody from my other studio, the office.

1947
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:06,840
I thought for our break in the main studio this week, we could take a look at this this new kind of release for the Commodore 64.

1948
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,600
Yeah, system that's well over 30, almost 35 years old at this point.

1949
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:18,320
There's this new release of an old game, Super Mario 64 and or Super Mario Brothers 64.

1950
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:23,360
Not to be confused with, of course, the Nintendo 64 version, but more the Commodore 64.

1951
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,160
So as you can see on the title screen here, this is Super Mario Brothers 64.

1952
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:34,600
I've actually muted the music here because we're on what's called what you would see a lot in the old Commodore 64 games, a loader screen.

1953
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,320
And sometimes it has its own custom music.

1954
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,440
And this particular one is very dark and ominous.

1955
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,560
I'll unmute it for a minute.

1956
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,960
But you can hear it's just like this really kind of like low, like like kind of scary sounding thing almost.

1957
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,600
So I'm not sure and I will confess I'm running it through the emulator.

1958
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,880
I'm not sure if the emulator is butchering it somehow or something, but I think it's just kind of a little bit of a weird launcher.

1959
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,080
But it looks really nice.

1960
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:05,360
So I'm going to mute that again for a minute while I set this up, because I'm sure Bobby's show tonight, I know he went to a classic computing show in the Atlanta area.

1961
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,080
And I think he got his hands on this as well.

1962
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:15,800
But I know a lot of people out there have been talking about this game a lot this week just because of the fact that, oh, this is kind of like a new release of an older game.

1963
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:22,600
But it's not that we haven't necessarily seen stuff like Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64 before.

1964
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:30,960
Folks have definitely done hacks of the great Gianna Sisters, which was a game that was very similar to Super Mario Brothers.

1965
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:38,760
In fact, so similar that it was pulled from the market at one point and Nintendo shut it down, just like folks are saying they're shutting this one down, too.

1966
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,520
But is anybody really surprised?

1967
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,200
Probably not.

1968
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,080
But this one's kind of new.

1969
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,080
You know, it just came out.

1970
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:49,160
And you see even here on the splash screen, it's been worked on for seven years by this zero page.

1971
01:43:49,360 --> 01:44:00,480
And, you know, considering the technology we're talking about here, the fact that this will run on an actual Commodore 64, this is very impressive how much of the Nintendo game that kind of shoved into this.

1972
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,000
So let's actually take a look at this here.

1973
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,440
So I'm going to unmute this so we can do the launcher screen again.

1974
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:13,440
I'm going to use my joystick to start to get to make sure I'm in the right window here and start the game there.

1975
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,320
Let me move my mouse out of the way just so it's not getting in the way.

1976
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,360
And there we go.

1977
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,920
You can see it's loading their little cute little loading.

1978
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:20,840
And look at that.

1979
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,040
The intro screen Super Mario Brothers, just like you might see it on the Nintendo.

1980
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,080
And I'm going to hit my fire button to start.

1981
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,000
And I apologize.

1982
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,360
You can hear the clacking of my mechanical keyboard in the background.

1983
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:41,200
But you'll notice one thing I noticed right off the bat is that it has a very faithful sound adaptation to the NES, which is interesting because the Commodore 64 SID chip was really nothing like the NES.

1984
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,600
So they've really reproduced it faithfully in this.

1985
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:53,760
One interesting difference between the Commodore 64 and the NES is that the Commodore 64 only has one fire button on the joystick.

1986
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,480
And of course, the NES had the A button and the B button.

1987
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,080
So that doesn't necessarily translate very well.

1988
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,600
What they end up doing is that the up key ends up being your jump.

1989
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,600
So when I say key, of course, here I am playing in an emulator.

1990
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,400
So it is mapped to a key because I'm playing on the keyboard.

1991
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:25,680
But if you were to be playing with an actual joystick, I'm sure you can imagine if you were actually using up to jump, that might control a little weird compared to what you're used to when you're actually playing on an NES where, you know, you have A and B and B is your run and A is your jump.

1992
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:29,160
And you can kind of, I think, I think control things a little bit better that way.

1993
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:37,040
So having up as your jump, I'm sure if you're using a legitimate Commodore joystick, it's probably going to it's going to cause you to probably jump at times you don't really want to.

1994
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,760
But for emulation, it works pretty well.

1995
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,200
It is interesting to note that the great Gianna sisters actually did the same thing.

1996
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:50,640
Great Gianna sisters used up for its jump as well, because, of course, there's only one fire button.

1997
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,560
But in the Gianna sisters, you couldn't run.

1998
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,720
So controlling this is your run button slash oops.

1999
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,160
You'll notice I threw one fireball before I screwed up there while I was talking and I threw my one fireball.

2000
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,520
And that was that was the control key that did that as well.

2001
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,120
I think that did that shell just clip through those monsters.

2002
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,840
I didn't even pay enough attention there.

2003
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:14,560
So it's probably not a perfect oops, I died.

2004
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,120
Not a perfect translation.

2005
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,840
If it was perfect, I wouldn't have died right then.

2006
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,400
But still, again, very impressive considering the technology, how faithful it is.

2007
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:23,960
I mean, sure.

2008
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:32,560
It's, you know, those question mark blocks are a little, you know, not quite the same fidelity that you would see on the NES, the goombas especially.

2009
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,160
You can probably see how different they are.

2010
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,040
Let's see if I can remember.

2011
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:40,960
And notice that slowdown when there's all the animations of the blocks, everything.

2012
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,920
Let's see if I can probably really slow it down with the superstar here.

2013
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,320
Oh, yeah, there's that slowdown about that.

2014
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,960
I'm sure you could do some tricks in the emulator to help the game through some of that.

2015
01:46:56,360 --> 01:47:02,480
I'm just trying to make a beeline for the end here because I want to see if we can get the warp zone in this version.

2016
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:08,720
But I think since this is a pretty faithful adaptation, I'm expecting to see the warp zone.

2017
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,440
So let's take the lift up there.

2018
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,160
And there we are running on top, running on top.

2019
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,360
We did it.

2020
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:20,200
We worked level four because every does anyone ever pick two or three?

2021
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,400
I'm sure somebody out there is raising their hand.

2022
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,680
Well, I did it this one time.

2023
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,480
Most people would just want to go straight to world four to continue on.

2024
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:37,240
But anyway, yeah, I mean, you know, considering that some versions of Mario that were on the Commodore 64 previously might have hacked like the first four stages or something.

2025
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:46,320
The fact that somebody went out there and actually reproduced the complete game is pretty awesome and is pretty likely to be shut down by Nintendo already.

2026
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,880
But you know what they say once on the Internet, always on the Internet.

2027
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:57,160
So I can't exactly tell you where to get this yourself, but I'm sure if you know where to look, you'll find it pretty easy.

2028
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:01,560
Anyway, there it is, a look at the ROM that everybody's talking about this week.

2029
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:07,000
Very old game, very old system, but very cool to see these types of things remade.

2030
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,240
You know, you love it when you see things like Halo on the Atari 2600.

2031
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,560
Come on, demakes are awesome.

2032
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,400
Anyway, that's going to do it for me.

2033
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,960
Let's go back to the studio live.

2034
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,880
Let's go back to the studio live.

2035
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,320
Thank you, me, for that look at Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64.

2036
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,720
Some comments in the chat.

2037
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,160
Orange Right says, this is cool.

2038
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,640
Quest Buster says, the person behind this did a really good job.

2039
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,600
Yeah, for sure.

2040
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,320
Darticuia says, I go three just to get all the one ups.

2041
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,240
Oh, OK.

2042
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,280
Yeah. When I was doing the warp zone there at the end, you can get all those one ups in world three.

2043
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,640
OK, fair enough. And some conversation there.

2044
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,680
Darticuia asking about the C64 Mini.

2045
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,120
Bobby Block was saying, I haven't tried it yet, but I have it.

2046
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,120
The C64 Mini and this ROM.

2047
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:54,880
Bobby also adding, I'm still skeptical if Nintendo actually sent a C&D or if they just said they got C&D to get press.

2048
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,880
Who knows? Well, if that was the case, it worked, that's for sure.

2049
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:03,880
But as I kind of referenced earlier, you know, Nintendo would certainly be well within their rights to do it.

2050
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,600
But it is still an impressive feat nonetheless.

2051
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:13,200
Anyway, speaking of like cease and desist and so forth, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here in a moment.

2052
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:21,120
But in the past few weeks at this part of the show, Dark Sakura has usually promoted a podcast or hyped something up.

2053
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,960
I don't know if you have something this week, but I have something.

2054
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:25,280
Why don't you go ahead and do it?

2055
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,480
Well, because I have something on the other side of it.

2056
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:32,760
I have something. I have something I'm going to demote this week and tell you what.

2057
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,400
Go for it. Oh, Loki has something to promote?

2058
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,600
OK, it's not really promotion, but we'll just go ahead and say it.

2059
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,760
Happy birthday, Naoki.

2060
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,200
It's his birthday today.

2061
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,920
OK, well, I'm all about promoting Naoki.

2062
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:53,920
Naoki of course, from Konami, who did pretty much all the in-house music in the early DDR and our roots in the old school dance dance revolution.

2063
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,520
We did. We got to meet him once.

2064
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,040
I think actually I think I met him more than once.

2065
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,720
I met him once at that. You and I met him at that Konami thing where they unveiled Supernova.

2066
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,080
Right. Because people don't know Loki was like the first person outside Konami to play Supernova in the U.S.

2067
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,960
And let's see.

2068
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,320
Also, and that was second.

2069
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,200
And what was going to say?

2070
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:16,040
Oh, E3 that year, that year they did the Kinect game, whatever that thing was called.

2071
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:19,800
It was like the Para Para sorta with the Kinect was there that year.

2072
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,760
Was that also the year like I just pretty much followed around Igarashi the whole time?

2073
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,440
Yes. Dance Dance Evolution.

2074
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,400
But like, yeah, I remember like everyone's like, oh, my God, Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.

2075
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,920
I'm like, oh, my God, Supernova, who cares about your Super Metal Gear Solid 3?

2076
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:34,320
I don't want to play that.

2077
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,600
Everyone's like, I'm not playing that.

2078
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,640
I think there was a particular reason we were because, you know, we did.

2079
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,760
That was like the first time you and I got invited to something.

2080
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,240
And you were, of course, I say you and I, but Jamie just had a conflict with the work or something and couldn't go.

2081
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:53,480
We were all invited. But like you and I, we had to like sign stuff and like all this thing, because like that was

2082
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,960
the first big thing we got to do.

2083
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,920
And I think because that's what they were showing and they knew who we were.

2084
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:03,720
Yes. And then then we also learned that apparently even though we all signed an NDA, everybody,

2085
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,960
they had deals with certain outlets to break that NDA early because, you know, we're not IGN.

2086
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,480
Yeah, we got a lesson in some harsh realities in the industry.

2087
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:16,960
Anyway, I want to I actually I wanted to talk about this at some point.

2088
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,760
So I'll talk about it during our segment. We usually talk about other podcasts.

2089
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,920
So there's a big app that came out this week and they've been doing a lot of advertising.

2090
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,600
And you might have heard about this on some different like websites and stuff.

2091
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,360
And I really didn't want to name it by name to give it any additional press.

2092
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:36,800
But I think I'm going to have to just to tell you to basically stay away from it and why I'm really unhappy with what they're doing.

2093
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,640
It is called Luminary. And you've probably seen this on some billboards.

2094
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,440
You've probably seen about it on Twitter and so forth.

2095
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:47,480
And basically what they're trying to do is they're wanting to be the Netflix of podcasting.

2096
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:51,120
So they are basically going to be offering a variety of podcasts.

2097
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:57,480
And, you know, when they first kind of pitched it, they said they're going to be putting out like what, like 40 celebrity podcasts.

2098
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:01,000
So like, I don't like Trevor Noah has a podcast on there.

2099
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:07,080
John Cameron Mitchell, who was Hedwig and the Angry Inch and all that, has a show on there.

2100
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,800
Lena Dunham, sigh, has a podcast on there.

2101
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,760
So it's this, you know, new thing.

2102
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,880
And they want to charge you basically a monthly fee to listen to these premium podcasts.

2103
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:25,640
And that was my first problem when I first heard about this thing, as I said, well, OK, y'all, that's not like that's not really a podcast.

2104
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:28,280
Now, if you're charging for it, right, you're charging people eight dollars a month.

2105
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:31,160
That's like an audible dot com competitor.

2106
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:38,720
That's what you are. You're an audio, you know, you're selling songs like iTunes or or one of those types of sites.

2107
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,880
You're not really podcast when you're charging for it.

2108
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:46,560
But whatever, because I kind of looked at the whole thing and I was just like, I don't know, I whatever.

2109
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,920
We'll see what they do. But then the app came out this week.

2110
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:59,000
And guess what, y'all? They added a ton of free podcasts, regular podcasts to this app without asking.

2111
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,800
Really? Mm hmm.

2112
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,320
Guess guess who's there?

2113
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,080
Us? Mm hmm.

2114
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,760
Well, we send them a cease and desist.

2115
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,880
And we can we've you know, and I've I've thought about doing it.

2116
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,360
Here's why I haven't done it yet.

2117
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:16,160
I'll get to that point in a minute here, because here and I'm going to tell you why this pisses me off.

2118
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:23,840
Because luminaries come from this perspective where they're saying, oh, well, all these free providers, we're just kind of like helping them get out there and all that stuff.

2119
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,160
And, you know, they're we want to we want to spread their their free providers and all this stuff.

2120
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,640
And I'm like, hold on, hold, wait, wait a fucking minute.

2121
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:35,320
That's not what you're doing. You're using us to promote your patient.

2122
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,000
They're not giving us any money.

2123
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,640
Exactly. Here we pay to do what we do.

2124
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,040
Are you saying Lena Dunham is more special than I am?

2125
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,080
Fuck you.

2126
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,160
That's what I have to say about that.

2127
01:53:48,640 --> 01:54:04,080
Like, I'm sorry, you're not going to use this show or any show to promote some type of like fee based gateway, as if there's these podcasts that are more premium, that are greater than others for whatever reason, because one, that's not a podcast.

2128
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:12,400
You're selling a fucking audio book, audio, you're selling a spoken song, you're selling not a stand up comedy album, but you know, something like that.

2129
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,600
We need to do a cease and desist and publish it.

2130
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,960
Well, girl, it's start the drama.

2131
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:24,600
It's done been started, like, you know, large podcasts that are already free, like Joe Rogan and all that stuff.

2132
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,000
I have already sent those types and gotten delisted from the platform.

2133
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:32,560
The only reason I haven't held up from anyone for a while or yet, as I've said, you know what, I'm going to give him seven days.

2134
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,040
I'm going to give him seven days to say, how am I going to get paid?

2135
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,920
Here's that. And I have never asked for money from doing all this stuff.

2136
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:49,000
But in my opinion, Luminary, if you are going to use free shows to promote Lena fucking Dunham, then I want to know, where's my cut?

2137
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,880
I'm going to tweet them right now.

2138
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,160
You and hundreds of other people.

2139
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:58,480
It's going to be like, where's the, when are you going to pay us back for the money that we put into our show if you're going to put it out there for free?

2140
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:04,040
So anyway, please, when you see these types of things go on out there, please question them.

2141
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:07,280
And when you see them like, I just, that's the part that pisses me off.

2142
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:11,840
They're using all of these free shows and they're saying, oh, it's promotion and all this stuff.

2143
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:20,960
And we didn't even get into the part where they were like, for a hot minute before they really got in hot water, they were like streaming it to their own servers.

2144
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:25,160
And like, so that people, we couldn't even track stats if people were listening for Luminary.

2145
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:25,640
Good.

2146
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,960
I don't think anybody is listening through Luminary.

2147
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:30,600
And I don't think, I think they've fucked this launch so hard.

2148
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,280
They had like a million dollars investment or something like that.

2149
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,280
They've fucked this so hard.

2150
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,520
They're going to, they're going to go under.

2151
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:37,400
Loki, I'm sorry, you look like you were dying to chime in.

2152
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:37,760
I'm sorry.

2153
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,760
Oh no, I wasn't chime in.

2154
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:44,120
I just looking at their website, which seems stupid.

2155
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,080
We give you access to all these podcasts.

2156
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:47,240
I'm sorry.

2157
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,320
Except you're not really giving people access to the podcast.

2158
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,680
You can download their app on the app stores, which you can also download podcasts on those app stores.

2159
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,480
I'm not really sure.

2160
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:57,800
That's stupid.

2161
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,440
Here's what I said.

2162
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,480
If you were listening, OLR, then you need to ask for our permission.

2163
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:05,480
If you were going to use us to make money for your paid content, then you need to pay us for our work.

2164
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:06,920
Fair enough.

2165
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,200
That's, that's all I'm asking.

2166
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,040
Absolutely.

2167
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,680
So anyway, I'm going to tag it with, uh, respect podcasters.

2168
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:23,320
I do want to remind everybody the official outlets for this show where we have asked to be listed are iTunes podcasts and Google play podcasts.

2169
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:27,000
There are some other apps out there as well, uh, that also carry the show.

2170
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,960
And because they're not charging you money and they're, you know, for, you know, a tune in, I think actually is, would be one I would endorse as well because we did ask to be on there.

2171
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:36,160
Uh, and there's a few others that aren't coming to me in the moment.

2172
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:45,880
Um, but, uh, and I, I, uh, I have heard the request to get this on Spotify and I'm there's, I, I actually am a Spotify premium person myself.

2173
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:50,840
I have no problem with Spotify and asking to be on there, uh, will be fine.

2174
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,960
It's just a, I need to do some behind the scenes changes before we do that move there.

2175
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,000
It's, um, nothing important or anything, but just it's, I don't want to do that yet.

2176
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:03,040
Well, I do have a podcast to promote and they are Sacramento podcast.

2177
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:03,640
Okay, cool.

2178
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:03,880
Yes.

2179
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,560
Let's send this on a positive note, please.

2180
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:09,920
It's called our tour, our turn gaming for everyone.

2181
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,520
It's our turn podcast.com.

2182
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:21,760
Looks like they do board games and tabletop gaming, and they also highlight, um, and encourage the views and accomplishments of women, um, queer people and people of color.

2183
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:29,200
So definitely, and I'm, I'm just going to say queer people instead of the acronyms, just because we're all a little queer.

2184
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:33,120
So, um, but yeah, definitely give them a check out.

2185
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:41,160
They've been here for a little bit, not as long as us, cause we old, but, um, I found them through, um, through, uh, brief.

2186
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:44,280
So definitely check them out.

2187
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,400
I miss her.

2188
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,720
I hope she comes back to the show someday.

2189
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:47,600
All right.

2190
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,600
She's doing mommy stuff.

2191
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,080
I know.

2192
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:49,440
I know.

2193
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:52,360
Hopefully she can get a break from that at some point when the kids 18.

2194
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,040
All right.

2195
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,080
We'll, we'll still be here.

2196
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:54,640
All right.

2197
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,800
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news.

2198
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:57,200
Loki.

2199
01:57:58,600 --> 01:57:59,000
All right.

2200
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,880
Well, Sega ages is doing some more games for the switch platform.

2201
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:21,560
Um, on the eShop right now, you can actually find Sega ages, Virtua racing, and they've got some pretty cool features in here, including they've upped the FPS of the single and a two player modes to 60 FPS, which is, you know, far better than it actually ran originally.

2202
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:34,360
And then, um, they also have for anything above that, when that can be anything from three to eight players on one console, you can actually do split screen there and that's a six or 30 FPS.

2203
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,480
But, uh, looks, it's kind of funny the way they have the screen set up for that.

2204
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,600
You like, it's literally just like three by three by two.

2205
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:47,280
So, um, pretty neat, but yeah, you can check that out.

2206
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:52,440
Um, I wonder if it's going to be coming out over here as well, but you know, we can get the eShop stuff as well.

2207
01:58:52,520 --> 01:59:02,080
I think if you have a way to purchase that stuff, um, and then of course we have a date now for shakedown Hawaii, which is a game I'm looking forward to.

2208
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:10,920
It is the kind of followup to retro city rampage, and it's going to be coming out on May 7th for $20 on PlayStation four switch.

2209
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:11,800
And guess what?

2210
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,720
That system that everybody seems to forget about the Vita, it is coming out there as well.

2211
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:22,680
And they're also going to be doing a physical version of, uh, retro city rampage as well on May 3rd.

2212
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:26,800
Um, and you can get that for $29.99.

2213
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:27,880
It's going to be limited though.

2214
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:31,080
Only 4,800 units are going to be available for that.

2215
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,320
Um, I am looking forward to this.

2216
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,200
This one's actually, you see the retro city rampage is more like an NES GTA game.

2217
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,320
In fact, that's actually how it started originally.

2218
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:44,120
They were trying to create a GTA game and like an NES style.

2219
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:51,400
Well, actually it was GTA on the NES, but then they found out that the system couldn't handle what they wanted to do.

2220
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:56,800
So they ended up making a GTA style game on, um, PC and stuff.

2221
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:02,000
And now this one's like a super Nintendo style 16 bit game, but same type of stuff.

2222
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:02,960
It looks awesome.

2223
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,520
All right.

2224
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:13,920
Well, uh, speaking of things that have limited runs, um, the, uh, the company limited run, uh, games has announced that they're going to be putting out a limited physical runs of

2225
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:19,280
luminous remastered, which of course was the, uh, you know, redone version of the first luminous game.

2226
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,600
Uh, they're going to be putting out a special limited run on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch.

2227
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,480
So if you are looking for a physical media version of this, uh, that would be pretty awesome.

2228
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:36,360
There's going to be a regular release and a $140 ultimate edition for the ultimate luminous fan, which I may or may not be.

2229
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:36,920
So I don't know.

2230
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:37,960
I don't know 140 bucks.

2231
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:42,880
That's a lot of money, but they're trying to tempt you with a special light up presentation box.

2232
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:43,320
Ooh.

2233
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,080
Vinyl soundtrack.

2234
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,360
All right.

2235
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:45,880
That's pretty good.

2236
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:52,600
A key chain, an enamel pin, and a collector's certificate hand signed by Mizuguchi himself.

2237
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:53,400
Ooh.

2238
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,320
So kind of charging for an autograph as well.

2239
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,000
That's pretty good.

2240
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:58,120
Anyway, uh, the pre-orders already went up.

2241
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,760
They went up on April 26.

2242
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,320
I'm assuming it's probably already sold out.

2243
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:02,200
It probably went out like that.

2244
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,840
So even if I wanted it, it's probably already gone.

2245
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:08,480
Uh, so, um, yeah, that's pretty cool that they're actually doing that though.

2246
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:16,400
Um, also something that was announced that people have to look forward to persona five, scramble the Phantom strikers.

2247
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:29,640
This is a game that is going to be coming out for PlayStation four and switch, which is interesting because they still haven't confirmed an official release of play a persona five for switch, but whatever there's going to be this, at least this is going to be a Musso type of game.

2248
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,480
It was announced during a persona concert.

2249
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,200
Uh, they showed a trailer for it.

2250
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,480
So yeah, it's going to be interesting.

2251
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:37,680
That means like, uh, what that's, um, what's the, what's the Musso game?

2252
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:38,880
Dynasty warriors.

2253
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,240
That's it.

2254
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,800
The one was like kill the mobs and mobs and mobs of people.

2255
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,920
So that's going to be kind of fun that a persona is getting a version of that.

2256
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,320
I'm sure, uh, fans will check that out as an aside.

2257
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:53,720
It's neat that persona gets all these kind of like side games, you know, because there's dancing games and you know, so on.

2258
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,600
Anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?

2259
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:00,000
Um, well more Fortnite bullshit, but this is good bullshit.

2260
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,440
Um, Thanos is back.

2261
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:14,240
Um, so you will be, this is a tie in with end game, but you will be able to, um, control the Chitauri from the movie, from the first movie or whoever came with them.

2262
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,840
I didn't really watch all the way through the, whatever.

2263
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:20,760
But anyway, the reality stone, uh, gives you health and shields doubled.

2264
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:25,320
Uh, the soul stone is siphon for Thanos.

2265
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,840
Uh, mind stone is jump height doubled.

2266
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,440
Space stone is ground pound AOE tripled.

2267
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:37,160
Time stone is knockback added to each hit and power stone is laser damage power.

2268
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,200
And an awesome game on the Dreamcast.

2269
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:39,720
Yes.

2270
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:50,200
And then in other news, uh, Walmart in Canada, uh, basically they had a little bit of fun with the Rage 2 League with a special pre-order box art.

2271
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:58,680
And, um, it says, uh, written around it, like incorrect key art, wrong font, and all all caps.

2272
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:01,000
And it was just pretty funny.

2273
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,040
They're saying like, here, hey Walmart, Canada, here's some, it's basically pretty funny.

2274
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:10,120
So, um, cause they had, uh, unexpectedly leaked the list of games.

2275
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:13,320
And so they're having fun with themselves.

2276
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:22,640
So it's actually, um, the Walmart is the, uh, the, the thing where they were called out for it.

2277
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,400
So it's pretty funny.

2278
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,440
That's it.

2279
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:29,640
All right.

2280
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:34,240
And let's talk a little bit about what is coming out.

2281
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:40,800
Not much because we're in April and it's, it's pretty, pretty slow at this time of year.

2282
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:49,480
So, uh, we've got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age that's coming out on Switch and Xbox One and U-Boat on PC.

2283
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:50,760
And that is it.

2284
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,920
Enjoy your Final Fantasy 12.

2285
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,240
Um, if I'm not mistaken, it is golden week in Japan this week, if I'm not mistaken.

2286
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:06,800
So it's, um, it is the, as far as releases go, there really isn't anything you can get some third party peripherals and things like that.

2287
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,400
Um, but that is really about the new stuff.

2288
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,960
I think last week was your last big week.

2289
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,480
So Japan is now I really got nothing to note this week as far as release dates.

2290
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:21,880
Um, in the UK on 29th, uh, there's Final Fantasy, uh, 12, the Zodiac Age fade to silence.

2291
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:27,680
Um, also on May 2nd is wasteland two uppers.

2292
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,440
Um, sounds like a party there.

2293
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:34,400
Um, the legend of heroes trails of cold steel too.

2294
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:35,440
And that's it.

2295
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:38,920
All right.

2296
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,880
Let's go to the mail bag then I guess.

2297
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:41,520
Full of cookies.

2298
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:42,200
There's no mail.

2299
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,520
There's no emails?

2300
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,560
No, it's a promo thing.

2301
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:48,640
Oh, well then that's, yeah, we don't, we don't read spam on here.

2302
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:55,080
Um, but, um, well that means we get to talk about Drag Race if we didn't get any emails that participate at orangeonshooter.com.

2303
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:56,360
Silky needs to go.

2304
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,880
I didn't watch this last week.

2305
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:59,760
I'm only up through snatch game.

2306
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,680
Who do you want to win at this point?

2307
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:09,000
Well, I don't know, cause Evie kind of disappointed me.

2308
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:16,240
Um, and knowing what I know about this episode, I don't really don't want to spoil much, but I'm still down for Evie.

2309
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:25,360
Um, my prediction for top four, and this is going to be excluding Silky from anything that exists.

2310
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:28,000
So, I mean, I'm sure that bitch is going to make it, but I don't want to name her.

2311
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:43,480
As I'm thinking Evie, Brooklyn, um, Vanjie and, um, she's probably going to be there, but I'm actually going to more, cause I don't know.

2312
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,400
They're not, she's not saying enough good about Nina.

2313
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:48,440
And I think they might have a kind of a bone to pick.

2314
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,880
I don't know.

2315
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,440
Just that she's still too quirky or something.

2316
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,120
People don't really respect the campy queens.

2317
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:56,360
I'm getting really irritated with Drag Race and the judging this season.

2318
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:58,120
It's really inconsistent.

2319
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:09,240
And I really feel like queens like Nina and sugar cane really notably like I, I find that I really stand sugar cane and like she's completely invisible on the show.

2320
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:11,320
And it's like, it's at the point where it's pissing me off.

2321
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:17,560
Like, especially for somebody that had like the best dress in the show's history that came down the runway a couple of weeks ago.

2322
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:21,320
Like it's just, it blows my mind that she's just getting slept on completely.

2323
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:23,320
And it's just like Naomi Smalls and all stars.

2324
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:30,160
But the other, the other thing too, though, is that, I mean, if you think about though in the past queens that like, they're like, oh, you need to change your silhouette.

2325
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:30,720
You need to do different.

2326
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:31,480
You need to do different.

2327
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:35,560
What bitch didn't change her look at all and is the best winner ever?

2328
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,120
Bianca Del Rio.

2329
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:37,400
No.

2330
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:41,800
Anyway, if you want us to not talk about Drag Race next week, you can send us an email.

2331
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:44,240
Participate at orange lounge trader.com.

2332
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:47,800
Cause otherwise we're just going to assume you want to hear more about our opinions on Drag Race.

2333
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:50,200
So from there, Loki, you can wake up and get it.

2334
02:06:50,200 --> 02:07:02,000
I'm just saying, uh, Sia Tabiri says, I think Nina has been doing much better than Vangie, but I feel like Vangie has been carried a lot and I agree Vangie has been carried a lot, but she's so addictive.

2335
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:03,560
Like she's just her personality.

2336
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,440
You just want to be a friend.

2337
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:05,880
They compared her to Alyssa Edwards.

2338
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:12,200
She's got that Alyssa factor where she could be a hot fucking mess and still you want to pay attention.

2339
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,200
She's going to get her own show.

2340
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,440
Anyway, I promise we move on.

2341
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:15,080
So let's move on.

2342
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:15,640
All right.

2343
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,200
Uh, Loki.

2344
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,120
Yeah, we'll just spoil it.

2345
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,200
And Game of Thrones instead next time.

2346
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:22,680
Just kidding.

2347
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:23,320
I wouldn't do that.

2348
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:24,880
All right.

2349
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,960
So let's talk a little bit about, um, some new stuff coming to Overwatch.

2350
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:29,880
So this is kind of cool.

2351
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:36,960
They have this new Overwatch workshop mode, which allows you to create new game types in Overwatch itself.

2352
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:42,160
So I guess kind of, um, fun ways to just mix up some of the rules in the game.

2353
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:47,600
So one example map that they create or game mode is basically the floor is lava.

2354
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:53,840
So if you are, I'm sorry, they're calling it molten floor, but you know, the rules of the floor is lava.

2355
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,880
So you touch the ground, you catch on fire and that's the rule.

2356
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:04,560
And so, um, there's a bunch of other fun things you can do and different, um, stuff you can script out in there.

2357
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,520
But it's pretty neat.

2358
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:12,520
I saw another example where there was one where people have to do emotes to kill each other or insta kill people or something like that.

2359
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,840
So that was something that was interesting.

2360
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:19,320
Um, but I'm curious to see what kind of fun game modes come out of this.

2361
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:22,800
You know, maybe I should fire up Overwatch. I haven't played it in a long time.

2362
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,600
Yeah, I haven't played Overwatch in a hot minute either.

2363
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,560
And, uh, this kind of sounds interesting though.

2364
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:34,920
I like, I like these, um, there's just, it's just begging to like have these silly YouTubes and silly contests and competitions.

2365
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:37,080
This is really right up your alley is what I'm saying.

2366
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:38,800
Yeah.

2367
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:42,160
I mean, it sounds interesting some of the stuff they're going to be able to do with this.

2368
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,760
So I can't wait to see in a couple of weeks what we have.

2369
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:46,560
All right.

2370
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:52,560
Well, if I'm making things in Overwatch isn't up your alley, perhaps making things in Super Mario Brothers is.

2371
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:55,160
Uh, I know I'm looking forward to Super Mario Maker 2.

2372
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:56,720
I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well.

2373
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:57,600
And we have a date.

2374
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,800
Mario Maker 2 will be out on June 28th.

2375
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,640
It was announced in a tweet this past week.

2376
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,120
Hey, that's my birthday week essentially.

2377
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,600
Cause my birthday is June 26.

2378
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:07,840
It's not too early to start planning.

2379
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,000
It's a y'all birthday week.

2380
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,480
So, uh, what do you mean?

2381
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,120
You and Alan?

2382
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:15,200
Uh, Alan is two weeks after me, so close because he's July 8th.

2383
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:20,160
We usually celebrate together around the 4th of July makes a really good time to celebrate.

2384
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:28,080
So anyway, um, Mario Maker 2 was dated and, uh, apparently some other things that were announced is that there's going to be a stylist.

2385
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:32,000
So it's going to be a special official stylist that will go with Super Mario Maker 2.

2386
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:35,040
It's going to be a pre-order bonus in Japan and Europe.

2387
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,160
Uh, we haven't heard about the U S yet, but we're going to hope that that's a thing.

2388
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:40,960
Uh, we haven't heard anything official yet.

2389
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,240
I don't see why would they leave us out?

2390
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:43,040
That'd be very mean.

2391
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:43,480
I don't know.

2392
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:53,200
But, uh, what should be noted about Europe and the release of Super Mario Maker 2 over there is that it's going to be bundled with a year of Switch Online.

2393
02:09:53,400 --> 02:10:00,920
If you pre-order Mario Maker 2 in Europe, uh, you get the online, um, Switch Online as well for a whole year.

2394
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:06,080
I don't believe Europe is getting the Twitch Prime thing that we're getting here.

2395
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,400
Granted Twitch Prime isn't free.

2396
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:17,520
But it is interesting that maybe it's a different way to kind of at least give that same perk to the folks over in Europe where they can get a year of a Switch Online.

2397
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,320
So there is that.

2398
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:20,840
Um, you guys looking forward to Mario Maker 2?

2399
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,360
I know I am.

2400
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:22,280
I'm definitely picking that up.

2401
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,840
That's like a day one release for me.

2402
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:25,040
Uh, what about you, Logie?

2403
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,760
Yeah, I'm getting to day one.

2404
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:27,480
Definitely.

2405
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:29,720
All right.

2406
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

2407
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,400
I have a mouthful of cookie again.

2408
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:35,160
I make some good fucking cookies though.

2409
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:35,440
Right.

2410
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:41,320
Anyway, it'd also help if I had the right window pulled open.

2411
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:49,520
So, um, at any rate, Kingdom Hearts 3, um, uh, Remind DLC has been announced with new secret endings.

2412
02:10:50,200 --> 02:11:01,520
Um, so basically, um, it was announced during the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra World of Tress concert that, um, uh, Nomura, uh, announced that there would be additional DLC.

2413
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:04,080
It's similar to a final mix thing.

2414
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:14,440
And the scenario is called Rii colon mind, and it's going to have a limited cut episode and bosses, optional English voiceovers for the Japanese version, a secret episode and a boss.

2415
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:18,800
You'll also receive a new form and a new key blade as a free download.

2416
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:24,800
Um, no date yet, but, um, you know, the last thing that we got was the free critical mode.

2417
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,640
So that was for more challenging, more challenging gameplay.

2418
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:29,720
There you go.

2419
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:31,200
All right.

2420
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:36,360
Um, so this is kind of a cool thing, especially since we are fans of Katamari Damacy.

2421
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:45,200
So we talked, um, probably months ago about, I think it was a few months ago about this website called noclip.website.

2422
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:50,000
That allowed you to kind of fly through different 3d games to kind of check out the levels.

2423
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,400
So, um, they had, you know, I think there was some of the, I want to say F-Zero was in there, but I know like they had a, maybe it was Wipeout.

2424
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,440
Several different maps that you can fly through.

2425
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:12,320
Well, one of the games that the creator of the website, Jasper wanted to have included on there, but was unable to figure out the file format was Katamari.

2426
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:25,240
And of course he offered a $500 bounty to any buddy who could reverse engineer, uh, the Katamari Damacy file formats to be able to port that into his website.

2427
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:32,160
Well, thankfully now that has happened and he was able to get, um, the data in there.

2428
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:41,960
So now you can actually fly through, um, several of the levels from the game, thanks to some help from some friendly modders.

2429
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:44,080
So that's pretty cool.

2430
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:47,680
This is me now that we're gonna get modded levels because I want modded levels.

2431
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:48,920
I'm hoping.

2432
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:50,840
I sure hope so.

2433
02:12:50,840 --> 02:13:00,760
I think that would be, I'm surprised that hasn't already happened where Katamari Damacy PC has been like altered to add these new levels and things, but this, this maybe is a step in that direction.

2434
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,080
I don't know.

2435
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:02,760
Hopefully.

2436
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:06,520
All right.

2437
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:09,320
Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up discord.

2438
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:15,680
So if you want to join us live on the show, you want to talk to us, uh, just join our discord server, vog network.com.

2439
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:20,960
That's vog network or voicegeeksnetwork.com slash discord, uh, to get your invite.

2440
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:21,880
And it's all free.

2441
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:22,520
It's discord.

2442
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,120
I think many of you are using it at this point.

2443
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:30,560
Um, you can join in there and then you just head on over to the green room and just a shout out in the orange on studio channel, what you want to talk about.

2444
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:35,560
Uh, and we'll be pulling you guys on air, uh, to talk with us if you are interested.

2445
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,640
So anyway, um, before we get there though, I want to talk about Snapchat.

2446
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:41,120
That's right.

2447
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:41,480
Snapchat.

2448
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:44,160
Do you guys actually use Snapchat at all?

2449
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:45,600
Probably, okay, probably not.

2450
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:53,000
I think it's more a thing that kids, even I barely use Snapchat, but it's because I found that more people were watching Instagram stories and Snapchat stories.

2451
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,280
So I kinda, I kinda went over there, which by the way, follow me on Instagram.

2452
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,280
It is at Mr.

2453
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,360
Rob Roberts, Mr.

2454
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:58,920
Rob Roberts.

2455
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,200
Anyway.

2456
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:05,160
Um, but you know, Snapchat and bitmoji are like tied together.

2457
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,080
They own each other.

2458
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,240
Have you ever used bitmoji at all?

2459
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:08,680
Is that a thing?

2460
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:09,880
No, I've used bitmoji.

2461
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:16,240
You create silly little avatars of yourself and then you can like copy paste them in, in certain poses and text messages.

2462
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:18,720
My sister uses it all the time when she sends me messages.

2463
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,800
So anyway, interesting.

2464
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:26,040
We've kind of heard rumblings that Snapchat might be doing something involving gaming and perhaps this is a sign of that.

2465
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:32,200
I don't know, but Snapchat earlier this week launched a bitmoji for games SDK.

2466
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:37,960
This will let game developers replace characters with bitmoji.

2467
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:45,920
So that way, if somebody has downloaded that bitmoji and created a little cartoon version of themselves, which that does, now you can insert that in a game.

2468
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:59,920
Essentially, it's basically like the Miis on Nintendo, but what bitmoji is doing and Snapchat as, as the owners of that, what they're doing is basically opening that up to other people to make a game where you would feature the bitmoji as the stars.

2469
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,240
It's kind of, kind of an interesting way to try to push that concept further.

2470
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:15,200
In a little pull quote here, they say, our vision is for gamers to open up their favorite game regardless of what device it's on and easily scan and play to bring their bitmoji directly into the game.

2471
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:26,040
At the option to choose an avatar or character, gamers will be shown a snap code on screen, prompting them to scan the code via Snapchat to link the account and play as your own bitmoji.

2472
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:33,720
So there is support right now for Unity, Unreal and PlayCanvas, which is a British VR company already in Snapchat.

2473
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:38,680
That's, you know, especially what's interesting about that is that essentially they're saying that's not limited to just phones then.

2474
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:44,120
You would be able to do this on like, if you wanted to, I guess, a PlayStation 4 game or a PC game.

2475
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:53,240
And by scanning that link, then it's going to like, it's kind of like when you, I don't know, validate Netflix or something using a device code instead of actually signing in.

2476
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:54,680
So it sounds kind of neat.

2477
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:57,400
I don't know, Loki, you think you think developers may actually use this?

2478
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,800
You think this is a good move for bitmoji?

2479
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,880
I'm sure someone will use it.

2480
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,840
I just don't, I don't know.

2481
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:08,040
I don't think it's going to be like a must have thing.

2482
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:10,000
But I'm sure someone will use it.

2483
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:13,000
Obviously, they think someone's going to use it.

2484
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:20,440
Bonds 006 in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, I actually like that bitmoji concept.

2485
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,320
And Dart Tetsuya says, doesn't Mr.

2486
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,400
Smoosh have an Instagram or am I remembering wrong?

2487
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:25,520
And he does.

2488
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,400
And so does Midna.

2489
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,840
Sia Tabiri got it right.

2490
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:28,760
It's at Mr.

2491
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,280
But the Mr. spelled out for Mr.

2492
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,520
Smoosh, M-I-S-T-E-R Smoosh.

2493
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:34,000
And Midna is at, what is it?

2494
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,680
Middle Patittles, Patittles, Patittles, P-A-T-I-D-D-L-E-S.

2495
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:38,080
There you go.

2496
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,360
Because her nickname is Middles Patittles.

2497
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:39,640
Yeah.

2498
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:39,920
Okay.

2499
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,720
I knew it was like some type of play on that.

2500
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:45,200
So anyway, if you want to follow all the pets of OLR, you can do that.

2501
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:51,640
So, uh, Dart Tetsuya talking about the bitmoji says, remind me of what Nintendo and Microsoft did with their avatars.

2502
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:52,360
Oh yeah, of course.

2503
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,320
Microsoft had the avatar stuff too.

2504
02:16:54,560 --> 02:17:00,800
Couldn't you play like, couldn't you put avatars in, um, the, uh, Xbox XNA games?

2505
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,920
That was the thing you were able to do for a short minute.

2506
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,240
Yeah.

2507
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:06,120
Cause I remember like a lot of the big downloads were avatar based games there.

2508
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:12,440
So, uh, kind of interesting that bitmoji is kind of bringing that back, but not necessarily, uh, just on one platform.

2509
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:13,760
So that's pretty cool.

2510
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:17,920
Anyway, let's open up the listener round table.

2511
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,320
So if you would like to participate with the show, you sure can.

2512
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:23,880
Uh, you can just join our discord server.

2513
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:29,280
Um, you can also, uh, send us a question in chat if you so desire that as an option as well.

2514
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,840
So let me bring up discord here on the computer, uh, while we wait to see if anybody wants to call a Loki.

2515
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:37,400
I don't know if you have any last minute stories, but I'm going to hand you the mic just in case.

2516
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:38,760
Cause I'm trying to multitask here.

2517
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:42,600
And I don't, unfortunately.

2518
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:47,120
So I guess, I guess we'll just have to sit here in silence.

2519
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:53,680
No, I was just reading up on that luminary site and how people are.

2520
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:54,720
Jump and chip on it.

2521
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:56,480
I don't know.

2522
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,640
I think it's going to be a hot flash and then gone.

2523
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,000
I think so too.

2524
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,360
I think they botched it way too hard.

2525
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:06,040
It's a, it's a bummer because they could have partnered with some of us perhaps and maybe been a little more successful.

2526
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:08,360
And it's not even, it's not even about the money.

2527
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:16,120
It's about the whole, like not asking and like, uh, anyway, I don't, I don't want to go out to a negative space.

2528
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:22,400
I'm not going to, but I see you're on a gaming forum, so I assume we're not the only gaming podcast bitching about it.

2529
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:24,200
So I'm sure there's other people as well.

2530
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:32,720
So anyway, some, uh, thoughts and chat, uh, some folks following up on talk about bitmoji, uh, Kaijuto says one versus a hundred use the avatars.

2531
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,560
Um, Tigerlaw says my Samsung Galaxy S9 has a thing called AR emojis.

2532
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:42,400
Basically you take a picture of yourself and the software and the phone will create an emoji based on what you look like.

2533
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:45,400
Um, the 3DS did that too, right?

2534
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:48,360
Like it wasn't great, but it did have a version of that, I think.

2535
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:51,080
And dark Tetsuya says, I think one of the key flings games.

2536
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:51,480
That's right.

2537
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:54,520
The kingdom of keflings or whatever it was called use the avatars.

2538
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:58,840
So the concept of having you in a game certainly isn't new.

2539
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:00,280
I think every me fighters.

2540
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:00,680
Hello.

2541
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:01,720
Everybody knows that one.

2542
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:04,520
So, um, that, that concept isn't particularly new.

2543
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:06,360
Well, I have an announcement.

2544
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:07,200
Okay.

2545
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:15,320
If you are in Northern California for the week end of May 17th, 18th, and 19th, it's a golden state pinball festival.

2546
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,560
Oh, fun.

2547
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,320
We will have some, we should go there.

2548
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,160
Yeah, we should go.

2549
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,720
I went last year after drag con.

2550
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:21,480
It was really fun.

2551
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:22,200
Thankfully.

2552
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,920
It's not the same weekend as drag on.

2553
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,280
We should film some movies there.

2554
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,600
Absolutely.

2555
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:33,600
But I just wanted to make sure to mention it that, uh, I will be all there all day, Friday, half a day, Saturday, and to help wrap up on Sunday.

2556
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:34,720
Where's that?

2557
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:36,240
Is that in Dixon or is that the one?

2558
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:36,680
Lodi.

2559
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:37,280
Lodi.

2560
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:39,160
Like it moved from one place to another.

2561
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:39,360
Okay.

2562
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:44,400
Well, because it used to be the same thing as Pinagogo and then Pinagogo became a separate thing still in Dixon.

2563
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,000
Oh, I didn't even know they were separate.

2564
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:48,720
I don't like to go to Pinagogo because of the corn pollen.

2565
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:49,960
Oh, okay.

2566
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:51,440
And no air conditioning.

2567
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:53,200
This place is air conditioning and has good food.

2568
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:56,800
You know, where I still have never been that we really need to take an OLR trip to.

2569
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,160
And I'm just like, I've shocked myself.

2570
02:19:58,160 --> 02:19:58,640
I haven't been there.

2571
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,360
The Alameda, no, the Alameda pinball.

2572
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:01,720
Yeah.

2573
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:02,040
Yeah.

2574
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,680
I almost went there the other day.

2575
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:04,840
Um, we should go.

2576
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:05,800
Yet.

2577
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:10,240
I went to that place in Vegas and I have it there.

2578
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:14,640
Oh, T-ara took me there to their old location across from the Liberace museum.

2579
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:15,000
That's right.

2580
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,120
Cause they moved and I had played pinball circus.

2581
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,960
Were you here at the week I brought back video or were you not back from your hiatus yet?

2582
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:23,520
I remember probably still in hiatus.

2583
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:29,320
Tiger Claw just sent a picture from his, uh, what his phone, uh, took him.

2584
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:32,120
That's not a bad, it's, it's not bad resemblance.

2585
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:33,880
You don't have enough scruff, Tiger Claw.

2586
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:40,040
I don't know if the thing didn't pick up your facial hair or maybe when you took the picture, but, uh, otherwise it's not too shabby.

2587
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,160
I wonder what mine would look like.

2588
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:43,800
Alan is supposedly getting a new phone.

2589
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,360
Do you know why Alan has to get a new phone?

2590
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:49,480
He dropped his old phone so many times that the screen is flickering so bad.

2591
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:50,960
He can't play Pokemon go.

2592
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,440
So he has to get a new phone.

2593
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:53,960
One of us, one of us.

2594
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:57,240
No, he's, he's not going to jump ship to the apple front.

2595
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,120
I roll so hard.

2596
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:03,000
I don't mind, I don't mind being a bi-phonal household.

2597
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,840
We, we get the best of both worlds here in this house.

2598
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:06,480
It's all good.

2599
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:07,800
All right.

2600
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:14,280
Well, unfortunately nobody is, uh, wanting to call in, so that's okay.

2601
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:25,200
That's, yeah, people are doing that or the, yeah, if it's, if it's not in, uh, movies or TV shows, they're, they're watching the end of the world in one place or another.

2602
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:26,080
So whatever.

2603
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,320
It's fine.

2604
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:29,440
I'm not going to be personally hurt or anything.

2605
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:33,160
No, but anyway, uh, let's, uh, let's get everybody's final thought.

2606
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:40,560
So, um, and wrap up the show first, let me say, um, as I always say here at OLR, thank you so much for downloading this show and checking us out.

2607
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:44,600
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2608
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:51,040
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out there for all the consumes.

2609
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,280
So please help us spread the word.

2610
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:53,080
We really appreciate it.

2611
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:59,440
Hosting on Twitch, adding VOG network to your auto host list goes a long, long way.

2612
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:00,160
Let me tell you.

2613
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:05,880
So if you really, if you don't mind doing that, that is like probably one of the biggest things you could do for us is putting us on your auto host list.

2614
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:07,600
I know some of you have already done that.

2615
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:08,400
So thank you.

2616
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:08,680
Thank you.

2617
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,600
Thank you very much for that.

2618
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:12,040
Um, that's it.

2619
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:13,600
I think it's time for final thoughts.

2620
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,520
So, um, since I have the microphone, I'll start.

2621
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:21,640
My final thought is, um, that music sure died 15 minutes into the show tonight.

2622
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:29,280
I hope, I hope it's not going to be awkward between me and the neighbors now, but you think the party was just planned to be, who ends a party at six 30?

2623
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:35,480
Maybe as a football game or maybe football or baseball or some, maybe they really were going to go watch game of thrones.

2624
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:36,000
I don't know.

2625
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,880
Is it that maybe, maybe who knows?

2626
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:38,600
Maybe that shit.

2627
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:39,360
Yeah, who knows?

2628
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:40,920
Anyway, dark soccer, your final thought.

2629
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:44,640
I've been sitting here reorganizing the time off that I've taken at work.

2630
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,000
Cause I realized I took a whole day when only have five hours.

2631
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:54,400
So I now have my time off planned clear up until, uh, July 1st.

2632
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:57,720
And by the way, I won't be here June 30th for San Francisco pride.

2633
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:09,840
Uh, my final thought is that I'm going to try to work more on games and playing them and making them.

2634
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:11,120
Yeah.

2635
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:17,160
Since you brought up pride before I pulled the plug for tonight's show, are you going to Sacramento pride?

2636
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:18,800
Um, one of the days.

2637
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,840
Did you, did you hear who they have closing the show on Sunday?

2638
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:25,080
I'm so upset that we have this show.

2639
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:28,880
I was actually told on Twitter, cancel the show and go see Lizzo.

2640
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:35,760
And I'm, I thought about, but it's, it's like, it's like two weeks after we're already off for Chicago.

2641
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:37,600
So, or for me, Chicago, you drag con.

2642
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:42,520
Listeners, would you be mad at Rob for going to see Lizzo?

2643
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:44,320
No, here's the, here's the, here's the, no, no, don't answer that.

2644
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:44,720
Don't answer that.

2645
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:48,360
Because the reality is we're going to be in Sacramento heat by June.

2646
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:51,640
All those people, all that heat outside.

2647
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,680
It's just, it's not the environment for me.

2648
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:54,000
Girl.

2649
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,280
That's why you sit in the Depot and lean out the window.

2650
02:23:57,320 --> 02:23:58,800
Cause you will have a view of this.

2651
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,040
Oh no, that's right.

2652
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:01,840
Because it's not the rainbow festival.

2653
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,480
It's going to be on the lawn.

2654
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:03,960
Shit.

2655
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:05,800
So it's fine.

2656
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:07,480
I'm I'm in, I don't like Lizzo that much.

2657
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:09,160
I'm a piece of, Oh, how dare you?

2658
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,480
I love her.

2659
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,200
Well, but she's also a Coachella supporter.

2660
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:13,160
So I'm mad at her.

2661
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,840
Well, yeah, but anyway,

2662
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:20,760
because remember the owner of Coachella supports anti gay charities as well and

2663
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:24,080
has personally donated Coachella proceeds to it.

2664
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:28,200
I went to Coachella in 2002, long before like any of this was brought to light or

2665
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,360
whatever it was.

2666
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:33,720
Um, and it was speaking about hot being in the sun too long and being over it.

2667
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:37,440
If that was Coachella for me, that's why I've only gone once.

2668
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:39,920
But I'll tell you what you're going to say.

2669
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,520
Worth it.

2670
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:40,960
Okay.

2671
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:43,440
When I went to Coachella, I'm sure I've told you this story, but I'm gonna remind

2672
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:46,720
you, it was, uh, the chemical brothers for the last performance.

2673
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:52,960
Bjork was, oh no, get this before Bjork, Susie and the Banshees.

2674
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,280
Ooh, okay.

2675
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:54,800
I would have done that.

2676
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,040
Yeah.

2677
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:55,440
Right.

2678
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,360
Oh, we found your ZZT.

2679
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:03,120
And on that note, that's it.

2680
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:03,640
Everybody.

2681
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:06,960
I wouldn't go to Coachella for Susie because that means that she'd be doing a

2682
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:07,640
tour anyway.

2683
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:08,640
Yeah, that's true.

2684
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,200
And I think they were that year.

2685
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,080
So anyway, that's it.

2686
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:12,600
We're out of here.

2687
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,680
Have a good night, everybody.

2688
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:15,960
Um, what, what would Susie say?

2689
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:17,280
Uh, kiss them for me.

2690
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:17,640
I don't know.

2691
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,120
That's it.

2692
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:20,520
