00:00.000 --> 00:17.200
This week, Big Brother is watching you!

00:17.200 --> 00:20.760
Echoes from deep within your Oculus Rift controller as Facebook deploys another shaggy defense

00:20.760 --> 00:21.760
for its actions.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.480
That's just one media titan getting caught on camera again.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.200
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where

00:27.200 --> 00:32.960
every gamer has a voice.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.720 --> 00:38.520
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 772 for this April the 14th

00:44.960 --> 00:47.040
of 2019.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.040
My name is Rob Roberts here with all you lovely folks over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network

00:52.040 --> 00:56.600
and on our podcast speed to talk about, you know, video games over the next few hours

00:56.600 --> 01:00.760
with my co-hosts across from me sometimes on cam when she feels like it.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.720
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
Sup.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Hi, how are you?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.720
I have the ache of head.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
I meant to put my hat on the screen.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
There we go.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Headaches are not good.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
There we go.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
There's my new hat.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.080
Well, I was hoping you might actually show the, I was hoping you might show the shirt

01:15.080 --> 01:16.240
a little bit too if you're willing.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.520
I, hold on, I'm just reading about Captain Marvel.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.340
Just to tell the story a little bit.

01:23.340 --> 01:28.740
One of our listeners and longtime supporters, Chris, from the Let's Be Legendary podcast,

01:28.740 --> 01:29.740
that's the name, right?

01:29.740 --> 01:34.140
Picked up that shirt for you like 10 years ago and now you're able to put that on again.

01:34.140 --> 01:35.140
You're looking fabulous.

01:35.140 --> 01:36.140
Look at you.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.140
All right.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.140
And I love that you're number zero.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.140
That's fantastic.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.740
So there she is, everybody in the flesh.

01:40.740 --> 01:41.740
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:41.740 --> 01:42.740
Yeah, that's me.

01:42.740 --> 01:43.740
All right.

01:43.740 --> 01:44.740
Don't get used to it.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.300
Well, I hope the headache feels better, but joining, that's what drugs are for.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.720
Joining us also in studio.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.900
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
I do feel better.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.900
Thank you for asking.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.460
Did you have a headache too?

01:55.460 --> 01:57.540
No, I was like, but I am the headache.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.700
Oh, you are the headache.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.700
I see.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.700
Um, I got it.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.780
Rob, you actually brought into the studio tonight and we were playing with this like

02:04.780 --> 02:09.300
I have left trash behind minutes before the Bobby Black Wolf show gave us a call there

02:09.300 --> 02:13.340
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

02:13.340 --> 02:17.420
at the voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash a VOG network right after the Bobby Black

02:17.420 --> 02:18.780
Wolf show.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.520
And you had brought this in this switch and we were checking that out.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.640
So yes, if there's no strap or anything, you do have to just kind of like hold it up, uh,

02:26.640 --> 02:27.640
and uh, do it this way.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.880
But that's, that's the Nintendo Labo.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Yeah.

02:29.880 --> 02:35.440
A lot of their, um, the toys that they require you to use just the basic headset without,

02:35.440 --> 02:38.600
um, any attachments to it and then a controller.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.640
It's a little awkward because they're like, hold on to the headset and hold onto the controller

02:42.640 --> 02:43.640
at the same time.

02:43.640 --> 02:48.680
It's like, uh, that could have been explained better, but well, I wasn't planning to talk

02:48.680 --> 02:52.240
about this at the top of the show and I know it's kind of dabbing into our gaming weeks

02:52.240 --> 02:53.240
a little bit.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.320
You notice it's, it's not on the little side ticker cause I didn't plan to talk about it,

02:56.320 --> 03:00.620
but since you did bring the Nintendo Labo VR, I'm kind of curious of your impressions

03:00.620 --> 03:04.520
having played with it for as much as you have and putting the whole thing together.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.520
I think it's good.

03:05.520 --> 03:10.040
I'm just surprised how well engineered it is because all the stuff that you put together

03:10.040 --> 03:12.040
is just very solid.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.920
It's just the amount of time that must have taken to actually design all that is just

03:15.920 --> 03:18.800
kind of incredible for a bunch of cardboard for a bunch of cardboard.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
Yeah.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.880
It's just, it's really well put together.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.460
I think the thing that's most impressive is that bird attachment.

03:24.460 --> 03:25.460
The bird is pretty cool.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.460
Yeah.

03:26.460 --> 03:27.460
And I don't know, can we show it on Twitch?

03:27.460 --> 03:29.920
And I apologize to folks that are listening to us on the podcast feed, but maybe somebody

03:29.920 --> 03:32.640
will clip this on Twitch for you or something.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.840
Um, because the, the clip stuff on Twitch is, is totally free.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
Oh, you took the beak out.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.840
I'll put the beak back.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.840
Okay.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.620
So put the beak back in because, so there's this bird attachment and when you actually

03:42.620 --> 03:49.480
put in the switch controller into the bird controller thing, which you push down to flap

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
the wings and all this.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.640
It's like a little bird thing.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
So there you go.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.640
Okay.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
So he's put it back together for us.

03:55.640 --> 03:59.320
So, um, I will read some comments in chat real quick because of course, while we tape

03:59.320 --> 04:01.200
live, we'd love to read comments in our chat room.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.320
There you go.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
And so I love that.

04:03.320 --> 04:08.860
So the little, we are, I keep saying we mode, the switch thing becomes like the beak.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.940
And so right now it looks like it's attacking you the way you're flapping the wings.

04:11.940 --> 04:13.000
It's next to you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.160
But that's, that's what it is.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.240
It's that's smart.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.080
That's a very Nintendo kind of thing to do, isn't it?

04:18.080 --> 04:19.080
Yeah.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.080
Yeah.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
Wait, we can't hear you.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.680
You got to remember.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.680
Sorry.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.680
I know you're trying to hold.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.680
Sorry.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
Then they have the camera.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
And then what's kind of cool is they have it actually click like for the lens.

04:27.680 --> 04:34.280
So you can actually, and then it's got, um, it's got the actual camera, the IR stuff facing

04:34.280 --> 04:35.280
outwards.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.080
So Pokemon snap VR confirmed, uh, no, well not right now.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.520
So in this, they have two modes.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.780
So they have one that you can actually take pictures of fish and then when you take pictures

04:44.780 --> 04:49.880
of this thing that I think is supposed to be a cat, but it's this weird alien cat thing.

04:49.880 --> 04:55.340
And then, um, you can take pictures of Mr. Smoosh and unfortunately it fell apart, but

04:55.340 --> 05:00.000
I have a, uh, there's this, it's supposed to be a snorkel.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.200
So it's a snorkel and what's kind of cool is because the infrared camera's facing out

05:05.200 --> 05:10.680
when you wear it, the fish that's closest to you gets this weird human face.

05:10.680 --> 05:17.320
Not, not like we're not talking about like, you know, um, Seaman human face, but it has

05:17.360 --> 05:22.120
like these weird bug eyes and then anything that you do with your head, the fish mimics.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.440
And so you could take pictures of that.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.760
Oh, it's like those emojis on Apple.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.360
It's weird, but yeah, it's, it's, it's silly.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.360
So whatever.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.360
Okay.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.040
So that's, it's just a very Nintendo thing to do.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.160
So tell us about some of the, okay, so you've obviously shown off some of the cardboard

05:37.160 --> 05:38.400
stuff here in studio.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.880
Um, what about like some of the games that are in it and all these like mini, there's

05:41.880 --> 05:43.400
a lot of games in there.

05:43.400 --> 05:48.960
So they have games for each of the like main games for each of the things that you build.

05:48.960 --> 05:54.400
So like the camera, there's, you know, the, um, you know, take pictures of fish.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.520
There's taking pictures of that weird cat thing, but then there's like these little

05:58.520 --> 06:01.720
mini games that they have in this VR, like toy boxing.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.040
So they have like cannon firing stuff.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.360
There's um, like all sorts of weird little things you can like move around and do little

06:11.360 --> 06:12.420
simple things.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.460
They have, I haven't even delved into it.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.940
There's some, they're actually non VR too.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.140
They have like mixed up stuff like pinball and like weird things.

06:19.140 --> 06:23.540
Um, there's like for each of the toys, there's like a bunch of mini games and then there's

06:23.540 --> 06:25.780
a bunch of main games for it as well.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.420
And then there's videos they have in there so you can watch like 3d videos.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.180
Some are really weird, very Japanese.

06:32.180 --> 06:37.540
Um, there's the whole creation stuff.

06:37.540 --> 06:41.100
There's um, there's a lot, there's a lot.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.540
And they even have like, I didn't even delve into it too much by looked at it.

06:44.540 --> 06:47.980
There's like, build your own FPS, build your own adventure thing.

06:47.980 --> 06:49.140
And like, I'm like, what is this?

06:49.140 --> 06:50.740
I saw that in the previews.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.260
There's a ton of stuff in there.

06:52.260 --> 06:57.160
Um, now dark Sakura, you, I know you don't usually do the VR thing because you know,

06:57.160 --> 06:58.520
you get headaches and motion sickness.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.900
You've talked about before, even when playing first person shooters, but you, the curiosity

07:02.900 --> 07:04.740
took over, you had to peak.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.060
So what did you think for the two minutes you did it?

07:07.060 --> 07:13.500
I watched birds swing around on poles and like, like when those little, hold on, like

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
that.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
Yeah.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.540
And then, um, yeah, like cause everyone who's not watching will really see that I did twisty

07:19.540 --> 07:20.540
fingers.

07:20.540 --> 07:25.220
Um, I w I wanted to knock the blocks over that were forming the menu cause I couldn't

07:25.220 --> 07:28.420
get shit to happen, but I was just hitting the wrong button.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.560
No way to be fair.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.700
We rushed through this to try to, and I was feeling really sick even after the first 30

07:34.700 --> 07:35.700
seconds.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.700
Yeah.

07:36.740 --> 07:41.620
And then my eyes like will un-focus on things and then they won't refocus and then it's

07:41.620 --> 07:43.140
instant vertigo.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.620
But I did notice when you sat down, you still said something about, I want to see the breath

07:46.620 --> 07:47.620
of the wild.

07:47.620 --> 07:48.620
Yeah.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.020
I'd still want to like, just look around and breath of the wild, like tourist mode.

07:51.020 --> 07:54.240
I feel like that's what most people are going to do because the breath of the wild thing

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
isn't in it yet.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.240
Right?

07:56.240 --> 07:57.380
No, that doesn't come out until next week.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.380
Two weeks.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.380
Right.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.380
So, uh, and I also don't have breath of the wild.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.980
So, you know, you can use my coffee demo for VR.

08:03.980 --> 08:04.980
You got it.

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
Yeah.

08:06.180 --> 08:10.420
But I imagine most people, like I cannot imagine sitting there trying to actually play breath

08:10.420 --> 08:11.420
of the wild.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.980
I mean, I know you could plug in the joy cons.

08:13.980 --> 08:17.900
Thank you for chat for, you're going to have to, cause there's no way you can hold everything.

08:17.900 --> 08:22.340
I was like, you would, I would be able to even use the, um, the pro controller.

08:22.340 --> 08:24.660
I don't even get sick, emotion sick really.

08:24.660 --> 08:29.860
I mean, well, I don't, I don't like to do VR for more than like 30 minutes.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.720
I just don't like, I have to take a break every now and then, but I think that's kind

08:32.720 --> 08:33.720
of normal.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.660
I think they encourage you to take breaks from for three days.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.700
They say it a lot, even when you're building everything, they're all, why don't you take

08:38.700 --> 08:39.700
a break?

08:39.700 --> 08:40.700
Take a break.

08:40.700 --> 08:41.700
You've been doing this for too long.

08:41.700 --> 08:42.700
Stop.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.700
You earned it.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.700
But anyway, uh, I can only see myself doing the, uh, breath of the wild stuff in short

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
bursts.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.340
Like, like I would go into a temple and be like, Ooh, pretty look around or climb to

08:50.340 --> 08:51.340
the top of a mountain.

08:51.340 --> 08:56.380
Ooh, that's pretty done, you know, but I guess, you know, if it was a relatively easy thing

08:56.380 --> 08:59.800
for Nintendo to implement, which it must've been, uh, then, you know, cool.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.820
It's like added value.

09:00.820 --> 09:05.500
I love when Nintendo puts like new value in like really old titles.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.940
And they've been pretty good about doing this a lot.

09:07.940 --> 09:08.940
Yeah.

09:08.940 --> 09:14.540
So, uh, apparently HBO go crashed from all the people watching that other thing that's

09:14.540 --> 09:15.540
going on tonight.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.540
Uh huh.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.860
So there's already bets as to who dies first.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.860
All right.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.280
Well, let's not, let's not talk about that.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.380
Let's focus on video games, uh, and comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

09:26.380 --> 09:30.080
uh, double O Waldorf, who I'm gonna refer to here.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
What game are we talking about?

09:31.080 --> 09:34.420
The Nintendo Labo, uh, VR experience.

09:34.420 --> 09:39.380
And then breath of the wild, uh, being plugged in there, but I do want to start today's show

09:39.380 --> 09:40.380
kind of like segue.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.820
So we talked about like Nintendo adding these value experiences to really, you know, older

09:44.820 --> 09:45.820
titles.

09:45.820 --> 09:48.440
I want to start with what I had planned to do for the kickoff topic tonight and talk

09:48.440 --> 09:54.940
a little bit about maybe not so great free, not free things in games.

09:54.940 --> 10:00.060
Uh, and this is a trend I think we're seeing, um, it's not unique to this game, but we're

10:00.060 --> 10:02.620
seeing it more often, and this is definitely a big title.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.220
Uh, so Resident Evil 2 got a remake recently.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.380
I know dark soccer, you're a big fan, right?

10:07.380 --> 10:09.800
So I'd be very curious what you think about this.

10:09.800 --> 10:15.740
So apparently, uh, what you can do, uh, is if you want, you can just pay $4.99 and you

10:15.740 --> 10:21.660
can buy in the shop, an in game rewards unlock add on, and this would allow you to unlock

10:21.660 --> 10:26.780
the two extra playable modes, costumes, bonus weapon and art.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
And it should be noted.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.540
All of these things are what you would unlock.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.540
Yeah.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.540
We have them anyway.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.460
Right.

10:34.460 --> 10:35.460
You guys did the same way.

10:35.460 --> 10:39.500
So this is the whole pay $5 to get it now type of thing is you get it anyway.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
Yeah.

10:40.500 --> 10:45.020
But, but if you're impatient and we should point out, it isn't, this is not a trend in

10:45.020 --> 10:46.020
the industry.

10:46.020 --> 10:52.580
You know, it's just, this is, it was either mafia two or the Godfather, I think it was

10:52.580 --> 10:53.580
the Godfather.

10:53.580 --> 11:00.860
I was Godfather on the Godfather because on Xbox 360 you had, um, the cheats that were

11:00.860 --> 11:08.180
in the game where paid DLC versus the PlayStation two and Xbox versions of that game.

11:08.180 --> 11:12.740
The cheats were button presses that you would do like a combination of button presses, unlock

11:12.740 --> 11:19.280
different cheats, but they've decided EA, of course, I know shocking, um, decided that

11:19.280 --> 11:22.260
they would sell that to you because they like all of the money.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.060
So that's why this is the way it is.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.980
And that's why our industry is the way it is.

11:26.980 --> 11:30.540
Well now the 360, you know, that was several years ago at this point.

11:30.540 --> 11:35.680
So apparently this trend, I mean, my people must be buying them or we wouldn't continue

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
to do this.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
Right.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
All right.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.540
They dangle it in front of you because what's the worst that's going to happen.

11:41.540 --> 11:42.740
It doesn't get purchased.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.100
I mean, who cares?

11:44.100 --> 11:48.340
It's just, it's a key and I'm sure it's very minimal because yeah, because I bet Sony and

11:48.340 --> 11:50.340
Microsoft, I mean, I don't know this to be true.

11:50.340 --> 11:55.500
Maybe you know, but I bet Sony and Microsoft don't exactly charge these guys money to have

11:55.500 --> 11:57.100
these things on the store.

11:57.100 --> 12:02.060
I mean, maybe if steam charged people a little more money, which I guess they do charge like

12:02.060 --> 12:03.060
a hundred bucks.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.060
What to get listed on the store.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.060
We have all this recoupable.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.060
Yeah.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.060
That's right.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.060
It's recoupable and all that.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.060
But, um, yeah.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.660
So, I mean, I guess there's really no harm in putting it out there cause some people

12:11.660 --> 12:13.540
are going to buy it if nothing else.

12:13.540 --> 12:18.780
And it's, it's just this whole mobile marketplace type thing, you know, even I was watching

12:18.780 --> 12:24.900
psych impressions of the, uh, elder scrolls blades that just recently came out and how

12:24.900 --> 12:26.020
grindy that is.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.540
Like you earn chests in the game.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.100
It's like, Oh, but you're going to wait five minutes to open that chest.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.360
I did see a story today.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.860
We cut it from the show, uh, roll tonight because I don't think any of us have played

12:34.860 --> 12:36.260
the elder scrolls blades yet.

12:36.260 --> 12:37.260
I don't know.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.260
Dark soccer.

12:38.260 --> 12:39.260
Did you check it out?

12:39.260 --> 12:40.260
I know you play a lot of cell phone music and she's saying no.

12:40.260 --> 12:45.260
So, um, but, uh, I heard that like as of like today or yesterday, Bethesda's actually responded.

12:45.260 --> 12:50.460
They are going to be adjusting some of that balance, adjusting, not removing, adjusting.

12:50.460 --> 12:55.340
You know, a lot of angry people on the internet have made them kind of reevaluate that stuff.

12:55.340 --> 12:59.780
And probably a lot of those one star reviews in the store and they have kept many meaning

12:59.780 --> 13:00.780
to check it out.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.780
I wanted to check it out.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.780
They have adjusted some things.

13:02.780 --> 13:05.720
Like there are certain chests, I think that took like five hours to open and they dropped

13:05.720 --> 13:08.620
it down to like one hour instead or something like that.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.120
But I don't know.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.580
It's just not my thing.

13:11.580 --> 13:12.580
It's a mobile game.

13:12.580 --> 13:17.540
I know that they want to say, well, it's a true elder elder scrolls experience, but no,

13:17.540 --> 13:18.540
it's not.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.540
It's a mobile game.

13:19.540 --> 13:21.660
It's a mobile game experience.

13:21.660 --> 13:25.260
Do we think now I'm curious and I want to ask our chat room this as well over at twitch

13:25.260 --> 13:26.720
TV slash vog network.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.300
I want to look at the other side because I think a lot of us gamers, especially those

13:30.300 --> 13:35.860
that have been around for a very long time, uh, remember the days of up, up, down, down,

13:35.860 --> 13:36.860
left, right, left, right.

13:36.860 --> 13:41.300
BA start was the only, you know, coach you needed right to unlock the extra help or whatever.

13:41.300 --> 13:46.280
Um, I'm curious if anybody would be willing to say they see a positive in this.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.640
Like maybe there's a reason you would want to do this.

13:48.640 --> 13:54.040
I mean, my, I don't really like it, so I'm really having to kind of try to put my feet

13:54.040 --> 13:56.960
or my, you know, put the other shoes on my feet to kind of think this way.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.600
But I'm thinking like maybe like a positive could be, you know, we have had a lot of talk

14:00.600 --> 14:03.720
about how difficult some games can be.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.780
And maybe if some people are willing to pay to make that easier, although like as the

14:06.780 --> 14:10.240
words will leave you in my mouth, I kind of go, God, that just seems shitty though.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.720
Like, no, I don't think, no, I don't think we should have to pay for that.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.720
But okay.

14:15.800 --> 14:20.600
Like maybe I'm not phrasing it the right way, but my point is that like, how, how many people

14:20.600 --> 14:25.320
can beat Contra, even people that, that claim to be hardcore.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.320
Yes.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.840
I know, you know, you and your husband, Jamie, but you guys are anomalies.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.400
You know that, but how many people can beat Contra without that code?

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
Right.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.600
So y'all need a little bit of skill adjustment once in a while.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.600
All of you do except, except that the crazy people like dark Sakura and her husband.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.720
But that was the half the fun, like with games, like I would love have, I loved owning the

14:46.720 --> 14:51.200
game genie because I'd rent stuff and I'd play it and if it's too hard, I just go find

14:51.200 --> 14:52.600
the codes for it.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.200
Of course, back then you didn't have like the internet to find codes.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.680
You had to rely on either gaming magazines or you had to buy a code book that had games

15:01.680 --> 15:02.680
in it.

15:02.680 --> 15:07.160
And then hopefully the one that you're trying to play has, you know, codes for it.

15:07.520 --> 15:12.120
But that was, that was where the fun was because 30 lives wasn't even enough sometimes with

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
Contra.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.320
Yeah, that's, that's the truth.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.880
So, and it's funny because later in the show we're going to be taking a look at like old

15:18.880 --> 15:22.720
Nintendo games that get boosted, uh, in the Nintendo switch online library.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.520
And sometimes even that isn't enough to get certain things.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
Yeah.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.580
So some games still remain very, very hard, but again, Oh, you know what?

15:30.580 --> 15:31.740
Great example.

15:31.740 --> 15:37.820
Here's Nintendo boosting something for free while these other companies are charging five

15:37.820 --> 15:38.820
bucks for it.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.700
But it's not just, you know, and I know I pick you on Resident Evil here, but of course

15:41.700 --> 15:43.300
we know EA does this as well.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.780
Uh, heck our show, our roots are in music gaming, right?

15:46.780 --> 15:51.720
I'm positive that when I went on PlayStation four, there was a DJ max technica thing that

15:51.720 --> 15:56.340
you could download that would unlock everything that you would get just from playing enough

15:56.340 --> 15:57.340
of this.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.820
You know how like every time you play like three or four songs, you get a little thing

15:59.820 --> 16:01.420
and sometimes you get extra songs.

16:01.420 --> 16:05.940
And I'm not talking DLC, I'm talking like some of the extra like remixes and some of

16:05.940 --> 16:10.620
the original tracks that show up in the game, they sell a key to unlock all that stuff out

16:10.620 --> 16:11.620
the gate as well.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.700
Cause it does take a long time to unlock.

16:13.700 --> 16:18.080
And I get that if you have, you know, less time to play that stuff and you want to play

16:18.080 --> 16:21.180
certain things, maybe that's an option for you.

16:21.180 --> 16:25.340
But at the same time, when you do stuff like that, it kind of ruins the point of the game.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.060
Cause the whole point is that you're unlocking everything.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.100
And once you've unlocked everything, then then what?

16:29.100 --> 16:34.380
I mean, I guess it was music and we can play songs and get better at them, but you know,

16:34.380 --> 16:37.700
what's the point if we're like unlock, I don't, I don't know.

16:37.700 --> 16:41.840
I think if you're going to put that option in there, that it should be something that

16:41.840 --> 16:47.880
is free later on down the road or something, but they can make a buck and people aren't

16:47.880 --> 16:49.100
going to complain about it.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.380
Although apparently people write articles about it.

16:51.380 --> 16:55.980
So somebody not like it, but at the same time, it's been like this for years now and it's

16:55.980 --> 16:58.780
more of like, Oh, there's another company doing that.

16:58.780 --> 17:03.060
So we're going to buy their game because so if you don't like, am I going to protest

17:03.060 --> 17:04.060
everybody?

17:04.060 --> 17:05.420
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.540
Um, the end of the end of the day, right?

17:07.540 --> 17:08.540
Bottom line.

17:08.540 --> 17:09.540
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

17:09.540 --> 17:10.540
Most important thing.

17:10.540 --> 17:13.220
Well, I mean, you can't say that about everything because there are some games now and they've

17:13.220 --> 17:16.340
gotten smart about it is like, they'll patch that shit in later.

17:16.340 --> 17:20.180
So like for example, call of duty, modern warfare remastered, you know, call of duty.

17:20.180 --> 17:26.400
Modern warfare is probably one of the best FPS games, you know, ever made.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.420
Then they decided, Hey, you know what?

17:28.460 --> 17:32.260
We're just going to go ahead and fucking put some loot boxes in there now, even though

17:32.260 --> 17:34.540
you purchased the game and they weren't in there originally.

17:34.540 --> 17:37.500
And if you're totally taking a lot of shit, totally getting that to that, but we're going

17:37.500 --> 17:39.340
to throw it in there now.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.340
You know what though?

17:40.340 --> 17:41.760
I can resell you that DLC.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.320
I liked what you kind of like referenced there where you said something about like you could

17:46.320 --> 17:49.300
come back a year later and then it could be free.

17:49.300 --> 17:54.980
Like that would be a great way for developers to kind of get people to revisit maybe an

17:54.980 --> 18:01.180
old title is that after a year, why not just put out that sort of DLC for free?

18:01.180 --> 18:05.740
And the value is that more people revisit the game, more people play the game, talk

18:05.740 --> 18:06.740
about the games.

18:06.740 --> 18:11.360
And then you can sell your resident evil, whatever remaster or you put the game on sale

18:11.360 --> 18:15.180
and now maybe you sell a few more copies because people know they can just unlock everything

18:15.180 --> 18:16.180
out the gate or whatever.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.260
Maybe we're stopping them before.

18:17.260 --> 18:24.620
I think that's a, that's a very Nintendo ish idea to, to do is just like make that code

18:24.620 --> 18:30.540
or whatever free a year, maybe if even that long, six months after the game is out, maybe

18:30.540 --> 18:33.620
I guess if they feel the need to charge for it out the gate, then whatever.

18:33.620 --> 18:36.620
I still don't think all they'll do is they'll bundle it together with the game.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.940
They'll reduce the price down to the original cost of the game, be like, look at the deal

18:39.940 --> 18:40.940
you're getting.

18:40.940 --> 18:45.700
And I'm sorry, I can't, I can't give, I can't give this industry the benefit of the social

18:45.700 --> 18:47.500
media sees straight.

18:47.500 --> 18:51.600
Where do people find out about most of those sales, social media, who sees through that

18:51.600 --> 18:54.260
shit right off the bat, social media, you know what I mean?

18:54.260 --> 18:59.300
So I feel like, like, I realize a lot of game company, executive boardroom type discussions

18:59.300 --> 19:03.620
don't think gamers are that smart, but like, I kind of think we are.

19:03.620 --> 19:07.260
And like, you know, your sale is not going to gain a lot of traction if, if it's very

19:07.260 --> 19:09.140
clear, it's a stupid sale.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.140
Yeah.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.300
So that's where my head's at on that anyway.

19:12.300 --> 19:17.140
Uh, let's see, going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, pod culture says

19:17.140 --> 19:22.940
Forza horizon has a key to unlock a map, to find all the barn find cars.

19:22.940 --> 19:26.180
Uh, and Bobby adds to that and that last damn bonus board.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.180
Yeah.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.260
And that's like stuff, you know, and I always thought that was really silly too, because

19:29.260 --> 19:35.020
I was like, you have an internet and the internet, all the location, I mean, I understand it's

19:35.020 --> 19:39.340
awfully convenient to just unlock it in the game and then use the magic GPS to take you

19:39.340 --> 19:40.340
there.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.340
I get it.

19:41.340 --> 19:44.680
But like, it's not like you can't, can't download a high resolution map and just see everything

19:44.680 --> 19:45.940
right there.

19:45.940 --> 19:50.340
Like it's just, it's kind of blows my mind that they actually make money off that, but

19:50.340 --> 19:51.340
I get it.

19:51.340 --> 19:54.380
People want to collect stuff and those types of collectible games, I guess.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.660
Um, let's see.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.900
And Bobby says, it's hard to figure out which bonus boards you don't have when there's 200

19:59.900 --> 20:00.900
though.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.540
But once the point out, I've never paid for the treasure map, but I see.

20:03.540 --> 20:07.660
So it's kind of like you're sitting there at one 99 out of 200, you have no idea where

20:07.660 --> 20:09.300
that last board is.

20:09.300 --> 20:13.140
Maybe looking at a map on the internet isn't going to help because you're going to see

20:13.140 --> 20:14.140
all 200.

20:14.140 --> 20:15.140
You're not going to remember which one 99 yard.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.300
I remember that they did something similar to that.

20:17.300 --> 20:23.740
I think it was in crackdown one where they, they, uh, for people that were down to like

20:23.740 --> 20:28.380
the very last few things it was, they actually had it where the, there was a detector that

20:28.380 --> 20:33.260
kind of let you know where some of the last few orbs to collect were because I know when

20:33.260 --> 20:36.380
it got down, it's like, Oh great, I have two left.

20:36.380 --> 20:37.380
Where the hell are they?

20:37.380 --> 20:39.620
I've been all over this map like crazy.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.220
So it like actually makes them louder so you can hear them and stuff because yeah, it was

20:43.220 --> 20:44.220
a pain in the ass.

20:44.300 --> 20:49.460
In crackdown one, I never did get all of them because I couldn't find the last, like however

20:49.460 --> 20:52.500
many I had left, probably less than five.

20:52.500 --> 20:58.020
And I was like all over that map, uh, at depth points out the dragon ball fighter Z also

20:58.020 --> 20:59.020
does it.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.660
And you can buy a key to unlock some of the characters that you unlock will play in the

21:01.660 --> 21:02.660
game.

21:02.660 --> 21:07.220
But I could see a little bit too, because like if you're saying, um, not really into

21:07.220 --> 21:11.100
just going through the story mode and progressing through that, normally maybe you're into the

21:11.100 --> 21:14.900
fighting game scene or something and you want to play those characters that you want to

21:14.900 --> 21:19.900
main as, then maybe unlocking them now would be beneficial to you.

21:19.900 --> 21:23.540
I don't know, but see, you know, back then what we used to do is just download a save

21:23.540 --> 21:27.420
off the internet and then put it in there and all this stuff is unlocked or there would

21:27.420 --> 21:32.060
be a code you'd put in a menu and unlock all the characters or a game genie code that would

21:32.060 --> 21:33.060
unlock all the characters.

21:33.060 --> 21:35.080
I mean, there's lots of ways around everything.

21:35.080 --> 21:40.300
We need, where, where did the game G Gottlieb, is that who made the game genie?

21:40.300 --> 21:44.020
We need them to come back and make a game genie for the PlayStation four and the Xbox

21:44.020 --> 21:45.020
one.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.020
That's what we need.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.020
What do you mean you can't?

21:47.020 --> 21:48.020
You can't do that anymore.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.020
Hacks.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.020
Hack the planet.

21:50.020 --> 21:51.020
I can't.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.020
I can't put the CD in the cartridge.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.020
It doesn't work.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.780
You're not trying hard enough.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.060
Can't push the digital games.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.740
You can put Linux on it, Loki.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.740
There's gotta be a way.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.060
Just get the game genie.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.060
Oh, Galoob.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.060
Sorry.

22:04.060 --> 22:05.060
It was very simple.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.060
Thank you.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.060
It was Galoob.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.060
Are they even around still?

22:08.060 --> 22:09.060
Gottlieb makes pinball games, I think.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.060
They did.

22:10.820 --> 22:11.820
They made the game genie.

22:11.820 --> 22:12.820
What's that?

22:12.820 --> 22:13.820
Is that like tilting the table?

22:13.820 --> 22:16.140
It's like going into the menu and changing the rule set.

22:16.140 --> 22:17.660
Or sawing the legs down.

22:17.660 --> 22:20.660
And then putting a big blocker right behind the flippers.

22:20.660 --> 22:21.660
Or turning the tilt off.

22:21.660 --> 22:28.500
Or what we used to do is strip, or put a rubber band in between the, was it the channels going

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
down towards the bottom?

22:29.500 --> 22:31.860
Just put rubber bands on the side so it only can go down the center.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.500
Oh, permanent like ball save?

22:33.500 --> 22:34.500
Yeah.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
Oh yeah.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
We did it with Attack on Mars.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
That was fun.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.500
Okay.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.500
Made the game much easier.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.380
A lot easier than it would have been otherwise.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.380
I like that.

22:43.380 --> 22:44.380
Alright.

22:44.380 --> 22:48.300
Let's get into some other topics that we have here at Orange Laundry tonight.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.820
One way we always like to start the show is by talking about our gaming weeks and the

22:51.820 --> 22:53.940
types of video games that we've been playing this week.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.180
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

22:56.180 --> 22:57.180
Eh.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.580
That fun, huh?

22:58.580 --> 22:59.580
I really didn't do much.

22:59.580 --> 23:06.500
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing on my phone and trying to farm an ingress

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
at work.

23:07.500 --> 23:13.700
You know, just little bits and pieces, it's just, I've had migraines all week from some

23:13.700 --> 23:15.660
problems I'm having in my neck.

23:15.660 --> 23:19.940
And so it's been really hard for me to just sit and look at a screen for any significant

23:19.940 --> 23:21.940
amount of time outside of doing my job.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.420
But you're building up hype for Animal Crossing on Switch, right?

23:24.420 --> 23:26.860
I really want it.

23:26.860 --> 23:27.860
I know.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.300
And then Dan will never see the Switch again.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.820
He'll have to buy a second one.

23:31.820 --> 23:32.820
Right.

23:32.820 --> 23:33.820
Alright.

23:33.820 --> 23:34.820
Well, if that's all you got for now.

23:34.820 --> 23:35.820
Oh, and pinball.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.820
I mean, there is pinball.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.220
Okay.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.220
So there is still that.

23:39.220 --> 23:40.500
So you're still you're still gaming something.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.780
It's just not maybe video games right now.

23:42.780 --> 23:43.780
Yeah.

23:43.780 --> 23:44.780
What?

23:44.780 --> 23:45.780
You guys just got a new pinball table, right?

23:45.780 --> 23:46.780
No.

23:46.780 --> 23:47.780
Well, we had Ghostbusters for a while.

23:47.780 --> 23:48.780
That was our last new one.

23:48.780 --> 23:49.780
I thought there was something.

23:49.780 --> 23:50.780
We sold Demolition Man.

23:50.780 --> 23:51.780
Okay.

23:51.780 --> 23:52.780
So we're selling Monopoly.

23:52.780 --> 23:53.780
Right.

23:53.780 --> 23:54.780
And you're selling.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.740
I may be selling World Cup to Melomelody.

23:56.740 --> 23:57.740
Right.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.740
Okay.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.260
I thought there was something coming in to replace one of those.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.260
Black Knight, Sword of Rage.

24:02.260 --> 24:03.260
Okay.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.260
Maybe.

24:04.260 --> 24:06.260
Because now Dan's like, I'm like, shut up.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.700
We're getting it.

24:08.700 --> 24:09.700
You tell him.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.020
And Steve Ritchie did all the voices in it again.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.260
He was also the designer of the table, of course.

24:13.260 --> 24:14.540
He did all the voices again.

24:14.540 --> 24:21.380
And I think that all the guitar in it was written by someone from Anthrax.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.380
Why not?

24:22.380 --> 24:23.380
It was pretty good stuff.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.380
Nice.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.380
All right.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.380
Loki, how about you?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.380
How was your gaming week?

24:27.380 --> 24:28.380
I played.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.860
Well, I built a lot of Labo VR stuff.

24:30.860 --> 24:34.540
So I got that on Friday and I've been building it pretty much ever since.

24:34.540 --> 24:38.700
I have still two more toy cons to build.

24:38.700 --> 24:43.620
I've got the elephant and the wind flapper.

24:43.620 --> 24:44.620
I don't know what they call it.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.380
It's a pedal thing with the...

24:46.380 --> 24:51.020
It's the one that they have the Toad picture that they posted on the Nintendo Twitter account.

24:51.020 --> 24:56.100
Everyone's like, why are you stepping on Toad's penis over and over?

24:56.100 --> 24:57.100
I get it.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.700
He's supposed to be doing sis, but it looked like you're just stomping on his penis.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.700
I'm not going to paint Toad on mine.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.960
So we're not going to have that problem.

25:05.960 --> 25:06.960
So I played lots of that.

25:06.960 --> 25:11.380
I actually did finish the Toy-Con Blaster earlier today and actually played some of

25:11.380 --> 25:12.380
that.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.380
And that's actually really cool.

25:13.380 --> 25:16.380
It's kind of like an on-rails shooting gallery type thing.

25:16.380 --> 25:20.740
And so it's hard to see from there, but you actually pull it back and it clicks and then

25:20.740 --> 25:25.620
you push a button and it's almost like firing a rubber band gun or something like that.

25:25.620 --> 25:31.780
But it's really cool and it's a lot easier to hold than holding the headset by itself.

25:31.780 --> 25:38.200
So I did that and then I've been playing Borderlands Remastered a bit.

25:38.200 --> 25:43.860
I had the hardest time getting it to run and it still crashes every now and then.

25:43.860 --> 25:48.980
It's just some general protection fault thing.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.340
It could be because I'm modding my saves.

25:52.340 --> 25:56.980
I don't think so, but it might be that.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.500
It shouldn't cause the game to crash.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.180
I've never had that problem before, but you know, I have to cheat.

26:02.180 --> 26:03.180
It's Borderlands.

26:03.180 --> 26:06.580
I've already played through the whole game once, so I don't care anymore.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.500
Not even once, several times.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.140
But it's just fun to mess around with that stuff.

26:11.140 --> 26:15.980
But I'm like level 15 now and yeah.

26:15.980 --> 26:19.100
So it's been okay.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.100
And then what else?

26:21.100 --> 26:22.100
Pokemon Go, I guess.

26:22.100 --> 26:28.320
A little bit of that and a little bit of working on my game.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
And that's it.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
Okay.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.200
My Gaming Week may surprise you.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.720
I am still playing Borderlands Remastered.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.200
I'm not having these problems you're having, but I'm also not fucking with my game.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.640
But it was doing it before I fucked with my game, so I think it's actually the game.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.440
No, I've been playing it just the way it comes on the computer.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
And I've been playing it.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.640
I mean, I don't play the 4K, I play 2K, but it runs really well in the 2K mode.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.640
And I talked a little bit about this last week, I don't want to repeat too much, but

26:55.640 --> 26:56.960
I've still been playing.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.360
I think that's noteworthy because you guys know how often video games hold my attention

27:00.360 --> 27:02.280
for more than a week as new things come out.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.720
I'm up to level 17 now, which for me is pretty good.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.600
I guess that doesn't sound that high.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.240
I heard you beat the game around level 35, right?

27:12.240 --> 27:13.240
I don't remember.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
I don't know.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.600
So I don't know how many levels you go through in the game, but I'm at level 17.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.880
I feel like I've done a lot.

27:18.880 --> 27:22.920
I've only beaten the second boss so far.

27:22.920 --> 27:28.160
Is that when you go into the hideout and you're like in a big circular room and there's this

27:28.160 --> 27:32.080
big guy, scary, because I think I just did that part.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.480
Maybe I only did nine toes.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.840
I thought I fought the second guy, but maybe not yet.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
Okay.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.600
So I did this whole area, I think the last thing I remember doing, it was either that

27:41.600 --> 27:46.320
or it was the one where you have all these shock crystals and you blow up the shock crystals

27:46.320 --> 27:48.680
and pick up the little fragments they leave behind.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.340
And then he makes a shot.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.820
Maybe I only got this quest because I'm the soldier, I don't know.

27:52.820 --> 27:56.300
But he makes a thing that you put on your turret and now it does shock bullets from

27:56.300 --> 27:57.300
the turret.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.580
So that's like the last thing I did.

27:58.580 --> 27:59.580
Oh, that's yeah.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.180
That's another side quest, I think.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.660
But here's, here's the thing that's made.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.660
Okay.

28:03.660 --> 28:07.500
So like with Borderlands, I felt like the game was like kind of hard because you have

28:07.500 --> 28:09.300
limited ammo, right?

28:09.300 --> 28:11.360
Even though it kind of like seems to drop from everything.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.920
And I think that's kind of the trick.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.920
Like even though I kind of get annoyed at how everything responds, I think there's a

28:16.920 --> 28:20.700
method to the madness because I think like if you're running low on ammo and for whatever

28:20.700 --> 28:24.220
reason you can't afford it, although I noticed it's really cheap.

28:24.220 --> 28:27.900
So I think that's by design is that they make the ammo really cheap so that you can't easily

28:27.900 --> 28:28.900
run out.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.580
But like also even though some of the monsters level up, not all of them do.

28:32.580 --> 28:36.900
Like I noticed right outside that Firestone town, those little, um, Scott, what are they

28:36.900 --> 28:37.900
called?

28:37.900 --> 28:41.420
The skags, skogs, skags, skags, those things that hang out, they never go up beyond level

28:41.420 --> 28:42.420
two.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.860
So if you just kill those things, which is really easy, you can melee kill them when

28:44.860 --> 28:48.900
they're level two and you're like level five, um, you they'll drop ammo too.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.480
So you can kind of farm it that way.

28:50.480 --> 28:54.360
So there is a way to do it where you're not really running out of things, but it will

28:54.360 --> 28:56.140
take a little selling guns.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.140
You do that.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.140
You can do that too.

28:58.140 --> 29:01.640
But where I'm really feeling progression now, and I know this is funny to some of you because

29:01.640 --> 29:04.040
this game is how old is like 10 years old at this point.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.480
And I'm like just discovering it for the first time where some of you have been playing it

29:06.480 --> 29:09.960
for forever, but maybe you can appreciate that now I'm discovering it.

29:09.960 --> 29:13.320
Um, I just got in this last little thing that I did.

29:13.320 --> 29:20.000
Um, I got, somebody dropped a purple shield and it's like, it was like twice the shielding

29:20.040 --> 29:21.040
of the one I had.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.600
It went up from like 160 to like 300.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.600
Okay.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.640
And it has very fast health regeneration and I was like, yes, this is exactly what I needed

29:29.640 --> 29:33.720
because I kept dying because there's like no, are you using the shift keys as well?

29:33.720 --> 29:37.920
Because they have shift keys that they post online and you can read, you can redeem them

29:37.920 --> 29:42.440
on your, um, like the shift key to run it.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.720
You're talking like a DLC thing.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.720
Yeah.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
They're shift keys.

29:45.720 --> 29:50.800
So you can register on the borderland site under your VIP thing or whatever, and then

29:50.800 --> 29:55.600
you can unlock, uh, there's a chest in Firestone you can unlock and you get loot from there.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.920
It's like rare loot.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.920
Oh, it's free.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.320
Oh, that's how you open that.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.320
Yeah.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.320
So you have to get shift keys.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.320
So you go online, just search.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.240
And I mean, I don't think they expire really.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.400
And you just, you can put as many of them in as you want and they unlocks five each

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
time.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
Passcodes and ingress for gear.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
Yeah, sort of.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
Yeah.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
Okay.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.400
Wow.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
Interesting.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.000
But if it's something, does it generate stuff at my level?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.400
Cause maybe I want to hang on to those till I'm like,

30:20.400 --> 30:21.400
um, yes.

30:21.400 --> 30:25.280
Oh, so maybe there's, you don't want to just burn them all at level one.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.280
That might not be a good idea.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.280
Yeah.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.280
He probably wants one gain a few levels.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.280
Use another gain.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
Okay.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.280
Okay.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.280
That's probably what I'll do that.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.280
Like I got a shield out of that one time.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.280
Yeah.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.160
But now that I have that purple shield, I feel like, okay, I can actually go in there

30:38.160 --> 30:39.160
and take them.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.320
Cause like I'm supposed to, I think the soldiers, the tanky guy, right.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.160
Or is it the, maybe there's another guy that's like really big and bulky.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.920
It's probably him.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.920
Yeah.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.920
Soldiers never laid the tank guy.

30:48.920 --> 30:49.920
Okay.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
I don't know.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.920
He has the tour.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.920
I, the turret thing sounded, I was like, Oh, uh, that's like mass effect with the drone.

30:52.920 --> 30:53.920
I'll like that guy.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.360
And I do because I remember the first time I played border lands years ago, I played

30:57.360 --> 31:00.200
the girl who's like the siren.

31:00.200 --> 31:06.160
And although that was a cool ability, like knowing my sense of what I need in first person

31:06.160 --> 31:11.700
shooters and how I do better in those games, I went with the turret building guy because

31:11.700 --> 31:13.040
I'm like, Ooh, I like turrets.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.880
I like, that's like the type of character I like to play.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
That's why I like Symmetra and Overwatch.

31:17.600 --> 31:22.720
And I always play as the hunter mortar guy is that now he, he probably uses snipers,

31:22.720 --> 31:23.720
huh?

31:23.720 --> 31:28.000
He's sniper rifles in, uh, revolvers and pistols are his specialties.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Those are the ones that he loves.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Look faster.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Okay.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.920
Everybody can use everything, but it's, yeah.

31:32.920 --> 31:37.560
Because I've been, I was using the sniper rifle a lot to like, like what I will do is

31:37.560 --> 31:41.720
like, I'll use this when I'm a distance away, I'll use the sniper rifle to attack them.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.260
And then that kind of like agros them, then they come at me.

31:44.260 --> 31:48.300
And then I was using a pistol cause I had a really good pistol, but I noticed, I looked,

31:48.300 --> 31:51.320
I looked at the skill trees and I was like, Oh, here's a shotgun ability.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.020
So let me set out for a shotgun.

31:53.020 --> 31:57.940
So now I use the, I was using the sniper rifle to pull them in and then I'd shotgun them

31:57.940 --> 31:58.940
down.

31:58.940 --> 31:59.940
Right.

31:59.940 --> 32:00.940
Good strategy.

32:00.940 --> 32:01.940
Right.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.700
But, uh, I just recently replaced the sniper rifle with a rocket launcher.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.460
That's a much better way to get people's attention.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.460
Yes.

32:06.460 --> 32:11.020
Well, Doug, and you have to be subtle with one and absolute opposite of subtle with the

32:11.020 --> 32:12.020
other.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.340
I'm not a subtle person.

32:13.340 --> 32:18.300
So yeah, it's, it's, it's so weird to me that I'm talking about like Borderlands strategy.

32:18.300 --> 32:23.420
I never thought I would like get into this game, but Mass Effect, I didn't enjoy the

32:23.420 --> 32:24.420
first time.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.420
Right.

32:25.420 --> 32:26.660
But now I'm kind of like into Borderlands.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.860
Some of the humor is a little bit toilet, but whatever.

32:28.860 --> 32:29.860
It's it's fine.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.620
And I, I, I let it go.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.620
I'm just, whatever.

32:32.620 --> 32:36.660
It's there is something really fucking satisfying about like when you get the car that you could

32:36.660 --> 32:40.060
just run over enemies and their blood splatters everywhere and H I definition.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.780
I'm like, that is really satisfying.

32:42.780 --> 32:45.860
So yeah, I, I'm liking Borderlands y'all.

32:45.860 --> 32:49.220
Now there's a reason to have this poster back here besides the fact that one of our listeners

32:49.220 --> 32:50.220
got it for us.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.060
And I also, look, look, he always liked Borderlands.

32:52.060 --> 32:54.820
I also play a zero all the time when I play in Borderlands two.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.820
Yeah.

32:55.820 --> 33:01.100
So I, I'm going to try to really finish this one and then try to play two and maybe make

33:01.100 --> 33:02.580
my way to Borderlands three.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.580
I don't know.

33:03.580 --> 33:04.580
Anyway.

33:04.580 --> 33:07.900
I'm looking at some comments in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network.

33:07.900 --> 33:12.500
Bobby Blackwell points out, I also picked the soldier because of the turret, the necromancer

33:12.500 --> 33:14.380
in Borderlands two also had a turret.

33:14.380 --> 33:15.380
I think.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.380
Yes.

33:16.380 --> 33:19.640
I would imagine that's having a little helper is kind of a standard class design thing I

33:19.640 --> 33:22.180
think is usually one of the arch types if you will.

33:22.180 --> 33:26.780
Um, other games I've been playing this week, Final Fantasy 14, I'm back, I'm back on that

33:26.780 --> 33:27.780
bullshit.

33:27.780 --> 33:32.020
Uh, I leveled my, so my astrologian has always kind of been my main and I've, that's been

33:32.020 --> 33:33.540
70 the max level.

33:33.540 --> 33:39.420
My white mage hit 70 in this past week and my scholar is now level 66.

33:39.420 --> 33:44.780
So by the end of next week, I should have every healer in Final Fantasy 14 at maximum

33:44.780 --> 33:45.780
level.

33:45.780 --> 33:46.780
Why?

33:46.780 --> 33:47.780
I don't know.

33:47.780 --> 33:48.780
It's fun.

33:48.780 --> 33:49.780
It's a thing.

33:49.780 --> 33:50.780
It's a thing.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.780
It's a thing.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.780
I'm working.

33:52.780 --> 33:53.780
It's just a thing.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.780
It's a thing.

33:54.780 --> 33:55.780
Um, so there's that.

33:55.780 --> 33:56.780
And then of course, Pokemon go like you guys, community day was yesterday.

33:56.780 --> 34:01.460
Um, so we went down to Capitol park, our usual stomping grounds for that.

34:01.460 --> 34:02.460
And what was it?

34:02.460 --> 34:03.460
It was bacon.

34:03.460 --> 34:07.600
And it was bag on, but I said, I didn't get a single shiny.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
You didn't?

34:08.760 --> 34:13.360
Well, I'll trade you one later than maybe I forgot that it was at that time.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.600
I thought it was earlier in the day.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.920
Oh, you know what they've been doing?

34:15.920 --> 34:18.960
It's kind of, well, it seems permanent, but they could change it whenever, but it seems

34:18.960 --> 34:23.040
like they figured out a way to roll it out in every time zone.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.380
And that probably has been helping with the server issues immensely too, but it's every

34:26.380 --> 34:28.240
time zone from three to 6 PM.

34:28.240 --> 34:33.920
And I like the later hours for now, but like, it's not like it'll work for maybe one more

34:33.920 --> 34:34.920
month.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.480
But when we get into June and July three to 6 PM is like the hottest point of the day.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.360
No, thank you.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.760
It's going to be like 115 out.

34:40.760 --> 34:44.920
So I'll be playing at the Galleria again, because I'll play at an indoor mall and I'm

34:44.920 --> 34:47.840
not playing out at the park in that kind of heat.

34:47.840 --> 34:51.320
So I'm hoping they go back to the earlier hours, but yeah, for now the three to six

34:51.320 --> 34:56.780
has been kind of interesting, but I caught a seven shiny bake-ons, which is pretty good

34:56.780 --> 34:59.640
because the first hour and a half I only had one.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.280
And then I just got like three more and then that was when Alan and I were like, okay,

35:03.280 --> 35:04.280
we're good.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.080
Cause he, he also got like way more in the second half than the first half.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.360
And we, so we each had our three and we're like, okay, we're done.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.840
And so I switched to my Bluetooth, my gotcha.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.240
And I was catching that way and I caught like three more shinies from the gotcha.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.120
So there you go.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.460
That was a pretty good, except none of them were very good appraisals.

35:20.460 --> 35:21.600
That's the only kind of bummer.

35:21.600 --> 35:27.400
So and then one of my friends who plays like super casually and doesn't really care about

35:27.400 --> 35:29.940
shinies, but he does want to fill his pokey decks.

35:29.940 --> 35:33.600
He needed a far-fetched cause he, he guess he wasn't playing when that event happened

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
or whatever.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
He's never hatched one.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.440
So I got a far-fetched and he gave me a shiny Q bone for it.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.160
I'm like, are you sure you want to give up a shiny?

35:39.160 --> 35:40.160
He's like, I don't care.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.960
I don't care about shiny thing, but I want that far-fetched.

35:41.960 --> 35:46.000
I was like, okay, so I got another shiny that I needed.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
So I got the Q bone.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.480
So, uh, which is also good because that was the ingress event shiny and that's the enlightened

35:52.480 --> 35:53.840
one was the Q bone.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.520
So I finally got one of those.

35:56.520 --> 36:01.320
I do, even though I'm not a resistance person, uh, the pony does that are the blue ones.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.320
Those are really good.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.600
Like I have, they're, they just look fucking cool.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.720
Like I have to have those.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.720
So, but I don't have one of those yet.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.720
So, uh, anyway.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.720
Oh, you don't?

36:09.720 --> 36:10.960
I think I have one.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.960
The blue pony tusks?

36:11.960 --> 36:12.960
I don't have one of those either.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.960
Cause I got one of those first.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.960
Oh, hang on to those.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.280
Cause yeah, unless you, when you get two, I'll trade you shiny.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.920
So I've got, I have like multiple shiny swab blues.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.840
I know that's one that like hasn't had a community day.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.360
I've just hatched a bunch and some turn out shiny.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.960
I wish I could part with my togepi.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.160
I have two shiny togepis.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.840
Well, one of them's a shiny toga kiss.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.720
What's the, no, what's the last, there's a third one.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.720
Really?

36:36.720 --> 36:39.280
Gen four toga kiss, I think is the last one or something like that.

36:39.280 --> 36:45.040
So that's the, uh, my, my only one of those is a shiny because since it was a hatch, it

36:45.040 --> 36:47.480
was also a wonder or highest level appraisal.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.240
So it made sense to do that one.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.240
So yeah.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
Um, yeah.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
Anyway, Pokemon, Pokemon.

36:52.240 --> 36:56.640
Oh, maybe, maybe I transferred it to, uh, I transferred the Pokemon.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.640
Let's go.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.960
You, you put a shiny and let's go.

36:59.960 --> 37:00.960
Yeah.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.760
Cause I don't give a crap about this stuff.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.160
Save me all the shinies ever.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.160
All right.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
Yeah.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.160
It wasn't.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
You need to get yourself a Bluetooth catcher.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.000
That's, that's been great for shinies.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.320
Just you have to just remember to kind of sit there and clean up your Pokemon all the

37:14.320 --> 37:15.320
time.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.680
And it's, it's only really works when walking.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.700
They really nerfed it when driving.

37:19.700 --> 37:23.600
But since I've been trying to walk more and do the fitness thing more, um, I've been using

37:23.600 --> 37:28.160
like I'll go walk the giant park, not far, not, not the park that's close to the house,

37:28.160 --> 37:29.160
but the giant park.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.240
It's a little further from the house.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.220
I've been walking that pretty regularly.

37:32.680 --> 37:36.060
And like, I'll use my Bluetooth to catch, I'll play ingress and I'm walking and it's

37:36.060 --> 37:37.060
exercise.

37:37.060 --> 37:39.060
Postmates is expensive.

37:39.060 --> 37:40.060
Yes.

37:40.060 --> 37:41.060
Yes it is.

37:41.060 --> 37:42.660
For pita kitchen anyway.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.660
All right.

37:43.660 --> 37:44.660
Anyway.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.940
Uh, that's it for my gaming week.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.840
So I guess, uh, we can get into some housekeeping real quick.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.580
You can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

37:51.580 --> 37:54.880
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange Laundrio.

37:54.880 --> 37:59.400
And of course, if you aren't already following us on Twitch at VOG network, VOG network,

37:59.400 --> 38:01.380
I would really hope that you fix that.

38:01.380 --> 38:05.020
Thank you to everybody who helps us out on Twitch through all your hosts, your bitty

38:05.020 --> 38:06.740
donations are appreciated as well.

38:06.740 --> 38:11.380
The bits, uh, and, uh, the, the, um, subscriptions are really, really amazing.

38:11.380 --> 38:14.220
You guys have really shown up and we're so happy.

38:14.220 --> 38:18.260
Uh, you guys have been supporting us on Twitch for the past few months, ever since we switched

38:18.260 --> 38:21.460
to Twitch in December.

38:21.460 --> 38:24.300
And there's been a lot of exciting news on the Twitch front lately, right?

38:24.300 --> 38:28.660
Uh, we got some new emotes, so I know Bobby Black Wolf has this little, a Wolf emote and

38:28.660 --> 38:30.780
we're going to have one that represents a well are pretty soon.

38:30.780 --> 38:32.020
We've been talking about it behind the scenes.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.580
I think we know what we're going to go with, but we'll have an OLR emote very soon.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.060
Uh, that's going to be a thing.

38:37.060 --> 38:42.300
And then I'm hearing something about, uh, um, at the Twitch con Europe, I think happened

38:42.300 --> 38:43.300
this weekend, right?

38:43.300 --> 38:44.300
Yeah.

38:44.300 --> 38:45.300
I saw the thing.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.300
They were talking about like highlight reels.

38:46.300 --> 38:50.940
Like, like something about the volume of your chat and the clips that are made will make

38:50.940 --> 38:54.340
this highlight reel at the end of your, so I'm really curious to see what the highlight

38:54.340 --> 38:59.180
reels end up being for the show because it sounds, it sounds very play of the game and

38:59.180 --> 39:04.180
Overwatch, like it kind of uses an algorithm to figure out like what the highlight is.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.180
Those always work well.

39:05.180 --> 39:06.180
Yeah.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.660
I'm, I'm really curious to see how those turn out.

39:07.660 --> 39:08.660
And there's other stuff too.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.660
We'll talk about.

39:09.660 --> 39:10.660
It's going to be, it's a little later.

39:10.660 --> 39:15.060
It's going to be like him, me talking all of a sudden, it's so much fun.

39:15.060 --> 39:18.180
God damn it.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.180
Fuck you algorithm.

39:19.180 --> 39:21.940
Oh, now I really want that to happen.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.220
All right, let's get into some gaming news for now.

39:24.220 --> 39:25.540
Uh, start us off, Logie.

39:25.540 --> 39:26.540
All right.

39:26.540 --> 39:30.740
Apparently, uh, Bungee has been blocking people from using a weapon that they accidentally

39:30.740 --> 39:32.620
sold to them in destiny.

39:32.620 --> 39:37.620
Um, so that seems to have, there was a, some exclusive stuff that they had in PlayStation

39:37.620 --> 39:38.620
four.

39:38.620 --> 39:44.780
There's this weapon that was, uh, the exotic trace rifle wave splitter, and apparently

39:44.780 --> 39:51.980
this traveling alien salesman would sell you and, uh, somehow that, uh, wave splitter was

39:51.980 --> 39:57.180
made available, uh, to players on Xbox and PC.

39:57.180 --> 40:01.020
And of course, you know, they, they're aware of the issue and they're working on a fix

40:01.020 --> 40:05.860
in the meantime though, if you've, um, acquired that weapon, you're not gonna be able to use

40:05.860 --> 40:06.860
it.

40:06.860 --> 40:11.100
So even if you paid for it, sorry, that's money not well spent and they're not going

40:11.100 --> 40:12.280
to refund them.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.660
I think that that's maybe what they're working on doing.

40:14.660 --> 40:17.780
They haven't said that they're going to do that yet, but most likely that's going to

40:17.780 --> 40:21.060
have to be the outcome unless it's going to become a non-exclusive weapon.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.860
Um, so I don't know.

40:22.860 --> 40:25.980
Here's my, my honest to God reaction to this story that I'm hearing.

40:25.980 --> 40:27.940
Like I realized it was a mistake and so forth.

40:27.940 --> 40:30.860
First off, we know these exclusive sorts of things are really silly.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.620
Like I understand why it happens in the industry.

40:32.620 --> 40:33.620
I get it.

40:33.620 --> 40:38.420
You know, people like Sony offer money, they offer, and Microsoft does it too.

40:38.420 --> 40:41.420
Nintendo kind of doesn't need to, well, no, I take that back.

40:41.420 --> 40:44.540
Nintendo does it too with things like star link, the Ubisoft thing, right?

40:44.540 --> 40:45.540
That practically became a Starbucks game.

40:45.580 --> 40:46.580
So Nintendo does this too.

40:46.580 --> 40:47.700
Speaking of which, they have that on sale.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.700
Yeah, I heard.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.700
It was down to like 30 bucks.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.700
Bargain basement prices.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.700
Yeah.

40:51.700 --> 40:52.700
But I might need to pick that up.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.700
But anyway.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.700
The Switch version too.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.700
I don't want to digress.

40:55.700 --> 40:56.700
I don't want to digress.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.700
All right, sorry.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.700
So Sony, um, you know, spends this money on Destiny.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.660
I'm, I'm only picking on them because we're talking about destiny, but my point is every

41:00.660 --> 41:01.660
company does this.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.660
Okay.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.660
So this isn't like a Sony problem.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.660
This is an industry problem.

41:04.660 --> 41:09.340
So, um, they pay money to get these exclusives, either they're paying money or they're offering

41:09.340 --> 41:14.300
advertising, booth space, trade type of MDF is what they call it.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.300
Oh, fancy.

41:16.060 --> 41:17.060
What's MDF stand for?

41:17.060 --> 41:20.700
It's, uh, I think it's marketing development funds or something like that.

41:20.700 --> 41:21.700
I don't know.

41:21.700 --> 41:22.700
Less fancy.

41:22.700 --> 41:23.700
That's all right.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.300
MDF is that's the, that's the ad dollars.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.140
It's basically it's ad dollars.

41:28.140 --> 41:34.300
So what it is is they, they say, I'm going to give you $100,000 MDF, you know, and so

41:34.300 --> 41:39.180
what the company has to do is they have to show them how they're spending that on marketing.

41:39.180 --> 41:43.680
So they submit, okay, here's our print ad run that we're going to do, or here's our

41:43.680 --> 41:47.160
TV advertisement, you know, and the, all the money behind it.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.160
All right.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.600
Thank you for the peak behind the curtain, but it's kinda, it's with all respect, it's

41:51.600 --> 41:52.600
not surprising.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.920
That's kind of what I figured was going on.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.920
Right.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.000
So they're paying the money for the exclusives, whether we'd like it or not, even though we

41:57.000 --> 41:59.640
think it's like, it's just kind of like ridiculous or whatever.

41:59.640 --> 42:04.760
Like why, you know, why can't Microsoft and PC, when it comes to destiny, just have the

42:04.760 --> 42:05.760
same things.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.240
It's really, really ridiculous.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.120
I get it when it's IP things.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
Okay.

42:10.560 --> 42:17.120
I get why Nintendo or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft can't have Star Fox in their version

42:17.120 --> 42:18.120
of Starlink.

42:18.120 --> 42:22.400
I get it when it comes to IP, but that's why I thought one of the coolest things ever was

42:22.400 --> 42:25.720
back in the day, Soul Calibur 2, right?

42:25.720 --> 42:33.160
And how like Nintendo got Link, Sony got Hahachi, Microsoft got Spawn, right?

42:33.160 --> 42:36.240
So that was kind of a weird one, but it, you know, it was still, they got something special

42:36.240 --> 42:37.240
too.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.240
And that was kind of neat.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
Right?

42:39.360 --> 42:44.720
I'm like, I don't know, master chief, there's not really any really space shooting years

42:44.720 --> 42:45.720
ago.

42:45.720 --> 42:46.720
It doesn't matter.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.840
So they put master chief in a million games.

42:48.840 --> 42:49.840
It's fine.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.840
Spawn's cool.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.880
So anyway, um, but it is really like, okay, the thing and the kind of the point I'm trying

42:55.880 --> 42:59.680
to get to with this is that, okay, so it was a mistake that they opened it up and sold

42:59.680 --> 43:04.400
these weapons, but these are not like, it's not like these are Sony branded weapons, right?

43:04.400 --> 43:06.560
These aren't like God of war guns, right?

43:06.560 --> 43:11.640
They're not like, um, horizon, zero dawn bullets or things like that.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
Right.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.400
These are just guns that are marked for PlayStation exclusives.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.400
Right.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.400
Yeah.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.880
So here's my thing is that like, Hey, this is a silly thing to have exclusive.

43:19.880 --> 43:24.240
They should just open it up already, but be fine.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.160
The economy is what it is.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.160
Capitalism is what it is.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.920
Deals and wheels and all that are what they are.

43:29.920 --> 43:35.520
But if they opened it up and they accidentally sold these things, I'm sorry, but you done

43:35.520 --> 43:36.520
fucked up.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.520
You let people keep them.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.520
Okay.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
And that's so that's your fault.

43:39.520 --> 43:44.880
And honestly, in this society we live in, Loki, it, this is going to be a lawsuit in

43:44.880 --> 43:45.880
six months.

43:45.880 --> 43:46.880
No, it's lawsuit in six months.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.120
Funny that you mentioned six months, though, because this is what's going to, this is the

43:50.120 --> 43:51.120
fix.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.120
Okay.

43:52.120 --> 43:56.740
So this is the fix six days because see, while it's an exclusive weapon, like most things

43:56.740 --> 44:02.300
that are exclusive on multi-platform, um, games, it's a timed exclusive weapons.

44:02.300 --> 44:06.440
So what's going to happen is you will have it in your inventory if you purchase it, but

44:06.440 --> 44:10.800
you can't use it until September of this year.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.300
So what dot, dot, dot.

44:13.300 --> 44:14.840
So it's a timed exclusive.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.160
So you know, you fucked up.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.240
Just deal with it.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.720
Like you, you fucked up.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
Open it up.

44:20.720 --> 44:25.480
Just lucky fucking people that got that when they could like, just deal with it.

44:25.480 --> 44:29.120
Like I just, I feel like this just ends in lawsuit.

44:29.120 --> 44:34.600
Well, by the time the lawsuit happens, it'll be out in the general public and it won't

44:34.600 --> 44:36.520
fucking matter because you'll be able to use it again.

44:36.520 --> 44:43.680
So what happens if I like, if I go to, um, target and I buy, um, peppermint Hershey's

44:43.680 --> 44:47.520
kisses or something, even though it's not Christmas, does target come to my house and

44:47.520 --> 44:49.400
repossess those kisses?

44:49.400 --> 44:52.680
And then they're like, we're sorry, you don't get your money back, but come December, you

44:52.680 --> 44:54.440
can come back and get these and we'll give them to you.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.920
Like that's not how it fucking works though.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.000
They hold it in your general inventory, so it's in your cabinet, but you can't touch

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
it.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.280
They padlock your cabinet until September.

45:03.280 --> 45:05.960
That's not, that's not how this works.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.480
That's not how any of this works.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.640
I'm telling you a lawsuit.

45:09.640 --> 45:14.840
That's just, thank God that this isn't fallout 76 and that gun has weight to it and stuck

45:14.840 --> 45:21.040
in your inventory for six months until you can, you know, actually use it and weighing

45:21.040 --> 45:22.040
it down.

45:22.040 --> 45:26.240
Guys, you don't enter chat at a Twitch TV slash vlog network says the problem is not

45:26.240 --> 45:27.240
the marketing.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.720
It was probably blocked because gamers are screaming.

45:29.720 --> 45:30.720
Opie.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.960
It happens too much with games.

45:31.960 --> 45:32.960
That's the real problem.

45:32.960 --> 45:36.240
I don't know if that's what happened, but that's what I suspect I kind of get.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.240
I get your reference, but I think in this particular example, they are selling that

45:40.240 --> 45:45.320
gun on Sony's micro marketplace and Sony players aren't screaming, Opie, are they on?

45:45.320 --> 45:46.320
Maybe they are.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.320
Okay.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.240
But regardless, it's functioning on one platform.

45:49.240 --> 45:54.080
This is just about, Oh, well due to our agreement with Sony, even though we're the ones that

45:54.080 --> 46:00.800
fucked up and somehow open that sale on other marketplaces on PC and Xbox live and all this,

46:00.800 --> 46:04.040
you were still going to lock it away from you because we have to honor our deal with

46:04.040 --> 46:08.760
Sony and it's like, you just need to admit you fucked up and there should be some type

46:08.760 --> 46:12.800
of clause in your contract with Sony where it's like, you know, we made a boo boo, but

46:12.800 --> 46:16.320
in good faith we pulled it from the store as soon as we realized there was an issue

46:16.320 --> 46:19.080
and it's still going to be exclusive until such a such day.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.880
Like they're not going to do that.

46:20.880 --> 46:24.120
God, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about it next week and then

46:24.120 --> 46:28.200
it'll just come available to, no, we'll talk about, I want to, I want a reminder.

46:28.200 --> 46:32.040
That's not going to happen at the top of every L R justice for death.

46:32.040 --> 46:37.160
Just forget all that happened because there's so much news that it's just going to be forgotten

46:37.160 --> 46:41.520
and the next thing someone will be mad at, I can't even think about like what few weeks

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
ago we were mad at.

46:42.520 --> 46:47.240
Do I need to put, is everyone still mad at Metro Exodus is on, um, the, was the Epic

46:47.240 --> 46:53.160
story and people still remember that or cause they're mad about borderlands three now or

46:53.160 --> 46:55.420
whatever next Epic exclusive they get.

46:55.420 --> 46:58.160
Do we need a little like, you know, you know how at the beginning of every year, you know,

46:58.160 --> 47:00.840
every show here on Twitch, we have our little parody intro.

47:00.840 --> 47:05.960
Maybe we need another slide that says, Hey, hashtag remember things were mad at things

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
were mad.

47:06.960 --> 47:07.960
Yeah.

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
The list of things to remember.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
We're mad at.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.280
Do we need like a Wiki page?

47:11.280 --> 47:13.640
I bet RTC would be willing to make a Wiki page.

47:13.640 --> 47:14.640
I just fall.

47:14.640 --> 47:18.760
I just fall and told him, I'm like, unlike the, uh, was it like the wall of fame that

47:18.760 --> 47:21.960
like certain other podcasts have that they write their listener names on their world,

47:21.960 --> 47:22.960
right?

47:22.960 --> 47:23.960
All the things that were mad at.

47:23.960 --> 47:27.680
So the wall of shame, the list of grievances, lists of grievances.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.320
The orange lounge list of grievances.

47:30.320 --> 47:33.640
We can move this poster and put like a big whiteboard here and have the orange lounge

47:33.640 --> 47:34.640
radio list of grievances.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.640
Do you want to do that?

47:35.640 --> 47:40.800
Cause we'll make a list of grievances of how expensive this crap is coming soon.

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
Coming soon.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.280
The orange launch radio list of grievances.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.280
Awesome.

47:44.280 --> 47:47.520
No, it's needed.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.520
It's needed.

47:48.520 --> 47:49.520
I don't even play.

47:49.520 --> 47:52.440
I don't even play destiny and I'm mad.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.800
All right.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.840
$13 for cheese and bacon and egg burrito.

47:58.840 --> 47:59.840
Delivery's expensive.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.840
Yo.

48:00.840 --> 48:01.840
All right.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
I'm hungry.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.840
All right.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.840
Yeah.

48:04.840 --> 48:05.840
You're hungry.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.840
Uh, it has just 200.

48:06.840 --> 48:07.840
Matt says the airing of the grievances.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
Yes.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.840
Bobby Black Wolf says an on notice board.

48:09.840 --> 48:10.840
No, we would not want to copy anybody else.

48:10.840 --> 48:12.000
This is a list of grievances.

48:12.000 --> 48:21.920
TM Pat pending, O L R uh, it's the orange lounge log.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.920
Yes.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.040
The orange log.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.040
The O L log.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.040
The O L log.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.040
What rolls downstairs.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
Hops over repairs.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
Your neighbors dog.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.240
That's great for a snack and bits on your back.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.160
It's O L R log.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.200
What's great to complain and scream at the rain.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.200
It's O L R's log.

48:38.200 --> 48:40.200
All right.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.440
Anyway, I'm never doing that again.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.040
Let's move on with more stories.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.600
Do we gotta, cause I don't know.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.880
I'm stuck on that log thing.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.360
No, I know you don't have to.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.680
I can do the next story cause the next one's supposed to be mine anyway, but it'll be fast.

48:53.680 --> 48:57.440
It's about an apex legends update, which I know you guys don't play or do you surprise

48:57.440 --> 48:58.440
me?

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
You guys play apex legends?

48:59.440 --> 49:00.440
Nope.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.440
All right.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
I played it a couple of times.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.440
It's cool.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.040
I feel like it's one of those things like border lands that I won't really grow to appreciate

49:05.040 --> 49:08.560
it for 10 more years, but the times I've tried it, it's interesting.

49:08.560 --> 49:13.000
But um, you all should know if you, if you don't already know this, don't fuck up in

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
apex legends.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.560
Meaning like, I mean, you can be bad.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.080
Well, if you're bad, people might yell at you.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.680
It's going to ban you if you're bad.

49:18.680 --> 49:19.680
But you know what?

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
Here's the trick.

49:20.680 --> 49:25.680
If you're afraid of other people in apex legends, which I completely understand, turn off your

49:25.680 --> 49:28.040
audio incoming and outgoing.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.780
They can scream into the abyss and you'll never hear it.

49:30.780 --> 49:35.320
And you can still be an effective team member because apex legends has a really great pinging

49:35.320 --> 49:36.320
system.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.160
They have a great, like, you know, here found a weapon.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.160
You can ping things.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.640
I'm sure people go ping, ping, ping, ping.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.000
Well, they've got to have a ping flood stop.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
I don't know.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.200
But anyway, my point is you can just turn the audio off and then no buddy can ever scream

49:49.200 --> 49:50.200
at you.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.200
But anyway, uh, but don't cheat.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.200
That's the one thing you can't do.

49:52.200 --> 49:56.280
And honestly, if you're cheating in these types of games that are meant to be multiplayer

49:56.280 --> 50:02.600
online, I mean, if you cheat in your own game, you know, if you hack your, uh, borderlands

50:02.600 --> 50:06.880
one file, as long as you're not playing online with other people, especially going into randos.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.320
It's co-op, who cares?

50:08.320 --> 50:10.880
Or if you're okay, but if you're going in with people that know what they're getting

50:10.880 --> 50:11.880
into, that's one thing.

50:11.880 --> 50:14.940
But if you go into rando matches and do that shit, that's what's fucked up, right?

50:14.940 --> 50:15.940
You don't-

50:15.940 --> 50:17.800
Besides, I would share my modded weapons anyways.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.660
You don't inflict that on other people that don't want their games to be messed up.

50:21.660 --> 50:26.160
So anyway, there's this whole thing going on, of course, the internet forums, the reddits,

50:26.160 --> 50:27.160
all that places.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.640
Uh, PC players are finding out that if they've cheated, they're getting banned.

50:30.640 --> 50:34.180
And the usual types of ban evasions aren't working.

50:34.180 --> 50:36.840
Like they're trying to change their IP addresses.

50:36.840 --> 50:37.840
Nope.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.840
Use a secondary account.

50:38.840 --> 50:39.840
Nope.

50:39.840 --> 50:45.940
It does appear that Apex Legends is actually using some type of hardware ID ban.

50:45.940 --> 50:50.780
So they know your computer specs, and so that is, I don't know if it's like a Mac address

50:50.780 --> 50:54.140
reading or what they're doing, but they're doing a hardware ID ban.

50:54.140 --> 50:55.500
They drink and they know things.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.020
So there's a whole Reddit thread that goes on.

50:58.020 --> 50:59.020
Nothing's perfect.

50:59.020 --> 51:00.020
They'll find a way to edit.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.900
Well, we'll see.

51:01.900 --> 51:06.020
But it's really funny to read, there's this Reddit thread going on, there's like 19 edits

51:06.020 --> 51:09.980
on the thread with this guy on Twitch who's screaming.

51:09.980 --> 51:13.540
And he's like, he got banned for the second time in 10 minutes.

51:13.540 --> 51:15.660
And then he says, I didn't use my personal info anywhere.

51:15.660 --> 51:16.660
That's the frustrating part.

51:16.660 --> 51:19.100
I'm going to run every single fucking cleaner I have.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.400
And then he rebooted the PC.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.900
And then he says, all right, I guess I have to find a new game to cheat on until I get

51:23.900 --> 51:25.380
a working spoofer again.

51:25.380 --> 51:26.380
That's edit five.

51:26.380 --> 51:27.380
And then it keeps going.

51:27.380 --> 51:28.380
I'll be back tomorrow.

51:28.380 --> 51:29.380
You better fucking believe it.

51:29.380 --> 51:30.380
It's just a soft bet.

51:30.380 --> 51:31.380
Da da da.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.380
And they edit seven.

51:32.380 --> 51:33.380
Apex can suck my dick.

51:33.380 --> 51:34.380
They can't keep me out.

51:34.380 --> 51:39.540
What people don't understand is that they're so fucking big they can't control everywhere.

51:39.540 --> 51:43.260
Seeing this guy get owned makes me so happy.

51:43.260 --> 51:48.360
Like you're not wanted in this game by.

51:48.360 --> 51:52.820
Don't let the door hit you.

51:52.820 --> 51:55.620
Makes me happy.

51:55.620 --> 51:57.100
I mean, what is very satisfying?

51:57.100 --> 52:01.120
I just want to go in the comments and just fuss at them or laugh.

52:01.120 --> 52:05.820
Just nothing but like as many characters as it would let me is ha.

52:05.820 --> 52:09.540
God, some of these edits are crazy.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.900
Dishonesty isn't toxic, but OK, I'm not toxic.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.620
All I do is kill people.

52:15.620 --> 52:17.140
Wow.

52:17.140 --> 52:18.460
Anyway.

52:18.460 --> 52:19.720
Ah.

52:19.720 --> 52:24.680
So anyway, I'm I'm I'm really glad to hear that they've found a way to like make at least

52:24.680 --> 52:28.660
ban them harder than they have been doing historically.

52:28.660 --> 52:34.100
Well, yeah, because, you know, again, it's one thing to cheat in a single player game.

52:34.100 --> 52:35.340
It's it's one thing to cheat co-op.

52:35.340 --> 52:37.820
If everybody knows that they're signing up for it, then whatever.

52:37.820 --> 52:38.820
Right.

52:38.820 --> 52:42.420
But it's another thing to go into these one versus 100 type of games is what apex is and

52:42.420 --> 52:44.900
flex your opinion, which is fake.

52:44.900 --> 52:45.980
It's Viagra.

52:45.980 --> 52:46.980
It's fake.

52:46.980 --> 52:49.380
It's a fake pain because you're cheating to do it.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.500
And you know, for what?

52:50.500 --> 52:55.860
To just, you know, yeah, I won, except I can't win without cheating because I have no skills.

52:55.860 --> 52:56.860
Yeah.

52:56.860 --> 52:57.860
Look at how awesome I am.

52:57.860 --> 52:59.940
I don't understand what L.O.

52:59.940 --> 53:03.260
How does that make you feel good that you beat people, but you suck?

53:03.260 --> 53:06.480
I don't understand how that works or it's L.O.L.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.340
I ruined all these people's day.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.700
They're probably sitting there crying.

53:10.700 --> 53:13.460
Who's crying now?

53:13.460 --> 53:14.460
Who's crying now?

53:14.460 --> 53:16.580
I need some tea to sip right now.

53:16.580 --> 53:17.580
You are.

53:17.580 --> 53:18.580
Oh.

53:18.580 --> 53:19.580
Yep.

53:19.580 --> 53:20.580
Fuck cheaters.

53:20.580 --> 53:21.580
All right.

53:21.580 --> 53:25.540
Anyhow, let's move on.

53:25.540 --> 53:26.540
Dark Sakura.

53:26.540 --> 53:31.540
Well, finally, finally, finally, finally, you can change your PSN ID.

53:31.540 --> 53:40.020
It actually is live now for North America, Europe and Australia for anyone on the PS4.

53:40.020 --> 53:45.620
Some games may have issues after you change your ID, but you need to make sure that some

53:45.620 --> 53:49.800
of the games, you know, if they're big games that you have a worry about, you need to make

53:49.800 --> 53:52.260
sure that they're going to be fine with the name change.

53:52.260 --> 53:58.660
A lot of the big ones like Fortnite, Destiny 2, those are fine.

53:58.660 --> 54:02.460
So basically it, you know, a lot of people have asked for it.

54:02.460 --> 54:09.140
People will put like, like, I'm trying to think of like a really crappy username, like

54:09.340 --> 54:10.340
Rob Roberts.

54:10.340 --> 54:11.340
No.

54:12.340 --> 54:18.340
Oh, you mean like a shitty toilet person type of name like, like, um, like lead hacks or

54:18.340 --> 54:19.340
101.

54:19.340 --> 54:20.340
Okay.

54:20.340 --> 54:26.780
And then decide, oh no, I actually want to be like, like just cool guy number two.

54:26.780 --> 54:28.780
Reformed troll 101.

54:28.780 --> 54:29.780
Oh yeah.

54:29.780 --> 54:34.980
Like, or, you know, have someone's ex go in and change your name to angry crusty bridge

54:34.980 --> 54:35.980
troll.

54:35.980 --> 54:37.180
You know, something like that.

54:37.220 --> 54:38.980
I'm sure someone actually is that.

54:38.980 --> 54:39.980
Oh, perfect.

54:39.980 --> 54:41.980
X, X Sephiroth 420 X, X.

54:41.980 --> 54:42.980
Perfect.

54:42.980 --> 54:43.980
Perfect example.

54:44.980 --> 54:50.980
Anyway, um, the first time that you change it, it is free, but it will cost you afterwards.

54:50.980 --> 54:54.980
Um, $10, um, or eight pounds.

54:54.980 --> 55:00.980
Uh, if, if you just have a regular account, if you're plus, then it's five or four pounds,

55:00.980 --> 55:02.980
$5 or four pounds.

55:02.980 --> 55:06.940
So you can change it as much as you want.

55:06.940 --> 55:11.540
You can always revert back to any previous version of your ID for free.

55:11.540 --> 55:18.100
If you contact PlayStation support, no one can take your old IDs so you can choose to

55:18.100 --> 55:21.340
display your old ID next to your new one for up to 30 days so that your friends will know

55:21.340 --> 55:23.660
it was you doesn't do good.

55:23.660 --> 55:30.340
If you were trying to hide who you were, child accounts cannot change their ID.

55:30.740 --> 55:37.740
So, you know, if you have, you know, mommy's a little gamer girl, 23 cause it's her 23rd,

55:37.740 --> 55:42.540
you know, gamer girl child, she can't go, God damn, this name sucks, mom.

55:42.540 --> 55:46.340
I want it to be blood rage woman, you know, or something like that.

55:46.340 --> 55:47.340
She can't do it.

55:47.340 --> 55:49.740
So I would have blood rage woman though.

55:49.740 --> 55:51.740
Just saying, of course you would.

55:51.740 --> 55:55.740
I would just have, here's, here's the thing though on PlayStation.

55:55.940 --> 56:00.740
Like, I don't, I don't like the gamer tags or the usernames, whatever they call them.

56:00.740 --> 56:03.740
I don't like, because I can never remember who's who.

56:03.740 --> 56:05.140
Some of them are obvious.

56:05.140 --> 56:08.540
Like when I see Bobby Black Wolf, like I know who that fucking is.

56:08.540 --> 56:09.040
Right.

56:09.040 --> 56:14.540
And usually like if your name kind of matches misty, OLR, I know who that is because that's

56:14.540 --> 56:18.840
her name every single place, which bless you for having OLR in your name in the first place.

56:18.840 --> 56:23.240
But, um, you know, there's some people where it's like their one name here, their one name

56:23.240 --> 56:26.240
on PlayStation, their one name in Twitch chat, their one name over here, which, you know,

56:26.240 --> 56:26.840
it's your life.

56:26.840 --> 56:30.840
You are welcomed as many identities as you want, but I can't keep them all together.

56:30.840 --> 56:35.840
So I love Facebook's name implementation where you can trade.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.440
I don't.

56:36.440 --> 56:40.840
And so that way, oh, because you don't, because you don't use a fake name on Facebook like

56:40.840 --> 56:41.840
I do.

56:41.840 --> 56:42.840
So I don't care who knows.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.840
Well, no, no, no.

56:43.840 --> 56:51.140
I, I have, I don't really want to say this live, but I know plenty of people who Facebook's

56:51.140 --> 56:54.940
name policy is highly detrimental to their safety.

56:54.940 --> 56:56.740
Oh, we've talked about this on the show before.

56:56.740 --> 56:57.740
Sure.

56:57.740 --> 56:58.740
Especially, especially in the trans community.

56:58.740 --> 57:03.440
That's why I don't like to have a single name like that.

57:03.440 --> 57:06.540
I would rather people, people be able to have a handle.

57:06.540 --> 57:07.540
Well, okay.

57:07.540 --> 57:11.700
But to be fair, like, here's the thing I w when it comes to like your Facebook name,

57:11.700 --> 57:15.740
you and the friend have to agree to show each other the name.

57:15.740 --> 57:17.940
So like randos don't see it.

57:17.940 --> 57:22.740
So like I, I, and usually I'm the one to do it cause I'm using a fake name on Facebook

57:22.740 --> 57:23.740
anyway.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.240
Um, I will go reach out.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.240
I'm like, who is this?

57:26.240 --> 57:29.440
And I'll just go do a close friend request and see if they accept it.

57:29.440 --> 57:30.440
And most of the times they do.

57:30.440 --> 57:32.940
And then I'm like, oh, it's this person.

57:32.940 --> 57:36.540
And then you see their Facebook, uh, picture and I'm like, okay, it's that person.

57:36.540 --> 57:44.740
Now I know who it is because I had no clue who X, X, X, Sephiroth 42069, uh, weed.king.com,

57:44.740 --> 57:47.740
X, X, X is like, I had no idea who that was.

57:47.740 --> 57:49.740
And now that guy sounds so awesome though.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.940
Well, the problem was he probably picked that name when he was 13.

57:51.940 --> 57:53.840
He couldn't change it till yesterday.

57:53.840 --> 57:59.940
So it's like, you know, perhaps the two triple X is, it's a bit much.

57:59.940 --> 58:07.040
I sure really only done one triple X, but if you triple, triple X, then does that mean

58:07.040 --> 58:09.140
like extra fun times?

58:09.140 --> 58:10.140
Yes.

58:10.140 --> 58:14.140
It doesn't sound fun to me.

58:14.140 --> 58:15.140
Interesting.

58:15.140 --> 58:17.040
I'm, I'm getting some comments in chat.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.140
I'm reading like Bobby's, um, story.

58:19.140 --> 58:24.740
Cause you know, he has, I think on, on, uh, uh, one of the services, he has a name that

58:24.740 --> 58:28.500
a lot of people really want cause the very like common more thing.

58:28.500 --> 58:32.740
And like he's been offered money to get off that name so that other people could use that,

58:32.740 --> 58:36.840
you know, on Twitter when my, cause I, you know, y'all know I changed my Twitter account

58:36.840 --> 58:37.840
like six months ago.

58:37.840 --> 58:42.300
So I'm now Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter because I just don't use the online name sky as much

58:42.300 --> 58:46.100
anymore, which I realize is in the intro to our show, but at some point we'll get our

58:46.100 --> 58:47.100
intro updated.

58:47.100 --> 58:51.580
But, um, when I had, because I've had my Twitter account for 12 years and I know that cause

58:51.580 --> 58:53.200
I got one of the memory things the other day.

58:53.200 --> 58:56.700
So when I first went on Twitter, I got on Twitter really early and my username was at

58:56.700 --> 59:01.160
S K I E at a four letter name, pretty hard to get right.

59:01.160 --> 59:04.700
And I would have people tweet me like, can I have your name?

59:04.700 --> 59:10.040
Um, no, this is apparently like, especially in some other cultures overseas, that's like

59:10.040 --> 59:14.160
people's like legit first name is S K I E and stuff, but it's like, no, I picked it

59:14.160 --> 59:15.160
first.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.160
Sorry.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.380
You know, this is my identity online.

59:17.380 --> 59:18.720
You know, this is my name too.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.400
And in a sense I can't.

59:20.400 --> 59:26.760
So what I did when I went onto Mr. Rob Roberts, I tried to grab sky back as fast as I could

59:26.760 --> 59:31.920
because my plan was I would let that name go when I could get at Rob Roberts, which

59:31.920 --> 59:33.560
is spammers sitting on right now.

59:33.560 --> 59:37.840
I couldn't get it back because Twitter won't let you get an account name under five or

59:37.840 --> 59:39.280
six letters anymore.

59:39.280 --> 59:41.360
So nobody can have that name anyway.

59:41.360 --> 59:45.560
So anyway, you were the last, I was the, I was the first and the last.

59:45.560 --> 59:49.840
I get people asking me for dark Sakura and I'm like, fuck, you know, no, it's my name.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.660
We have OLR.

59:51.660 --> 59:52.660
We do.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.660
We do have OLR on Twitter.

59:53.660 --> 59:54.660
And that's a three.

59:54.660 --> 59:55.660
And why would I let that go?

59:55.660 --> 59:56.660
Yeah.

59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.040
So even, even if the show were to end someday, it would still be an archive of all the episodes

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.240
of this show that ever had existed.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:10.560
It's going to be, no, it's going to be inherited by like Julian and all the cool kids.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.520
Honestly that's where this is headed is that there'll probably be a gen two of OLR at some

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520
point.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.880
So, and I'm okay with that.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.880
Yeah.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880
Why not?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880
I'm going to be doing this when I'm 90.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.960
I'm going to be like, just like Iris Apfel with my big huge ass glasses and just be like,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960
fuck you.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Games suck.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.600
Well, it's like, it's like we've got this record now.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.480
Like we've been doing this video game podcast fee thing longer than anybody else can consistently

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.760
like weekly, you know, some people are really close and I'm sure would love to see us hang

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.680
up, hang up our hats, but it's like, it's one of those things where, you know, in a

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.180
friendly competitive way, nobody's really like cutthroat.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.960
But I, I it's, it's one of those things where it's like, it's so such a habit.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.880
How can we ever stop?

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.080
What would I do on my Sunday nights?

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080
Watch Game of Thrones.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
Not for much longer.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.080
I can't even do that much longer.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.920
You have to watch the Game of Thrones prequel that they'll do.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.520
I know, you know, now the thing I see like all now is like the memes, it's all the Game

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.720
of Thrones fans.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.320
There's tons of memes on here already.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.840
Well, no, but they put these memes out there that say, nobody cares that you don't watch

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.160
Game of Thrones, asshole, let us have our moment.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.020
And I'm like, okay, wait a minute though.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.400
Like I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I don't like, I'm not shitting on people who

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400
do.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.960
I feel a meme from a friend of mine or a friend of ours, I guess I should say, but everyone

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.280
who's going out going, well, I don't watch it.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280
I don't watch it.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280
I don't like good for you.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.720
Literally no one cares, but I, it's, it's a Cersei quote, every breath you draw in my

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.500
presence annoys me, but, but why can't I say I don't watch it?

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.260
Like it's not like, it's one thing to say, I don't watch it.

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.780
It's another thing you like you'd be, Oh, I don't watch it, you know, but other people

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.860
who make a big fucking deal and it's not watching it, it's, it's, here's the thing.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:06.060
It's when it implied I don't watch it and people who do are stupid.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.140
That's then I get that.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.520
Be mad at that because let people enjoy things.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520
Just let people enjoy things.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520
And I'm all about that.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.220
But like when people like expect me to know Game of Thrones, it's so noisy when people

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.480
like things, when people expect me to know Game of Thrones or I'm not a real nerd, I'm

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.540
like, okay, real nerd.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.980
You want to talk about why I haven't been watching Game of Thrones?

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.780
Cause I do this other thing online, Sunday nights with literally half of my fucking life.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.660
So you want to talk, you want to talk about nerd?

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660
We'll talk about nerd.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.660
I'll do this.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.660
Have you read the books?

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.660
There's that too.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.660
Have you read the books?

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.980
Did you see the four hour version of Dune?

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.260
But what was your first movie?

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.220
Mine was fucking Star Wars and I was nine months fucking old.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:57.020
For the record, if you're watching the Game of Thrones and you're having a good time,

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020
the hats off.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.020
Enjoy it.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.020
Live it up.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.100
Embrace your nerd passion.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.100
Love it.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.220
Um, and I hope, I hope everybody dies because that's what seems to happen every week on

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.780
that show and people lose their shit.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780
So they like it.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780
Right?

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.780
I only literally care about one character that I don't want to die.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:16.420
Anyway, actually three, three characters, uh, Akuma JP in chat says Game of Thrones,

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.140
too much sex for me.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140
There is.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.140
I think that's what I think.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.620
I know.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:24.180
I know you're from another part of the world, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.820
about like America.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.220
I think that's why nerds like it.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.220
Just just an inquiry.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.660
I honestly, I just wait and fast forward pass all the shit I don't want to see because I'm

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:36.660
not into it.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.660
I'm, I'm ace.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.660
I don't like the gory stuff.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.500
It doesn't add to anything watching this like, okay, good.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500
They fucked.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500
Whatever.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500
Yeah.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.040
You, you would just rather see the black screen that says, and then they fuck.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.300
But both sex, both sex.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740
That's the thing in Game of Thrones.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.740
You watch this.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.740
Don't you?

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.740
I watch Game of Thrones.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.740
Of course.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.740
Of course.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.740
I could know.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.740
Of course.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740
That's, I called it on demand, dude.

01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.740
I mean, geez.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740
Like watch it later.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740
Okay.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.740
But I shipped it on the ship.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740
Aha.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.740
Okay.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.740
Here's the thing.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740
Yes.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740
That's the number one thing I get told by all the Game of Thrones fans.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.740
Oh, you did something.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:09.740
So now watch it on demand.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.140
I got two reasons for you.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.540
Number one, have you seen my on demand cue lately?

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.300
Did you, did you miss the memo that like fucking everything went to on demand sometime

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.300
ago?

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.300
Like respectfully.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300
There's just a ton of shit to watch.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.060
This is why I'd watch jack shit.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.460
So that when something really awesome is out, I can watch it.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.440
Number two, because there's so many of you that enjoy it and that's cool too.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.900
You all have spoiled it by the next day.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.300
Like I literally saw a tweet earlier that said, if you don't want Game of Thrones spoiled

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.660
for you, then stay off Twitter at night.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660
That's what I'm doing.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.380
This is the exact same person who said, I'm looking for spoilers right now.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.380
Don't don't.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.380
Obviously we all know not to say them on air.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.380
If you want to seek them out.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.380
That's one thing.

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.380
I'm doing it.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.380
I'm looking for them.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380
Go for it.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:55.820
But, um, I was gonna say, um, uh, this is the exact same person who then says, if you

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.740
brag about how you don't watch Game of Thrones, you're an asshole.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.200
And I'm kind of like, you can't have it both ways, sis.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.660
How are the rest of us supposed to watch Game of Thrones when you're sitting here going,

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:12.980
but I'm going to spoil it as soon as it airs and it's your, you can't have it both ways.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580
Anyway.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.580
Sorry.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.580
It is a video game show.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.580
I don't know why.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.340
Well, I also didn't really care for chair of swords because I tried reading the first

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.340
book in the first book.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.260
Actually, I literally hated everybody.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.860
I hated everybody for like the first three seasons.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:29.420
Ooh, you're edgy because you don't like Game of Thrones.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:36.500
But then I discovered characters I liked and then saw the ones I hated die or about to

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.500
die.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500
So it's like Mass Effect kind of.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500
Yeah, it is kind of like that.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500
All right.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.500
Moving on.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Let's get back to games.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.020
I'm happy.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.580
I don't know how we went from PS4 name changes to Game of Thrones podcast waiting for my

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.260
fucking $20 burrito.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.700
Let's move on.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:56.060
Let's talk about a world where the Vita is still getting games.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.060
Wow.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.060
Physical games.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.620
So, uh, was it Nasalis?

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.620
I think that's how you pronounce it.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:08.380
They're publishing a couple of physical copies or physical versions of a thousand one spikes

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.700
and VVVVVV.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.820
I love this box art for VVVV.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:15.720
I wish I'd had the forethought to make a video thing I could put on Twitch.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.260
I love the VVVVV cover because that looks like an old Commodore 64 cartridge.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260
Yeah.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.140
It looks like if you guys have seen like old Commodore 64 cartridges with like it's like

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.580
the same font and design and everything.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580
It's gorgeous.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.580
Yes.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.580
So, I mean, I it's awesome.

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.780
I don't have a Vita anymore, so.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.740
But yeah, I love the box art.

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.540
I know that came out for other systems.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.580
I'm surprised they're not publishing on other systems, too.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.580
Thousand one spikes, to be clear, though, is actually a PlayStation 4 version.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.780
So Vita is getting VVVV.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:50.860
But yeah, it's pretty awesome to see those physical versions.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.220
And this, I don't think I don't believe this is actually by Limited Run either.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.100
So this is actually being published by Nasalis.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.380
So coming soon, apparently they did leak out early to the promo, promo copies that they

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.900
had been floating to like Sony employees had somehow made it to eBay.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.220
It's still a collectible of sorts, really, at this point.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.960
So that's pretty cool.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.660
Over in chat, Renji221 asked, what's a Vita?

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.140
Well, put up a chair, Sony, and let me tell you a story.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.980
One day, Sony thought they'd compete with Nintendo in a handheld space.

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.740
So that's almost worth being $20 or $13.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.740
Don't interrupt grandpa's story with your burrito.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.740
You know what?

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.740
It's a burrito and it's delicious.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.740
No one cares because they're not eating it.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.740
Discrito, burrito.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:36.140
Yeah, you need to be a little more discrito with that burrito.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660
All right.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.660
Other comments in chat.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660
Let's see.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.100
Oh, Akuma JP in chat says, I'm playing Stardew for the first time on iOS.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.460
So bye bye free time.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.460
Yeah, that happens.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:52.220
It's interesting how we discover big games after the fact.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.260
And sometimes it's because it's on a platform, you know, the right platform that we want

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260
to play it on.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.180
Who knows what big games I have in my Steam library that I've never played.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.980
I know there's hundreds of them.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:09.140
So I thought there was something you could use to like, look at the, like, it's coming.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.160
Look at your library and see what you haven't played.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.160
It's coming soon.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.620
That's an update to the Steam store.

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.620
Oh boy.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.620
Library.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.620
I can't wait to see that.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:17.860
We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860
Okay.

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860
Yeah.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860
I thought that was the thing that come up recently.

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:21.860
All right.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.860
Anyway.

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.860
All right.

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.860
Uh, moving on.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:31.220
Let's, uh, talk about our next story, which has to do with a, uh, leaked little, uh, information,

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:38.300
little sheet of information about the disc free Xbox one, uh, a site called win future

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:43.320
got images that show off the, and take it with a grain of salt because people are weird

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.260
and do photo shops and all that stuff.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:50.980
But I mean, we have heard so much buzz around the, this, like nothing is shocking with this.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.560
I wouldn't be talking about it if it wasn't one of those.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.420
This is, we know that Microsoft has been headed this way where there's smoke, there's fire.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.780
But anyway, but some of the specifics, somebody could be fucking with us, but they're probably

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.940
not to be fair.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:09.140
So anyway, uh, the design is what looks like an Xbox one S, but there's just no drive on

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.140
it.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.140
How about that?

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.900
Uh, it made it much smaller though without the drive in there.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.820
Cause you would think that the drive takes up quite a bit of space.

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:17.820
Yeah.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.620
You'd think, I don't know why they decided to still keep it the same.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.540
Assuming that that's legit because that totally looks like someone just photoshopped out the,

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.020
uh, you know, actual drive image.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.380
So maybe that's you that maybe it isn't legit.

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.140
Whatever dude, like really like a month away from it apparently being released.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:35.260
Well, it's supposed to have a one terabyte hard drive and the Europe version, cause I

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:39.580
think that's the version that actually leaked out the Europe version we'll have for Forza

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.300
horizon three.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.140
It should be noted that four is the current one.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.020
So it's an older one, but Forza horizon three Minecraft and sea of thieves will already

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.020
be installed.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.380
So you have something like old three though.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.420
It's still a good game if you're new to the universe because they want you to play and

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.260
enjoy three and then, Oh, click this button to purchase for now or buy X-Box game pass

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.420
for only XYZ a month and or that should just be ABC a year.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:12.220
Just with withhold the games, like withhold actually purchasing, you know, or including

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.220
like additional games.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.220
You're like cut that game out.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.220
Like how much is that game worth?

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:21.100
I mean like 20 bucks maybe well 30 but I think these, I don't think they're, I, I feel like

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:26.260
the price they're charging for it, which by the way is, is speculated to be 230 euros

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.100
or $260 is what that translates to.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.540
So like just cut the cost out of there and just like throw a few months in is that I

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.900
think these are kind of freebies.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:37.660
I think Microsoft, I don't think Microsoft isn't is inflating the price.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.860
I think they're throwing in these freebies to make that price a little more like lucrative.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:47.020
Oh, I'm saying is they should do game pass instead of at one of the games.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:51.300
You know what I would do, I would support that because you know, Minecraft is one of

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.760
the games that's supposed to be in there as well, you know, eventually.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.560
So why not just do game pass so you get the fours of game and the other one and see if

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.080
these, I think all those game pass games actually.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.720
So just game pass, no game, I don't know.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720
All right.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.640
Well, anyhow, that is apparently what's going to happen.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.320
They're saying April 16th is the unveiling, which would be like Tuesday.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.960
Is there a, is there a, is there like an inside Xbox plan pretty soon?

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960
I don't know.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.440
I don't remember either, but April 16th about is supposed to be the day that this shows

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.960
up and they're saying May 7th will be the release.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.960
So this is all supposed to be kind of wrapped up by E3.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.240
So this isn't something they're planning to unveil at E3, I guess.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240
So yeah, we'll have to see.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240
Interesting.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240
Yeah, we will.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.800
Yeah, actually they do have, it says an all new episode of inside Xbox on Tuesday, April

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.540
16th at 2 PM or 5, 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern time.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.540
There you go.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.480
That date matches up with what we're hearing here.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.880
Latest news on E3, including Xbox Fan Fest and more.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.680
So there you go, possibly then.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.080
That will probably be the day we get the specifics, if anything.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.800
So tune in if that's your thing, I guess.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800
Yeah.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800
Yeah.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800
Cool.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.120
Um, I also want to point out in our chat, our Renji221 in chat says, honestly, I think

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.620
Horizon 3 is better than 4, but that's just me.

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.480
That's an interesting kind of perspective is that maybe 3 is the better, 3 did have

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480
the Hot Wheels thing.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.200
Does this have all the expansions?

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.080
Cause maybe that, is it 4 is Horizon 3 with the expansions?

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.800
Cause that would be pretty rad because that Hot Wheels was pretty cool and maybe, maybe

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.520
they, maybe some folks think 3 is the better representative.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.520
Who knows?

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.520
Who knows?

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.520
All right.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.040
Anyhow, uh, let's move on with Dark Sakura.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.160
Well, for fans of, uh, the Star Wars prequel, some looks like something kind of good is

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:47.360
coming out of it because the rest of it was kind of shit, but the pod race was cool.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.280
Well, there is a game coming out called Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.320
That's a third person action adventure game coming up by Respawn will be on X-Box 4, X-Box

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.600
1 and PC on Origin.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:06.880
Um, because EA is publishing it, um, it's going to be $59.99 standard $69.99 deluxe,

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.400
but it also has like a director's cut that shows like behind the scenes stuff and content

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.520
and you know, some cosmetic stuff.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.440
But I just like the, um, the, uh, story like that's actually what has me interested is

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.000
that you play someone who escaped the, uh, order 66 to kill all the Jedi.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's like, it's, what's funny is about like all these games that are based in the prequel

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.960
era or like literally everything that's come out of Star Wars that's in the prequel era

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.720
is better than the actual prequels.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720
Exactly.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720
But I don't know.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.760
I always thought I, I, I used to be in a tabletop game where we played, you know, remnants of

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.800
the Jedi order and it was, it was a fun thing.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.640
So just to see like my old tabletop game kind of coming to life just was really, really

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640
kind of cool.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.880
So, um, it's a shame you can't like actually customize your character, you know, do whatever,

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
but whatever.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:03.280
Um, it has, I'm going to mispronounce this name, Cameron Monahan from Gotham Monahan,

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.960
I think, but close, get close.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960
But anyway.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.960
Cool.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960
Anyway, I thought I'd make a mention.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960
It has droids.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960
It has lightsabers.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960
Yeah.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.760
So you know what has me more excited, honestly, than anything else about this, the fact that

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.100
Respawn's making it and Respawn is like a studio to watch right now because Titanfall,

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.120
you know, was pretty, especially Titanfall, it's Titanfall 2, a lot of people slept on.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.980
And of course, Apex Legends is like the hot shit in gaming right now.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.560
So the fact that they're the folks that are making the Star Wars game, which many people

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.640
have also been going, what the fuck is EA doing with the Star Wars?

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.200
Titanfall 2 had a pretty great single player campaign.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.640
So I hear, haven't played it yet, own it, but still haven't played it yet.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.880
Talk that up to your inventory, but that would be your origin backlog as well as your

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880
Steam backlog.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.360
That's my PlayStation backlog, actually.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.440
And on top of this, the trailer looks really freaking good.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.120
I mean, it's pretty beautiful.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.120
So we'll see what happens.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.900
Here's our chance to talk about, I know it's a gaming podcast, but why not?

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.300
We already had one tangent tonight.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.960
I'm sure a lot of nerds watching the Star Wars celebration have some thoughts and feelings.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.320
Like I have to admit, I haven't, okay, I've been a really bad Star Wars fan.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.680
I still haven't seen episode eight.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.160
I like, that's like on my to-do list.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.440
I need to see it.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:18.120
But I did watch the episode nine trailer and I got verklempt when I saw Carrie Fisher.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.520
That was the number one thing I noticed.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520
Yeah.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520
I mean, yeah.

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.520
Ray jumping over the pod thing.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.920
That was badass too.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920
But like...

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
TIE fighter.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
It's called the TIE fighter.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920
Yeah, whatever.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.800
The thingy, the space space plane.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.060
TIE fighter.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.060
It's like...

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.520
When she jumped over the space plane, I was like, and it looked like I saw a great side

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.240
by side comparison on Twitter.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.600
That Hitchcock movie North by Northwest when the plane comes in.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.600
There's a great side by side.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600
Like that scene looks like that.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.680
Yes, I loved when he did a back flip with his lightsaber over the...

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680
Shut the fuck up.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680
No, no, no, no.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:54.720
But, but the thing is that the movies actually do take from like some of the cinematic greats.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.760
Like the whole Rashomon storytelling when it came to Luke's flashbacks.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.360
Oh, wait.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.360
Okay.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.160
You need to see that one because it has the Rashomon style flashbacks.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160
Okay.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.440
And basically you see the same scene from different perspectives.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.640
Oh, um, God, who does that a lot in their movies?

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.200
God, that's like a Tarantino thing actually, Pulp Fiction was kind of that.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.320
No, but this is like exactly the same moment from different perspectives.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.720
So you have, you'll have to see it, but basically the entirety, I believe it was Rashomon that

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720
was told that way.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
It's Kurosawa.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.720
I mean...

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720
Who's that famous director?

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.480
I think, um, um, his first movie was Phantom of the Paradise.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.960
That's how all the cult movie people know him.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.600
De Palma does that.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.360
Like he does the split screen thing.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360
Like, okay.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360
Oh, not the same.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
Okay.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.000
It's basically it, it is interjected at different points.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.320
Now I think all of Rashomon was told this way where you have everybody at the same event

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.920
that different their own perspective on it, but this comes in at key points in the movie

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.260
as it pushes the narrative, as you get more story and perspective on it, but it's still

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.440
exactly the same scene.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:05.880
So, but yeah, there's lots of wonderful, wonderful, um, just different.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.680
And cinematic quotes, I like to call them, you know, in art, when you see someone refer

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.600
to the same art style as someone else or something from another painting, it's called a quote.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.040
These are definitely quotes back to, you know, other theatrical grades.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.440
Can I do a really random thing?

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440
Cause you talked about art.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.560
Can I do a really random thing?

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.320
Cause this is something like I should have done like six months ago on Twitch.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.320
This is going to be a Twitch thing.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.320
Okay.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.400
And I apologize to the podcast listeners for this, but this is very important.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.120
Can you help me fill time here while I go grab something?

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120
Um, sure.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.600
I'm just making sure that it is the story that I'm thinking of, that it is Rashomon.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.640
Um, that's the short story I'm looking for the movie.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.960
Um, but yeah, the, uh, the movie Rashomon, yeah, that's the one I think is the, uh, the

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.840
one where they tell it a different, yeah, different, uh, levels of the story.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.240
And it's another one with Mihone in it, so.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.880
So since you brought up art, I've never been able to show this and I'm so happy I can now.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.960
This is an example, this is one of my mom's paintings.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.160
And so we have a whole collection of paintings.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160
No, this is a good, this is fine.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160
This is fine.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.360
Uh, there's a whole collection of paintings that she made, um, before she passed, you

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.240
know, cause she was a painter like her whole life.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.600
So I've never been able to show these on the show before and I just thought I would now

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.960
that we're on Twitch.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960
So what's that?

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960
Nothing.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960
Oh yeah.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.760
So anyway, I just thought I would, uh, show that.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.720
And I love this painting too cause it's cats.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.920
And so she made this with me and mine just so we're clear.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.320
I like the penguin one.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.280
Yes, there's a pink one that's hung up in the hall though, so I can't exactly take that

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.360
one down.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.960
And for those who don't know, by the way, what Russian one is, there is what the poster

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.960
looks like.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:49.280
So anyway, but yeah, I, that's been the big kind of nerdy thing for me enjoying the, um,

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:55.760
the movies though, is that there really are some wonderful callbacks to just really beautiful

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.840
movies and just the storytelling.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.800
I'm super happy with it, but just like, you know, you were mentioning the one throwback

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:08.000
for North by Northwest, which I do believe that the titles for North by Northwest were

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.680
done by Saul Bass.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.440
Let me double check, which is everyone know he's one of my heroes.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.680
Yeah, I think it was Saul Bass.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.680
Yup.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.400
It was Saul Bass who also did the man with golden arm and a man with the silver arm,

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.680
sorry, and, uh, Vertigo.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.720
And he directed the shower scene in Psycho and actually when it came out that he did

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.440
Hitchcock said he would never talk to him again.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
Anyway.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.520
Uh, anyways, yeah, we, we, uh, before we move on to the next gaming story, anything Star

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.320
Wars related that anyone wants to get out about everything around this celebration.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320
I'm looking for it in the movie.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:48.040
Yeah, the movie very much because the last two movies are kind of, but the new movie

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040
looks awesome.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
The movies were great.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.640
Wait, when we say the last two movies, do we mean spinoffs or do we mean seven and eight,

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640
seven, eight?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Okay.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640
Cause there were no prequels.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.680
So basically remakes of the first two original.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.680
No.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.880
Well, I, people, people have their different opinions, so we'll see.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.800
I still haven't seen eight, but I liked seven.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.960
I did definitely see the parallels to the original in seven, but I still really liked

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.040
seven for what it was, for what it's worth.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:17.140
Um, I will say the thing that definitely has my attention, that's kind of tangential to

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:21.720
Star Wars, this whole Disney plus and their competitor to Netflix.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.600
Like it seems like Disney is like ready to come out the gate with this Disney plus thing

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.120
it's pretty loaded with stuff.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.000
I got to say, I'm not looking forward to having yet another subscription, but I have a weird

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.960
feeling that the marketplace is going to force some of these things to consolidate before

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.080
too long.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.240
Just like Spotify and Hulu have kind of joined forces here.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.680
I think you're going to start to see more of that stuff show up.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.280
I'm looking forward to Hawkeye series.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280
Oh yeah.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.680
Cause that's a Disney thing, huh?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.680
Yeah.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.120
Well it's Marvel, but, um, but it's going to be taking, um, it said that like one of

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.640
my favorite comic characters who was like the girl who took over as Hawkeye while he

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.040
was dead in the comics, Kate Bishop, she's supposed to be in it too.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.040
So that'd be really awesome.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.040
All right.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.160
Well meanwhile, we'll also look forward to whatever Lucasville's games is working on

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.920
because that was a story a couple of weeks ago that Lucasville's games apparently making

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920
the comeback.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.920
All right.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.920
Well, anyhow, let's move on.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.040
We have a couple more stories before we get to our classic segment of the week or is it

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.400
month this week?

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400
Uh, Loki.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400
Yeah.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:22.600
So there's a rumor that the next, uh, Assassin's Creed game has been teased in the division

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.780
two.

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:29.940
Apparently there's a poster that can be found inside the Potomac events center.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:36.480
And one of those shows the title Valhalla, which of course, uh, features kind of a Viking

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.520
character in there.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.660
They are saying that the Viking appears to be grasping the apple of Eden, which they

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:51.620
says the main plot device, and that, uh, apparently the following, um, or following Assassin's

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.300
Creed Odyssey, the next game is going to be set in the Viking age.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.700
I think it's just kind of a guess, but maybe, I mean, it seems plausible since they were

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.500
kind of using my word since, since, since, you know, they kind of threw in, I think some

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.860
like Greek mythology stuff with the last one.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:06.860
So why not?

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:12.300
It fits the Assassin's Creed kind of M O and Vikings is not something they've explored

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.300
yet.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.300
Right.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.300
We haven't had a game in that.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.860
So it fits the, the, the mold, let's say, and would, I think it's something people would

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.860
be interested in.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.700
I know that even though I'm not super into the Assassin's Creed games, I know that what

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.260
I want to happen, if this is the direction for Assassin's Creed, is that if my character

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:31.140
gets defeated in Assassin's Creed, I want to have a Viking funeral.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.860
I think that would be fantastic.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:37.060
So I hope that plea, as long as a Viking funeral, which, you know, of course is when they put

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.740
you on a boat, say you have to see, and then light the boat on fire where they're shooting

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:40.980
all the arrows at it.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.740
That is what I hope to see reflected in this game.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.740
Okay.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.220
Well, you don't want to see a Viking funeral?

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:47.220
No.

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:50.900
I know someone who did that for their cat.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.580
That's kind of, I don't know.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.580
I don't know.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.580
It's weird.

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.820
It's a little, I guess if that's what helped them through it, that was also a Norwegian

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.820
forest cat.

01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:58.820
Oh, okay.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.260
So there's a reason for it.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260
Yeah.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.260
Interesting.

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.260
Okay.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.260
All right.

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.260
Uh, all right.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.260
I just like sitting cats on fire.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.260
So I know their cat was dead.

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:08.260
That was already deceased.

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.140
Didn't say the cat wasn't alive.

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.420
Right.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.700
One more completely different topic here.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:19.740
Before we get to the classic game segment, actually, um, I think it would be appropriate

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.200
to talk about this service.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.740
This was something that was brought to my attention completely on our discord.

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.640
I had no idea that this was a thing that was going on, but then dark Tetsuya I think, or,

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.540
you know, the topic came up in our discord server, which if you're not on our discord

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.500
survey, you should think about joining it.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:39.180
Gog network.com slash discord is the only URL you need to get an invite right on into

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.180
the server.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.900
And I would certainly encourage you to join that cause that's how you can call into the

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.220
show later as well.

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:48.820
But um, anyway, the story was posting the orange launch radio channel is that we, and

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:52.680
we've been talking about this just as recently as like last week, like whatever happened

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:58.140
to services like game tap and the classic games and why, why isn't somebody taking the

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.980
advantage to do a streaming service for classic games?

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.780
Well, how about this?

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.700
It's apparently one has been being developed for a little while and they just went on a

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.260
Kickstarter this week.

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:14.220
So, but in usually I wouldn't talk about Kickstarter things, but in kind of reading the website

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:19.740
in reading their pitch on Kickstarter, I kind of got the impression of we're doing this,

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.580
whether this Kickstarter succeeds or not.

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:26.180
This Kickstarter just seems to be a way to offer these kinds of earlier perks and maybe

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.620
get the word out, which I guess, you know, successful cause here we are talking about

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:33.820
on our show when I guess this has been a thing that's been in development for a while

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.640
and I had like no idea.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.660
So the service is called ant stream.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.980
I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but I think the logo is really cute cause

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.580
it looks like a little ant or whatever.

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.260
They are saying that ant stream will have a beta launch on mobile devices.

01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:51.260
So iOS and Android, PC and Xbox one.

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.200
And the early backers are set to get in in early may, which I guess is probably when

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.580
this Kickstarter is about to finish up.

01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:01.340
Cause I think the Kickstarter has got about 25 days left on it.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:06.020
And so when it goes into beta, you are going to be able to play curated titles from the

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.980
seventies, eighties and nineties.

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:14.900
They are mentioning titles like Akari Warriors, Joe and Mac, California Games, Zool and Double

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.260
Dragon.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:20.740
It was pointed out that a couple of weeks ago, one of the parody intros we had here

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:26.860
at OLR, we had the epics game store, the EPYX game store, because it was a play on

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:33.500
me always talking about EPIC apostrophe S when really the story is called the epic game

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.500
store.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.580
And so you're not supposed to call it epics game store cause it sounds like the old company

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:44.980
from the eighties, but ironically that epics, the EPYX looks to be a company that is partnered

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.340
on this service because you go look at the games list, which they're showing off what

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.900
400 games, right?

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.620
And epics games are all over this list and it's very similar to the type of stuff you'd

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:58.380
see like on the mini Commodore 64 and some of these other places right now, but it's

01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.380
not just limited to that.

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.380
Right.

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.820
It looks like they've got, you know, like Akari Warriors would be like Data East appears

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.820
to be on this.

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.280
A lot of these SNK, Codemasters, a lot of these retro friendly companies you've seen

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.100
in other places too, but with their really old stuff.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.460
So I mean, certainly there's that question that's going to be asked, well, why not just,

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.180
why not just use emulators?

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:20.180
Right?

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:26.100
Well, and I, I even called this out as one reason I liked to play on GameTap was they

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.460
had the additional features like the replays, like the high scores so I could compete with

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.760
my friends.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:37.640
And so that's why like this caught my eye and Stream will be having unique multiplayer

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640
challenges.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:45.740
So it will put twists on some of the games like score attacks, speed runs and boss rushes.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:50.260
So there's a whole spiel you can check out over on their Kickstarter, which if you just

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:55.060
start for Antstream or go to antstream.com, I really want to invite them on the show.

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.580
I'll probably do that in the coming weeks here since they got a Kickstarter going on

01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.580
anyway.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:04.300
Cause I just like, it's funny because I feel like I S I said this out loud, like one or

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:09.100
two weeks ago, not obviously I didn't invent this has been in works for years, but I think

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.420
it's just funny that like, this is relevant.

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:14.720
Like I was asking for something like this and here it is.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.400
And I got to say, it looks pretty, pretty cool.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:22.560
I mean, there, I think like the early fee, like if you get in early, you can like have

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.280
your rate frozen at like six, I think $60 a year was like a rate you can get frozen

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280
out.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.680
I think they said they were going to ask for $10 a month for it.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.480
I'm worried that might be a little high for some people for retro games, but I mean, if

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.880
they're talking like a library of 4,000 games that were, it, it might be kind of worth it,

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.800
especially if these multiplayer challenges are really good.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.040
Like I really want to see the implementation of this.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.920
Unfortunately, that's the one thing that Kickstarter's not really showing is, but I, you know, and

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.680
they're about two thirds of the way to their goal already with, yeah, they're probably

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.640
going to make their goal, honestly.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.200
So I'm curious, I got to say, you know, I'm a sucker for retro games.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.760
I love that, like as a retro game enthusiast and somebody who would like stream them a

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.860
lot, like, because I like to stream games like this would open up a whole new, like

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.560
zillions of games to stream.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.840
So I do want to see something like this succeed.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.520
I hope, I hope it is really going to be worth that price that I'm going to be really surprised

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.440
there, but I'll probably sign onto the Kickstarter.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.440
We'll see.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440
So it looks pretty neat.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:31.480
So it says they're fixed price for Antstream is that's if you pledge 55 Euro is $70 a year

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480
for it.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.240
Yeah, there's, there's weird because they're based in the UK.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.760
So you have to, there's some money conversion things going on.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.120
It's something like if you put down like $120, you get two years because that's actually

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.760
the two years and $60.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.580
And then you get $60 frozen beyond that, I think.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.760
So it's kind of interesting.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.160
So I'm, I'm curious, was there early backers already gone?

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.920
Cause I was looking at doing that and I got lazy and didn't do it.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.380
And of course it's already gone.

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.480
So I mean, that's, that's good for them though.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480
So we'll see.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.400
Like I said, I really want to try and invite them on the show to later date because I hope

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.400
maybe they'll go so far as to be like a virtual museum.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.200
Wouldn't it be really cool if like, not only do they have the games, but maybe they have

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.520
interviews with some of these game makers talking about the games.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.960
Like think about like commentary tracks or something, because let's be real, the people

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.300
who made these games in the eighties and nineties, they're getting older.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.140
Some of them are no longer with us.

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:25.800
And you know, as people get older, that's going to continue to be the case.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.520
They can't have an interface where I can put arcade cabinets and arrange them in certain

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:30.520
ways.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.640
And, Oh, you take your tongue in cheek reference to game room.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640
Yeah.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640
I'd love that.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880
I'll take what I can get.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.320
I kind of think that's all secondary.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.040
So yeah.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.880
Some folks in chat, S.H.O. 100 Matt saying, like what game room could have been.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Yeah.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.880
Let's see.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.760
Dartitsuya says, yeah, I'm definitely getting a game tap vibe from the service.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.200
I'm very interested to see how they do.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.280
That's what I thought of when I saw some of those games on the list.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:59.000
I think that was a reference to when we had the Epic store, tongue in cheek joke, who

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.440
knew that that may actually become a reality of sorts after this.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:09.160
So Metal Mayhem says, yeah, I missed out on the game tap era, but I know you were there

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.080
for Microsoft's game room era because Kaijuto is asking, what's game room?

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.800
It was a Microsoft thing that they kind of tried to do with the classic gaming.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.400
But I feel like they let it, they pulled the plug on it before it had time to really grow.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.400
Yeah.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.400
That's unfortunate.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.400
So anyway.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400
All right.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400
Let's move on.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.880
Speaking of classic stuff every week here on the show, we like to step into the gaming

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:32.920
vault and find a classic game that, Hey, you guys should be checking this game out and

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.720
show it a little bit of love this week.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.940
But in the 2019 twist, we like to do things a little differently.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.720
So once a month, Dark Sakura picks out a classic soundtrack.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:48.400
So the classic soundtrack of the month is what we're going to be discussing this week.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.520
And you said the theme for 2019 is going to be all NES or 8-bit games, right?

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.520
All right.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.320
So what 8-bit game did you pick this week?

01:30:55.320 --> 01:31:00.560
I picked Jackal, which I've covered before for classic game, but my focus is of course

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.300
the soundtrack, this music.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.760
And I should point out that the video is not synced with the audio we did replace so that

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.920
I took, I stripped the game noise.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.360
Although it was actually pretty close.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.840
Yeah, it is pretty close.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.640
But this is like some of my favorite 8-bit gaming music ever.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.880
It was just that era of delicious Konami music, you know, but this was even better than some

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.480
of the other stuff that was out at the time.

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.760
Didn't we ever get a remix of this and like Beat Mania or anything?

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.400
It's really like a missed opportunity.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.400
Bummer.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:40.720
But anyway, it was, the sound designer for this was Atsushi Fujio.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.880
He worked on many Konami titles in the late 80s.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:50.280
He's actually, I think still doing music to this day.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.240
But as far as other games that he worked on, I'm trying to pick like, well, I brought this

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.620
came up before YY World for Super Famicom.

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:09.620
He did Jyris for the Famicom Disk System, Blades of Steel, Jyris for NES itself, Twin

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:11.520
Bee 3, Poco Poco Daimaou.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.640
I love the Jyris soundtrack, even though it really just is like classic songs.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:24.320
You May Penguin, Monogatari, Konami Hyper Soccer, I'm trying to think of things, Bucky O'Hare,

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:28.080
Hunter 3, The Alien Wars, he was a sound programmer.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.240
He did sound programming for Axlay.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:35.320
He did the same for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtle Tournament Fighters.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.920
Sorry, words are weird today.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.740
He also did the music for Double Dribble.

01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.480
And he was a consultant on Snatcher, Rob.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.480
Nice.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:50.940
But at any rate, this is just a good soundtrack.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.860
I played a fuck ton of this game when I was a kid, every time I was in Dothan, and I always

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:59.300
wanted my own copy, and I didn't get it until I was an adult.

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:04.220
But just the music was just, I thought, really solid.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:09.620
It actually was, some people would say it was kind of generic for like the whole army,

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:15.140
war, you know, military game, but I really did think that it was actually a very fitting

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:20.620
soundtrack and it wasn't just, I think, more of the same how a lot of the other games of

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.620
its type were.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.420
And on top of that, Jackal is just a really unique and good game.

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.700
So there you go.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.020
Yeah, I remember playing this game on Commodore 64.

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:33.180
I don't think, was the soundtrack the same?

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.180
I don't think it was.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:35.180
I don't think so.

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:39.700
But I remember, like at the time, this whole like driving a jeep around like a much larger

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:43.380
map that kind of scrolled in different ways than what we were used to, like that was a

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.740
very kind of like novel thing.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:51.780
Well, this game was also originally designed to use rotary joysticks, like in the SNK games,

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:58.220
like Ikari Warriors, but they ended up doing this one out for a joystick, I think because

01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:04.380
of like cost, but it also, you know, it changed the way that the tactics were going to work

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.380
on this game.

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380
It is a very solid game.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:09.860
And of course, the music is just not even annoying at all.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.940
It's just really good.

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.340
So there you go.

01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.340
All right.

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.860
I would love for this in the chat room as well.

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:19.940
Some folks saying, let's see, Metal Mayhem says Jackal was one of those Konami NES games

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.940
I saw advertised.

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.140
I won it on the NES.

01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:25.660
The only time I ever got to play it was on Game Room, the arcade version, I think was

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.660
there.

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.460
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, my brother and I played the hell out of this, so much better

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:30.460
with two players.

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.100
I played this with my papa.

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:33.420
Oh, love that.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.860
Dr. Seuss says, I do have the cart of this.

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.340
Still haven't beaten it, though.

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:41.100
And Quest Buster says the music- You haven't beaten it?

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.660
No day like today.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.060
Quest Buster says the music in Jackal was one of the reasons I kept coming back to the

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.060
game.

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.060
Yeah.

01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:54.340
And it's all just that intro music where it has the build up and then, you know, it goes

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.340
right into it.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.340
Let me play it.

01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.340
Wait, if I restart the thingy, hold on.

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.340
If I go back to us in the studio and then I go and I hit the button to start the video

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:02.340
again.

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.340
Yeah.

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:07.060
You can hear this opening music again.

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.180
Yeah.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.540
But the little bit of a key change between the two.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.540
Yeah.

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:17.580
Just really with the pause and then a key change, I was like, that's really, I mean,

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.700
coming from a musical point of view, I know it's a fucking video game, but it is really

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.700
dynamic.

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.580
But back in the day, in the 80s with games like this, you know, when sometimes you play

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:31.820
the game just to hear the songs because there wasn't the YouTube, MP3s, OC Remix wasn't

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.820
made yet.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:37.820
You know, you had to go to the game, you had to put the game in and listen to the music.

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.700
And sometimes that's how you rediscovered a game that you may not have really played

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:43.700
the first time.

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:46.300
I was telling Dan last night, just, you know, when I was thinking, what should I do?

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.300
What should I do?

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.420
And then I picked the music.

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:52.660
I was like, man, I feel fucking heroic.

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.660
As you should.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.660
Yeah.

01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:55.660
As you should.

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.660
All right.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.660
There it is.

01:35:57.660 --> 01:35:58.660
Your classic soundtrack of the month.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.420
Jackal on the NES specifically.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:02.040
And just a point of order.

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.540
We may see something on a different system next month.

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.540
Ooh.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.540
Okay.

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:07.540
It's gotta be an 8-bit.

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.260
Well, gee, I wonder what it could be.

01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.260
We'll see, though.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.260
We'll see.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:12.260
All right.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.900
What could it, could it be when you put two 8-bits together to make a faux 16-bit?

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.500
Because there was one console that did do that.

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.420
I'm not going to talk about the PC Engine.

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.420
All right.

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.420
Fine.

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.500
But, but, um, I'll just put it this way.

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.900
Um, there may be some Sega love coming next.

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.900
All right.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.740
Gee, I would never have guessed.

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.980
Or it could also be Atari.

01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.980
Okay.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:33.980
Oh, true.

01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.980
True.

01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.980
It could.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.980
The 7200.

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.420
Old school stuff.

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.220
You know that arcade collection is coming out very soon.

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:42.780
So I'll be very curious.

01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:46.660
Even though, um, you know, some of the games, like Haunted Castle was kind of like the arcade

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:52.220
version of Castlevania, but the, the gag is it's not that good unless they put, they may

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.380
have put cheats in it.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:57.700
I bet they did, uh, on the Switch version so that you can just keep plunking in quarters.

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.060
You know, probably get further in the game than you ever did before.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.420
Um, but it'd be interesting.

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.820
I don't know if Jackal was into it though.

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:06.620
I don't think Jackal's in it, but, um, I didn't remember seeing, I don't think Jackal was

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.100
on the list, but, uh, yeah, I know that's coming out very soon.

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:11.820
So some folks will be, uh, taking a look at that pretty soon.

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.820
All right.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:17.420
Anyhow, uh, we're going to do a little prerecorded segment that I did earlier today about another

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.420
just recorded.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.420
A what?

01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:20.980
So it's just recorded.

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:21.980
Yes.

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.300
A recorded segment from earlier today, uh, on another news item this week.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.300
So let's go to that.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.300
All right.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.780
Hello everybody from the office studio.

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.460
And I thought for a little middle of the show break this week, we could take a look again

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.340
at the switch online, uh, and the classic NES library.

01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:40.820
But this time, you know, I know that last week we looked a lot at the comparisons between

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.900
the American and the Japanese versions of the service, but this week I want to take

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:46.280
a look at some of the new offerings in the service.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.080
So, uh, as you guys know, there was some new stuff that was added, including a special

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.740
version of kid Icarus, as well as punch out star soldier and super Mario, the loss levels,

01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:59.920
which of course is super Mario brothers two in Japan.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.500
So what I want to kind of focus on during the break, uh, this week is I want to take

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:07.420
a look at these special versions that have been added to the service.

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:11.580
You know, it's kind of interesting as this trend that Nintendo has been doing with the

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:15.740
classic library is that it seems like every time they release new games, they've been

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:20.300
doing like a throwback to one of the harder games from the previous month, allowing you

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:26.060
to take it on in a whole new way, perhaps, um, actually, uh, starting with full life

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:30.640
or full coins or, uh, starting on the very last level of the game, which is the case

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.520
with the kid Icarus release this week.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.480
But if you actually look at, you know, the details, they try to give it like this fancy

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.480
little name, like, Ooh, you're playing the three sacred treasures level and you know,

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.560
you're not really finished.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.840
And it's basically a fancy way of saying we're starting you at the end of the game with all

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.060
the items and full life and everything.

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.060
So let's actually take a look.

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.060
I'm going to load it up.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.380
And the interesting thing about kid Icarus specifically was that the very last stage

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:59.980
of the game, stage four, one was very different from any other level in the game.

01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.480
There was really no other level like it.

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:08.420
Not so ever, um, it plays more like a shooter game, whereas of course the first few stages

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:14.980
of the game is a platformer and, uh, uh, dungeon stages are also there and yeah, it's just

01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.440
a very different type of game.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.940
So obviously we're flying through and you notice pit looks very different now because

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.240
the story with the game has him collecting the treasures in the various dungeons.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.420
So he has the wings, he has the special arrow, he has the shield, so that's why he looks

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:30.640
a lot different.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.700
So we're obviously flying through here to make our way to Medusa who, spoiler alert,

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.840
is the final boss of the game, but I'm sure you all already knew that.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.300
It's interesting too because I haven't played this in a long time, the American release,

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.560
but I've played the Japanese.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.000
It's funny cause I have to throw back a little bit to last week.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I did play the Japanese release of this earlier and believe it or not, it's different.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.580
Like you actually use one of the buttons to fly and I seem to remember you walk on this

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:04.460
part, you can't fly underneath this brick like you can in this version.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:09.760
So the American version apparently lets you fly through walls and that's something new

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.100
and you just use the control pad to move wherever you want.

01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:16.380
That's a very interesting, a little difference I'm noticing right off the bat besides just

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.380
all those sound differences we were noting last week.

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.580
Well, this stage isn't very long.

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:23.940
Once you get to the green brick, guess what?

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.460
You are about to the Medusa fight.

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:30.940
I think we just have to get through a few more mobs.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.380
Shoot my way through.

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:36.460
Yeah, it's like a shooter, but it's not like, you know, for as hard as this game is, it's

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.940
not exactly like cuphead level shooting.

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.920
I mean, sure, I've lost a little bit of health and been hit a few times so far, but it's

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.540
not like, you know, I'm not like super dying or anything.

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.980
All right.

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:50.780
This level is longer than I remember.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.380
Maybe the American version is longer too, I don't remember.

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.980
I played the Japanese one earlier this week when it was first released.

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:02.040
Just because I wanted to hear the little subtle differences in the music that we talked about

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.040
last week.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.140
But obviously, Kid Icarus is not the only game that's had an SP release.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:11.980
I know like Legend of Zelda, I did a stream on my personal channel once when that came

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:12.980
out.

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:17.340
They had a version that started you with all the rupees and heart containers and everything

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.420
else that you can get.

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:20.580
I swear this thing just looped me through the level twice.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.100
Isn't that what it looks like?

01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.500
I just looped through the level twice.

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:25.620
I think I did.

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.140
Maybe that's how they made it more difficult.

01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.140
You thought this was easy?

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.140
Well, ah!

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.140
Do it again.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.140
All right.

01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.060
Well, maybe this time when we get to the green brick, we'll be able to fight Medusa.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.140
You know, the other interesting thing, though, even though it looks like I'm really close

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:43.900
to dying, well, not only do I start with full hearts, so picking up the additional hearts

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.080
really isn't doing me any good, but if you look at the special items, you'll notice I

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.980
have like eight life restoration items.

01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:55.140
So even if I were to lose all my health, which unfortunately seems very likely at this point,

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:58.360
it's okay because my health is going to refill automatically.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.460
So it makes it very hard to die.

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:06.320
So even if like you sucked at Kid Icarus as a kid, now's your chance to be a winner, which

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.420
hopefully I will get the chance here shortly without this middle point segment going on

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.660
for 20 minutes.

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:19.020
Pretty sure maybe there's something special I have to do to trigger the Medusa phase.

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.860
I don't remember.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:21.860
I don't think so.

01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:22.860
I've got full hearts.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.020
What else could I possibly need?

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:27.820
All right.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:34.020
Oh, my God, are we living through it again?

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.140
We might be if that green brick goes away.

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:38.660
Oh, no, it just looks.

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.660
There we go.

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:41.660
There we go.

01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:42.660
Okay.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:43.660
Now, yeah, suspenseful music change.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.660
Here we go.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.120
All right.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:52.440
So obviously I want to dodge that dragon, which I'm getting hit with a bunch.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.340
You can deflect those little beams that are coming with the mirror.

01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:59.480
So as long as but you'll notice the shield goes down for a minute when you shoot the

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.480
arrows.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:07.740
I'm having a really hard time facing forward.

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.240
This is probably part of my issue of using the control pro controller.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.280
So I'm just going through those extra health like it's nobody's business.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.920
Hopefully I'll be able to kill Medusa.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:33.920
Oh, my gosh, I think that's one of the downfalls of using the pro controller is that, oh, look

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.920
at that.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:35.920
I found that sweet spot.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.920
There it is.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:38.920
That's right.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.120
I remember that being a thing now is that there's like a sweet spot.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.280
There you go.

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:45.320
And there's Palutena.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.320
I think.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.120
So that's supposed to be coming out of the eye.

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.120
We did it.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120
We beat it.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.120
Yay.

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:54.120
Hooray.

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.120
There it is.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.120
The ending screen.

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.400
And I didn't have any help whatsoever.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.400
And he transforms.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.720
Again, interesting because this is very different from the Japanese version now that that's

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:04.720
recent in my head.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.680
Oh, no, they didn't hug in the Japanese.

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.480
Oh, that was a little kiss.

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.520
All this blue scenery and everything.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.800
This is not in the Japanese version.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.680
It's just a black screen, but it has more writing.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.160
And then it says Fiin at the bottom.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.040
And I imagine this is the translation of the writing, which is Medusa was destroyed in

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:23.480
the light of peace.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.480
Return to Angel.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.480
I didn't read fast enough.

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.080
I need to be a speed reader, clearly.

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.280
And we get the staff role, which again, not present in the Japanese version.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.480
So I guess this did end up being a comparison video of sorts as well.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:38.120
But it makes it a lot easier to see things later in the game.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.640
Thanks to these special SP versions.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.120
So I'm curious, are you guys checking out these SP versions?

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.800
Those of you that have Nintendo online?

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.280
Like are you using this to see parts of the game that you couldn't get to as a kid?

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.020
Now, I did beat Kid Icarus as a kid.

01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:57.000
I may have had some help from maps in Nintendo Power or whatever magazines are out at the

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.160
time that helped me get through like the third dungeon and all that stuff.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.560
But I did beat it.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.020
But things like, I don't know, like Ghosts and Goblins and some of these other games,

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.740
like I would never see these end segments of the game if it weren't for the SP versions.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:14.500
So I'm curious if you guys are checking them out or if, you know, you're like, eh, I don't

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.140
want to see it on easy mode.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.140
No.

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:19.260
Anyway, that's my question to you guys.

01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.500
And I think that's it for now.

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:27.380
So we'll end on that lovely note where the hero, the hero is you and copyright 1986 Nintendo.

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.380
That's it.

01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:29.600
We're going to go back to the studio.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.820
See ya.

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:38.660
Thank you, me, for that lovely segment on the SP version of Kid Icarus, which was released

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:43.900
into the Nintendo online library on Switch in this past week.

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:47.300
Have you guys or you guys don't really do a lot of the Switch Nintendo library?

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.500
I don't play that often.

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.780
Yeah, it's not really.

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.780
Yeah.

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.780
I kind of check out the SP stuff once in a while.

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.980
Well, especially kind of like I was saying there, the ghosts and goblins, but like things

01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:58.640
like I just I never was going to see otherwise.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.880
The Kid Icarus thing, again, humble brag.

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.300
I saw that already when I was a kid, but also, I mean, all humble bragging aside, and I forgot

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.320
to talk about it in the video.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.640
There was also pass codes we would always use, right?

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.320
Like I was it like Icarus fights, Medusa, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320
Yeah.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.900
So there were little codes you could use that would also get you a little further along

01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:20.720
in the game to see that level.

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.720
But now who needs codes anymore?

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.720
You have SP versions.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.360
We could sell you those codes for cheap.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.560
Well, at least Nintendo is not selling those as well, unless you consider the price of

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.240
the online subscription, what you're paying.

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.880
But I think I let that one slide, considering that's not the only value in their online

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.880
subscription.

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.660
So anyway, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news, some other quick things

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:45.660
going on in the industry.

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.280
You also have a podcast of the week.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280
Oh, yeah, let's do that.

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.280
Let's do it by all means, please.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.920
You have a podcast to plug.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920
Absolutely.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:59.760
And then comes courtesy of my friend Grim, who is the one of the creative talents behind

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.720
Voodoo Walrus.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.320
And check out check it out.

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.360
It's a really funny, cool adventure comic.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:10.900
But the podcast is called This Week We're Talking About.

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:13.920
And there are up to 10 episodes from what I can tell so far.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.080
The last one was on April 4th.

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.560
And they basically just pick a topic and talk about it.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.820
You know, it's like, oh, but but not.

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:30.820
Not with Katya or Trixie, but like this last episode is a kiss retrospective, 1971 through

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820
1974.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.420
And because Kiss is going to be retiring because it's about time, I'm sure Gene Simmons's tongue

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:40.220
has had so much Botox that it can't move out anymore.

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.260
But yeah, check him out.

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.540
Actually the favorite title of all.

01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:48.580
Actually, there's two titles I super like.

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.380
One of them is episode eight.

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:55.500
We've come to teach you the boundless joys of a life without pants.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.980
And oh, it actually is creep night and grim on that one.

01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.700
So and then carbon units are not true life forms.

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:05.660
And it's actually about Star Trek the motion picture.

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.640
So go check them out.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.700
There's only 10 episodes.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.700
You can catch up easy.

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.700
All right.

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:12.700
Thank you for that lovely plug.

01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:18.380
I had to also plug the shows at vognetwork.com because we have many shows that are part of

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.380
the network.

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.860
All of them broadcast live on Twitch.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:26.900
A few of them do not, including anime jam session, which is hosted here on Tuesday nights.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.020
But I will plug, I'm going to plug my own show.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:34.540
I'm going to plug shaking and crying now, which I do with the lovely Aria snark.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:40.220
Speaking of Game of Thrones, Aria snark is a cosplayer, but she goes by Victoria in the

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.860
real world.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:46.700
And this week we talked about, well, Victoria did the show high.

01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:48.620
So we talked about marijuana.

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.220
And we talked about 420 a little bit.

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.320
And you know, cause that's coming up.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:55.100
So we had a very frank conversation on that.

01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.260
So it was a interesting episode.

01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.700
Also the first full day of Passover.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:01.660
And guess what weed is kosher.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:02.660
Good to know.

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:03.660
Good to know.

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:04.660
So you can check that out.

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:05.660
Shaking and crying.com.

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.540
But that's just going to take you to a little subsection at vognetwork.com.

01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.920
Now we can get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:19.480
So if you're a fan of old edutainment, and this was probably a little, this was probably

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.560
a little after when I was actually playing a lot of those games, but you're probably

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:30.920
familiar with humongous or humongous entertainment and humongous entertainment did such wonderful

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:36.840
series as pajama Sam, Freddy fish, spy Fox, putt putt, et cetera.

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.440
Well they have a bundle now on humble bundle and you can get a shit ton of games for very

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.560
little money.

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.080
So for a dollar, you get, uh, quite a few.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:53.040
So big fingers, first grade kindergarten, fatty bears, birthday, surprise, buzzy, the

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.960
airport, the farm, the jungle, putt, putt, and pops, uh, balloon, Orama doc on a stick

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.080
and activity pack.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.280
What was that birthday surprise?

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.360
That was fatty bears or fatty bears.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.360
Your dinner.

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.600
That sounds like my trip to Chicago last year.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.600
Let's see where else.

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:18.540
Uh, and then of course spy Fox and cheese chase.

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:21.020
So all that for $1, not bad.

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:27.200
And then of course, um, if you pay the average price, which now is $11 and 16 cents, but

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.000
of course that changes as people are purchasing the bundle.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.480
It's spy Fox to, uh, putt putt travels through time.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:39.760
Freddy fish to pajamas, Sam for pajamas, Sam, lost and found, uh, lots of games basically.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.360
Um, and then of course, $14 or more, um, you get even more games.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.000
So pajamas, Sam, three Freddy fish, five, four spy Fox, three puppet joins the circus.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.640
There's just a ton of goddamn games in there.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:58.800
So if you really need to fill your steam library full of humongous games, then go check that

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.600
out on humble bundle.com because it's, there's a lot.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:12.840
And then, um, there was this lawsuit against, um, take two, um, regarding red dead redemption

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:18.380
two, because in the game, of course, there's the Pinkertons, which were kind of this rival

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.640
to your gang.

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.960
And apparently the Pinkertons are actually real.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:26.320
Um, there is this, uh, Pinkerton consulting and investigation.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:32.420
Uh, they wanted royalties for every time the word Pinkerton was used in the game, but now

01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:38.400
they have dropped their lawsuit against take two over their depiction of the Pinkertons.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:44.840
Also there was the Pinkerton investigation agency in Hong Kong, just saying, so that's

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:45.840
been dropped.

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:52.880
Unfortunately, um, that lawsuit being gone does not make red dead online any better.

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.880
Fair enough.

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:57.580
Uh, maybe there'll be online in this game, although this is, um, you know, this is one

01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:01.560
of those take it with a grain of salt cause it's not confirmed, but usually the ratings

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.280
boards, when we get leaks from the rating boards, we know there's something coming.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.360
Like those don't tend to be things that lie to us.

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:13.920
So the Australian ratings board just approved something from way forward games, the developers

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.720
behind Shantae, um, and that Shantae you stay.

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:20.760
I always like, I can't say that game without saying that, uh, way forward did other stuff

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.760
too.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.760
That was really cool.

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760
Did they do blaster master zero?

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.040
No, but didn't they do, was it the DuckTales or masters?

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.040
Yes.

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.040
Yes.

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.040
So they've done some really cool classic remasters.

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:35.200
Well, apparently the game that was rated was called river city girls.

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:41.040
So some people are wondering, is this Kunio kun, which is the river city ransom, right?

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:47.320
Those games is that here now that franchise is by arc system works, but they have licensed

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:52.320
that out for other releases like river city ransom underground, which was by a Canadian

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.320
studio.

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.600
Did they maybe make like, did way forward maybe make a new river city ransom as game,

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.920
but now it's, you know, the twist is it's going to be girl fighters maybe, uh, who knows,

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:04.920
but I'm into it.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.560
I'm into like river city ransom coming back.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:11.080
I think that's a fun twist, uh, on the, the franchise, um, beginnings.

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.080
So that'd be cool.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.080
Uh, dark soccer.

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.880
I know you love the Kunio kun type games.

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:16.880
Would you play river city girls?

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.880
I probably would.

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:18.880
Yeah.

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:22.040
And you know, especially if like the boys are the ones that are working at the cafe

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.440
and have to have to smile for free.

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.440
Yeah.

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.320
They're like, like they'd be prettier if they smiled more.

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320
Fair enough.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:33.000
Why not give everybody a turn?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.800
Uh, and then that's, that's all I have.

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:37.400
So dark soccer, what do you have for us rapid fighters?

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:44.240
Well for fans of octopath traveler who don't necessarily have a system to play it on, um,

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.320
it's going to be on steam.

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.320
Of course.

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.120
Phoenix is going to put it on steam on June 7th.

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.640
So keep your eyes open if you sincerely want to play it.

01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.040
Um, which honestly it's not a bad idea, but I hope that it will, there will be a Mac version

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.040
as well.

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.600
Um, and then, um, this one I thought was funny for all of you oculus sisters, there's creepy

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.840
messages on your controller, at least a few thousand of them.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:18.160
Um, so there were, um, you know, different versions that went out for testing, um, different,

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:24.840
uh, but about tens of thousands of oculus touch controllers have creepy privacy related

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.960
Easter egg messages written on the internal hardware.

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:34.500
Like one of them says, the masons were here inscribed on a cable, others are big brother

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500
is watching.

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:41.760
Um, you know, and other develop, developers will put jokes in their kits too, but here's

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760
a few others.

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.440
One of them says, uh, this space for rent, the masons were here.

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.600
Big brother is watching.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.280
Hi, I fix it.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:52.160
We see you.

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.420
So that they will throw back to pin bot.

01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:00.080
Now I see you.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:06.960
I can see from bride of him, but, but yeah, but, um, they basically were part of the prototypes

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.720
and they went into production, but, um, they're trying to keep them from happening again.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:18.160
Um, but yeah, the affected touch controllers are shipping with the rift S and oculus quest

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.160
headsets.

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:24.760
Um, and they're not going to recall them because I mean, why the fuck it might be really funny.

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:29.000
It's not like we don't have hidden messages and a lot of things that we use in our everyday

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
lives.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.720
For example, um, currency, right?

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.560
Like coins, they have little, you know, things on them.

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.120
Um, also like, hello, don't y'all know, like, like everybody loves in and out when they

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:41.120
come to California.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.400
You ever looked at one of the bottom of the cups at in and out Bible verses, Bible verses

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.400
on them.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:54.840
So no, not on my cup, but thankfully they don't, you know, contribute money to, well,

01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.800
do they not to anti LGBT, but you know, it's just, you know, you gotta do your research.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.340
But I also, I have a controversial opinion on all that anyway, but I, you know, I still

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:10.000
eat it because, um, they treat their workers very well from what I understand.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.360
And kids really want to work there.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.840
So I think that's also very, I like that everyone who starts off there, even if they're, you

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:21.480
know, fresh incoming CEO or whatever, or executive have to take, um, have to spend a day on the

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.480
floor.

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.480
Oh, okay.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.480
That's, that's interesting.

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.480
They're absolutely required to.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.480
Oh, that's cool.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.480
Yeah.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.480
You know what's interesting?

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.180
The orientation I do in my work is the same required.

01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:31.920
Why wouldn't you want to do that for a day?

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.920
That'd be fun.

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:33.920
Yeah.

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:34.920
Just for a day.

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.920
I think for a week.

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.700
Oh, well, you know, why not?

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:39.840
It's the best way to learn about what's going on, right?

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:42.940
So anyway, but my point is there's hidden messages in a lot of things.

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:46.200
It sounds like, sounds like this was one that wasn't meant to get out in mass.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.560
In fact, Bobby, who we all know loves his VR in chat says, I fix it does tear down YouTube

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.600
videos.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.800
That's what the message was for.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.160
So of course that makes sense.

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.160
Yeah.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:59.560
So, you know, they tried to hide a cute message for those folks and now it's turns out a lot

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.080
of folks see it.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.080
I'll be honest.

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:06.160
I have used, I fix it before and for lack of having a manual with me when trying to

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:09.180
change on a hard drive and it wasn't like on a PC.

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.140
It was on, it was a, my old Toshiba.

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:13.140
Right.

01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.140
So, all right.

01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.580
Anyway, hidden messages.

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.580
They're everywhere.

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:17.580
All right.

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.580
Moving on.

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.420
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates that are coming up.

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:30.540
Well, we've got Anno 1800 coming out on PC, Final Fantasy 10 and 10 2 HD remaster on the

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:33.740
Nintendo switch and Xbox one.

01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:42.460
We have my time at Portia on switch PlayStation four and Xbox one world war Z on PC, PlayStation

01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:50.420
four and Xbox one, um, trooper Brooke on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.280
one cup head on Nintendo switch.

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.240
And finally Katana zero on PC and the Nintendo switch.

01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.240
That's it.

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:01.220
Are you going to pick up cup head on switch?

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:03.640
I've heard a lot of people talking about it on PC and I don't play it.

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:07.800
So why would I pick it up another platform not to play on PC and it makes me cry to continue

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.800
to not play it.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:09.800
Oh, why is it?

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:10.800
Just cause it's fucking hard.

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.480
I do want to pick up birth defense force.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.820
I did hold off on picking that up this week because I knew I wouldn't get to play it this

01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:16.820
week.

01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:21.320
So it's, which is why, and also it's kind of expensive, but I, I do need to get it.

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.320
All right.

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:26.120
Let's talk about some titles coming out in Japan on the PlayStation four this week.

01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:31.020
It looks like the biggest title they have there is Langrisser one and two on the PlayStation

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.020
four.

01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:38.220
This is a remake of these RPGs that were out on the mega drive in 1991 and 1994.

01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:42.260
So now it's like a one, two combo remastered for the PlayStation four.

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:44.580
So there's a regular and a limited edition of that.

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:46.580
And that's on the PlayStation four this week.

01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:53.580
The other release in Japan this week, override mech city brawl is also out this week in Japan.

01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:57.380
And that is also on the PlayStation four looking quickly at the Nintendo switch that Langrisser

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.960
one and two is also out on the switch.

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:05.640
As well as a game called Tai Shu cross Alex, excuse me, Alice all in one.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:07.820
That is the other release in Japan this week.

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:12.900
Otherwise it's a relatively slow week in Japan, but I know we're heading into a big holiday

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:15.780
thing coming up here pretty soon, I think at the end of the month.

01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:18.220
So it's probably going to be slow for a little bit.

01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.420
How about Europe?

01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:20.420
It's a little bit slow.

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.300
I mean, there's some stuff to look forward to.

01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:29.020
So there is my time at Porsche on April 15th.

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:35.220
Also out on the 15th is world war Z and then final fantasy 10, 10 to HD remaster.

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:41.940
On the 16th, we have snooker 2019 which is a pool game.

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:48.520
On the 17th, we have trooper Brook constructor plus, and our world is ended.

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:54.280
And then on the 18th ghost giant deluxe edition.

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.280
That's it.

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:56.280
That's it.

01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:01.760
And then my birthday, which is a game in and of itself because trying to just live is fun.

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:02.760
That's right.

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.960
Happy early birthday because we do another show.

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:05.960
It will have passed.

02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:06.960
Right.

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:07.960
Thank you.

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:08.960
I'm old.

02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:09.960
So no, you're not.

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:10.960
You're doing a 24 hour stream for your birthday.

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:11.960
Right.

02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:12.960
I'm just kidding.

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:13.960
No, I'm going to be in San Francisco.

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.960
Oh, that'd be.

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:15.960
Oh yes.

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.960
Oh, cause you're, you're not here on the next episode, right?

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:17.960
No, I am not.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.040
I'm going to be going to the, uh, conclave for the 40th anniversary of the sisters of

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.840
perpetual indulgence because I know you're very heavily involved with that.

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.280
I would love to go.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:28.920
I have a very busy next weekend is very busy myself though.

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:32.940
I'm hosting an event Friday here in SAC, a burlesque show in old town and then a rocky

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:34.280
horror is on four 20.

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.880
The very important thing though about the theme burlesque show or is it just a regular

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.880
burlesque?

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:42.720
It is a themed burlesque show because it is also a, it is that cannabis weekend.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:45.040
So it's a cannabis burlesque show.

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.920
That's interesting.

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.920
Come see what it is.

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.360
The other thing though about this particular one is that, um, the, the, the Easter in the

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.000
park had been done traditionally at Dolores park and had to move to golden gate park when

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.840
they changed the gathering rules for Dolores park.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.360
They got a special, uh, dispensation for the 40th anniversary to have it at Dolores park

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.360
again.

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.120
So if anyone, any of our listeners is in San Francisco, come find me.

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:16.880
Um, I will be, uh, in my sister persona, I'll be wearing a little blue and white Lolita

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.840
dress with a floofy hat and I'm sure there'll be pictures on social media, but my face will

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.840
be hidden.

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:24.840
Can you find me?

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.320
It's where's Jamie?

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:30.020
Uh, and I'm okay going off topic a little bit because this is the part of the show where

02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:34.240
we would be answering your emails, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:37.840
us emails and every week, dark soccer dives in the mailbag and finds what she wants to

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840
read about tonight.

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.800
But this week, someone washed the floor.

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.040
It's not sticky anymore.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.040
It's clean.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.760
So there's nothing in the mailbag once again.

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.760
Yeah.

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.280
And because of that, I'm going to play animal crossing.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.280
No, no.

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:50.560
We're going to talk about RuPaul's drag race.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.560
Oh, that's right.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.840
So, so girl, I didn't watch this a week's episode.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.840
Why?

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.440
I just haven't gotten around to it yet, but it was so satisfying.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:01:59.440
I know.

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.000
I've heard what happens cause you know, things get ruined on social media.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.840
If you, I was ready for that bitch to go.

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.920
Now I got one more bitch to go.

02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:07.280
You know which bitch I want to go.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.160
Uh, probably Dr Ganesh.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.160
Dr Ganesh.

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.160
Yeah.

02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.160
I'm thinking.

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:15.600
Dr Ganesh is proof that you can be well educated and still be a fucking moron.

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.840
Let's keep it positive.

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.840
Who are you rooting for?

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.840
Positively stupid.

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:21.040
Who are you rooting for at this point in the competition?

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040
Evie.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040
Evie?

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:24.040
I really like Evie.

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.040
I like Evie too.

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.440
But I super love Miss Vangie and I want her to, I think Vangie is going to get, um, Miss

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.120
Vangie is going to get a spinoff series.

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.360
Miss Vangie just, Miss Vangie is going to be like the Alyssa Edwards of this generation

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.360
of drag race.

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.360
You know what I mean?

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:46.600
Miss Vangie though, I think is going to be, um, what, what fan favorite called, um, uh,

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.200
crap that De La got and oh, Miss Congeniality.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200
Yes.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200
Thank you.

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:53.200
Cause I was like, I couldn't make the word come out of my mouth.

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.400
Oh, by the way, in chat right now, Frodo's swaggin says reload the mailbag cause I sent

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.400
something 10 minutes ago.

02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.400
Too bad.

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.120
It's already closed and you made me lose a fish.

02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.120
Damn it.

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:04.120
All right.

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.120
Let me look at this freaking mailbag.

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.120
We can roll it to next week.

02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:07.120
Well, you won't be here next week.

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.120
Then you can read it.

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.120
Rob.

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:10.120
It's up to you.

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.120
No, you go ahead.

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:12.120
Let's do it.

02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.120
Let's do it.

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.120
Loki.

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:15.120
Loki is literally typing in chat.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.120
Save me.

02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:17.120
It's just called OLR.

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:18.120
Okay.

02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:19.120
All right.

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.120
Hey, OLR.

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:21.120
Frodo's swaggin's here.

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.760
I wanted to take a second to talk about Roblox.

02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:26.960
I've always, it's coming up later in the show, but okay.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:27.960
It's fine.

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:28.960
We'll talk about it now.

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:29.960
I've always seen it on X-Box and PC.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:30.960
I've also seen it.

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:31.960
It's on X-Box?

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.960
I didn't know there was an X-Box.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:34.960
That's cool.

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:37.080
Cause it's windows shit.

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.080
Makes sense.

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:39.080
Yeah.

02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:40.440
I've also seen people try to do add-ons for it.

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.720
They get their computers hyper infected.

02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:44.080
Watch what your kids download.

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:45.600
Is that the technical term for it?

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:46.600
It's windows shit.

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.600
Shit.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.600
Yeah, exactly.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.600
Is that the technical term?

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:50.600
Yeah.

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.600
Is that what we call the windows store now?

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.600
I did this number.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.600
Sorry.

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.600
Sorry, Loki.

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:55.600
I didn't mean to.

02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:56.600
It's very popular.

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.600
I know it's popular.

02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.600
My son plays it every day.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600
Watch.

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600
What do you download?

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:01.600
Come to find.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:02.600
Oh, I don't want to download whatever.

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.600
What's it going to do?

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.600
Hyper infect this computer that has nothing on it?

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.680
Can I read an email, please?

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:08.240
Come to find out it's on all platforms, actually.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:12.800
I also just assumed it was going to be for younger age group just by looking at the title

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:13.800
and screenshots.

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:17.400
Anyway, last week I said why not and opened up the game and holy shit, there are thousands

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.420
of games in there to choose from.

02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:23.900
Not all games are great, but there are many gems here to have fun with.

02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:27.720
It's literally all I've been playing lately, especially some of the first person shooters.

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:32.120
The graphics obviously aren't anything special, but the gameplay is definitely there.

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.280
Especially on PC with keyboard and mouse, the shooters feel great.

02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.640
Also been dumping hours into restaurant tycoon.

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.880
Anyway, I had no idea what the heck Roblox was and I'm glad I opened it up.

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.880
Lol.

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:47.280
Also, I've seen people making their own games and putting it on there.

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.880
Loki, have you ever thought about making a game for Roblox?

02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:51.800
No, I mean, sort of.

02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.100
I've looked at it, but I'm not really interested in Roblox at all.

02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:56.100
My son is.

02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:59.840
That's actually why he's doing his programming class now, because actually part of the programming

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:05.720
class once he gets high enough into it, because they have to learn Scratch, then JavaScript,

02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:09.320
then they actually do Roblox level making with Lua.

02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:12.360
I keep forgetting your kid's going to finish a game before you do.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360
He doesn't.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.360
He already did a game.

02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:18.820
He's done several, because they have several projects that they work on.

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.820
I just don't.

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:20.820
The John Cena game.

02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:24.880
He had that, but he has several that he's done since then, because he's been doing it

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.680
for like a couple months now.

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:31.640
But no, once they actually get out of, he belts up to yellow, they start doing JavaScript

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:32.640
and stuff.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:37.480
And then eventually I think it's like they do Lua and Roblox and they start teaching

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.360
like level design, stuff like that.

02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:42.960
I've thought about it, but like, I just don't want to.

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:46.800
You should say you've made him a game and it's nothing but like Josh's adventures at

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.880
the broccoli farm.

02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:51.860
There's so much rampant like IP theft on that.

02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:55.840
It's just not even like you think you think like YouTube's bad with all like the weird

02:05:55.840 --> 02:06:00.000
children's programming, but like people like because I think some a lot of kids are making

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.040
so they don't give a fuck what they rip off.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.880
It's just like, oh, hey, I'm playing a Five Nights at Freddy's game.

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:10.000
I'm sure you had permission to do that or hey, I'm playing an Avengers game or whatever

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
the fuck I'm playing.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.440
The way I heard about Roblox the first time and like I thought it was just like a kid

02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.760
only thing and I never even bothered to look at it.

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.540
The way I heard about it was that there were you know, I played those fakie fakie survivor

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.240
and big brother games online.

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:29.360
Well, some of those people play survivor Roblox games and so they have all sorts of this is

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:30.360
happening by the way.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.360
Yeah.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:32.360
Oh yes.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:33.360
Now who's derailing the topic?

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:34.360
Yeah.

02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:35.360
Yeah.

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:38.620
They have all sorts of like simulator games that he'll play and stuff and that's fine.

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:39.620
It's entertaining for him.

02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:40.800
It's free.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.640
He does want me to buy the premium currency form every once in a while.

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:47.320
I'll do that like once or twice a year for him and then that's it.

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:51.080
But like they've got like physical toys you can get the unlocked stuff in the games and

02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:52.080
they have.

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.800
And you can basically build a game and build your own like premium stuff in there that

02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:00.040
they purchase with their points and you get money for it is what kind of the incentive.

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:04.600
So it's funny our emailer brought up Roblox because I actually have a showreel story on

02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:05.600
it here later.

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.600
We just haven't come across it yet.

02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:14.840
And so I only know of this game what my friends from the other stuff have told me about it.

02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.400
I haven't really bothered to do any research.

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:21.720
So sometimes when I want to learn more about a game I'll go look up twitch streams.

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.040
So you should totally stream yourself playing Roblox.

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.040
It's free.

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:26.040
OK.

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.040
Maybe I will.

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:28.040
Well here's the problem.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:31.820
When I went into those like Roblox streams and like just clicked on some random ones

02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:38.120
I sampled like for every single one of them was like a 13 year old and I felt fucking

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:44.440
creepy because I'm like I'm a 40 year old dude watching these 13 year olds play like

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440
where are the adults.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:50.040
You know the average people that play Fortnite though in like Apex Legends stuff is probably

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.040
the same.

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.900
So if you're probably you know what.

02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:59.040
And see when I was 13 back in my day I was calling into BBS's and I bet like a lot of

02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.040
adults are on this.

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.780
I remember talking to people that were in like their 20s and 30s and I was 13 posting

02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.000
on these like fucking BBS threads and stuff.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Sorry I'm sorry.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I scared the hell.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
My mom hated it.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Sorry to derail that.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Once again.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
What else.

02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:15.760
I did want to bring this up and this is to your interest as well.

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.760
Hold on.

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:17.760
Hold on.

02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:18.760
Is the email done.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.760
OK.

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:20.760
The email is done so we can we can do a tangent.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:21.760
Sorry.

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:25.080
So Humble Bundle as I was talking about before they have another bundle right now that is

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:28.160
a classics video games.

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:32.320
It's boss fight books and they do kind of post mortems and stuff.

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:37.860
It's a nonfiction documentary style books about classic video games and stuff.

02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:45.260
The reason I mention this is in their one dollar one there is a book on ZZT Oh get out

02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:49.740
and not only ZZT but Earthbound Mega Man 3 Galaga.

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:52.820
And then of course you know if you pay that more than the average which is eight bucks

02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:59.660
they have like Soft and Cuddly Super Mario Brothers 2 Bible Adventures Metal Gear Solid

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:00.660
American one.

02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:01.660
And these are all e-books.

02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:03.100
Yeah these are all e-books.

02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.380
But like I saw the ZZT I'm like I may have to pick that up and that's good for another

02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.260
about two and a half days.

02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:11.300
So I hope I remember after the show to go look that up.

02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:13.020
I love ZZT.

02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:17.000
I'm curious though who the authors are because if they're authors that work for a particular

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.100
large gaming Web site then I'm interested.

02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.820
It's Anna Anthropy.

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:25.940
I oh I've I've heard that name before.

02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:30.020
I believe she was at one of the gamer X events.

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.020
Yes.

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:38.020
She's been right or author of Rise of the Video Game Zenisters.

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:43.820
OK yes I know I think I recognize the panels a gamer game creator historian 30 year old

02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:44.820
teen witch.

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:45.820
All right.

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:46.820
So OK.

02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:47.820
I can deal with that.

02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:49.780
Teen witches are so in right now.

02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:50.780
Yeah.

02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:51.780
You know watching Sabrina.

02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:52.780
All right.

02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:53.780
OK.

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:54.780
Oh.

02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:55.780
And says.

02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:56.780
Yeah.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:57.780
Yeah.

02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:58.780
She says her previous.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:09:59.780
Yeah.

02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:03.780
Rise of the Video Game Zenisters and Starwench which she recently made is easy to version

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:04.780
of.

02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:05.780
Oh so.

02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:06.780
OK.

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:07.780
So there's a little credit in there.

02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:08.780
She makes her own ZZT game.

02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:09.780
So yeah.

02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:10.780
All right.

02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:11.780
I'm into it.

02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:12.780
Yeah.

02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:13.780
Definitely.

02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.780
All right.

02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:15.780
I'll check it out.

02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:16.780
All right.

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:17.780
Anyways that's all I had.

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:18.780
No that's fine.

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:19.780
Let's move on.

02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:20.780
Let's get into some more gaming news.

02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.780
You have a few more things that we're going to get to the discord part of the show and

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:22.780
as well as any chat room comments.

02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:24.660
We'll get to that a little later on here in our roundtable.

02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:25.660
But first Loki.

02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:26.660
So this is interesting.

02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:31.660
We have Twitch actually releasing games on their platform.

02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:36.300
So this is a new free to play karaoke game called Twitch sings and it's a partnership

02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:40.180
between harmonics and Twitch and it's been in beta for a while.

02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.180
Yes.

02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:44.380
Because you've probably seen this on Twitch already but only certain people had access

02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:46.080
to it.

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:47.500
So apparently yet.

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:52.660
So they have now close to 2000 songs and we'll get new songs over time.

02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:56.260
And apparently it ties directly with the players Twitch accounts letting them stream

02:10:56.260 --> 02:11:02.980
games without needing any sort of additional software or whatever.

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:09.340
Interesting you also support duets using asynchronous multiplayer where one person records half

02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:14.420
of it and the other person sings to the upload of that.

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:17.500
Interesting I have no interest in doing this whatsoever but it's interesting that it's

02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:18.500
something that's available.

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:26.460
I hope we see more things like this or you know Twitch built games or something.

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:29.700
I downloaded it and I'm too afraid to play it on stream.

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:36.420
I got to be honest because my one like karaoke infamous thing I did was when we were at that

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:41.060
theme park years ago and I went to sound booth and I did Madonna's like a prayer because

02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:45.260
that was like a big thing you will do like yeah you go record your video or the video

02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:49.540
no music video is a CD this is before like CD burners were everywhere.

02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:52.260
So like that was the great America right now is a great America.

02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:53.260
Yeah we're there.

02:11:53.260 --> 02:12:00.400
You know I didn't do that Jessica did Lisa Loeb or oh oh no non blondes that was always

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:02.040
her like no she did.

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.040
She did stay.

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.040
Oh yeah.

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.040
That was one of her go to.

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.040
So yeah.

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:07.040
Yeah.

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.040
But anyway.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.040
So anyway.

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:11.380
Well the problem is that CD ended up in the hands of trying to Travis Donovan.

02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:14.140
Oh no.

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:17.920
So it kind of like makes me nervous to do karaoke again.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:22.780
I've gone out and done karaoke at bars and stuff but I don't know like I'm not a great

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:28.180
singer like I'm not William Hung but I'm not like great.

02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:30.220
I'm going to get off key sometimes.

02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:32.060
So makes me a little scared to play it on Twitch.

02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:35.140
I did download the client just to see if I could play it like offline.

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:39.940
I think I can but I didn't even want to play it because Alan was home.

02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:43.500
I didn't even want Alan around I was trying to play it.

02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:46.860
I should have played it earlier today when he went to the gym but I was working on it.

02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.260
I did that movie you saw during the break instead when he was gone at the gym.

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:52.260
So I don't know.

02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:53.620
Maybe I'll play two things somewhat.

02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.700
Would you be willing to do karaoke on stream or soccer.

02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:58.620
I would do it once once.

02:12:58.620 --> 02:12:59.620
OK.

02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:00.620
All right.

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:04.040
I've I've done it and I've been recorded before.

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.140
Maybe I'll do it for charity.

02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.500
Maybe that's maybe that's will finally get me to do two things if it's for rock band

02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.500
for charity maybe.

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:11.500
Yeah.

02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:12.500
Something like that.

02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.940
By the way why are all the copies of robot money do you like expensive.

02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.260
I have no idea why.

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:19.260
I don't know.

02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:21.100
All right.

02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:25.540
Moving on to talk about World of Warcraft something a little more old school and getting

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:29.620
really old school pretty soon because World of Warcraft classic as you know is on the

02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:34.140
way out because what's new is not good for some people they want to go play the game

02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:38.180
the way it used to be back in my day so World of Warcraft classic is on the way and people

02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:40.740
want to know how's PVP going to work.

02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:44.940
Like because you know PVP didn't just like end up in the game all at once.

02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:49.060
How is it going to work in World of Warcraft classic what's going to look like when the

02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.060
game rolls out.

02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:53.980
And the answer is it's going to be rolled out gradually just like it was when the original

02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:55.160
game launched.

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.420
So there will be no kill tracking or reward system at first.

02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.500
If you take down other players just to kill them.

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.180
That's just good.

02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:04.180
Good on you.

02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:05.180
E-peen.

02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:06.180
E-peen points.

02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:07.180
That's all you get.

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:11.820
Phase two kicks in there will be an honor system and rank rewards.

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.540
And then the third phase will bring in the battlegrounds.

02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.900
Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch.

02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:19.260
The fourth phase, Arathi Basin.

02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:23.860
The fifth phase I don't think I don't think will affect PVP I think they're doing other

02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:24.860
updates.

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:29.040
And the sixth phase is finally the World PVP in the Eastern Playlands and Silithus.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.220
But we don't know how long these phases are.

02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.220
We don't know if they're months.

02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:35.620
We don't know if they're weeks or what that's going to look like.

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.620
But I don't know.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:40.220
I really think all these people have been demanding the classic WoT and I think they're

02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:43.100
going to download it, play it, and realize it sucks.

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:46.940
Like I just feel like Blizzard's pouring all these resources into something that's not

02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:48.660
going to last very long.

02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:53.940
I mean I'm sure there'll be like a little a little audience that sticks with it hardcore.

02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:57.020
Now if they were doing something a little more frozen in time when Wrath of the Lich

02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:01.060
King was current content maybe but I even then I still feel like it would be something

02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:05.260
where it's like oh you download the novelties but you've just gotten too used to the quality

02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:08.840
of life stuff that's in the MMOs now.

02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:15.420
Like when people realize that there is no flying mounts that's going to be irritating.

02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:19.580
When people realize that oh there's weapon skills you have to level up because that's

02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:22.300
what you used to have to do and wow they're going to be annoyed.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:26.540
Like there's a lot of things where the quality of life you forget like how much these games

02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:30.340
have progressed because oh everything sucks now I guess.

02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:31.340
I don't know.

02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:34.340
Anyway World of Warcraft classic I'll still check it out.

02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:40.880
Like I mean it's supposed to be free if you're a wow subscriber anyway which I am so I'll

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:46.100
check it out anyway but it's just I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:47.100
All right.

02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:48.100
Anyhow let's move on.

02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:50.020
DarkSakura what do you have for us?

02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:55.920
Well there is a documentary coming about this comes actually from Destructoid but they are

02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:03.480
doing a project about Shirley Curry who is the gaming grandma.

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:08.380
And so they're going to basically it's going to be actually no it looks like it's already

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:11.880
released but it's for her 83rd birthday.

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.840
Going through Skyrim and YouTube and how all of these people have affected her life and

02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:20.120
how she keeps doing it and enjoys what she does.

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:26.660
So I think that's pretty cool and I'd say if you want to watch it I'll link the page

02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:32.640
for it in the chat room but it's on Destructoid and I think it would be a worthwhile watch.

02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:36.740
And this is the same grandma that is like known for Skyrim and we just had a story like

02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:40.480
two weeks ago about that she's in Elder Scrolls 6 now.

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:41.480
Yep.

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:42.480
That's pretty cool.

02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:43.480
Yeah.

02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:44.920
She seems like a fun lady.

02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.960
So I tried to get my mom into games but she wasn't having it.

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.320
I can just imagine your mom sit her down with Skyrim you know and what she would say.

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.320
No.

02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:56.320
Yeah.

02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:57.320
She would.

02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:58.320
Yeah.

02:16:58.320 --> 02:16:59.320
No.

02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.720
I detect holding a controller like this.

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:01.720
She'd be like what do I do.

02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:02.720
There's too many.

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:03.720
But you know you do it.

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:04.720
I'll just tell you what to do.

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:05.720
No.

02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:11.400
The only games I could ever get my mom to play would be like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.800
Family Feud like the game show games.

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:17.760
She would play those but she would still be like you type it in.

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.760
You do.

02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:19.760
You run it.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.760
I don't want to touch it.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.760
Oh my God.

02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.240
Why don't they have game show games like in VR.

02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:27.980
Like imagine actually being able to spin the wheel in Wheel of Fortune.

02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:30.220
I'm sure somebody is working on something like that.

02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:34.740
Just I was going to say just waiting for VR to gain a little more of a foothold.

02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:39.260
But honestly PlayStation VR is so like out there now I'm now I'm surprised there isn't

02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:40.620
a Wheel of Fortune VR game.

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.620
You can even have someone host it or something.

02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:43.620
I don't know.

02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:44.620
It'd be funny.

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:45.620
It's like a wish.

02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:46.620
Yeah.

02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:47.620
Yeah.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:48.620
Yeah.

02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:51.140
These I smell money games live game show apps are all the rage.

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:56.060
Now did you know that even dating apps have like game show things in them.

02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:57.060
What Yeah.

02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:00.100
There's like there's a there's what are you saying there's like a tinder game show now

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:04.060
sort of like I wouldn't expect you to know about this because it's a gay dating app.

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:08.760
There's a gay one called Scruff that like you know gay dudes used to find each other.

02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.400
And this thing has a game show built into it that they do.

02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:19.180
That's just it's the exact same thing as HQ it's the exact same thing as that.

02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:22.820
But it's in this and they'll they'll do a thing where they're all like if you've been

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:26.220
eliminated from the game you can swipe to the side and see other players that have been

02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:29.900
eliminated and you can tap on their profile to save them for later or whatever.

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:35.140
I don't I don't know all the ins and outs of it but yeah they do like a game show and

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:40.540
I know it's funny but like it's all the rage these these game show things okey doke.

02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:42.780
And I don't think it's just dating apps that are doing them too.

02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:49.400
So I'm surprised that we don't have like an HQ type of thing on PlayStation yet or Microsoft.

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:50.400
Maybe it's a matter of time.

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:51.460
I don't know.

02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:58.680
So let's see Kai's you know says I was watching a trivia show in Altspace VR SSU 100 Matt

02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.280
says got to have a VR match game with a digital Charles Nelson Riley.

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:04.280
Hell yes.

02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.560
Well ABC has been reviving all those old game shows like match game is back on ABC and they're

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:10.400
they're doing a press your luck.

02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:14.120
And I think it was the other one concentration maybe that they're doing to I know there's

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.120
they're adapting.

02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:16.120
Yeah.

02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:19.240
ABC is having a lot of those game shows are probably more successful in American Idol

02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:22.800
reboots doing so you know that's on air.

02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:26.640
It's like literally on right now like on the word like there's an American Idol thing on

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:27.640
now.

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640
Like against Game of Thrones.

02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.640
Yeah.

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:30.640
Right.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.640
Yeah.

02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:32.880
I guess it's something to realize that was on.

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:33.880
Yeah.

02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:34.880
No it's back.

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:39.980
Well like it's not even Simon Cowling there anymore it's Katy Perry some country guy Luke

02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:42.880
something and Lionel Richie.

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:47.640
Yeah I watched that like part maybe part of it last season.

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:48.640
I don't really remember.

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:55.140
I don't watch the show but I see the emotional porn clips on Facebook of like this really

02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:58.320
sweet audition that just knocks it apart.

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.140
You won't believe what happens at the 75 second mark like those types of things.

02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:05.380
I just know I'm not doing this.

02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:06.380
I tried to.

02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.220
We tried watching I think we just got bored of it really fast.

02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.180
All right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to discord if we

02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:17.460
have anybody tonight unfortunately because of those things our live viewership is a little

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:19.500
lower than this week.

02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.500
How long is the season again.

02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:21.900
There's only like six or seven weeks right.

02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:22.900
It's a short season.

02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:24.180
It's like eight episodes.

02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:26.500
No offense but good.

02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:27.500
It's gotten into our numbers.

02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:28.500
All right.

02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:30.380
A few more stories for you guys first though Loki.

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:34.700
So in case you're not aware there is this Twitter account called Can you pet the dog

02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:40.460
which basically answers or ask that question among lots of things including games.

02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:43.820
I'm assuming just games.

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:49.820
But apparently one of them it actually looked at into the gungeon and it said no.

02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:57.220
And so into the gungeon of course the devs behind that once people I guess saw that they

02:20:57.220 --> 02:21:01.640
prompted them to like hey you know why can't we pet the dog in the game.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.980
So with the latest update they have now added the ability to pet the dog into the game in

02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:11.820
which the of course tweet was deleted from the Twitter account.

02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:18.740
Can you pet the dog with now it being updated to say yes yes now you can pet the dog.

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:25.700
All those updates just to get on the Web site that yes you can now pet the dog.

02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:26.700
Yes.

02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:27.700
What happens when you pet the dog.

02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:28.700
Just go Arf.

02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:32.500
I don't like in some games when you go up and talk to the dog the dog just goes wolf

02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:35.220
estimation boy and that's like you petting the dog.

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:39.460
I don't know but you can I guess I'll have to download and see I don't know.

02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:40.460
All right.

02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:41.460
Anyhow.

02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:46.980
And lastly tonight my last story that I had earmarked for tonight was about roblox.

02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:51.100
So I guess we kind of already got into that discussion earlier but the notable landmark

02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:56.760
for roblox is that they have hit 90 million monthly active users.

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:59.220
They announced that news today actually.

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:03.780
This gaming company is also going to be expanding into other territories.

02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:08.740
French and German languages will be added into the game and even more languages from

02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:09.740
there.

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:15.080
So in a statement the president of roblox international which yes is a thing Chris Minzer

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:19.740
said roblox is where anyone can unleash their creativity and have fun with their friends

02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:21.380
no matter where they live.

02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:25.820
By bringing top games and resources to French and German audiences we're uniting the next

02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:30.840
generation through a truly global platform for play.

02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:33.160
Everyone playing it is 13 I'm telling you.

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:35.300
Or younger.

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:36.300
Or even younger.

02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:40.440
No I should I there was one or two people in chat that were like I'm 30 and I play it

02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:43.600
so I'm just saying I just knows wow.

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:44.600
I feel old.

02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:49.040
I don't usually get that feeling a lot but yeah and dark soccer if you're in your feelings

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:53.480
right now with your birthday being this week I implore you do not watch roblox streams

02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:59.000
because you'll just be more in your feelings because that's where I was today.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.900
I have no feelings.

02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.920
My heart shriveled up.

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:04.920
All right.

02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:09.800
So congratulations though to roblox no you know what I will say this.

02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:17.740
I will say that it's really cool that roblox is getting kids interested in programming

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:19.960
and stuff like the way you describe it.

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:20.960
That is pretty rad.

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:26.000
So as much as I like poke fun at this game tongue in cheek I think that is really cool.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.480
Wow breaking news I had no idea this was the case.

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:34.320
Bobby Blackwell is telling me buzzer the network on Twitch that has all the classic game shows

02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:36.800
is no longer airing.

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.160
That's tragic.

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:41.040
Is the over the air buzzer still there.

02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:42.040
I'm sad.

02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:43.040
What happened.

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.520
They put a goodbye message or anything.

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.520
God damn it.

02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.260
This is why we can't have nice things.

02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:54.720
I love my classic game shows but I guess that's actually I feel like it probably went off

02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:55.720
the air a while ago.

02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:59.000
I haven't seen it in a long time actually.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.520
So they probably pulled themselves a long time ago.

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.780
No I don't see anything.

02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:07.480
It just said we'll be back soon.

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:08.800
All right then.

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:10.200
Yeah as soon as any time.

02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:11.880
Yeah that could be anything.

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:16.600
All right well anyhow hopefully you'll be with us very soon.

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:20.120
We're going to take some calls now via discord.

02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:26.800
So if you want to be on the show you can join the green room over on the vog network discord

02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:32.880
which again is accessible over at vog network dot com slash discord.

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.000
Although of course nobody's there right now I have a feeling it's going to be a very slow

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.280
week just because our live listenership is a little bit lower than usual and I imagine

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:43.520
all the TV going on and other things share of sorts.

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:47.480
Well not just that but if I'm not mistaken if Easter is next weekend then I mean spring

02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:49.760
break started this week for a lot of people.

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:50.760
Right.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.760
Yeah.

02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:52.760
So that's probably cutting into it too.

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.200
So I don't think it's just the HBO shows fault and that sort of thing.

02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:01.880
So we'll take questions in our chat and comments as well over a vog.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:06.720
Well I mean vog network dot com will get you there but over twitch TV slash vog network.

02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:11.960
So as you know says I just saw buzzer a day or two ago it's a sister network on one of

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:13.040
my local channels.

02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:19.100
Yeah they they are you know when TV switched from analog to digital right.

02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:23.240
So like TVs don't have the dials anymore or if you had a TV that had the dials you had

02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:26.960
to get an adapter to get digital signals that changed like God that was probably like eight

02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.800
years ago at this point it's been a while.

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.600
When the expansion to digital happened there's more room there's more bandwidth.

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.160
So it's off the air because I'm like it seems to be pulling up on their Web site.

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:41.120
I don't know if maybe they're streaming through a different platform or something interesting

02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:44.880
I don't know if they have it or that could actually that could be the buzzer.

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:48.000
That could be the buzzer network that's over the air.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.240
Maybe it's just on their their but but I can't pull that up on my Xbox one.

02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:57.780
That's what I like to do with the twitch app is I would just pull up buzzer and watch old

02:25:57.780 --> 02:25:58.840
game shows.

02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:05.860
So anyway but yeah no but the digital expansion happens so that's why you have like all these

02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:11.780
like little networks that you're like you know like your CBS station like here we have

02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:14.080
what CBS is 13 right.

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:20.180
So I think 13 too is like the CBS all news network all day and it is news all 24 7 and

02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:23.260
I think there's another one that's just weather 24 7.

02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:27.100
And so that's where buzzer goes on some of these areas is that they just go on one of

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:28.680
the digital channels.

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:31.840
Some will do like Christian programming all day long depending on what part of the country

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:36.380
you live in or other types of religious programming or possibly Spanish language programming is

02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:38.800
another one.

02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:40.620
There's another one that's on to movies.

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:43.060
There's some that just show classic movies all day long.

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.700
So it just depends.

02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:51.820
Let's see Frodo Swaggins is asking in our chat room is did Facebook streaming ever go

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:52.820
anywhere.

02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:54.140
Oh it's it's still a thing.

02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:56.420
I see it's so easy from your mobile phone.

02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:58.780
I mean like the real life streaming.

02:26:58.780 --> 02:26:59.900
I see that all the time.

02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:05.380
I was watching because I was a youtuber that I watch only 43 who does a lot of Grand Theft

02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:07.420
Auto stuff and all sorts of other games.

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:13.060
But he for a while tried doing live streaming from Facebook for the Facebook gaming stuff

02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:14.060
specifically gaming.

02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:15.060
OK.

02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:16.060
Yeah.

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:19.840
So Facebook gaming stuff and his thing take away from it was when he did like his first

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:21.220
few streams.

02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:27.280
He got quite a few views on there but then it really dropped immensely afterwards like

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:31.860
he was getting just no traction whatsoever and he thought it was probably their algorithm

02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:33.360
that's fucking with it.

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.860
And so he's basically given up on it and going back to Twitch and YouTube instead.

02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:43.020
So it sounds like it's still out there but however they have their algorithms it's not

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.020
working out.

02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:46.700
They might have had that curiosity factor at first too.

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:50.340
But then like now people aren't talking about oh Facebook's getting into gaming streaming

02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:51.460
so people aren't looking at it.

02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:52.460
Yeah.

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:53.460
I think that's a huge part.

02:27:53.460 --> 02:28:00.180
So it's there but I don't know how long until I think that the problem where I think a lot

02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:04.140
of the competitors to Twitch and so forth have a real problem getting their foot in

02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:06.620
the door is because Twitch has an app.

02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:08.740
Twitch isn't just a Web site.

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:10.060
Twitch is a phone app.

02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.980
Twitch is an app on PlayStation 4.

02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:13.460
It's an app on Xbox One.

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:16.980
And I would bet those that are watching the show right now some are probably on their

02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:17.980
PCs.

02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:21.180
Most are on their PCs or Macs whatever you know desktop computers right now watching

02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.180
the show.

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:26.660
And I would say quite a few are on their mobile phones watching probably so they can watch

02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:29.300
in their bedroom or while they multitask or something.

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:32.180
Maybe some might just have their headphones in because you can just listen to audio only

02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:33.180
on Twitch.

02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:35.340
So some people might be doing it that way.

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:40.100
And then some folks might be on their PlayStation or their Xbox One streaming through it right

02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:41.100
now.

02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:42.900
That's what's so I think great about Twitch.

02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:49.420
When Facebook gaming came out the only way to watch it was on PC or Mac or whatever.

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.580
Could you even do it on the mobile app.

02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:53.420
Maybe you probably could do it on the mobile app.

02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:54.420
That's it.

02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:56.860
It wasn't really baked into consoles or anything else.

02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:01.380
At least Mixer you know which is probably Twitch's biggest well Mixer and YouTube I

02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:03.460
guess which are probably the biggest competitors.

02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:05.560
YouTube is also available everywhere right.

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:07.580
We know that YouTube is everywhere.

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:09.180
Mixer is on most of those places.

02:29:09.180 --> 02:29:13.460
It's just not on the PlayStation or the Nintendo Switch.

02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:19.800
But if these rumors and things about Nintendo and Microsoft being in bed together continue

02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:24.460
I would bet we're going to get a Mixer app on Nintendo Switch before we get a Twitch

02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:26.900
app on Nintendo Switch.

02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:28.480
Not saying you're gonna be able to stream your games.

02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:32.460
I don't know if the Switch has the power for that but you might be able to watch at least.

02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:34.180
I mean YouTube is on there now.

02:29:34.180 --> 02:29:35.220
Am I correct.

02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:36.220
So yeah.

02:29:36.220 --> 02:29:37.220
Yeah.

02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:43.060
Look in our chat lights up there and Bobby says the Amazon Fire TV stick finally got

02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:44.060
a Twitch update.

02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:46.620
Act Deaf is using his PlayStation 4.

02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:48.860
Spyro 557 Jonathan's on his phone.

02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:50.980
Frodo Swaggins is on his phone at work.

02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:53.660
So people that's the great thing about Twitch in my opinion.

02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:59.280
And one reason why I was really sold on the move over from how we were doing this before

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:00.280
on Shoutcast.

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:01.280
Yeah.

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:04.600
Because you couldn't really do Shoutcast I mean you could do Shoutcast on mobile but

02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:08.880
it was like you had to know that you really download an app called TuneIn and that will

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:11.800
get you into it and like all this stuff like it just wasn't the same.

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.720
Like Twitch is very very easy and that's kind of what I like about it to be honest.

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:19.240
Anyway I do see we have a call waiting in the green room so I want to go ahead and take

02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:20.240
a call here.

02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:25.560
I just closed my control panel however so there we go I think I can do my drag and drop

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:26.560
now.

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:27.560
Yes there we go.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.560
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:29.560
Who's this?

02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.560
Hey this is Act Deaf.

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:31.840
Hey it's good to hear from you Act Deaf.

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:32.840
What's up buddy?

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:43.000
Well I want to talk about KmonGo and pretty much all the events we've had for the last

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.460
like two months maybe.

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:50.640
There's been a lot right because we don't just have the community days but we've been

02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:55.600
having these research days right so it's it's been a lot.

02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:00.500
Yeah it's been a lot we've had the at least in the last month.

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:11.740
We've had the Econox event, we've had also the Lotad and Castform event, then we also

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:23.540
had Trico last month, we had just the Bagon community day also and we had this past week

02:31:23.540 --> 02:31:28.140
what what what other event we had oh the debug got a bug out event.

02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:36.540
So yeah there have been like really really tons of events but by my question here for

02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:44.380
for you and anyone on the studio playing Pokemon Go have you liked the events at all?

02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:47.620
Have you literally been like excited to play an event?

02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:49.620
When I can go to them.

02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:55.220
Yeah I'm kind of with you Jamie I like the concept of the events I think they're doing

02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:58.880
too many of these limited time events.

02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:03.940
I think these like week long things like the bug festival or the raid bosses are changing

02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:08.620
that's fine but like there's too many things that are limited time and then you have that

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:12.820
whole FOMO if you fear missing out and you feel like well the object of the game is to

02:32:12.820 --> 02:32:16.060
collect them all and they can't do every event then I've flopped and I might as well quit

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:22.100
playing and like these things like the lunchtime raids like in theory that's a good idea but

02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:27.980
that they should be doing it like more often than what they're doing or the you know the

02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:34.660
community day and stuff that's fine and good but like I can't like put aside this specific

02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:41.860
three hour window to go do these things every time you know at the whim of Niantic and whatever

02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:45.540
window they choose that's why I think the low tat event and the castle one thing ended

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:50.540
up being a little better because that had the nine hour window on it right yeah yeah

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:54.460
and that was a little better so you didn't feel the need to grind the entire nine hours

02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:57.780
you just did it enough to get like your one or two but then I guess the shiny drop rate

02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:01.740
was so low on some some people did grind for hours and hours and still didn't get what

02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:05.100
they were looking for so I think Niantic in some ways has to find the balance there but

02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:11.500
I think as far as like the burnout of Pokemon go with all these events and the limited event

02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:17.580
fatigue I think it's very real like I have a friend who is a big presence in Pokemon

02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:22.980
go like co like he doesn't lead the raid group but he's kind of like the vice lead of a big

02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:28.340
raid group here locally and he kind of said like yeah I'm just getting really kind of like Pokemon

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:32.660
go is kind of starting to drag a little bit like it's just not as exciting as used to be so he

02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:39.180
picked up ingress and like he's gone like off the deep end and ingress I mean that a good way like

02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:43.380
he's already up to like level he's gonna be level 9 pretty soon which you know takes a little while

02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:48.100
I know it doesn't sound like a long way but it's a pretty long way in ingress and it like he's just

02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:53.500
enjoying that right now so it's and I'm sure when the Harry Potter game comes out of all things it's

02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:58.180
gonna make this worse because so many people are gonna want to jump ship to Harry Potter now is that

02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:03.740
really a loss for Niantic I guess not if they're just it's kind of like it's kind of like when

02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:10.420
people leave World of Warcraft to go play overwatch is that really a loss for blizzard not really

02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:15.380
because you're still kind of keeping them in the system keeping it in the fam so to speak so yeah

02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:20.060
I don't know but um how are you feeling about it all act after what's that what's the impression

02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:27.460
from you as well as like your community well mostly my community has been someone liking it

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:36.220
but but I understand also the frustration coming from the loss of people and friends that are

02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:44.900
playing right now because like for example the past bug out of band that lasted a week do you

02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:52.900
get any like shiny from from it from which event I didn't get any from the last one yeah from the

02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:58.780
bug bug out of and from oh the bug event no I didn't get any I I'm sorry when he was saying

02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:04.700
that real fat I was like is that a bag on I got no no the bug event I ain't gaining I had well I

02:35:04.700 --> 02:35:10.900
already had a shiny Caterpie I had that from before I got it in a research task but I know

02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:14.980
like Scyther was the new one no I did I saw Scyther's everywhere but I didn't get a shiny

02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:20.220
yeah and many people were frustrated because of that because oh there they all wanted us

02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:29.180
a shiny Scyther I managed to get one and I was like really really lucky but so many people even

02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:36.580
in my my personal raid group like we're really really frustrated they were like oh I'm tired

02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:45.980
of this I don't want to do this every every single week like per se because if if you're not gonna

02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:53.300
get like new content we're not gonna get like that really really big chance of getting a shiny

02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:59.900
and I understand that a shiny it's like a really really lucky occurrence it shouldn't be like oh

02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:07.700
they they just dust them around especially with this kind of events but still it's like there's

02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:17.460
no not gonna say pressure but there's no there's no really really great reward yeah or doing those

02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:23.780
events so yeah you just play normally I think Pokemon go could really benefit from like a

02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:29.020
crafting system sort of thing like a way and you know not maybe like literally the way you might

02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:34.100
interpret what I'm when I say that but like you know a way to sort of guarantee that you can get

02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:40.980
a shiny Scyther if you do like a lot of work like you might still have a chance at it through RNG

02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:46.300
but like you guarantee yourself one if you're willing to do a lure item for a shiny yeah well

02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:50.580
because they don't want to give out well I've heard that that might be something because somebody did

02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:55.980
data mining I've heard there is like a shiny it's either a is it a lure or an incense these an

02:36:55.980 --> 02:36:59.980
incense thing that they're looking at doing like that would attract more shinies but I also

02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:06.660
realized Niantic doesn't want to necessarily give away shinies like candy because there's only so

02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:11.580
many and then like if somebody fills out a pokey Texas shinies then what you know like what's what's

02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:15.980
left to do in the game for some people so they want to keep people coming back so but I you know

02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:23.900
I think of things like the Meltan quest I took a long time to do or the what was the one the

02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:29.900
Halloween by the way I know it's hard it's hard to find the Aerodactyl huh spirit orb I think I've

02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:35.380
had a bunch of Aerodactyls had a spear I just keep forgetting the transfer stuff to my let's go game

02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:39.660
but um you know they had a question I think I think maybe if there was like some type of

02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:43.300
questing or some other way you could like guarantee you to get a shiny if you do a lot

02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:49.260
of work if you spin a stop every day if you're checking like I I think it would help I think

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:53.780
with some of that so that at least you can still get the reward and not feel like you're just at

02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:59.820
the mercy of the random number generator yeah and I've seen concepts of that like the shiny

02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:09.260
incense and also like in the main games that you can have a shiny charm so you could possibly get

02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:16.900
they could reward it if if they they're planning on expanding levels like instead of 40 being the

02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:25.500
limit like 45 or 50 being the level limit they can probably reward the a shiny charm for yeah

02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:30.740
those getting levels or you know maybe maybe you'll hate me for putting this idea out in the

02:38:30.740 --> 02:38:35.700
universe but one big thing they started doing in ingress when they released ingress prime is that

02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:41.420
now you can do something called recursion so if you were a max level agent in ingress level 16

02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:45.980
you could basically go back to the beginning you wouldn't lose your badge you wouldn't lose your

02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:50.100
perks that come with the leveling you wouldn't lose like your badges or anything you wouldn't

02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:55.020
lose your lifetime AP is still track but basically you go back to level one and level again I

02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:00.260
actually did it and I'm only on level 10 in the recursion process now so soft six levels to go

02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:04.980
which can take me a very long time but my point is we're still waiting to see what the perk is

02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:11.300
for recursing in the first place besides a shiny badge but what if they brought in a similar type

02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:16.340
of system in Pokemon go where okay you've hit the max level you've gone as far as you can go in

02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:24.980
Pokemon go you can reset back to level one but you get a big reward like a shiny charm maybe would be

02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:30.100
like your your reward for resetting back to level one I bet you there's people that would do it for

02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:39.460
a shiny charm Shane or maybe like a permanent incubator and a second permanent incubator for

02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:43.980
recursing going back to the beginning there might be some people that would be really intrigued by

02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:50.020
that idea so I don't know this is something that I could I think when we talk about extra levels in

02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:55.260
Pokemon go I have a feeling they might do something like the recursion from ingress instead or

02:39:55.420 --> 02:40:01.820
prestige ing is how they call this in other games too and yeah that that would be actually awesome I

02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:09.580
would be down for that actually because even right now and as sj100 madison and shad you get to level

02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:17.020
40 and lucky x are like yeah I I don't need them I I have no use for them I have like almost like

02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:22.540
more than 40 lucky x that I don't I don't use because I don't have the need for them

02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:29.740
so yeah having like recursive or or prestige whatever they want to call it yeah it would be

02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:37.660
great because they I would be like more incentivized to play more because I would

02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:44.460
like to to get those rewards again at level 20 level 30 or even getting again to level 40

02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:52.300
that that would be like really awesome that the game is fine right now it's it isn't

02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:57.740
and like bobby buckwolf says also a dead game it isn't at all well he always says that just yeah

02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:05.020
yeah he's that's the recurring joke there but but still that there's many people that think that

02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:13.660
and it it isn't but it's starting to feel like is it is going to be a dead game it won't it's

02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:19.980
starting to feel like a job and games shouldn't feel like a job yes and I see people that treat

02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:26.060
pokemon go and ingress as their job you know and it's like you just kind of like okay you don't

02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:31.500
want to let a game dictate that much you know what I mean it's it's really it's really kind

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.220
of hard to watch that but um maybe niantic is listening and maybe would adapt some of these

02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:40.300
ideas I think that would be very exciting but I will say this you know despite this conversation

02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:43.580
about some of the troubles of pokemon go I don't know about your neck of the woods but like

02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:49.020
community day yesterday down at capital park where I usually go it was it was hopping like it was

02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:52.620
more crowded yesterday and I've seen it in quite a while so I don't know if that's just because the

02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:59.340
weather was really good too or what but it was it was hopping yesterday oh yeah I've seen that

02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:06.380
effect on my neck on the woods were there server problems there's um not in the states yeah there

02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:12.140
were server problems in japan yeah yeah they they always happen in japan it's like they give

02:42:12.140 --> 02:42:17.260
they end up extending it and in japan what happens is because now they do it time zone by time zone

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:22.300
who has the first time zones on the planet that region like australia asia they get the first

02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:28.140
ones and so all the problems show up then yeah in japan it's always a given that it's going to fail

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:33.980
that these at the first hour so yeah they always extend it they always do something like that

02:42:33.980 --> 02:42:39.020
because it always fails because there's way too many people playing in japan yeah and not

02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:44.700
mentioning spoopers but yeah i was gonna say i didn't notice anything going on so no it was

02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:49.900
fine here but but california if you think about it we're one of the last areas to do community

02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:55.660
day because the only place on earth that has time zones later than us is like hawaii alaska

02:42:55.660 --> 02:43:01.100
the hawaii and alaska would be the latter or earlier than us would be the no they're they

02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:05.580
because they have to wait till it's three o'clock in their region so oh i see and they're behind so

02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:13.100
hawaii is like the last on the planet to do the community day basically yeah so yeah but but yeah

02:43:13.100 --> 02:43:20.140
going back to the community day thing it was pretty great the past two community days have been

02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:27.020
really packed their way there have been way more people than in previous community days and that

02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:33.500
has been awesome but something that is going to suck but really really suck is coming into the

02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:41.900
summer having the three to six time in a 110 degree weather i don't know if you caught me

02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:46.620
i complained about this exact thing earlier i said they're gonna need to re-evaluate those times when

02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:50.700
summer gets here because five o'clock is the hottest point of the day so either it needs to

02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:56.460
go back what do it in the morning or yeah they need to go back to the 11 am time frame or i'm

02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:01.020
just gonna go play indoors like we have a mall here that has 10 pokestops it's enough

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:07.820
yeah that's what we're planning to on on on possibly torture community day

02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:15.820
we're going to the mall it has four five pokestops too and two gyms so we're gonna be fine

02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:23.180
there there's tons of pokies uh pokemon spawning there so so yeah because in the summer at least

02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:30.700
we would have endured the first hour and a half um being outside at the middle of the day but

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:38.220
still it would have been uh like okay we can we can endure it but three to six is gonna be like

02:44:38.780 --> 02:44:43.740
hell literally hell because it's gonna be way too hot you know what i'm thinking i'm like while

02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:49.100
it's on my mind i'm like next time i go to galleria i need to submit more ingress portals

02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:53.020
there so that way by the time summer rolls around maybe there'll be some more pokestops

02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:59.900
like kind of help myself in advance that's what i'm thinking too that's what i'm thinking with

02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:07.100
my brother since his level 10 ah we can make more portals there yeah go get him to submit some

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:11.180
portals at the mall get ready for that because those take a few months to go through so get

02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:15.580
working on that yeah all right all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:19.100
but thank you for calling in i appreciate that and uh it's always good to talk to you and have

02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:24.860
a great week okay hey thanks for having me and good luck with shiny latios thank you i'll try

02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:31.100
my best take care buddy thanks all right always good to hear from act theft and i think uh i think

02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:34.540
on that note that's probably the i didn't see anybody else in the green room waiting so i think

02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:39.980
we'll probably wrap up on that note but thanks of course to everybody who's uh listening live

02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:43.260
tonight and participating and of course if you're listening on the podcast feed or watching the

02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:49.020
twitch archive then that is all fine and dandy too we appreciate that as well um hey if you

02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:52.860
enjoyed what you heard here at orange lawns radio tonight tell a friend or two about the show help

02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:56.700
us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't

02:45:56.700 --> 02:46:01.180
here to chat with us how can we possibly get all the opinions out there we need people who want

02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:05.020
to pay for dlc to unlock everything in the game we need more of those types of opinions and the

02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:09.740
the other sorts of takes there and if you only have one friend then tell your one friend yes

02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:15.500
and or or leave us a nice five star review on a place like itunes or google play or um you know

02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:20.620
a nice uh twitch hosting i really can't tell you how far that stuff goes and helping like twitch

02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:26.380
hosts and five star reviews on podcast apps are like the number one way to like help this grow

02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:30.700
and of course we're buying me a pizza no buying jamie a pizza will do nothing that's just something

02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:37.260
she wants but making me happy makes me uh have more incentive to do things anyway although

02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:41.340
staying in bed also works all right well uh we're gonna go around and give everybody's final

02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:44.860
thought because we're about to wrap up for the week here uh dark soccer will not be joining us

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:49.420
next week as she has her easter commitments in the golden gate park in san francisco and i'm

02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:57.660
gonna be old oh too old and happy early birthday and none of that none of that on your birthday

02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:05.580
i'm gonna be doing none of anything all right but happy birthday thank you remember when we were

02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:10.780
kids and we first met no i'm too old to remember it was the olr my god i was how old was i when

02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:16.620
our last started like 24 it's crazy i was still older just not not by much so i think i was still

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:21.820
in my yeah i was in my 20s all right um let's go around to everybody's final thought dark soccer

02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:26.300
will start with you have a good week off next week we'll miss you but our what our aim will continue

02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:33.420
to improve uh cadbury creme eggs speaking of eggs and this is my final thought deer animal crossing

02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:40.700
put more of these fucking eggs where i can find them i need 150 more so i can get the stupid bunny

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:46.620
and get more fucking leaves leaf tickets or points or whatever shit they're called

02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:52.220
frodo swagans wants to know what day is your birthday the 19th 19th i will it will officially

02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:58.140
be at whatever 2 a.m is central time all right fair enough i was born into central time

02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:03.260
uh loki so that would actually be midnight here the day before if you think about it i

02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:08.140
think that 4 a.m um central so it'd be 2 a.m here okay it's 4 a.m yeah 2 a.m here

02:48:08.940 --> 02:48:15.580
i was also born early in the morning i was a 5 a.m baby i woke up my mama labor because i'm a brat

02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:21.660
all right um listen i'll do my final thought my final thought tonight is um i'm gonna try to get

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:26.540
to at least level 20 in borderlands and keep my going my way through the story and probably hit

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:30.780
level 70 on all the healers and palm asi 14 as well that'll probably be my week and then i have

02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:34.380
to think about what i want to play after that because i'm not sure yet uh loki your final

02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:41.500
thought i'll probably finish the other two toy con things that i have still for labo vr and i'll try

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:51.660
to roll back my uh insane borderland save hacking to it it's a damn game because it crashes whenever

02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:58.940
i go to the actual uh perk screen and that's what causes the crash every time for no reason and so

02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:04.460
and it's apparently this bug is not necessarily just from what i've been doing it's related to

02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:10.540
the phys x and it's also from the original game like the original release and so it's a bug that

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:16.220
they've had in there they patched out and then remastered the bug um so yeah that's what we'll

02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:22.540

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:26.060
screaming in the other room would you know something like that used to happen for becky

02:49:26.060 --> 02:49:31.260
because i would hack her mass effect save file so like she could use like one of the hairstyles

02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:36.060
that's programmed into the game but it wasn't available mr smoosh screaming still is like what

02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:42.540
