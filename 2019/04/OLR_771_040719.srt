Orange Lounge Radio

With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

This week you got your Apex and my Fortnite

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
From downtown, in my rage

And your VR and my Switch

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've read through the fools and hope it's all legit

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To bring you tonight's news starting right now on the show

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Where every gamer has a voice

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Live with episode number 771

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For this April the 7th of 2019

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And joining me in studio

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so full

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're full?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Of those cookies that you brought to the studio tonight

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well I meant to save one

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But I ate it

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She was going to give us a cookie

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But she ate it

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They came out black

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or gray

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because I made raspberry and blackberry puree

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And when I added it to the batter

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It turned gray and got really sticky

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I had to add more flour

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I don't know if I'm going to make them again

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Because the first bite's like sugar cookie and then raspberry flavor

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It turned out good though

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It did but I like my sugar cookies

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But I'm not doing any more dandelion cookies this season either

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Speaking of our raspberry cookies

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Would you allow the Twitch folks to see the back of your head

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because it's a very lovely red color

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This isn't raspberry though

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I know it's a little lighter than raspberry

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I like the color

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is flamingo

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is orange and peach

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can't really see

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is where my head was shaved

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well and for the podcast listeners

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They can't see anything anyway

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sucks to be you

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I didn't say that they suck

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I said it sucks to be them

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Since they can't see the gloriousity

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of my you know

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My hair

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well if you want to see the gloriousity of hair

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can tune in live every Sunday night at Twitch TV

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My follicular glory

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is that a word? Follicular?

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me do my plug be quiet

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000

Other things you can see on Twitch

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a word

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Follicular

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can I introduce our third host please?

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alright over there by my side

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Did you just catch a Pokemon here?

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Techmaster Loki

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Live on air

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is there something good on the house I should be paying attention to?

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No I just have to get rid of all these

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Great and whatever

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh like the quest you have to make so many

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No I just have so many of them

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm taking out my inventory space and normally I just throw them away

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So you know might as well

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Gotcha you got too many balls

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Robin he's throwing away his blue balls

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Too many balls

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't want to know about yellow balls

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Over in our chat

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Over at Twitch TV slash vog network

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because again we tape live on Sunday nights

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And you guys can join us in our chat room

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Bobby Black Wolf suggesting that somebody could make a clip

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Of the hair thing and then

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Cause yeah there are clips of our show

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And Bobby's show

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We have a little archive cause that's a little something special

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You can see it free of course when we broadcast live on Sunday

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But you can subscribe using your

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Twitch Prime subscription or any of the

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Twitch subscription offers they have there

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And you will get access

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
To the complete video library so you can watch

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A video episode if you want

102
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Audio only of course is free as it's always been

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
For coming up on 17 years

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But the clips that people make

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are free

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you can see little like 30 second clips of our show

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Some people clip random things too

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think some people just accidentally clip the button

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cause they'll be like these random I'm like why did somebody

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Clip that it's just us I mean

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not like yeah but there's

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Also clips of things that are like

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You know funny moments or like when

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Smoosh came on camera that one night or whatever

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So things happen

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's part of the magic of doing Twitch since

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We did move over in December

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
From Shoutcast where we were beforehand

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Anyway let's get

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Into our kickoff topic tonight let's talk about

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's talk about anniversaries

122
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a little bit different of a kickoff topic

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Usually we would talk about you know some

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
New gaming story or what's

125
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Going on in the news and there is a little bit going on in the

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Gaming news this week although it's probably slowed down

127
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A little bit from last

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Week because of

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know there's no PAX this week

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Or GDC I think everything's calming down a little bit

131
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But we do have a big anniversary

132
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That we're looking at this week and that is

133
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Final Fantasy 6

134
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Celebrating it's 25th anniversary

135
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now of course I'm sure

136
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Many of you guys that consume

137
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Gaming podcasts are probably aware at this

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Point that here in the US

139
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We received Final Fantasy 6

140
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As Final Fantasy 3

141
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So sometimes this is called Final Fantasy 3 US

142
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We received it as that but

143
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is in the true Final Fantasy

144
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Canon it's the 6th game and

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
25 years ago on April

146
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
2nd so this week in

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
1994 Final Fantasy

148
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
6 was released in Japan

149
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We got it a little bit later because

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Back then you know it wasn't

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Such a global economy

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The internet had not yet taken off

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think the internet was probably still government in 94

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't think you could do internet on Prodigy

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Or AOL that stuff yet

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
94? Not yet

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Almost there right? No you had AOL

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Remember I met Dan

159
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In my first year on AOL

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In 93, 94 was

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AOL 1.5 which was the DOS based

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I thought it was more like after I graduated high school in 96

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But I think it was still

164
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We can say it was still very niche and not a lot of people were

165
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was in college

166
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But anyway

167
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Regardless Final Fantasy 6 came out

168
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
25 years ago and obviously

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A lot of people

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Remember this game very fondly

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Although we sometimes joke about

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Super Nintendo releases and

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What's better Super Metroid or

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Chrono Trigger or

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We razzed maybe other games

176
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Of Final Fantasy series like you guys know I have my

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Issues of Final Fantasy 8 and so forth

178
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All that tongue and cheek

179
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Talk aside I think

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Generally most people regard this

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As especially in

182
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Our age group of gamers

183
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that's an important footnote to make

184
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You know the late 30's early 40's

185
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Probably a good range outside of that too

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think there's a generation almost that would consider

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Even if maybe Final Fantasy 6 isn't

188
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Your favorite game

189
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's probably one of your favorite

190
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Games if you're a role play

191
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Person if you're more of a sports gamer

192
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Maybe it's not in your list but I know a lot

193
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of people that would be Final Fantasy 10

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you're a sports game oh for Blitzball

195
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Heck yeah come on San Arc and Abe's yeah right

196
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But anyway

197
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think this game certainly left an impact

198
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
On a lot of people

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dark Sakura you know since you were

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
On the internet earlier and I know you're a big retro

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Gamer and a big gamer girl

202
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
All the way back in college and so forth

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What was your memories with

204
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Final Fantasy 6?

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Pretending to have the flu for a week so I could beat it

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
After I rented it

207
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So you rented the game

208
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You didn't even I rented it and you held on to it

209
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
For an entire week that's a lot of late fees

210
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No I

211
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Renewed my rental the place that we were renting our

212
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Video games from you could rent for a week oh that's

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh nice and so cause I wasn't running through

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Blockbuster we were doing like little mom and pops

215
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah I rented cause I worked for

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mom and pops I usually rented through there too but

217
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah but I

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Played the shit out of it

219
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I actually

220
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Started over after the

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Minecart level and then

222
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Just started completely over and just

223
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Zoomed right up till then and then

224
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Got through it I don't know why I think it was

225
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just that motion sickness thing I've had cause I had

226
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just couldn't do it at all

227
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Got so pissed that I put it away for a day

228
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Went back started over and beat the

229
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Whole game in the rest of the week and

230
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was absolutely amazing and then I

231
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Finally got my own copy

232
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I remember

233
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Watching a friend in high school

234
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Play it because you know my family

235
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Was pretty middle class so it's like

236
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We didn't really get the games when they first

237
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Came out or that was a real treat like when I got

238
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mortal Kombat on Mortal Monday or whatever

239
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was that was a freaking treat cause

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I usually didn't get games on the release day so I didn't get

241
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Final Fantasy 3 I didn't even I somehow didn't

242
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Even realize the game was coming out and I was over at a

243
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Friends house one day and

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We were about to do I used to do

245
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
D&D in high school so we were about to do a D&D

246
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thing and I walk in and they're playing

247
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm like oh my gosh this

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is like Final Fantasy 2

249
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But because remember I didn't I wasn't

250
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As aware of what was going on in Japan and everything

251
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm like this is Final Fantasy 2 but like

252
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Like oh my gosh I'm just like watching

253
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Like dumbfounded the entire time because

254
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's like the mechs and the different

255
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think he was at the point in the game where you

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Had Edgar and Sabin and

257
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So he was showing off how you could put like in the

258
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Controller input cause remember with Sabin it's like

259
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He did a little Hadouken and he would actually do

260
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Was it that was one move?

261
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think so. You know there was like the controller input moves

262
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And it was like oh my gosh it's like a

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Fighting game not really but you know

264
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
When you're 13 you're thinking those types of things right

265
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a fighting game and then

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Of course Edgar had the tools right

267
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So he had like the chainsaw

268
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And the so it was like

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah the autocrossbow the gas

270
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Thing the bio weapon or whatever

271
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And so it was like getting to see all that for the first

272
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Time was like oh my gosh it's so cool

273
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And so like I knew I had to have it and so I

274
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know begged and I ugly begged

275
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I was like what did they get? So finally

276
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For Christmas that year I got that game

277
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I just I played it like

278
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Every single day until I beat it

279
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think part of me as a

280
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Kid is still a little more

281
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Fond of Final Fantasy 2 or what

282
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Would be 4 of course in canon

283
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Just because that was like the first one

284
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I played and especially like the

285
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Story from start to finish

286
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because I don't know why but Final Fantasy

287
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
6's ending

288
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was always a little weirder to me

289
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Like that I think it's

290
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me kind of rephrase this

291
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Because I think it's something I've grown to appreciate

292
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
In my older years

293
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
As I did versus when I would have first

294
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Played through this game you know

295
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Many years ago when I was like

296
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
13

297
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is that I seem to remember

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Actually no I would have been ordering 13

299
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because this game was out when I was in high school and it's

300
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What 25 years ago so I was more like 15, 16

301
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I didn't

302
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like the way like at the end you

303
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Split up into the 3 parties

304
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And he had to kind of go through that way

305
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then like everybody

306
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Kind of had like a little piece of an

307
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ending and then like if you didn't have

308
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Somebody you wouldn't see their piece

309
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because there's somebody I didn't

310
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh I think it was Shadow I didn't have Shadow

311
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You have to wait for him

312
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well right but I didn't know that

313
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wait for his late diva ass

314
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Right so I didn't know that when I was

315
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A teenager actually you know the

316
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
As a teenager do you know what I remember

317
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
About Final Fantasy 6

318
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Like something I interpreted in the script

319
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That like nobody else took away from it

320
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I know this is wrong but when I first

321
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Played the game I thought that

322
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
One of the flashback scenes with

323
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Realm and

324
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What was the older guys name

325
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Her grandfather

326
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Whose name I can't remember in the moment but somebody will

327
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yell it out in chat shortly

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I thought that Shadow was Realms mom

329
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Notice I didn't say dad

330
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I said mom

331
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I thought that was like the twist

332
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because ninja why not a female ninja

333
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Thank you strago

334
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So why not a female ninja

335
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I don't know what it was in the script if there was like a

336
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Pronoun I misread or something I don't know but I thought

337
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like for years

338
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That Shadow was Realms mom

339
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Until somebody was like

340
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No no no like it's actually

341
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Maybe her dad but it's not really said

342
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I would have

343
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm now going to head canon that it's her mom

344
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Because we don't really know

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If Shadow is actually a dude

346
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ultros was her mom

347
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Alright what are you

348
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You played through this game right

349
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah I rented it from Blockbuster

350
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I did I think

351
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm pretty sure I did I know I didn't own it

352
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I had it long enough to play through it and beat it

353
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I did

354
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And it was great

355
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think I rented it multiple times

356
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And just

357
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Everything about it was fantastic and I must have

358
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Played it like

359
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Over the course of a weekend or something to finish it but

360
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In a weekend

361
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I remember that game took like 60 hours

362
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To beat or something I don't know

363
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But it was yeah I was

364
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I just remember the end on it

365
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I don't know

366
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How long it took me to do it but

367
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was fun

368
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So if y'all have an SNES classic

369
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean that's probably the easiest way to play this game now

370
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well let's talk a little bit about you know

371
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because to tie this into some more recent news

372
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And things we've been talking about on the show more recently

373
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You know we seem to think

374
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That we might be standing on

375
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Looking at the future of gaming

376
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where things are going to go more streaming

377
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And so forth

378
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's not like you know Super Nintendos are gonna suddenly

379
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wilt up and die and those things

380
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Especially can take a beating right

381
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well I mean that's just what

382
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They're pushing for console

383
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Gaming and stuff but it doesn't mean that anybody's actually

384
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It doesn't mean it's gonna take off

385
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You know like they may say that

386
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We wanna go this route but if no one buys

387
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The system or no one pays into it

388
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They're not gonna continue with it

389
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So I'm not really worried

390
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That it's going streaming because

391
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's still PC

392
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There's still retro

393
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You know if you don't like what

394
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The new game's coming out on your streaming

395
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Platform or if it's just

396
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Not gonna work because you don't have the bandwidth

397
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or the bandwidth caps

398
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For it then

399
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sure you'll find ways around it

400
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When we're looking at 25

401
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Years from now do you think

402
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The only way people are going to be able to experience

403
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Final Fantasy 6 is

404
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
By finding

405
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Grandma at that point or Grandpa's old

406
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Super Nintendo and playing

407
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The actual cartridge or do you think

408
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No emulators come on

409
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So emulators

410
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All of a sudden they're gonna find a way

411
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
To wipe those off the internet this time

412
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I guess that's true I don't

413
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe because I think of the full experience

414
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
As plopping down in front of the TV

415
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
With a controller but you're right

416
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why can't you do an emulator on the TV thanks

417
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
To the

418
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Little computers in a box and the USB

419
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Stick which name escapes me at the moment

420
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Raspberry Pi

421
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And all those things

422
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I'm sure that technology's gonna just get even more

423
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah they're gonna get more powerful

424
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And it's just gonna be

425
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You'll be able to play all those old games

426
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That you want

427
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Just because there's new games coming out

428
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Doesn't mean we have to only play those new games

429
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Otherwise we wouldn't be remastering

430
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Borderlands 1

431
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Or doing all this stuff

432
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think it's just

433
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Good games are gonna be good games no matter what

434
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And that's why everyone's saying

435
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well it's all gonna go the streamy route

436
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But indies

437
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can't necessarily afford to maybe

438
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Be on those streaming platforms so they're gonna do

439
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Things differently

440
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Unless there was a do it yourself solution

441
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Like YouTube

442
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There will be ways

443
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
To put yourself on different

444
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Platforms but it doesn't mean that's the only

445
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Way to do it and they're gonna

446
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Fill the void of so it's not gonna be

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That this is gonna be the only

448
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Way you do it it's only gonna be streaming

449
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're not really gonna purchase anything you're only gonna have

450
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Licensing to it or something maybe the

451
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Wrong thing to say is the only way but

452
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Especially again you know not to repeat this conversation

453
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Too much when we go look at the film industry

454
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think and we see like a lot of it is

455
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Netflix and these sorts of things now maybe

456
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The primary consumption method is

457
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Streaming and physical

458
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Blu-rays and DVDs are more

459
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Collectible keepsake they're more

460
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Collectibles they're more the secondary way to

461
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Do things right I guess you could

462
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do it that way but if it's gonna be like

463
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You know the film industry that we're gonna

464
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Have Square Enix's streaming service

465
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We're gonna have Nintendo

466
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Streaming service Microsoft streaming service

467
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sony EA Activision

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
All of them wanting their own I think

469
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think especially on the TV I think things are gonna

470
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Break with that eventually I think you're gonna

471
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
See mergers and things you know

472
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh you're gonna see piracy is what you're gonna see

473
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because people are gonna get tired of it

474
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Lots of great comments in our chat

475
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network

476
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And Bobby Blackwolf saying

477
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Google wants to dumb down

478
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Your computer enough to make it a dumb terminal

479
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where the actual computing power is in a server

480
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Farm so the new computers of the future

481
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Wouldn't have the horse power to run an emulator

482
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well a super

483
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Nintendo emulator in this day and age can run on your

484
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Phone you know what I mean but I get what

485
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're saying they're kind of tongue in cheek when it comes to Stadia

486
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And things no I get what they're trying to do too

487
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They're lowering the cost of computing

488
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For like people to get

489
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Into that so like say I don't want

490
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
To drop several thousand dollars on whatever

491
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I can buy a Chromebook or well

492
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And also something we we really

493
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Always need to be aware of is that we're

494
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In the United States we're in California

495
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Computers and being able to go pick one up

496
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is kind of a part of our culture but you go

497
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To many other countries throughout the

498
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
World and computers are

499
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Not something that's just

500
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Assumed everybody has in fact

501
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a rarity you don't see computers but I'm

502
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Never gonna buy a Chromebook for

503
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like playing games that's never

504
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Gonna be a thought that ever goes through

505
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My mind because if I'm gonna build a

506
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
PC to play games on whether it be

507
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Buying a laptop or something it's gonna have

508
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The horse power to play games I'm not gonna

509
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well I'll just buy a Chromebook

510
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because it essentially does nothing without

511
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know Google you know

512
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So I just

513
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I would never do that but

514
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There's other people that Chromebooks are

515
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
A good option like for example I have a

516
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Co-worker that is retiring and she

517
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Wants a computer that can she can check email

518
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And do Facebook and I'm like

519
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Chromebook is your way to go because

520
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's all that shit does

521
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That was that was my mom when she was still

522
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
With us is that she just

523
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wanted to do email and she wanted to

524
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Be able to look at her kids on Facebook

525
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's all she yeah and so for that I mean

526
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And she's like well maybe I should get a Mac

527
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Even email I feel like is

528
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Starting to fade away it doesn't seem

529
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like email is going away in favor of things like

530
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I hate to say it Facebook Messenger but Facebook

531
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Messenger is huge but I also see

532
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Other I feel like things like Telegram

533
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And some of those are starting to gain a lot of speed too

534
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well I don't think

535
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Email is not going anywhere but

536
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think that

537
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You know for there's a market

538
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Physical mail is not going anywhere either

539
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But like the only thing that I welcome

540
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Getting in the physical mail anymore is

541
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Packages like stuff I bought on the internet

542
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's it it's true yeah

543
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But I don't know

544
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I just think that it's not going to be

545
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They want you to

546
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Be convinced that this is going to be the next

547
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Big thing because they want the investors

548
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
To be excited about it and they want

549
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
People to be excited about so they jump into

550
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It but let's just see what it actually

551
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is by the time it actually comes

552
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Out and how wonderful it is because

553
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If you may remember not that long ago

554
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
When they were talking about the PlayStation

555
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
3 or I think it was the PlayStation 3

556
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That it was going to be you know

557
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
1080p

558
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Full native 1080p 120

559
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Frames per second it's just going to be this

560
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Monster of a system that was going to be super

561
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It just it fucking wasn't so it's like

562
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The same thing with

563
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They overhype everything

564
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then it comes out and then they have to lower their

565
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Lower your expectations to what it actually

566
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Can do so let's just wait and see what

567
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It can actually do before we

568
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know start predicting where the industry

569
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is going because who gives a shit where the industry

570
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Is going we're just going to go with it

571
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Dialing back to Final Fantasy 6 a little bit

572
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Since that was what this is originally about

573
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I would love to see this game remade

574
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well it has been Loki

575
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well I meant remade like

576
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I meant remade in sense like Final Fantasy 7

577
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Is being remade type of thing

578
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh you want to see it but I don't know if it would

579
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know if you can ever like

580
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Lightning strike twice with

581
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The Final Fantasy 6 like you know obviously

582
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The recent mobile

583
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Support they did was not good

584
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Or I would even take

585
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A new Final Fantasy game

586
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Done in the style of Final Fantasy 6

587
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We don't need 3D polygons

588
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
In like real time battles and shit like that

589
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Just you know drop

590
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Down because that doesn't cost

591
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
As much to develop

592
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Didn't they kind of do that with the Final Fantasy 15

593
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Damn it I can't remember the name of it

594
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But it was basically like it was like a

595
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Earlier throwback

596
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well they also did the after years for Final Fantasy 4

597
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So that was like that

598
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And if you got that on the WiiWare it was like

599
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It was like you were playing Final Fantasy 2

600
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Slash 4 like graphics

601
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There was some good comments so I want to make sure

602
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I got a couple other of these because

603
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
ActDeft in our chatroom said that eventually

604
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I lost the original comment but he had made the point

605
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That oh yeah games eventually will fall

606
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
In the public domain too

607
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So after so many years

608
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're not really pirating the game anymore

609
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because it's in the public domain

610
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But it doesn't get really complicated though

611
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Unfortunately the game was made in Japan

612
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But I guess since it was put out in the US

613
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
As Final Fantasy 3 I guess there's

614
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A certain term

615
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But you can thank Disney for continuing to

616
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Push that term back

617
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Because Mickey Mouse

618
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Mickey Mouse should have been public domain by now

619
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But he's not

620
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So kind of interesting how that all works

621
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Well it's because he's also their trademark

622
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So you got trademark issues too

623
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But Bobby Blackwolf

624
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Pointing out the new Dragon Quest

625
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Does that if you'd played that on 3DS

626
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It had the top screen and bottom screen

627
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I think with the whole

628
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Switch port they're doing something with that too

629
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Obviously it's not top screen and bottom screen but like a button

630
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
To switch between the two

631
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So some people do dig their retro modes

632
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Dragon Quest is a pretty good game as well

633
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So

634
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah Questbuster says

635
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I wanted that 16 bit Final Fantasy

636
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
13 that Square Enix made

637
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
A trailer of to explain the story

638
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
TigerClawnChat says

639
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Some games will get in the public domain

640
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But some of the more bigger ones they will continue to make games

641
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
For those as long as they are around

642
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know I'm almost starting to feel like about

643
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Video game remakes though kind of finishing up

644
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That thought as I am some of the movie remakes

645
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like some of them can be really good

646
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But a lot of them

647
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Are not good and something like okay like the

648
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Borderlands remaster where they just basically

649
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Went in and put out

650
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
4k textures and didn't really change the game

651
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I would consider that more like a

652
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Criterion collection

653
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Release of an old movie

654
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
They're not trying to redo the movie

655
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's not a remake it's a remaster

656
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Exactly

657
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They did change a few things

658
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
A lot of video game remakes are kind of

659
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Not Resident Evil 2 though

660
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That was freaking amazing

661
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
There's a few diamonds in the rough and I liked

662
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Blaster Master Zero even though other people

663
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Had their problem with it and I would say not

664
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Every movie remake was bad

665
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Although most of them are I'm trying to think of a good

666
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Movie remake

667
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The new stars born was incredible

668
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you know

669
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not Barbara

670
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or Judy Garland

671
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I kind of thought it was better

672
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There were as many motorcycle accidents in it as there

673
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Was in the previous version

674
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There's no way I'm going to answer that question

675
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I actually think that the Total Recall remake

676
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Which is actually I think off the original

677
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Story

678
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Honestly it's arguably a better

679
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Movie than the Arnold one

680
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Even if it doesn't have the cult following

681
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The original one did

682
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Not Spielberg

683
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Miniseries, Stephen King

684
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Miniseries, some people swear that the

685
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Miniseries they did on The Shining is actually better than

686
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The movie because it was more faithful to the book

687
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Stephen King actually signed off on

688
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The Shining

689
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well Stephen King also signed off on the end of

690
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The Mist and that was a poor decision

691
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's true too

692
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But then they made The Mist a TV show

693
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Isn't The Mist a TV show now I think

694
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I thought I heard something about

695
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Not that I watch TV anyway

696
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I know I so rarely do anymore these days

697
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And then what else

698
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Every Animal Crossing new game has been good

699
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The It, some people

700
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The It

701
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's just It

702
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Versus the miniseries

703
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not Tim Curry

704
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't mean to

705
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Go down this rabbit hole

706
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't mean to go down this rabbit hole of remakes

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Someday when computer technology

708
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Is good enough

709
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
To resurrect

710
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You know

711
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Movie actor Tim Curry

712
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He's not dead

713
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I understand he's not dead but

714
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
To the point where mobility is limited

715
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Mobility is you know

716
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He's not what he used to be unfortunately

717
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But he's a national treasure

718
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
International treasure

719
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I want the new Dune to be good

720
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because I saw the

721
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Four hour original

722
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Because I knew someone who

723
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Remember we talked about Betamaxes earlier

724
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Someone had it taped on Betamax

725
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Funny enough Questbuster and chat

726
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Is talking exactly about the Dune thing right now

727
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Sci-fi did their own Dune series

728
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And it was actually pretty good

729
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The series is good but it lacks the epic music of Tangerine Dream

730
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That was in the movie

731
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's how some people feel about Legend

732
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
To tie it back to Tim Curry

733

Order of Magic was also done by Jon Pappadou

884
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, we tried to get everything set up

885
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Dan couldn't find the crap we needed

886
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but then we decided

887
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we might be playing something on the Saturn instead

888
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
because we want to go through

889
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
all of our Konami collections

890
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and just sit and bore the shit out of people with Parodius

891
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and Salamander

892
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and maybe some weird RPGs

893
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that we have to have a translation FAQ for

894
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that we're going to speak our own dialogue for

895
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
like View 10 a game

896
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Hi, in another universe I turn into a car

897
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if everyone has seen the Utena movie

898
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that must be the awesome universe

899
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Utena turns into

900
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
spoiler, she turns into a pink Batmobile

901
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and she and Anthe drive off through the city

902
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it's weird

903
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and then they're naked on the chassis

904
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
of the pink Batmobile

905
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
as they drive off into their lesbian sunset

906
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that is literally the ending of the Utena movie

907
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
okay

908
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
right?

909
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
okay

910
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
right?

911
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ah, jeez

912
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
but anyway, we've been kind of on this

913
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
old Konami shooter kick

914
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
so that's kind of what we're going to do

915
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
we watched through different playthroughs of Parodius

916
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and the collection that we

917
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
no, it's not the collection we have

918
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the PSP version

919
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is the one where they replaced

920
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
um

921
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
crap, what song was it?

922
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it was like a pop song that was in the

923
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
pattern version and they switched it out

924
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for a remix of

925
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Brilliant to You

926
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
because we were trying to figure out which one had Brilliant to You in it

927
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and it was

928
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I think Ocean Berry Parodius

929
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
for the PSP

930
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
so

931
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
anyway

932
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Bright Man says a pink lesbian Batmobile

933
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that's not something I thought I would hear about

934
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
have you heard this show?

935
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
well, we've done it all

936
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
now we have pink Batmobile lesbians

937
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
show Michelle

938
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
or Tamar

939
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
anyway

940
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
so that's really been about the

941
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
extent of us making plans

942
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and just getting shit together

943
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Dan kept thinking we wanted to play

944
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
on the CRT, I'm like why would we play

945
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Saturn on CRT when it's

946
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you know

947
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
HDMI

948
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
whatevs!

949
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

950
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
um, I played not a lot

951
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
of stuff this week but I did start off the

952
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
week by trying to transcribe more

953
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
edits I was missing off of my DDR machine

954
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and I got through 18 of them

955
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
before I decided to try to transfer

956
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
them to my system and

957
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
you see the problem is I'm using a brand new

958
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
editing tool

959
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I used to use one called DDR Edit Max

960
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and it's old, it only ran

961
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
on XP and out of

962
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Visual Basic 6

963
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
runtime

964
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
which doesn't work in

965
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Windows 10, so I found

966
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
thanks to the Wayback Machine

967
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
DDR Edit Max 2

968
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that actually does work

969
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but

970
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
there's a problem is that something's

971
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
wrong with the edit

972
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
files themselves and

973
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the machine does not recognize them

974
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
or doesn't recognize most of them

975
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
it recognized one of them

976
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and I don't know why one works

977
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and the rest don't

978
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
so I've been

979
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
digging through them through

980
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
hex editors going back to my

981
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
edit FAQ that thank god I made

982
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
a long ass time ago because

983
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
it's actually helped me trying to read this shit

984
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
which I found out a bunch of new stuff

985
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
with it as well and I've been

986
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
updating it as I go but I

987
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
still haven't gotten any of it to work correctly

988
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
because something is fucked up

989
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
in the header and I'm not sure what

990
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I need to figure out how to fix it

991
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
because there's some really awesome edits

992
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I want to play so that was

993
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
about most of my week

994
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and then I decided

995
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to check

996
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to see how much well because I

997
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
saw the Labo

998
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
VR kits coming out this

999
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
following week so I was like okay well

1000
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it seems so soon like

1001
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
yeah let's see how much the other

1002
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Labo kits are because I know they're coming down in prices

1003
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and stuff so I found the robot kit for

1004
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
$29.99

1005
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
it actually ended up getting I think for $25

1006
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
after I think I had a

1007
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
coupon or something on there but

1008
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
$25 for the robot kit I was like

1009
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
can't beat it for that price that's kind of worth it

1010
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
so I went ahead and picked that up

1011
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
so I've been building that I started that today

1012
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and then I pre-ordered

1013
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the VR kit that will be coming next week

1014
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because my kids like

1015
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
playing with the VR stuff and I hate

1016
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
having to set up the Playstation VR for them

1017
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
all the time so I was like well I'll just

1018
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
build this and they can shove their

1019
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
head in the butt of a bird

1020
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
so

1021
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
so we'll be doing that

1022
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and then

1023
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
what else I played a little bit of Ingress

1024
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
today just because I was

1025
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
because I was

1026
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
trying to report a

1027
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
pokestop for being in the wrong

1028
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
spot and

1029
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you can't do that in Pokemon Go and

1030
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
apparently I can't do it in Ingress either but

1031
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you have to download Scanner Redacted and you can still do it

1032
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
there which is the 1.0

1033
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
because they had it was

1034
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the arcade creek trail and they had the

1035
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
lizard marked there which there is a lizard

1036
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it's a big cement lizard but it was

1037
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
several like tens of feet

1038
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
away from where it actually is

1039
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's in a completely wrong spot so

1040
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I was going to report it

1041
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
but I did

1042
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Download the Scanner Redacted app and since you made

1043
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
your account before Prime

1044
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you can still now if you're a brand new agent

1045
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
you can't use Scanner Redacted because

1046
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
they're trying to prevent people making new accounts

1047
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to spoof and things but since you had an existing account

1048
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you can do it yeah so

1049
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I may get around to that or I just may not

1050
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
give a shit but

1051
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
it was in the right spot at one

1052
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
time so it's like it got moved I don't know

1053
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
how that's shenanigans

1054
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
it's awfully

1055
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
conveniently close to a

1056
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
mobile home park where maybe someone's

1057
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
living in and

1058
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
you know couch portaling

1059
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
send me info on that portal we'll get it fixed

1060
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but anyway so yeah I did that and

1061
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I played Pokemon Go a little bit because

1062
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
yeah so I'm going

1063
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
to be I wanted to and like

1064
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I must have been half asleep last night when

1065
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I decided to order I ordered another

1066
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
docking station for my

1067
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
switch because I was like I want to take it apart

1068
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and I'm going to use this to build

1069
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and then of course my dumb brain today

1070
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
is like you idiot you can't

1071
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
you can't hack that apart to make it

1072
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
allow you to stream

1073
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
from handheld mode because the damn thing's gonna

1074
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
think it's docked and it's not going to work so

1075
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
that's kind of the frustration

1076
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
because I wanted to like actually

1077
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
do some streaming from the

1078
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
VR thing to show like what it looks like

1079
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but you can't because

1080
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
fucking switch

1081
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
can't stream in handheld mode

1082
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so

1083
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
what are you going to do?

1084
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So yeah

1085
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I guess I'll just have to find something else to do instead

1086
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and play some Borderlands

1087
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
alright yeah that's it

1088
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
My gaming week so I actually

1089
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
officiated my first wedding

1090
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
yesterday so

1091
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I do weddings now if you're curious

1092
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
at least in California

1093
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm sure it's probably not that hard to do in other states

1094
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
but so that

1095
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
took up a lot of my time this weekend however

1096
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I have been playing some other games

1097
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
including Beat Saber I

1098
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
played a little bit this week because I had not

1099
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
gotten around yet to the official volume

1100
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
one DLC pack and they

1101
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
put out that what's that

1102
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
crab song whatever that April Fools

1103
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
thing was like a year ago it was like this crab song

1104
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
that they put in Beat Saber

1105
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
that you can play

1106
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I also like the coloring in it because they use

1107
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
blue and green as the colors instead of the blue and red

1108
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
that most songs do

1109
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
so yeah that was fun I liked

1110
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
playing that so I played a little bit of that

1111
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and then I played some of the DLC songs because I downloaded that

1112
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
because I have Beat Saber on PlayStation 4

1113
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
so I was playing some of those songs and

1114
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
you know just enjoying

1115
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
expanding the original library of songs

1116
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
not that the songs are bad but now

1117
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
they're starting to sort them out a little bit too so like

1118
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
instead of just having a big song list

1119
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I have like official volume one

1120
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
soundtrack add on

1121
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
songs or whatever it's called and then like

1122
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
DLC one and so on and so on

1123
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
so yeah I've been playing that

1124
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and then I've been playing Final Fantasy 14

1125
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
just a little bit kind of got sucked back into that

1126
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
after the Stormblood story patch and for no

1127
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
good reason I pushed my

1128
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
White Mage all the way to level 70 so that's my

1129
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
fourth job at max level behind

1130
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Astrologian Bard and Red Mage

1131
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
so now I have Astrologian Bard, Red Mage, White Mage all

1132
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
at 70 no tank at 70 yet

1133
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and I don't know if I'll bother taking a tank that high

1134
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
because I'm not that big a fan of tanking

1135
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but I guess if anything I like Dark Knight

1136
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
of the tanks but we'll see

1137
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
so did you want to say something on?

1138
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I actually just remembered the other

1139
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
thing I was going to do for gaming is I'm going to go back to

1140
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Star Trek Online. Oh yeah

1141
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm going to cancel the wow and everything and go back to Star Trek Online

1142
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'd be curious how that game kind of

1143
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
sizes up now compared to when it was first out

1144
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They've been incorporating more characters and

1145
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
have from the TV series and

1146
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
have the actors back

1147
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
as voice actors. Oh that's cool.

1148
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So I didn't mean to derail your segment

1149
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
but I thought that since you're talking about MMOs

1150
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that might be curious too. That's not the first time.

1151
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And I do it to you too. Alright.

1152
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says oh speaking of Diablo 3

1153
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Rob I sent you something on Switch. I apologize

1154
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I haven't checked Diablo 3 on Switch in a long time

1155
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
but I should probably get on that. It would be nice

1156
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
to roll a season 16 character

1157
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
but one more game that I played this week

1158
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that I think is kind of a big deal IDK

1159
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I played Borderlands which you know

1160
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
is not a game I've played. I've played it before

1161
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
but I haven't played a lot of it

1162
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but I downloaded the remaster

1163
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because I had it on Steam

1164
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
anyway, the original, and if you had

1165
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the original game of the year edition

1166
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
which I'm sure a lot of people bought for like 5 or 10 bucks

1167
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah I just saw what was it

1168
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the pre-sequel and stuff was discounted

1169
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm like oh I should buy the pre-sequel

1170
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and I looked at my library and I'm like oh I already have it

1171
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So I looked at my library

1172
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and now there's Borderlands GOTY

1173
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and then there was sure enough Borderlands GOTY

1174
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Enhanced and I was like cool

1175
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I downloaded the Enhanced one and

1176
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
originally it wanted to set my configuration

1177
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
for 1080p and I was like

1178
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
no I know my video card can do better than that

1179
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
it was doing ultra

1180
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
settings at 1080p so I kicked it down to

1181
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
high settings on 2K

1182
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
obviously my video card's not quite

1183
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
good enough to do full 4K but it's 2K

1184
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and that works. The game runs very smoothly

1185
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and it looks really good

1186
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
on PC. The art

1187
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
style of the, you know how Borderlands has the very

1188
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
strong outlines in a lot of

1189
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the art that it does. It really pops

1190
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you know in that high resolution

1191
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It is funny though because you definitely

1192
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
notice the parts of the game

1193
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that aren't in 2K or 4K

1194
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
namely anything pre-rendered

1195
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
so like the little introduction videos

1196
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
so I've played through the intro of the game

1197
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and I did the first boss or whatever

1198
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Nine, what is it? Nine Tails?

1199
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
No Nine Toes

1200
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So I've killed Nine Toes and when it did

1201
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the whole like introduction

1202
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it suddenly switches to a video and you can

1203
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
tell like there's like it looks

1204
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
kind of a little more grainy and not

1205
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
quite the same and I was like oh okay

1206
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
but you know obviously that's a very minor

1207
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
complaint it's not even really a complaint

1208
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
because the game is how old but it's

1209
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
fun to explore it again and I feel

1210
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
like in some ways I've gotten a little

1211
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
better at shooters on the PC

1212
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and I think because I remember I used

1213
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to be very much like I only wanted to do

1214
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
shooters with a controller because of

1215
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
stuff like Halo that I you know

1216
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
had grown up on or whatever but thanks

1217
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
to things like Overwatch and other

1218
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
shooters I've been playing on PC like I feel

1219
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
very comfortable playing Borderlands on

1220
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
PC with keyboard and mouse

1221
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
so I remember how it was the opposite in Final Fantasy

1222
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
11 where I played everything on a controller

1223
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
including my macros as a healer

1224
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Well you know in Final Fantasy 14

1225
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
some people play controller on

1226
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
computer and it's totally

1227
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
like but that game was kind of built for

1228
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
a controller not so much 11 a little bit

1229
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
well no a little bit because it was on

1230
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the Playstation 2 in Japan and not everybody

1231
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
had that you know yeah and

1232
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
honestly for the longest time I was

1233
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
strict to controller

1234
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I mean Rob came

1235
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and saw me play using my little shoulder buttons

1236
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
for my macros and yeah it works but

1237
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't know it's kind of funny

1238
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
how people kind of turn around on what they play on

1239
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It does yeah yeah um let's see

1240
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I think

1241
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Borderlands still has an aim assist on

1242
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PC which helped me that is

1243
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
true the aim assist is still there obviously

1244
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm using it no shame in that I

1245
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the nine toes guy killed me once

1246
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
because he has two little ads

1247
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
or whatever and so I had to do him

1248
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
do that fight does he have nine toes

1249
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
apparently he has nine toes and three balls

1250
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
that's what the intro says there's a lot of

1251
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
there's a lot of straight

1252
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
bro humor in the game

1253
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
in Borderlands that I just

1254
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
kind of go whatever

1255
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I find it more questionable if he had

1256
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a camel toe so

1257
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
anyway but whatever I think the

1258
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
game is it's fun to play I like

1259
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
the questing system feels like an MMO

1260
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
really so it's kind of yeah it's fun

1261
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
so I'll probably play some more of it I want to play

1262
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
some more of it and see you know where the story goes

1263
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and I because I've never

1264
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
really touched the second game and you know

1265
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
if I really enjoy it maybe I'll even buy the

1266
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
third game when it comes out so

1267
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm definitely buying the third game but I want to let

1268
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
y'all know I finally am getting around and I played

1269
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
a little bit of Borderlands before but it was just like I'm terrible

1270
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
at shooters this is bad but I don't know

1271
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm approaching this with some

1272
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
more years of gaming of different types

1273
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
under my belt and I'm kind of like into it right now

1274
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and it looks very nice with the enhanced version

1275
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
so um kudos

1276
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
so far so

1277
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Bobby Blackwell says will you buy the third

1278
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
game in September or in April

1279
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
um I'm not going to buy the third game unless

1280
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I actually make it through the first two

1281
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
isn't that fair? Three

1282
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
well I,

1283
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
do you have to play pre-sequel? Pre-sequel's

1284
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
well then I guess I have three to play so

1286
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't know I haven't played

1287
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
pre-sequel yet

1288
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
well let's I guess we need to get into the

1289
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
news a little bit and talk about why Bobby

1290
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
is asking that question uh real quick

1291
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000

Google Plus is officially dead rest

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
in peace uh alright let's

1298
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
get to the news starting off with

1299
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the big decision when to buy Borderlands

1300
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
right? Yeah so Borderlands

1301
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
uh they did a second because you may remember

1302
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the original announcement that they did at PAX East

1303
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
they had more details coming

1304
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you know next week

1305
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and so the more details that were coming

1306
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
it's going to be

1307
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
an exclusive

1308
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
game to the Epic Games Store for six months

1309
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
it's going to be launching September 13th

1310
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and then you'll be able to buy it elsewhere

1311
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
April 2020

1312
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and it's also going to be out on

1313
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

1314
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and of course

1315
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
a lot of people aren't very happy about this

1316
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
mainly because the Epic Store

1317
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is very bare bones

1318
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and is missing a lot of the things

1319
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that you would expect

1320
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
from a storefront including you know being able

1321
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to um

1322
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
put stuff in a shopping cart

1323
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and you know I don't even know

1324
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
do they have friends list? I mean they have friends list

1325
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
but they don't have a lot of most of

1326
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the bare modes things I would say

1327
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it is bare bones but also I would

1328
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
say it's it's progressed since

1329
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
it first came out they're still updating it

1330
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and who knows where we're going to be in September

1331
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
September's still a ways out

1332
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so of course since quickly though

1333
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I can understand the frustration though where it's like

1334
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I have Borderlands 1 and 2 on

1335
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Steam and now I'm going to have to go

1336
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to this store to get Borderlands 3

1337
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and it's you know going to be a little bit different

1338
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
of course tell that to all the Bayonetta

1339
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
fans right?

1340
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I have to buy a Wii U or a

1341
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Switch if I want to play Bayonetta 2

1342
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
even if I play the first Bayonetta

1343
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Xbox 360 or wherever

1344
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the multitude of places where the first Bayonetta came out

1345
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
it's on PC now

1346
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
not not Bayonetta 2

1347
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the first Bayonetta is but not Bayonetta 2

1348
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
gotta get a Switch

1349
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
because the Epic Games Store is still so bare bones

1350
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
that there is no way to leave reviews

1351
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
on any game there

1352
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
people have turned to Steam to go

1353
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
express their frustrations by review

1354
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
bombing of course the other Borderlands

1355
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
games and you know Steam is very

1356
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
fond of that happening so

1357
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
yeah

1358
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Steam is really not getting a lot of good news

1359
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
with this because not only do they not get the game

1360
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
but then now all the users are going to

1361
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
shit on the store for Borderlands

1362
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
1 and 2 right

1363
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
so that sucks but I know that

1364
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
they had talked about ways to

1365
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
prevent review bombing so we'll see

1366
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
how that ends up working out but

1367
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I mean I don't know like

1368
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
yeah it's annoying

1369
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
that the only thing Epic's doing

1370
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
right now seems like to try to drive

1371
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
people to their platform well a couple things

1372
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I guess they're lowering the price

1373
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
which is why or the cut that they

1374
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
take which is why these big game companies are

1375
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
kind of going their way because I'm sure they're

1376
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
getting money thrown at them

1377
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
plus they're also getting more

1378
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
of more profit off of everything

1379
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
so of course they want to make as much

1380
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
money as possible

1381
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think originally the plan was more

1382
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
to try to drive you know indies to their

1383
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
platform but

1384
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
whatever it is what it is

1385
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the free games they give away

1386
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
is nothing to buy

1387
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
no that's nice and it's

1388
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to me it's kind of like you play

1389
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and stuff like that or like even

1390
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
EA services

1391
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Origin you just have to have

1392
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
it for certain games whether you like

1393
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
it or not and I think this is kind of like this

1394
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
if I want to play this game on PC at launch

1395
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I just have to

1396
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I already have Epic installed so it's not a big deal

1397
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
to be honest I have Origin

1398
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you know love it or hate it

1399
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
which it's come a long way but I

1400
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
have Origin installed because that was the only

1401
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
way I was going to be able to play Mass Effect Andromeda

1402
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
on PC

1403
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
as well as got a sweet deal

1404
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
on Titanfall 2

1405
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
you know there's just there's certain things that

1406
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
you can only get on Origin that have to do with

1407
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
EA BioWare and that type of thing

1408
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Can't you put like external games into it?

1409
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You have to have Origin for Apex

1410
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Can't you put external games into your Steam library

1411
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
anyways because I thought they have ways to launch them

1412
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
so I mean I'm sure that if this

1413
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
isn't like any other game out there

1414
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
you can have an executable that's straight

1415
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
you don't have to launch it through the Epic

1416
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
storefront I'm pretty sure

1417
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
that you can just have an executable shortcut or something

1418
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The way that it works for

1419
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Origin is that it will

1420
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
open when you have the link to

1421
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
the game it will open

1422
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Origin and then open the game

1423
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
but run it through Steam so that you can do your

1424
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
screenshots and everything through the Steam platform

1425
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh wow. Because that's how

1426
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
basically how I got all of my stuff

1427
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
for my little effect which I've kind of let

1428
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
fall to the wayside

1429
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well the game's been out a long time now you've probably screen capped almost everything you can

1430
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I've had drama that's kept

1431
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
me from posting and being sick and

1432
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
family members dying and stuff

1433
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
speaking of Mass Effect not to like

1434
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
completely 180 this conversation but I noticed

1435
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Alan was like he was

1436
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
reinstalling Mass Effect the other night and I'm like what's going on

1437
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
he's like there's some new mod that came out that I want to check

1438
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
out so I think they have like another new

1439
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
graphics mod or something and so

1440
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
now I see him because you know remember

1441
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Alan will get obsessed with one

1442
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
game at a time. One game at a

1443
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
time and um

1444
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's nice to be able to have that kind of restraint

1445
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't have that kind of restraint

1446
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I know he's the complete polar opposite

1447
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
so like Dark Souls has been his thing for a long time

1448
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Overwatch he still kind of plays off and on

1449
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
this is the one that surprised me do you know what game

1450
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
has been like his late like it's all he's been playing

1451
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
lately? Dead Island

1452
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
of like all the games in the universe

1453
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The first one? Yeah

1454
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I think it's a combination of the

1455
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
series but mostly the first one

1456
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
like that's what he's kind of been

1457
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
into lately so yeah

1458
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I mean not to knock that game I know some of y'all are big

1459
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
fans. By the way what ever happened

1460
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to Dead Island 2? Wasn't that like supposed to be out by now?

1461
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Uh I think Dead Island

1462
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
2 already came out. No I don't think it ever did

1463
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
there was like a Dead Island like

1464
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
expansion for the

1465
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
first game or something it was just built on the

1466
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
first game. It still says it's upcoming on

1467
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
wiki. Yeah they showed a trailer for Dead Island

1468
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
2 like in 2014. Yeah I was like

1469
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I was like the last time I went to E3

1470
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh yeah. I saw that Dead Island 2 too.

1471
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That was a long time ago right?

1472
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Well there's a rumor on

1473
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
this E3

1474
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
like thing about with some pre-alpha footage

1475
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
on it saying that

1476
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
it's supposed to

1477
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
the release date is going to be announced at E3

1478
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Well then they

1479
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
have like a what was the other dead game

1480
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
there was another dead bot not Dead by Dawn

1481
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but like there was a

1482
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
oh like not a dead island but like a dead

1483
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
free running game I can't remember the hell it's called

1484
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
but they had like a couple sequels of that

1485
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I thought that was maybe

1486
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't know maybe

1487
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
stop making zombie games because

1488
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I can't tell them apart okay?

1489
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Maybe you should stop doing that. I did not mean to

1490
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
180 the conversation but we got on a tangent train

1491
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
as we sometimes do. Let's have the

1492
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
the chat brings back. Act F says

1493
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Dead Island Riptide no that was kind of that was

1494
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
still it was like the first game

1495
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
like after bit because you

1496
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
just started at level 40 or you could import

1497
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
characters to the first game it wasn't a true sequel

1498
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Dead Island Riptide was not the true sequel but

1499
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
good point

1500
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The Break Man says is Dead Island any good

1501
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and Quest Buster says

1502
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it's good now it was pretty broken on release

1503
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and that's pretty much everything I've heard too and knowing Alan

1504
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
he's probably modded the fuck out of the game

1505
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'll bet you anything what got him on it there's probably

1506
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
some graphic mod for the game

1507
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
that got him into it

1508
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Maybe he should join up with Minecraft

1509
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Knowing Alan as well as I do

1510
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So YYR

1511
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
is kind of fed up a little bit here

1512
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
saying I'm just fed up with apps

1513
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and launchers I basically refuse to

1514
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
play anything that would require me to download

1515
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
an app or get another launcher

1516
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I have enough accounts I don't want anymore

1517
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
since I play mostly niche stuff

1518
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I haven't really been affected by any of this yet

1519
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
but if someone releases their game on the epic store

1520
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
good for them but I'll never play it

1521
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Um

1522
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Isn't it I might be wrong I don't to be

1523
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
honest I've never bought anything on the epic

1524
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
store I have a nice collection of the free

1525
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
stuff and fortnite that's about it

1526
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
so I mean at least I bought things

1527
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I haven't bought anything yet on the epic

1528
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
store personally but

1529
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
do you

1530
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
because we were just kind of talking about the

1531
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
launcher loading in the background

1532
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
if I get a game like

1533
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
say super meat boy that I got for free

1534
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or whatever on the epic game store

1535
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
if I just run that executable

1536
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
doesn't it not go through the store

1537
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
like maybe you don't have to use launcher I don't know

1538
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I can't remember I have it just I had it already

1539
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
on there when I was trying out

1540
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
development in unreal engine so

1541
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I already have it on there

1542
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
for that um

1543
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and but I right now it's mainly

1544
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
now it's just to grab the free

1545
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
game of every couple weeks or whatever

1546
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
that they put out and Bobby's correcting

1547
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
me it does still launch the epic game store in the

1548
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
background alright fair enough it's probably

1549
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
must check to make

1550
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
sure you bought it or something I don't know yeah

1551
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
so I mean whatever I've

1552
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I haven't really purchased anything from

1553
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
the epic game store I have looked at the new

1554
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
game that they have from coffee scene studios

1555
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I may pick up that one

1556
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
um but

1557
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
so far I haven't purchased anything

1558
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
from there alright

1559
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
well let's move on and talk about

1560
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
um what's going on

1561
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
with the switch online retro

1562
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
service so um

1563
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
switch online uh has

1564
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
been adding more NES games every

1565
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
month and um

1566
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
uh some of the latest

1567
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
games will be coming to the switch um in

1568
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
April of 2019 on

1569
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
the 10th so what next week I think yeah

1570
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
about three days uh they've announced

1571
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
the next series of games that's going to come out which includes

1572
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
punch out

1573
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
not the Mike Tyson punch out cause obviously

1574
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the licensing stuff is gone although

1575
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm sure y'all heard about that tweet where Mike Tyson

1576
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
was like why am I not in punch

1577
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
out on this like I seriously don't

1578
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't think Mike Tyson knows

1579
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
that he was taken out

1580
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
of punch out a long time ago I don't

1581
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
think he knows about Mr. Dream shh don't tell him

1582
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
don't tell him I don't know

1583
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
anyway he might bite Mr. Dream's ear off

1584
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
uh also coming out Star

1585
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Soldier kind of a fun little shooter

1586
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and then Super Mario Brothers

1587
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The Lost Levels at least

1588
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
that's what they're calling it here in the

1589
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
US and so they actually are

1590
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
giving it the little box you know that they kind

1591
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
of created for Super Mario All-Stars

1592
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
little square box but what's funny is

1593
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
that when they showed the preview movie

1594
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
they didn't bother to correct the title screen

1595
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
or anything so when you launch it it's still just

1596
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Super Mario Brothers 2

1597
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
obviously the Japanese version of these releases

1598
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
same thing punch out Star Soldier

1599
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Super Mario Brothers 2 for them

1600
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
but you know like if you launch

1601
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
our Super Mario Brothers 2 in their

1602
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Famicom online it says Super Mario Brothers

1603
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
USA they changed the title screen

1604
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
they didn't they didn't do that here

1605
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
so

1606
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
because they actually did get it released to

1607
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Super Mario USA there later right

1608
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
yeah so but anyway

1609
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
that's not really the big news although it's certainly

1610
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
a part of this as well as the the

1611
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
question people might be asking is how long

1612
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
is Nintendo going to keep going with this like

1613
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
are they going to release every single NES game

1614
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
and which honestly would be doubtful

1615
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
due to licensing

1616
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and you know especially when

1617
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
third parties develop the game where does

1618
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
the money go and all that stuff so

1619
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
um apparently what's happening

1620
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
over in Hong Kong some leaflets for the

1621
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Switch online service were being distributed

1622
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and leaflets talk about what

1623
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
the Switch online service includes because you know

1624
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
they're trying to sell people on get your

1625
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
you know online Nintendo subscription

1626
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
so you can access the classic library

1627
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
but apparently there's one little section with

1628
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
fine print that says

1629
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
eventually Nintendo will stop

1630
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
adding new NES games to the

1631
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
collection but obviously they're not

1632
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
saying when or anything

1633
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
like that but this it kind of already

1634
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
has the internet riled up on oh

1635
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
the Super Nintendo must be coming because

1636
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
they're saying the Nintendo thing is ending

1637
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
there's only a finite amount

1638
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
of games on the Nintendo so eventually

1639
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
yes it will end

1640
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and it could be

1641
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
ending in three years

1642
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
it doesn't mean it's going to end by the end

1643
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
it's because we live in a world where people

1644
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
are going to sue over the fact that Red Bull

1645
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
doesn't give them wings so of course they have

1646
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
to you know put the

1647
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
put the disclaimer in there guess what

1648
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
eventually we're not going to be adding

1649
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
this was in Hong Kong I don't know if Hong Kong

1650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
has a sue happy culture like we have here

1651
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but but I get what you're saying

1652
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
of course I get what you're saying you have to

1653
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you have to say the obvious things like

1654
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
that because you're right people will sue well I've been paying

1655
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
money every month where's my new games class

1656
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
action lawsuit yeah

1657
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
yeah anyway uh

1658
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
dark to see in chat says well I assume they would

1659
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
they were not going to end it like next month

1660
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
but obviously they won't keep it going forever

1661
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
honestly they would have made a lot more money if they

1662
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
just uh virtual console

1663
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you think huh I know

1664
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
well now especially that they just gave away a year

1665
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
free with Amazon Prime obviously

1666
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Twitch and Amazon must be kicking them some money

1667
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but it's interesting they could have made a lot

1668
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
more money a lot more

1669
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
way all they just

1670
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
seem happy I don't have to drop

1671
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
the drop the cost

1672
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
of the games down like you know cut down the amount

1673
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
that they were charging for those because eight dollars

1674
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
for a Super Nintendo game is just ridiculous but

1675
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
cut that down to a point that it is like

1676
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
very like four ninety

1677
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
nine or something like that or you know

1678
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
cut it down to where it's just like impulse by

1679
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
people be eating that shit up

1680
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
so Questbuster in chat says there's around

1681
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
seven hundred or thirty officially licensed game

1682
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
on the NES but

1683
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I mean you're assuming they're going to

1684
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean I don't think you specifically are assuming but like

1685
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
they're not going to release all seven hundred thirty games

1686
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
they're just not like the licensing on

1687
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
too many games is too complicated for example

1688
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1689
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
by Konami not going to come out

1690
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
not going to happen because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
licensing now is complicated

1692
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't think Konami owns the license anymore

1693
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
they haven't for some time either EA has

1694
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
or somebody else has it and that

1695
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I mean miracles happen because they did

1696
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
release that arcade game on 360

1697
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
when people didn't think that would happen but it's going to be

1698
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
much harder for like a classic thing

1699
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that Nintendo kind of oversees for that to happen

1700
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I would say things like the

1701
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Guardian Legend as much as Dark

1702
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Sakura and myself and many of you stand that

1703
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
game hard I just don't see that game

1704
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
coming out because the license it's too complicated

1705
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
who owns that game now? I think we figured

1706
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
it out. Whoever owns

1707
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Bode Brund

1708
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
well Bode Brund only published it

1709
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
it's compile

1710
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
we figured out the rights in the previous episode

1711
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
it's so far like four times removed

1712
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
now at this point and then I think I cried

1713
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
yeah I might have cried

1714
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
but you know again

1715
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
miracles happen but they're just

1716
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
not going to jump through hoops

1717
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
for all seven hundred thirty games because

1718
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
also let's be real some of them were pretty bad

1719
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
some of those games were pretty bad

1720
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
so maybe we don't need

1721
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
all seven hundred and thirty but

1722
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
yeah I think you know it's inevitable this is

1723
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
going to end but I would say it's still going to be going at least

1724
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
for a year I think the

1725
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
thought is that you know as far as a Super

1726
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Nintendo online or something that does

1727
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
seem like a very logical kind of next

1728
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
step although

1729
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
you know Loki to kind of build on your point

1730
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
maybe they're going to have

1731
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
the NES library be

1732
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Nesflix style

1733
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
but maybe the Super Nintendo games

1734
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
they plan to do piecemeal maybe

1735
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
we're all assuming they'll be

1736
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
assuming or did they say in

1737
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the earliest they did say in the

1738
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
earliest press releases

1739
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that there would be Super Nintendo games didn't they

1740
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and the earliest earliest

1741
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
materials about this online service

1742
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm trying to remember that far back

1743
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and they seem to remember that might have been a

1744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't need

1745
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
the Super Nintendo games to come out

1746
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
because I have a Super SNES

1747
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Bobby's confirming what I just said they did say the earliest

1748
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
ones absolutely did say that

1749
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
well that's cool but I don't need it because

1750
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
you only sold me your systems

1751
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
you know you sold me that stuff already so

1752
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
obviously I already have it and modded it

1753
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
you know

1754
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
SNES classic yeah exactly so I

1755
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
don't need your you know extra

1756
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
stuff Bobby points out

1757
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the early ones didn't even mention NES

1758
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
games they only mentioned Super Nintendo games

1759
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so it would be interesting if they started

1760
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
to dial back from that now but I kind of I don't think

1761
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
they will I think most people kind of figure that

1762
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
maybe when this

1763
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
new Switch comes out or whatever they'll roll

1764
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
out if rumors are true they'll

1765
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
roll out the matching Super Nintendo library to

1766
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
go with it who knows but we'll see

1767
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
anyway that's to assume that the

1768
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Switch Online stays legal

1769
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
right Narsakra I guess there's some interesting legal

1770
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
things going on right there is that

1771
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
basically in the UK the

1772
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
competition and markets authority

1773
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
has opened an investigation against Microsoft

1774
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Nintendo and Sony to check on

1775
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
their online service practices to see

1776
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
if they violate a consumer protection law

1777
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
consumer law is a lot

1778
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
more of a big thing

1779
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I guess in

1780
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Europe Australia

1781
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
those general areas

1782
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
but basically

1783
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
they want to see if it's violating

1784
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
those aspects of their consumer law they want to know

1785
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
the auto renewal policies are fair

1786
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
how easy it is to get a refund

1787
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
or cancel it and whether or not the terms

1788
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
of services

1789
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
take more power out of the

1790
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
customer's hand and put it into

1791
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
the companies so basically

1792
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
they want to make sure the laws are fair and

1793
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
equal to both company and

1794
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
consumer it's

1795
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
actually part of a response to

1796
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
a quote super complaint

1797
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
on a loyalty penalty

1798
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
which is basically the tendency for

1799
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
some of the companies to punish

1800
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
long standing customers by

1801
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
making it difficult or

1802
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
expensive to leave

1803
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and so they're

1804
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
they said the investigation just started but they may

1805
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
only take enforcement action

1806
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
if they believe the companies are not being fair

1807
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
you know

1808
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
the biggest things that have indicated

1809
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
this is becoming a problem is that Sony raised

1810
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
prices for Playstation Plus

1811
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
that there is

1812
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I mean just kind of like we were saying that there's no

1813
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
guarantee that you're going to get

1814
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
the same number of free

1815
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
games or perks for

1816
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
the cost that you're paying for it

1817
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and of course there is

1818
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
auto renewal

1819
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you know for example

1820
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
like what's going on now

1821
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
with the Switch promotion for Twitch Prime

1822
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
you have to

1823
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
turn the auto renewal off after your time

1824
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
period is up or you're going to get charged

1825
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and well

1826
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
it's interesting because you know this is UK

1827
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
law so a lot of our normal ways of

1828
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
thinking don't really apply

1829
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
necessarily but like I know this is a super

1830
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
common tactic in the US like

1831
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
when it comes to let's say Spotify

1832
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'll pick on Spotify you get 99

1833
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
cents for a month of Spotify right

1834
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
but the whole trick is now they get your credit

1835
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
card number they're going to auto bill you

1836
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
unless you like turn it off

1837
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
and heck there's tons of iPhone

1838
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and Android apps that do this too right they'll give away

1839
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
a 7 day

1840
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
preview of like the sleep

1841
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
app that I use we'll do like a 7 day

1842
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
preview of their mode but then

1843
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
if you don't turn it off it will do an auto

1844
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
renew so like I feel like in our

1845
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
culture that's a thing like you got

1846
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it like we all know that's a gotcha

1847
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
tactic in a lot of different places

1848
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
right or a gym membership that's another

1849
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
big one sign up for a gym membership

1850
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
for 5 bucks but then after

1851
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
30 days oh it's going to be the full you know

1852
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
$50 a month or whatever it is right

1853
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
but um yeah

1854
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
it's the fact that it's UK law

1855
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I don't I can't put myself into the same

1856
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
like shoes or whatever

1857
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
so but some of our chatters think there

1858
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
might be something here uh break man in chat says by

1859
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
British laws I think they have a chance

1860
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I think Microsoft and Sony will lose this

1861
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but I don't know how it will affect us in America

1862
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
well and I will tell you one thing too

1863
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
just with some other companies

1864
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
like for example with these

1865
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
increased stringency of

1866
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
encryption requirements and

1867
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
uh customer control over

1868
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
their personal online data

1869
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
um because they became so

1870
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
much stringent um overseas

1871
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that American companies are actually now

1872
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
following suit to match those so that they don't have

1873
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
to worry about what

1874
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
are we doing different here what are we doing different

1875
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
there you know it's

1876
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
going to be universal it's why when you go on to all

1877
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
these different websites now there's a huge

1878
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
fucking thing that says by using

1879
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
this website you agree to use cookies

1880
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
here's our cookie policy that's because of

1881
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
something that happened in the UK not here

1882
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
so but we all

1883
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
kind of get it too because

1884
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
in the world wide web

1885
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
you know it kind of has to apply

1886
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
they set the bar at the most

1887
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
stringent standard and then the rest of us kind of see

1888
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
the effects of that exactly yeah

1889
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I think the auto renewal you know it's interesting because you know

1890
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
it's a like when you get your free

1891
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
PlayStation Plus games let's say

1892
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
if you don't renew

1893
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and you're at the mercy of

1894
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Sony and everything I'm saying could apply

1895
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
to Microsoft or I'm not picking on

1896
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Sony I'm just using them as an example

1897
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
but um you know if you don't renew

1898
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
um you don't get to play

1899
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
those games anymore that you got for

1900
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
free and that's part of the agreement but

1901
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
you're kind of at the mercy of Sony

1902
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
could kind of kick up the price of that

1903
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
at any time they want to

1904
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
well the same thing goes for Spotify subscription

1905
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
or Pandora or Apple Music

1906
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
it really is quite literally the same

1907
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
thing it's just for games instead of listening

1908
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
to music you know

1909
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
it's really

1910
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
no different I mean you know

1911
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Pandora could bump up their price or Spotify

1912
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
could bump up their price and it's really

1913
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I

1914
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
mean

1915
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
it's like that ongoing

1916
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
capitalist inflation cycle

1917
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
where everything else increases

1918
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
but your money does not so

1919
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
it's all that

1920
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Akuma JP in chat says in Japan

1921
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
we're trying to get rid of auto-subscribe

1922
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and fees for unsubscribe

1923
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I can't even believe there'd be like

1924
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
fees for unsubscribing you know what I kind

1925
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
of think is that I

1926
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
the thing that frustrates me is that like to

1927
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
get to unsubscribe from some

1928
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
things you have to like call

1929
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
in and the thing is only

1930
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
open between like 9 am and 5

1931
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
pm when a lot of people are working or whatever

1932
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
so sometimes it's like really hard

1933
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
to like cancel something because you can only

1934
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
do it over the phone even though you can sign up for it

1935
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
online so I kind of think

1936
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and I thought I heard something about the rules

1937
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
moving this way or whatever is

1938
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that if you sign up for something

1939
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
online you ought to be able to

1940
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
cancel online as well

1941
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
you shouldn't be able to sign up

1942
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
and then not

1943
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
like cancel the same way you signed

1944
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
up they should only have cancellation

1945
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
cancellation over the phone is the only option

1946
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
if subscribing over the phone is the only

1947
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
option that's the thing that I kind of disagree with

1948
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
but I thought I heard something about laws

1949
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
we're looking into that as well

1950
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
so YYR in chat

1951
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
says where are there fees for unsubscribing

1952
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
it could be another part

1953
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you know Akuma JP is commenting from Japan

1954
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
so maybe it's just not something we

1955
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
have here but

1956
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
well I have heard of things like early

1957
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
termination agreements like cell phones

1958
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you sign up for a year

1959
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and then mortgages prepayment penalties

1960
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
sure or

1961
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
again

1962
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
gyms right for some

1963
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
deals you have to sign up for a year

1964
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and if you break it early you get a penalty

1965
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
so but I get

1966
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that that's kind of you know

1967
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
maybe we kind of sit here

1968
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
going oh well doesn't everybody

1969
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
know that but you know certain cultures

1970
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
may have a different approach and I think

1971
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
that's also what you're seeing here is that the UK

1972
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
is starting to look at some things that maybe

1973
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
we've just kind of come to accept as normal

1974
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
in our culture and going huh should that

1975
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
really be the way I don't know

1976
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
so anyway

1977
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
alright Sia Tabiri in chat

1978
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
says Verizon will never let the

1979
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
government stop that and Amazon

1980
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
or Act Deft points out Amazon

1981
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
used to have a cancellation fee for monthly

1982
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
prime subscribers but they got rid

1983
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
of that and then

1984
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the break man says

1985
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
rollover contracts are a big no-no

1986
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
in the UK as of the 2015 law

1987
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
very interesting how all these

1988
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
as the world gets more and more closer

1989
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
together through the internet

1990
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
all these laws in different places

1991
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
kind of set different tones very interesting

1992
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
anyway it's always about

1993
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
consumer advocacy though that's very important

1994
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
well let's move on for the sake of time

1995
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
we're gonna go to our next topic Loki

1996
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
yeah so this is kind of neat

1997
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
so apparently Microsoft is rolling

1998
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
the Xbox or they're giving you an

1999
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
option to

2000
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
have basically Xbox Live and Game Pass

2001
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
as one big subscription

2002
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
so apparently the plan

2003
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
is to merge them into a $15

2004
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
per month subscription called Xbox Game

2005
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Pass Ultimate

2006
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that'll basically give you both of those

2007
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
services

2008
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
at one cost now

2009
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
apparently the annual of course

2010
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
live gold membership is

2011
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
$60 and 12 months of Game Pass is

2012
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
$120 so that still

2013
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
works out to $180 per year

2014
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
so you're not really saving any money

2015
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
in that way

2016
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
but maybe $15

2017
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
a month they're kind of

2018
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
poising it in a way that

2019
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
like hey you pay like 12 bucks a month

2020
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
for Netflix or whatever and

2021
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
it's not much more so

2022
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
maybe that's how they're trying

2023
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
to sell it when I first read the article

2024
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I was like oh this is what they're gonna start to move to

2025
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
it's the only option I was like I've been saying this

2026
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
they dropped the price down like maybe dropped it down

2027
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
to like say $12.99 a month

2028
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
or something like that and then

2029
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
look see if you sign up for both

2030
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
you save a little bit but

2031
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
if you sign up for both

2032
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
you pay for both that's not really much

2033
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
of a deal

2034
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
aren't you saying that only if you're paying for like live

2035
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
on a year if you're paying live month to month you're still saving money

2036
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
aren't you? Right but you're

2037
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
always gonna be saving a month even just paying it for a

2038
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
year so I

2039
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
depends on how you want to do it

2040
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
but I've been kind of sitting here going it's only

2041
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
a matter of time before they just kind of

2042
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
loop Game Pass and gold into the same thing

2043
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and this feels like a step in that direction

2044
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
even though you know the finances and all that

2045
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
get tricky and I do think

2046
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I do think you know they're not gonna

2047
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
be able to easily

2048
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
convince people to do this if they can't get

2049
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
the price of Game Pass as low as the price of gold

2050
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
maybe this could be per month

2051
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and then if they have like a year

2052
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
subscription to this it's even less

2053
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
you know maybe they could do something like that

2054
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I can understand that might be a little bit more

2055
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
enticing because it's like oh hey you know I can get both these

2056
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
services for less than I'm

2057
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
you know paying for them

2058
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you month to month or something like that

2059
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I just don't see the advantage of just

2060
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
putting the prices together

2061
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
it's if you're doing it month to month

2062
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
and YYR points out if you're paying month to month

2063
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
$15 a month is a 25% savings

2064
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
over subscribing to both individually

2065
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
but if you're paying $60 a year then it's the same

2066
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
price unless they get rid of gold

2067
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and just have that is this is your

2068
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
only option I just I feel

2069
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
like that you know I've been saying that for a long time

2070
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
but maybe I know I know we're probably still

2071
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
a little bit away from that but it'll be

2072
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
very interesting to see I think at E3

2073
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
what Microsoft does to push this further

2074
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
are they saying this is going to be a thing at E3 or

2075
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
sooner than that?

2076
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
The thought was that it's supposed to be

2077
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
this is rumor right? It's supposed to be out

2078
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
around the time when the Xbox

2079
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
One S all digital edition is revealed

2080
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
the thought is so

2081
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
that I think is supposed to happen in a few weeks

2082
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
so I guess we'll hear about this before

2083
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
E3. Alright

2084
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
it'll be interesting if all this stuff kind of comes out

2085
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
before E3.

2086
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Moving on to what's been kind of

2087
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
an interesting back and forth this week

2088
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Kotaku ran a very

2089
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
interesting piece on BioWare

2090
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
that was really kind of a dragging and exposing

2091
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
of some of the things that went on behind the scenes

2092
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
at Anthem and the development

2093
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
of Anthem and why Anthem may not

2094
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
have turned out to be as

2095
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
wonderful as it did. I'm not going to

2096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
really try to summarize the article if

2097
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
you want to go read it you can. I would say

2098
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
what I took away from this and maybe some of you in

2099
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
the chat feel different but it really sounds

2100
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
like they shifted

2101
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
development in the last year

2102
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and a half which I feel like we

2103
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
hear about games all the time and I would say

2104
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Final Fantasy XV was another one of those games

2105
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
they just took the wheel and change

2106
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
development in the last year and a half and

2107
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
that's one of the reasons but it sounds like the biggest

2108
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
reason Anthem had

2109
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
problems was that they were forced to use the Frostbite

2110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
engine. It really sounds like that Frostbite

2111
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
engine is not doing

2112
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
BioWare any favors because it sounds

2113
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
like I'm hearing a lot of the same

2114
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
stuff out of what happened with

2115
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Mass Effect Andromeda and so on. Anyway

2116
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
but the complicated

2117
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
stuff that happened. So Kotaku

2118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
put out their story and then like what like 15 minutes

2119
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
after the fact BioWare

2120
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
put out a thing that

2121
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
basically was like you know

2122
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
we don't agree and it was

2123
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
very kind of generic and didn't really

2124
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
speak specifically to the piece like they knew it was

2125
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
coming but they didn't know specifically what was

2126
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
in it and obviously if Kotaku had asked

2127
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
BioWare to comment on it then they probably knew it was

2128
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
coming. Well a secondary

2129
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
piece kind of came out and

2130
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Casey Hudson I believe wrote this piece

2131
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
to something they sent to the whole

2132
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
staff and of course emails

2133
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
leaked from within what a shock

2134
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and part of the letter says

2135
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
what we found out of bounds

2136
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
was the naming of specific developers

2137
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
as targets for public criticism

2138
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
because Kotaku does try to kind of

2139
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
draw this line of this particular

2140
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
individual came in and the development kind of

2141
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
shifted so it did kind of I did

2142
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
find it to be maybe finger pointing a little bit

2143
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
but I didn't me personally I didn't see

2144
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
it as a negative I kind of felt like

2145
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
it might be that this guy saw this

2146
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
machine that was rolling in like all these different

2147
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
directions and had to put it on

2148
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
course because it was spiraling out of control

2149
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
or something. It sounds like there's a lot

2150
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
of other issues going into this that are

2151
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
more complex than a three hour show can handle

2152
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
but what's also interesting

2153
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
is Kotaku kind of notes at the end of the letter

2154
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
they said that

2155
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
they've heard from a number of developers

2156
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
who work or have worked at beloved

2157
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
AAA game studios with messages like

2158
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
replace BioWare with my

2159
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
studio and it's the same story

2160
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and these are things like

2161
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
crunch hours

2162
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
just things

2163
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing

2164
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
rivalries between studios that are in

2165
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
different cities and like all

2166
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
of these things are just like really really

2167
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
messy and

2168
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know

2169
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I think we all have been sitting here going

2170
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
the gaming industry is going to

2171
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
crack under some of this at some point

2172
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and I don't know if it's the AAA

2173
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
gaming that is going to be

2174
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
looking at streaming as a primary thing that's

2175
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
going to cause some things to crack or if

2176
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
game developers do

2177
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
cross that bridge and they

2178
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
form a big game developer union

2179
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I mean Hollywood has unions

2180
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
they need to unionize like

2181
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
major Hollywood has Screen

2182
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Actors Guild, Writers Guild

2183
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I mean right so

2184
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
it would be

2185
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
sorry now it's SAG-AFTRA

2186
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the Screen Actors and the Play Actors

2187
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and voice actors

2188
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
are part of that as well which

2189
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
have affected gaming in the past

2190
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and they have very specific rules

2191
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
they have to follow so anyway

2192
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I know that's a really kind of like controversial thing

2193
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
but I think a lot of us are sitting here going

2194
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
this whole like gaming crunch

2195
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
time and the way games are being developed

2196
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
it ain't working

2197
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
y'all

2198
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
and especially when you look at Anthem

2199
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
some people are still defending

2200
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Anthem and having a good time playing it

2201
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and if you're having a good time with Anthem

2202
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
go you, have fun

2203
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
but I'm hearing some challenges about

2204
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
what to do at the end of Anthem

2205
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and that it seems like it might be a little bit short sight

2206
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I feel like this is a broken record

2207
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
there's so many of these games that have been in development

2208
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
for years, well we just joked about

2209
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Dead Island 2 right?

2210
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
they probably haven't started the real development

2211
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
on Dead Island 2 yet

2212
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and they're going to crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch

2213
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
to get it out by the end of a fiscal year

2214
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
so

2215
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
anyway

2216
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Kaijuto in chat says if they make a union

2217
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I hope they name it the multiplayer

2218
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
unions don't really get

2219
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
very cute names

2220
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
it'll probably be something very, very plain

2221
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
let's see

2222
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Act Def says

2223
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
it's the people running the unions that

2224
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
may be bad, unions aren't a bad thing

2225
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and devs should definitely form one

2226
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I don't know if the US has a similar law but in Mexico

2227
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
you have the right to start a union

2228
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
yeah you have the right to start a union, it's just

2229
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
some companies will go so far

2230
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
as to show you movies on your first day on why it's a bad idea

2231
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
sometimes happens

2232
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
so anyway

2233
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
YYR in chat says and this is why I develop games

2234
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
in my spare time and refuse to actually try to do it

2235
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
for a living, sorry that you're all still waiting

2236
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
for the new bungee ferret tossing but

2237
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
it's not ready, and that's okay

2238
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
YYR, when it's ready, it's ready

2239
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and that's cool, I mean you got new baby

2240
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and all that stuff, you're busy

2241
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
it's fine, it's done

2242
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
when it's done, right

2243
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
just like we've gotten used to with a lot of blizzard games

2244
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
just like we get used to with a lot of movies

2245
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
it's done when it's done, right

2246
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and that's a-ok

2247
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
so

2248
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
what was I gonna say with the whole

2249
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
that whole tangent

2250
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
about the development needing to take its time

2251
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I lost my train of thought but

2252
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I think, you know, it's gonna get worse

2253
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
in some ways when the graphics

2254
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
are pushed even further

2255
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
as we move into the Playstation 5

2256
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and the Xbox, you know, whatever the next Xbox

2257
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
is, I don't know, I feel like something's gonna give

2258
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
here, it's just

2259
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
this industry really can't

2260
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
keep going the way it's

2261
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
going and people

2262
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
need to be held accountable for some of these really

2263
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
fucking bad decisions that happen

2264
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
because I, from my perspective and looking

2265
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
at all this, I feel like truly

2266
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
the bottom line in this whole

2267
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
thing on why these games are not

2268
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
turning out as good as they could be

2269
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
is that they're being forced to use the Frostbite engine

2270
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
because of some type of company

2271
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
you know, because EA, EA's making

2272
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
them do it, like the real enemy

2273
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
in this whole thing between

2274
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Mass Effect Andromeda and

2275
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
maybe the next Dragon

2276
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Age and Anthem

2277
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
is the Frostbite engine

2278
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
so, you know what, EA

2279
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
it is time to let that engine

2280
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
go and if your developers

2281
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
want to make a game in Unity, fucking let them

2282
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
fucking let them

2283
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
why are you, why are you tied, like you're

2284
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
gonna go like that, do you want that Frostbite

2285
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
engine to be the hill that you

2286
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
die on? Cause

2287
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
so far it's not looking good

2288
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Unless they have some sort of exclusivity

2289
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
contract

2290
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and they're stuck to it

2291
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
What I'm saying is that that contract is garbage

2292
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and it's sinking those games and they need to

2293
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
end that contract or whatever it is

2294
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But companies don't think that way, they think of

2295
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
immediate and not long term

2296
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on

2297
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
we got plenty more show to cover

2298
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Alright, well, how about

2299
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
loot boxes?

2300
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
How about no loot boxes?

2301
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Well, anyway

2302
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
the Federal Trade Commission is going to

2303
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
be holding a public workshop

2304
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
on August 7th

2305
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
2019 at the Constitution

2306
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Center in Washington D.C.

2307
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It will be webcast on the FTC's

2308
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
website, but the workshop is called

2309
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Inside the Game, Unlocking Consumer

2310
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Issues Surrounding Loot Boxes

2311
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
to quote

2312
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Examine consumer protection issues

2313
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
related to video game loot boxes

2314
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
End game rewards players can

2315
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
buy while playing a video game

2316
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So this is what they want to do, they want to include

2317
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
industry representatives, consumer advocates

2318
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
trade associations, academics

2319
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and government officials to discuss

2320
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
these following things. So it's the

2321
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
end game transition landscape

2322
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
including origin and

2323
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
evolution of loot boxes and their role

2324
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in game play in the digital marketplace

2325
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and this is actually bullet points from

2326
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
their thing

2327
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I was just going to say, Bobby is suggesting

2328
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
this webcast should include one slide

2329
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
with one word, don't

2330
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Research examining

2331
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
consumer behavior including child and adolescent

2332
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
behavior in the context of video games

2333
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and digital transactions

2334
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and a discussion of consumer awareness

2335
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and education about end game digital

2336
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
transactions including the mechanics, marketing

2337
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
and financial commitments associated

2338
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
with loot boxes

2339
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They're also saying

2340
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
that the public can

2341
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
submit their input on those

2342
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
topics by emailing lootbox

2343
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
workshop at

2344
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
ftc.gov up until

2345
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
June 7th of this year

2346
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So there you go, you can send your email

2347
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
subject, loot boxes, message, don't

2348
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
There's also

2349
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
an online

2350
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
comment, forum

2351
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
comment, forum on

2352
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
the FTC

2353
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
website which I will be linking in chat

2354
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh good!

2355
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But I'll just

2356
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
go ahead and read it, it's regulations

2357
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
dot gov slash

2358
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
dot get question mark

2359
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
D equals FTC

2360
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
dash 2019 dash 0021

2361
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I imagine most of you will just Google

2362
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
it. Whatever, I just said it

2363
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
because it was a short one, it wasn't all crazy

2364
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But yeah,

2365
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
basically you can

2366
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
comment on the

2367
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
document, there's nothing supporting right now

2368
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
but the final

2369
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
on that page is the document

2370
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
for their

2371
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
proposal on here for that workshop

2372
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and just taking a quick glance

2373
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
over on it

2374
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Why does everything from the FTC

2375
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
have to be in Microsoft Word format?

2376
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So basically

2377
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
yeah, it's a lot of what I said

2378
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
but it talks about what a loot box

2379
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
is, why people

2380
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
have concerns about it

2381
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and basically some of the goals of it

2382
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and again, it's for the public

2383
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I think it would be interesting to read this

2384
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
and I might have to go in and do it later just to see how it's been

2385
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
dumbed down for government officials

2386
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
There's also a media contact listed in here

2387
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Fun

2388
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I imagine many of you are running

2389
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
to the forum right now to simply post

2390
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
don't

2391
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Does anyone enjoy loot boxes?

2392
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Sometimes they're kind of fun if you're guaranteed

2393
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
something nice

2394
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I mean, I didn't mind it so much in

2395
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2396
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
but I got

2397
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
kind of tired of it

2398
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I prefer being able to

2399
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
win currency in my game

2400
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
instead of getting a box for it

2401
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
because that's 90% of

2402
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I saved my points and got stuff

2403
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
instead of just paying into them

2404
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
What are the people who will pay into it to get the biggest and bestest?

2405
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I like Enforza

2406
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
where it's like you kind of have a wheel

2407
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
that you spin but you'll get everything eventually

2408
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
you know what I mean? If they want to

2409
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
hand it out in a random order then fine

2410
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't know, but anyway

2411
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
AkumaJP in chat says

2412
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
free loot box I don't mind

2413
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
when it's free and you get them as a part

2414
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
of playing through the game

2415
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I think that's why a lot of people kind of give

2416
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Overwatch some slack because

2417
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Overwatch is kind of constantly handing out

2418
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
free loot boxes between the holidays

2419
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and every time you level up and all that stuff

2420
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
so I think that's why

2421
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
some people kind of let that one slide

2422
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't know. Anyway, moving on

2423
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
we still have some more gaming stories for you guys

2424
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Loki. Alright, well

2425
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
something coming from yet another

2426
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
battle royale game

2427
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
but taking a page

2428
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
out of Apex Legends

2429
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Fortnite has decided to add reboot vans

2430
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
which apparently is very similar to

2431
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
the respawn

2432
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
beacons that you have in Apex Legends

2433
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
but of course now they're just

2434
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
kind of skinning it for

2435
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Fortnite so that's the new update that's going to be

2436
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
coming very soon as well

2437
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
to kind of mix up the game a little bit

2438
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and they kind of do something like

2439
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
once a month anyways to kind of mix the game

2440
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
up so I'm not surprised

2441
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
that one game's curving

2442
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
off of another game for

2443
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
gameplay ideas

2444
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's kind of interesting now to see how like

2445
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Fortnite that's been kind of leading things

2446
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
it's kind of taken some cues now from

2447
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Apex which has Apex overtaken

2448
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Fortnite at this point or is it still kind of like a back

2449
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and forth? I've been watching the

2450
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Twitch rankings that closely and I know that's just one

2451
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
representation

2452
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
of how the games might actually be doing

2453
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
when it comes to the money they're making

2454
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and so forth so yeah but

2455
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I mean I think it sounds interesting

2456
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I don't know I still just when it comes

2457
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
to Fortnite like the building thing I just

2458
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I've never been able to wrap my head

2459
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
around how the building works like what

2460
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
like strategically how you like do that

2461
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
in Fortnite because Fortnite has like no

2462
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
tutorial and so I've never really been able to

2463
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
figure out how to use that effectively

2464
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You can do the creative mode which

2465
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
you know what's funny and a half later because I went to go look at the

2466
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Weezer thing at one point and like you know

2467
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I yeah the creative mode's kind of fun I

2468
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
like that but then when I I don't know

2469
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
what the building in combat

2470
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I don't know I haven't been able to wrap my head around that but the building

2471
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
stuff isn't in Apex so

2472
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
in some ways it's kind of easier I think

2473
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
so yeah

2474
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Bobby Blackwell says

2475
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
in Fortnite when you shoot someone they turn into

2476
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
a 10 story building yeah

2477
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
or they they try to hide themselves inside

2478
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
a 10 story building so that you can't shoot them

2479
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I suppose alright anyway

2480
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
one more story for you guys before we get to

2481
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
the Classic Game of the Week and it has to do with some

2482
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Best Buy leaks so who

2483
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
knows if they're true or not but

2484
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I know they're talking about some things

2485
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think a lot of us have been waiting for

2486
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
well anyway apparently these were on

2487
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
internal employee terminals

2488
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
suggesting that Persona 5

2489
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
was about to get a

2490
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Switch release for 60 bucks

2491
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
they didn't have a date on it

2492
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it just was in the system

2493
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
you know how that goes somebody made a record in the system

2494
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you know how that goes remember Walmart Canada

2495
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and E3 last year yeah

2496
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Metroid Prime Trilogy was

2497
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
another one and I think a lot of us have been kind of

2498
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
asking oh when is that going to come out on Switch so that

2499
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
might actually be a thing but then

2500
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
the other surprise in there was

2501
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The Legend of Zelda

2502
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
A Link to the Past

2503
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
wait a minute wait a minute

2504
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that's the Super Nintendo game

2505
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
why would the Super Nintendo game

2506
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
be released by itself

2507
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
unless

2508
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
either Nintendo does plan to

2509
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
piecemeal this despite

2510
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
their earlier marketing about

2511
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
the NES and the Super Nintendo

2512
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
being separate or could

2513
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
they since they're making

2514
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
this Link's Awakening game

2515
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
in a 3D environment

2516
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
that looks a lot like A Link to the Past

2517
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
but 3D could they

2518
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
possibly maybe

2519
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
be remaking

2520
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
A Link to the Past as

2521
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
well that's what some people are

2522
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
theorizing with this how would you

2523
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
feel about how would you guys feel about

2524
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
A Link to the Past remake

2525
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
in that

2526
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
3D style that they're doing this Awakening

2527
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
remake in

2528
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I mean

2529
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I need my pixels

2530
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I'm open to it like the Secret of Mana

2531
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
remake was alright

2532
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
but the original is still

2533
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
like the one like if I'm like you've never

2534
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
played Secret of Mana I'm gonna pull up the original

2535
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
like the 3D remake was cool

2536
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
in some ways but it also had issues when it first came out

2537
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I don't know if you guys remember the Secret of Mana

2538
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
kind of had some issues when it first came out so

2539
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I don't know but Nintendo

2540
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
usually does not

2541
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I would trust Nintendo's quality

2542
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
a little bit more than probably anybody else

2543
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
so anyway

2544
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
let's see

2545
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Brakeman says I want a VR style

2546
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
remake be careful what you ask

2547
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
for let's see

2548
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Bobby Blackpool says what is the remake also

2549
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
has Metroid and has a randomizer

2550
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
you're on

2551
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
but I don't think that's what's gonna happen although

2552
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
god I wish Nintendo would go down that path

2553
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
can you even imagine you know what I want

2554
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I want a new remix game

2555
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
like NES remix and wasn't there

2556
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
SNES remix at one point I remember

2557
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
no there wasn't then I want an SNES

2558
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
remix I want those games to come back

2559
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
out those are fun anyway

2560
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
alright let's move on to

2561
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
the classic game of the week

2562
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
every week here on the show Dark

2563
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Soccer steps in the gaming vault to find the game

2564
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
that she thinks hey sticky

2565
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
you guys should be checking out this classic

2566
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
oh my god the cat threw up and you know

2567
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
sometimes that's what I say in the vault

2568
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
sometimes Dark Soccer will pick

2569
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
pretty obscure Japanese titles you probably never

2570
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
played like last week was one of those

2571
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
titles right it wasn't very

2572
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
yeah it was but this

2573
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
this week she's picking a game

2574
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that I owned

2575
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
this is a little bit more

2576
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
one that you guys probably could play

2577
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
honestly act deaf this goes out to you

2578
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
what is the classic game of the week

2579
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
actually finger trick

2580
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
it is Kirby Superstar

2581
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
because

2582
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
it's so much fun I've decided that

2583
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
my first tattoo might actually

2584
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
be Kirby riding the star

2585
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
it might be if I don't get my cherry blossom

2586
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but anyway

2587
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
in PAL regions it was released as Kirby's

2588
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Fun Pack and it came out in

2589
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
1996 so the

2590
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
year I moved out here

2591
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
the year I graduated high school

2592
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
girl I should take that back

2593
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
no I moved out here did I move out here in 96?

2594
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I don't remember

2595
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
no I think I moved out here in 98

2596
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
anyway whatever

2597
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
anyway it was

2598
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
developed by HAL Laboratories and published by Nintendo

2599
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
for the Super Nintendo

2600
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and it was part of

2601
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
the entire Kirby series

2602
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
it basically was advertised

2603
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
as featuring 8 games

2604
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
7 short sub games

2605
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
with all the same basic gameplay

2606
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and too many games

2607
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
it was later released on Wii and Wii U

2608
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and there's an enhanced remake

2609
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
called Kirby Superstar Ultra

2610
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
that came out on the DS in 2008

2611
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
also Nintendo

2612
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
re-released Kirby Superstar in Japan

2613
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
US and Europe

2614
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
in November 2017 as part of the

2615
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Super NES Classic Edition

2616
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
which I think I played

2617
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
quite a bit of that during the time

2618
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
anyway you play

2619
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
as Kirby who can float

2620
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and inhale stuff and spit him out

2621
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
if he swallows certain enemies

2622
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
he gains their abilities and can use them

2623
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
as his own

2624
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
another feature of this

2625
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
particular game is helpers

2626
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
so when Kirby has an ability he can

2627
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
transform it into a helper character

2628
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
that the second player or computer can

2629
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
control and certain abilities

2630
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
like

2631
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
crash or the mic cannot be

2632
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
like crash or mic cannot be

2633
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
turned into helpers

2634
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
so you have to choose to give the helper

2635
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
a form or revert them into a power

2636
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
up in an emergency

2637
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
so some of them

2638
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
like wheelie allow Kirby to interact with

2639
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
them during two player play

2640
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
so

2641
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
basically if it takes too much damage

2642
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
then Kirby can grant it a new power

2643
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
before it disappears and he has to create

2644
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
a new one and if Kirby takes too much

2645
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
damage he loses a life

2646
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
so there are a few

2647
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
the different ones in here are Spring Breeze

2648
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
which is a simplified remake

2649
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
of Kirby's Dream Land

2650
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
but it has the Superstar enhancements in it

2651
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
so basically you have to make it to a

2652
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
castle to challenge King Dedede

2653
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
who has stolen food from Dream Land

2654
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
wah

2655
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and also float islands

2656
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
in Castle Lola Will have emerged

2657
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and Kabula does not

2658
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
appear and then

2659
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
when you reach Castle Dedede you don't have

2660
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
to do a boss rush to get to

2661
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
King Dedede

2662
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Dynablade is an original

2663
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
one where you have to stop Dynablade

2664
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
which is a giant bird from

2665
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
disturbing Dream Land's crops

2666
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
it's all about food isn't it Kirby?

2667
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
so you have four layers that you have to play and then you face off

2668
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
against Dynablade and you have two secret

2669
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
areas and many bosses that move around the world

2670
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
map in this one

2671
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Gourmet Race, jeez even more food

2672
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
so you have to race against King Dedede

2673
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
while eating as much food as you can

2674
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
so

2675
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
you take

2676
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
it takes place across three levels of different links

2677
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and whoever earns the most points by the end of all three levels

2678
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
with a bonus point being the first to

2679
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
finish each race

2680
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and so then you can choose to race

2681
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
King Dedede or your ghost

2682
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
to be the best at that

2683
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and the DS actually had multiplayer

2684
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
functionality in this one

2685
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
then we have the Great Cave Offensive which is

2686
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
a metroidvania style game

2687
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
where Kirby has to explore a cave for treasure

2688
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and so you have

2689
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
sixty treasure chests

2690
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
and you get a maximum score

2691
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
of, it looks like

2692
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
ninety-nine million

2693
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
no, nine million nine hundred and ninety

2694
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
nine, nine hundred and ninety points

2695
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
and sixty treasures

2696
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
it also has references to

2697
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
other Nintendo games like the Triforce

2698
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
screw attack

2699
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
the helmet of Captain Falcon and

2700
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Mr. Saturn from Earthbound

2701
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and then you've got

2702
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
other value

2703
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
items that appear like in other

2704
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
role playing games. We have the Revenge of

2705
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Meta Knight which basically has Kirby

2706
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
trying to destroy Meta Knight's battleship

2707
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
the Halberd before Meta Knight can

2708
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
conquer Dreamland

2709
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
you have a time limit and it will cost

2710
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
you a life if it hits zero

2711
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and it is very apparently plot based

2712
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
so then we also have Milky Way Wishes

2713
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
which is the largest game in the collection

2714
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
basically the sun and the moon

2715
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
around planet Popstar

2716
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
are fighting and a creature named

2717
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Marx tells Kirby that he must travel across

2718
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
nine planets to restore a giant

2719
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
wish granting comet

2720
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Nova, comet Clock Nova

2721
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
so unlike this one

2722
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Kirby can't copy

2723
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
the enemies

2724
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
he can get copy essence's

2725
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
deluxe and then he can choose a copy ability

2726
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
from the list and then he has it through the game

2727
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
also

2728
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
beating Milky Way Wishes

2729
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
grant you the arena sub game

2730
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and the arena is an endurance mode

2731
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
that is a big boss rush, you fight basically

2732
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
every boss, there are 26 bosses

2733
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
in 19 rounds

2734
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and in between each round you have

2735
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
a room with maximum tomatoes

2736
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
five of them which can only be used

2737
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
once each and then

2738
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
two randomly selected pedestals will

2739
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
give you certain powers

2740
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
you can choose any of the powers at the beginning of the game

2741
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and then if you beat that you get the sound test

2742
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
function so you can listen to all the music in the game

2743
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
there are some sub games like Samurai Kirby

2744
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
where it's a

2745
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
timing based mini game

2746
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
like quick draw from Kirby's adventure

2747
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
where you have to

2748
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
do the attack at just the right moment

2749
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
wild gunman basically and then megaton

2750
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
punch which is what I did yesterday

2751
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
anyway you have to punch a crack

2752
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
in the planet and you have to make a bigger crack

2753
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
the point is crack rob

2754
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
anyway

2755
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
this is one of those games that had a special

2756
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
chip for it, it's the SA-1 chip

2757
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and

2758
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
with this particular

2759
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
one it was basically just to

2760
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
be able to

2761
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
help with some of the computer generated imagery

2762
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
like what was in the

2763
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
introduction

2764
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
they had some

2765
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
other things that were planned

2766
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
for the game and of course

2767
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Sakurai who also did give us Smash

2768
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Brothers

2769
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
was developing the game using three different

2770
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
design pillars as he said it

2771
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
a two player co-op gameplay, beat em up

2772
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
gameplay and an omnibus format

2773
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
that you could use it to reach

2774
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
an ending and actually it was

2775
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that last

2776
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
sorry the two player co-op

2777
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I believe was requested by Miyamoto

2778
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and then

2779
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
a couple of the other things

2780
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
that were wanted to be in the game

2781
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
was one called Kagero Mansion

2782
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
which was a survival horror game

2783
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
that leaves Kirby stuck in a mansion

2784
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
with a cursed seal in his mouth

2785
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
so he cannot use his

2786
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
inhale or copy ability

2787
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
and then

2788
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
it was meant to be a little bit more

2789
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
proactive in the gameplay but

2790
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
they didn't want to

2791
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
do it so basically

2792
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
but when it was sold in Japan

2793
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it was sold in a package

2794
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
resembling a wooden box with a seal

2795
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
burnt off

2796
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
like buying high priced sake or dishware

2797
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
comes in one of those boxes, luxury items

2798
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
so the design was supposed to be

2799
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
like a luxury item box

2800
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
so anyway

2801
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
with the remake version

2802
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
which came out in 2008 so it's still

2803
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
under that 10 year thing

2804
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
it has different modes

2805
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
in it for Kirby Super Star Ultra

2806
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
there's Revenge of the King which is a more

2807
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
difficult version of Spring Breeze

2808
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
where you fight a stronger King Dedede

2809
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
which is Mask's Dedede

2810
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and in this one Kabula appears

2811
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
and you

2812
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
have to face using Starship Kirby

2813
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and you also have a Boss Rush

2814
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
and they're all powered up

2815
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
on top of that. Then you have Meta

2816
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Nightmare Ultra which you

2817
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
control Meta Knight and he plays

2818
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
through the levels on Spring Breeze, Dynablade

2819
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
the Great Cave Offensive, Revenge

2820
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
of Meta Knight, and Milky Way Wishes

2821
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
and at the end of Milky Way Wishes instead of fighting

2822
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Marks he fights Galacta Knight

2823
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Helper to Hero

2824
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
is also like an arena mode

2825
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
but you play as a helper

2826
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and fight a new character

2827
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Wham Bam Jewel

2828
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
True Arena is an enhanced arena

2829
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
you've got all your extra bosses

2830
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
in that one and then you have the sub games

2831
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Snack Tracks, Kirby Swipe

2832
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
and Kirby on the Draw

2833
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
which can be played up to 4 players

2834
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
a local play. Anyway

2835
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
it was pretty

2836
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
pretty rad. People liked it and it

2837
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
sold over 1 million copies in Japan

2838
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and it received fairly

2839
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
favorable ratings and

2840
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
a lot of people considered it one of the best games

2841
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
in the franchise.

2842
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It got really great reviews

2843
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
in EGM back then Electric Gaming Monthly

2844
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
GamePro really

2845
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
GamePro gave it a 5 out of 5

2846
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
in sound and control and Fun Factor

2847
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
got a 4.5 out of 5

2848
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and it was really considered just a

2849
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
very charming and fun little game

2850
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Famitsu gave it 32 out of

2851
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
40

2852
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
and in 2008

2853
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Superstar Ultra became a Famitsu

2854
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Gold title

2855
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and that particular one

2856
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
sold 1 million

2857
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
21,000 copies in

2858
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Japan and was the 9th best selling

2859
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
game of Japan in 2008

2860
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
as of December 2008 it was the 5th best

2861
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
selling Nintendo DS game in the US

2862
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and as far

2863
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
as its legacy

2864
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
some of the tracks

2865
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
ended up in Super Smash Brothers

2866
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
especially in the N64 and that was

2867
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
the music from the Gourmet Race and Kirby's

2868
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
theme song. It was on

2869
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Wii Virtual Console

2870
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and Wii U Virtual Console

2871
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
like I said earlier

2872
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
and it was included in Kirby's Dream Collection

2873
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
that was released on the Wii

2874
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
in celebration of the 20th anniversary

2875
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Metal Knights Battleship

2876
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
the Halberd reappeared in

2877
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Kirby's Squeak Squad

2878
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Kirby's Epic Yarn

2879
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Super Smash Brothers for Wii U

2880
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and Kirby Planet Robobot

2881
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
try that fist a little

2882
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
it's not a tongue twister it's a

2883
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and then a stage based off

2884
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the Great Cave Offensive

2885
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
shows up in Super Smash Brothers

2886
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
for Wii U

2887
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
that basically is just a reference back to them

2888
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
of course it's included in the Super Nest classic

2889
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
edition. So there you go

2890
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
we got some koi b action

2891
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
yes and it's a game that I

2892
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
remember pretty fondly as well

2893
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I had this game, I loved the samurai game

2894
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
the little wild gum and rip off was so much fun

2895
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I can't go

2896
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
all

2897
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
crazy

2898
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
about

2899
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
picking weird obscure shit no one's heard of

2900
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
or that maybe five of us have heard of

2901
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I like the obscure stuff but I think

2902
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
a good segment is a mixture of all of it

2903
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I am still thinking of getting the Kirby

2904
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
on a star

2905
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
because I said that when I lost

2906
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
100 pounds I'd get ink

2907
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
well now I've lost 116

2908
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I guess you still don't have ink

2909
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
that's okay because I talked about getting a tattoo a long time ago

2910
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
as well because I was

2911
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
going to get a sound wave

2912
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
here because thankfully

2913
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
thanks to the long running history of this show

2914
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I have audio of my mom

2915
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
because she was on the show so I wanted to get

2916
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
you need to get the one of her going, Rob

2917
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
well I wanted to get her

2918
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
on my arm

2919
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and it's that whole little nerdy thing

2920
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
where you can use the phone to play it and read it

2921
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and I realize that type of stuff won't be around forever

2922
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
even though tattoos are but I still think like sound waves

2923
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
the fact that it would be my mom and just the fact that

2924
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this shit here has been

2925
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
a part of my life for so long there should be a

2926
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
representation of that, you know, so

2927
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
that's what I'm looking into doing

2928
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
we'll have to go get matching

2929
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
tattoos, no we wouldn't get matching tattoos

2930
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
but sibling tattoos

2931
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
anyway, does Agdeft have a Kirby tattoo?

2932
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'd be curious about that

2933
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
yeah I really want to know Agdeft, do you have a Kirby tattoo?

2934
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and where is it?

2935
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
we're going to take a studio break real quick

2936
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
but we're just going to throw it to a segment

2937
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I made earlier today, we're talking about classic

2938
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
games, I've talked a lot on the show

2939
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
before about the classic

2940
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Nintendo online library on the Switch

2941
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
but I've talked about the

2942
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
oh well maybe that's

2943
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
something for the future

2944
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
but I've talked about the Famicom

2945
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
library and how there are some subtle differences

2946
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
in some of the games and I thought it would be kind of

2947
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
fun for this segment tonight to

2948
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
show some of those subtle differences

2949
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
here, so we will be right back

2950
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
here on Orange Lounge

2951
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Radio, let's throw it to myself

2952
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
earlier today

2953
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Hey everybody, it's Rob in the

2954
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
office studio and I thought for our

2955
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
OLR break tonight we could take a look at something

2956
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
that I've talked a few times about on the show

2957
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
but I haven't really shown here on the show

2958
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
and I thought it would be a good thing for the midpoint

2959
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
break, I've done a couple of livestreams

2960
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
on my own personal channel that have

2961
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
addressed this a little bit but what I wanted to show

2962
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
tonight was the Nintendo Switch

2963
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
online family computer classic console

2964
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
or Famicom classic console

2965
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
as opposed to the online library

2966
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
for the NES that I think many of you

2967
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
are used to, if you own

2968
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
a Nintendo Switch you've probably fired up

2969
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
this application and it shows you

2970
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
all the classic games that you can play

2971
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and you can fire up whatever it is that you

2972
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
want and you can play it, so

2973
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
here's what it looks like right now

2974
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I think we're going to talk in tonight's show about some of the other

2975
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
games that are coming soon, you can kind of see generally

2976
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
what it looks like for those of you that don't own a Switch out there

2977
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
you can pick whatever game it is

2978
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
that you want to play and you just pretty much

2979
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
go right into that game and you can hit the ground running

2980
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
and play the game

2981
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
but I want to take a look at the

2982
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Japanese version of this, the Famicom

2983
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
which you can see right off the bat

2984
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
had the very different controllers

2985
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
it was a different system in Japan

2986
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and because it was a different system

2987
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
there was also some different

2988
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
types of peripherals, like they had a

2989
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
disk based system if you weren't already aware

2990
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
you could actually load

2991
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
games based on a disk

2992
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
kind of like computers back in the 80's

2993
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
a lot of disk based stuff

2994
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
well it's very easy since the Nintendo Switch is region free

2995
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
it's very very easy to create a

2996
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Japanese account, you can go online

2997
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
you create an account and just set it's

2998
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
home as Japan somewhere

2999
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
and then you can sign in on your

3000
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Switch with that account and you can go on to the

3001
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
eShop and download this for free

3002
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
and as long as you still have an online subscription

3003
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
for your US account

3004
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
or wherever it is you happen to be

3005
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
it will work, the Japanese

3006
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
stuff will work too because again

3007
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
the Nintendo Switch is region free, it's just most people

3008
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
don't think to make a Japanese

3009
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
account to go on to the Japanese eShop

3010
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and download this, if you do do that

3011
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I notice sometimes I get

3012
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Japanese news updates and things

3013
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
because I have both accounts on my Switch but

3014
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I don't mind at all actually

3015
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
it's sometimes nice to see things on the other side of the pond

3016
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
so let's fire up the Famicom version

3017
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
of this and you don't have

3018
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
to use, so you'll notice

3019
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
if you have a Japanese account here, you don't have to use

3020
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
the Japanese account, you can just use your regular account

3021
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
in fact that would be the one you would want to use

3022
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
because that's the one that actually

3023
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
is paying for the Switch online service

3024
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
which maybe you got free through the whole Amazon

3025
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
deal lately, I don't know, but you only

3026
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
need that Japanese account

3027
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
to actually download the client from the

3028
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
store, you'll see here, oh the

3029
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Japanese version looks very different because

3030
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
again the boxes in Japan

3031
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
very different and so it looks a little more jigsaw

3032
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
puzzle here because of the fact

3033
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
that all the

3034
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
disks were different sizes and of course

3035
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
there's a lot of special versions, different

3036
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
software as well and all that fun stuff

3037
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and so you can kind of jump in and see some of the

3038
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
big differences, for example let's fire up

3039
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Super Mario USA

3040
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
right, which we all know is Super Mario Bros. 2

3041
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
so it has kind of a different title

3042
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
screen to it, otherwise

3043
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
once you get into the game really it's pretty much the

3044
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
same thing, it's just Super Mario Bros. 2

3045
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
they just had that different screen that

3046
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
went with it, so that one's a little bit like

3047
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
whatever, there's not a lot of differences there

3048
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
of course, one of the big big differences

3049
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
is that Japan has been getting some games

3050
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
that we haven't been getting in the US

3051
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
for example, I don't believe this Yara

3052
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Kung Fu came out in the US

3053
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
at all, this is based on a classic

3054
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
arcade game, a really classic fighting

3055
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
arcade game and yeah you can play

3056
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
this which I don't think is available

3057
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
in the US store at all

3058
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
so, you know by downloading the Japanese

3059
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
client, which again you have access to

3060
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and if you're paying for the US online you can just

3061
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
create a Japanese account and go get it, you can check

3062
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
out this game if you want, that's not

3063
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
the only one

3064
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
however there, you could also get Fire Emblem

3065
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
which I know is a series a lot of people

3066
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
are paying attention to now

3067
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
but the original original was on

3068
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
the NES and so that's what this game

3069
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
is, unfortunately this one's a little

3070
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
harder to play because as you see you're

3071
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
gonna have to know some Japanese

3072
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
in order to kind of make your way around the game

3073
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
but I'm sure there's lots of FAQs

3074
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
online that'll help you get through the game

3075
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
because obviously, you know, people have

3076
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
wanted to play this before so there's

3077
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
fan translations and all that good stuff

3078
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
obviously you can't translate the ROM itself

3079
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
but there's some good text guides and things

3080
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
that can walk you through the game and when in doubt

3081
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I'm sure a lot of YouTubes or other Twitch streamers

3082
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
that are playing the game as well could also

3083
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
help out with things like that, so this bottom option

3084
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
will always take you back out to the main menu

3085
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
also some other interesting differences, Blaster

3086
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Master, completely different game

3087
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
in Japan, so it has like a completely

3088
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
different screen here, Metafight right?

3089
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
When you start the game, so you remember the story

3090
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
in the US is like, oh you're gonna go rescue

3091
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
your frog so you have this, you know

3092
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Sophia, the big

3093
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
car that you're driving through the cave

3094
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
right? You've seen that sequence at the beginning of Blaster Master?

3095
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Yeah, all in Japan? No.

3096
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Different story. It's not a cave.

3097
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It's like this laboratory thing.

3098
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Completely different story going on in that game

3099
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
there, so that's kind of another like

3100
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
little interesting difference. But one of the things

3101
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
that I think gets really interesting is when you get

3102
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
into some of these games that were on the

3103
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Disk System, the Famicom Disk System

3104
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
because some of the sound

3105
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
is slightly different because the

3106
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Famicom Disk System again had that extra

3107
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
sound chip, so the versions

3108
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
that are actually emulated here on

3109
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
the Famicom library are

3110
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
the Disk System versions. So for example

3111
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
let's go to a game that I know everybody

3112
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
knows, so where is it down here? Here we go.

3113
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
The Hyrule Fantasy, right? The Legend of Zelda

3114
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
and you can see that little logo with the little

3115
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
yellow guy there for the Disk System, okay?

3116
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
So that shows you that The Legend of Zelda was

3117
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
a disk game and the way they translated that

3118
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
when this game came out in the US was they

3119
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
used the battery pack, but let's take a look at some of the

3120
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
differences. So

3121
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
it's very subtle

3122
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
but if you can kind of hear the theme music

3123
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
in the background, I'll shut up for a minute.

3124
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Little chimes.

3125
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
There's some extra stuff in it, right?

3126
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Because there was a different sound

3127
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
processing system on the

3128
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Famicom with the Disk System

3129
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
versus the NES. So it sounded like a different

3130
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
font as well that they used in that version.

3131
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So I can just go in real quick here as well.

3132
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I think I already set up a file. Now you have

3133
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
to actually wait. The downside to using

3134
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
the Disk System is it emulates the

3135
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
loading times as well.

3136
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So you have to sit through the loading times

3137
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
to actually get into the game.

3138
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
But once you do,

3139
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
it's pretty much the same game you remember from before.

3140
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
But let me go pick up the sword,

3141
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
okay?

3142
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And it is in Japanese

3143
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
so he doesn't say

3144
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
what he usually says.

3145
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
It's dangerous to go alone, right?

3146
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
But now, listen carefully when I fire the sword

3147
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
because I have the full health.

3148
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Kind of a very

3149
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
different sort of noise it makes there when you fire

3150
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
that off, right? So some subtle

3151
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
differences. Again, at the end

3152
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
of the day, it's pretty much the same game

3153
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
but there are some differences.

3154
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Now, some of these differences on the other

3155
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Disk System games get more so. Like if I

3156
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
were to go over to Metroid,

3157
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
okay, so here's Metroid.

3158
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And again, if you listen

3159
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
very carefully, you can hear an extra kind of

3160
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
bass track in the background

3161
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
music here. But if I actually get into the game,

3162
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
okay, look at this. You don't remember

3163
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
this from the NES version of Metroid

3164
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
because this was

3165
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
on the Disk System so it had a file menu very

3166
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
similar to what you had

3167
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
with The Legend of Zelda because

3168
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Metroid came out first in the US

3169
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
and that was their password

3170
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
pack. That's why there were the silver

3171
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
boxes. This and Kid Icarus

3172
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
were the password pack series. So they

3173
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
used passwords at first to sort

3174
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
of emulate a little bit what they

3175
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
were doing with the

3176
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
sorry, I hit the mic. With the Disk

3177
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Systems before. So if I actually start the game

3178
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
here and it actually, you know, it'll load here a little bit

3179
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
and then

3180
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
you'll hear it. Loading, loading, loading.

3181
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Now loading.

3182
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Lots of loading for these games.

3183
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
That's, again, the downside to the Japanese

3184
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
ones is that you have to actually emulate

3185
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
that disk loading. Here we go.

3186
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I think it'll start here after this.

3187
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
You kind of notice like, kind of like

3188
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
an extra horn noise in there a little bit.

3189
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Probably. Oh, and I actually

3190
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I picked a pile that I actually already played so I can't

3191
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
even go pick up the item now because I've already played this

3192
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
character a little bit. Whoops. That's alright.

3193
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
You can still hear like, some

3194
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
of those subtle differences a little bit.

3195
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And when I get hit, like that little owl noise

3196
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
is slightly, slightly different.

3197
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Newer releases.

3198
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I mentioned Kid Icarus as well

3199
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and I think we'll go there.

3200
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So again,

3201
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
a screen with multiple files

3202
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
just like you'd have in the other

3203
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
disk games so

3204
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
it wants a name but I don't really have

3205
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
one so we'll just give it a fake name there.

3206
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And

3207
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
start the game.

3208
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And

3209
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
all those loading screens.

3210
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
There we go.

3211
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And I think

3212
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
for the most part the audio

3213
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
is very similar in this game.

3214
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But I think when you get

3215
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
hit

3216
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I want to say I noticed

3217
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
a big difference when he, like

3218
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
if you die or whatever. Maybe to do that

3219
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I might have to just do a falling death here.

3220
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Oh, maybe it was the Grim Reaper guy.

3221
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Let me see if I can just run up to him real fast

3222
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
this first level.

3223
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Let's be real, it's not hard to die in Kid Icarus.

3224
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
This game is very hard.

3225
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Some of those games you have to really kind of remember

3226
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
your way through.

3227
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Okay, let's see.

3228
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So there's the harp that turns everybody

3229
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
into hammers.

3230
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Kind of makes a little bit of a different noise instead of just

3231
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
like a tick tock.

3232
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Ooh, I really went the wrong way on that.

3233
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I'm really not supposed to go to the right, that's okay.

3234
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Alright, there's one of the death guys.

3235
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Oh no!

3236
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Did you hear that little extra

3237
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
backing track there? Wow, I wasn't

3238
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
trying to die there, but you know, fail.

3239
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I did it anyway. Alright.

3240
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Anyway, I think that's enough

3241
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
of a tour. A little quick break tonight.

3242
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
But you know, I just thought for those of you that have

3243
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
played Nintendo Switch and maybe haven't played around with it,

3244
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
it's kind of just fun to look at some of the differences

3245
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
between the Japanese releases and the American

3246
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
releases. And again, you know, even though

3247
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
you might be like, well, whatever with the extra sound,

3248
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
you do have some of those extra games.

3249
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And now it's going the other way

3250
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
too with this last month that we had

3251
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
we had the Star

3252
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Tropics release in the U.S. that they didn't get

3253
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
in Japan. So you know what? If you happen

3254
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
to be one of those few Japanese listeners

3255
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
that's participating with Orange Lounge Radio tonight,

3256
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
maybe there's something to go in the other way

3257
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
as well if you want to check out Star Tropics for the first time.

3258
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
So there's that. Anyway,

3259
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
just a little bit of a tour there of the differences

3260
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and I'll be curious if any of you guys

3261
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
check it out this week. Be sure to send me a tweet

3262
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
at MrRobRoberts if you decide

3263
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
oh, this segment kind of

3264
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
inspired you to go into the Famicom

3265
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
library and check some of the things out there.

3266
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
But for now, we will head back to the studio.

3267
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Enjoying that. YYR is like noticing

3268
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
a lot of the differences that I'm pointing out there

3269
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
and talking about maybe making a

3270
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
switch online just

3271
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
to check that out. And Brakeman

3272
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
made some funny comments in our chat at

3273
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Twitch.tv slash OLR going, the music

3274
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I grew up with and loved was

3275
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
watered down. My whole reality has been

3276
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
shattered. Gee, thanks, OLR.

3277
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
It's all perspective. I mean,

3278
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
sure, maybe it was missing some of

3279
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
the tracks there because it had

3280
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
like one less chip or something.

3281
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
But perspective a little bit,

3282
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
those loading times in Metroid

3283
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
were pretty bad and that didn't exist

3284
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
when it was in a cartridge form.

3285
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
There are some pros and cons and

3286
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
like I said, I'd be curious if somebody like

3287
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
AkumaJP or maybe one of our other listeners in

3288
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Japan would be curious about

3289
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
exploring it the other way to see

3290
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
what we always complain about and maybe

3291
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
hear what the watered down audio sounds like or

3292
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
check out StarTropics or some of those things

3293
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I was addressing there in the video.

3294
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Yeah.

3295
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Let's see.

3296
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Other comments in chat here. MetalMayham

3297
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
says, admittedly, I never had Kid Icarus on the nest.

3298
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
It's a hard game, but it's definitely

3299
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
worth playing. It's a fun game.

3300
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
So, Brakeman said that was a really fun segment.

3301
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
OrangeRite says, Joy Mech Fight

3302
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
is worth the time to make the Japanese

3303
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
account alone. Yeah, why not? I mean,

3304
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
part of the reason I want to highlight that is

3305
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I know I always talk about it, but like, those of you that

3306
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
are already subscribing to Switch Online, which is

3307
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
a ton of people at this point with the Twitch Prime

3308
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
add-on now, you know, you

3309
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
can go peek at some of those differences. Again,

3310
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
it kind of takes a special type of gaming

3311
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
nerd to appreciate a lot of those differences. I think

3312
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
for the most part, they're all going to be very subtle and you'll just

3313
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
be like, oh, there's really the same game.

3314
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But there's at least those couple extra games, like Joy Mech

3315
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Fight and so on. So, anyway,

3316
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
all that being said, I think we

3317
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
will get back into some

3318
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
news and our show and the rest of what we got

3319
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
to talk about tonight. So, let's do some rapid

3320
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
fire news. Loki, I believe, starting

3321
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
us off. There's some ridiculous stuff that you'll

3322
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
find out there on the internet, including

3323
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
screenshots, or I should say a

3324
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
photographs of Gabe Newell

3325
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
in China,

3326
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
pimping out

3327
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
some underwear. Well, apparently

3328
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
some Chinese company that sells underwear

3329
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
has used his likeness

3330
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
on the cover of these

3331
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
packages, and it's funny because

3332
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
You know, when I think of underwear model,

3333
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I don't always think of Gabe Newell,

3334
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
but I appreciate that we're being

3335
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
body positive and featuring all sorts of

3336
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
different, except the picture is him fully

3337
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
clothed, to be clear.

3338
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
The picture is Gabe Newell

3339
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
fully clothed. He's wearing a bra on his head,

3340
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
like Travis, being Queen

3341
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Amidala.

3342
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
No, no, none of that. Are they selling

3343
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
boxers or briefs? That's the important question.

3344
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Apparently, they appear to be

3345
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
boxer briefs. Broccoli?

3346
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
No, boxer briefs.

3347
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Although, the way

3348
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
they actually have it listed, it's

3349
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
large brief.

3350
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
It's 5XL.

3351
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Oh, okay.

3352
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That's just probably the box the person picked up.

3353
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
So, alright.

3354
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Interesting. Congrats, Gabe Newell,

3355
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
CEO, underwear model.

3356
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
But are they three-packs

3357
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
is what I have to see. It's only a two-pack.

3358
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Oh, okay. Can't get to the

3359
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
three-pack. No.

3360
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Apparently, so, yeah.

3361
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
At least they respect that part of the

3362
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Newell. I'm so glad we talk

3363
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
about such important elements of GameCo.

3364
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I'm so glad for all the stories we bumped tonight so we

3365
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
could cover that one. Hey, you know what?

3366
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Can you not get enough of Hideo

3367
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Kojima? Well, guess what?

3368
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Soon, you'll be able to get him in other

3369
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
mediums as well, including

3370
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
a brand new show that's gonna be

3371
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
on Prime Video. So,

3372
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Hideo Kojima has apparently

3373
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
a cameo in

3374
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
this new crime series. It's coming out

3375
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Too Old to Die Young.

3376
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And he's actually featured in the

3377
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
trailer very

3378
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
extremely briefly.

3379
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But you can check it out.

3380
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
And it looks

3381
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
interesting. I don't know what the series is about

3382
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
but it's

3383
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
the music

3384
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
they have the retro

3385
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
was it like the

3386
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
retro waves music in the actual

3387
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
series? Plus it just kind of

3388
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I don't know, very dark and stylistic

3389
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
so it looks neat. And that

3390
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
seems like something that he would get himself

3391
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
involved in. So

3392
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
check it out since I have Prime

3393
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Video and I don't use it for anything.

3394
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Alright. Get on it.

3395
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Alright. Moving on

3396
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
April Fools was this past week

3397
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
which, you know, I'm kind of over

3398
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
all the dumb things people do on that day.

3399
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But once in a while, like video games

3400
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
will put out like a little extra thing for

3401
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
April Fools Day that ends up being like a permanent thing.

3402
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
For example, I talked earlier in the show, Beat Saber

3403
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
had that crab song and that's like there

3404
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
now. Yeah, a full time thing. Well,

3405
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
also, here's another one. So if you're a Rage 2

3406
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
player, then they

3407
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
unleashed a new announcer pack

3408
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
featuring Tim Kitsrow

3409
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
who is the announcer from NBA

3410
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Jam and NFL Blitz.

3411
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
So if you want the guy from downtown

3412
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
if you want that in

3413
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Rage 2, yes, that is

3414
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
really something that is available.

3415
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
If you pre-order Rage 2, you

3416
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
get the He's On Fire cheat code

3417
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
DLC pack.

3418
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And that will have the commentary for

3419
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
the actions that you perform in the game.

3420
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
It looked hilarious. Yeah, it looked hilarious

3421
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
in the trailer. And that's a real thing.

3422
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
So I like it when the April Fools jokes are

3423
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
like legit, like actual things

3424
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
that are just, they're just stupid and you turn them on

3425
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
in office as you need to.

3426
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Now y'all know I love me some Civilization 6

3427
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
right? In the Civilization series.

3428
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I think this is really cool is that

3429
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
now if you link your 2K

3430
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
account, you can actually

3431
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
play Civilization 6 with cross

3432
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
save support. So you can

3433
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
start a game on the PC,

3434
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
save it, and pick it up on the Switch.

3435
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Cool. Pretty cool. Yeah.

3436
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Cross save as opposed

3437
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
to just like a cross play type of thing.

3438
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
So that's pretty neat. So anyway, that was a recent update

3439
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
that just came out. No April Fools joke there.

3440
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Where you can save a game

3441
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
on the PC and you can pick it up on the

3442
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Switch. Again, you have to have a 2K

3443
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
account to basically

3444
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
facilitate the cross save. So

3445
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
yeah, yet another game company account

3446
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
you get to make. Woohoo. But that's kind of

3447
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
a neat thing there. So do remember that

3448
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
the original, or excuse me, the Switch

3449
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
version of Civ 6 is the original

3450
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
with no expansions.

3451
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
So keep that in mind for your Civ 6

3452
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
game. That's an important thing is that if you have

3453
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
a Civ 6 game with all the expansions

3454
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
oops, you can't actually transfer that file.

3455
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
So do keep that in mind

3456
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
with this. But I think that's pretty cool.

3457
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
It's kind of one of those things that like now they announced

3458
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
and I'm like, oh, that really should have been there

3459
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
the whole time. How about that?

3460
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

3461
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Well coming out is going to be

3462
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Konami's Arcade Archives

3463
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
series.

3464
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And the game that's going to be added to that is

3465
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Time Pilot. That's going to be coming

3466
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
out on April 11th, 2019.

3467
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Basically you go through time rescuing other

3468
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
pilots. Apparently in 2001 we were supposed to have UFOs.

3469
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I love Time Pilot.

3470
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But it is actually saying it's going

3471
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
to be the first of their classic

3472
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
arcade titles to join that. So that's pretty cool.

3473
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
It'll be on PS4

3474
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
and Switch in Japan on April 11th.

3475
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It will be 823 yen.

3476
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
A game that was

3477
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
prominently featured on

3478
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Nick Arcade.

3479
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I was going to say StarCade.

3480
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
StarCade had this game all the time.

3481
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Anyway, also the game

3482
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Power Rangers Battle for the Grid

3483
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
is going to have some free DLC characters

3484
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
and more content.

3485
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Enway has revealed

3486
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
three characters coming out.

3487
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
That's going to be Dragon Armor Trini

3488
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
rest in peace.

3489
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Udonna and

3490
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Cenozoic Blue Ranger

3491
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
are going to be out with no other

3492
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
cost and that they are

3493
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
hard at work on packing more content

3494
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
into the game.

3495
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
They are giving the

3496
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
fans what they want. All six of them.

3497
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
There's more fans than that.

3498
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Alright.

3499
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Well go go Power Rangers.

3500
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I heard what you did there.

3501
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I know. It was intentional. Let's travel around

3502
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
the world and check out some games that are coming out

3503
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
real soon starting in the US.

3504
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
We have a few things this week.

3505
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy

3506
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
on PC, the Nintendo Switch,

3507
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

3508
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
We have Shovel Knight

3509
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Showdown on PC,

3510
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Mac, and Linux.

3511
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Wii U, Nintendo Switch,

3512
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

3513
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Zanki Zero

3514
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Last Beginning on PC

3515
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and PlayStation 4.

3516
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Earth Defense Force Iron Rain on

3517
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
PlayStation 4.

3518
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 4

3519
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
VR Kit is coming out this week

3520
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
on the Switch. And last but not least

3521
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Konami Arcade Classics

3522
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
PC, Switch, PlayStation 4,

3523
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
and Xbox One.

3524
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Which if I'm not mistaken has Time Pilot

3525
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
in it as well. So it's a little weird

3526
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
that Arcade Archives is doing one for 8 bucks

3527
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
when it's part of a collection that's going to be

3528
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
20 bucks. So this is a little weird

3529
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
but okay.

3530
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
You gotta choose how you want to consume your

3531
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Time Pilot I suppose.

3532
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So I'm traveling over to Japan. It's a little bit lighter in Japan

3533
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
this week. I don't know if that's because gold weeks

3534
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
at the end of the month or some of those budget things

3535
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
that Loki talked about in the last episode. Who knows

3536
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
maybe all of that coming into play. But the only release

3537
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
really on the PlayStation 4 this week is

3538
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
V-Rally 4 that is out on April

3539
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
11th. Over on the Nintendo

3540
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Switch, oh a little bit a bigger deal

3541
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
on the Switch. Not only is V-Rally 4 also

3542
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
out on the Switch, but the Final Fantasy

3543
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
X and X-2 HD Remaster

3544
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
hits the Switch on April 11th.

3545
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So that's kind of a big deal. So that is happening

3546
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
this week as well. But that's

3547
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
really it as far as like big notable releases go.

3548
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Dark Sakura, what about the UK? Two things

3549
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
on the 8th.

3550
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Dangerous Driving and

3551
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Zanki Zero Last

3552
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Beginning. That's

3553
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
it.

3554
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Alright I think Dangerous Driving was

3555
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
supposed to be coming out here too but I must have missed

3556
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
out on the list. But it is. Okay.

3557
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
It's Burnout Paradise or it's basically

3558
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Burnout. Yes but the

3559
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
team kind of doing a new game right? Yeah.

3560
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
It's basically Burnout.

3561
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It's like yeah. Burnout Take Down

3562
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
basically but not. That team is

3563
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
in the UK so maybe it is coming out there first.

3564
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Right. Yeah so maybe they do get it first

3565
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
for a change. Who knows.

3566
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Anyway. The

3567
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Final Fantasy X stuff won't be out until next week.

3568
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Yeah it's Japan's getting it

3569
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
first. That sometimes happens. Of course.

3570
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Alright. Well I mean honestly.

3571
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I mean what can they do for us?

3572
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
If you really

3573
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
wanted to play those remasters right now

3574
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
it's out on Playstation 4 and PC.

3575
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
It's just the Switch versions you have to wait on.

3576
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Anyway. Alright.

3577
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Let's go to the mail bag

3578
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
because every week you guys send us

3579
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
emails at participate at

3580
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
orangelandradio.com

3581
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
and why are you laughing?

3582
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Because there's nothing in there. There's no email.

3583
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Nobody sent us any emails to participate.

3584
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Someone trying to scam us did.

3585
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Those don't count. Spam emails don't count. I deleted it

3586
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
and bypassed the trash. So participate

3587
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
at orangelandradio.com if you

3588
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
want to send us an email in a future week but

3589
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
since y'all didn't send us emails you know what that means.

3590
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Fuck off. No.

3591
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It means I get to have an excuse to

3592
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
talk to Dark Soccer about Drag Race.

3593
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Season 11. So.

3594
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I need to watch the last episode but it's already been spoiled

3595
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
for me in the most delightful of manners. Well you don't have to

3596
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
spoil it here but who are you rooting for on

3597
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Drag Race Season 11? I'm rooting for that

3598
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
little romance budding between Miss

3599
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Vanjie and Brooklyn

3600
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Heights. Even straight

3601
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
people know Miss Vanjie. Even

3602
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
straight people do.

3603
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
That was the most meme-able thing that's ever come out of

3604
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
the show. I'm actually

3605
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Evie Oddly is my top favorite.

3606
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
My second favorite would be

3607
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Brooklyn Heights.

3608
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
And my third favorite is actually

3609
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
kind of a tie between Miss Vanjie just

3610
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
because I love her. I mean I love

3611
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
her terrible. Get these cookies!

3612
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Yeah. And I love her talking.

3613
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And Nina West.

3614
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Yeah I love Nina West. I like

3615
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
the campy queens. Yeah I love the campy queens.

3616
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
My favorite is Evie Oddly for sure.

3617
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I think she's going to go all the way to the end.

3618
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Nina West I really like too.

3619
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
She's going to be here locally in a couple weeks. I kind of want to go

3620
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
see that show. I think it'll be a lot of fun.

3621
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Yeah I'm like you. I love a campy queen.

3622
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
But as far as like a glamour queen goes I think

3623
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Acuria Chanel Davenport

3624
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
has been bringing a lot of great stuff to the runway. I do

3625
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
but I really like Plastique Tiara

3626
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
and I would like to have another Asian queen

3627
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
somewhere in the top. Yeah.

3628
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I mean that isn't you know the

3629
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
an

3630
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
imitatable uh

3631
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Raja. And not this bitch on

3632
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
this season. Oh yeah.

3633
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Her. Her. Her and Silky

3634
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
can go fuck right off. The other one I wanted to

3635
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
fuck off is gone. What did you say is in town tonight?

3636
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Somebody's downtown tonight from the show.

3637
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
He said. I lost it because it was

3638
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
on my Facebook. Oh

3639
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
it was I remember it was Trinity. It's not even from the

3640
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
season. Yeah Trinity the Tuck. Your current

3641
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
one of your current fucking half

3642
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
reigning. One of our local queens

3643
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
is um performing with her. Oh fun!

3644
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
That's good. Support your local queens.

3645
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I want to tell everyone right now I'm going to

3646
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
give one more shout out and this is to

3647
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
a Facebook page

3648
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
that everyone must follow.

3649
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
It's called Possum Core.

3650
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Okay. And it's nothing but adorable

3651
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
little freaking possums.

3652
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Alright well moving away from the mail

3653
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
bag saying. Possums! I

3654
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
did neglect to ask you because you're talking about

3655
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
plugs. Did you have a podcast you want to plug this week?

3656
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Um. I guess we can do that here too.

3657
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Game Buoy.

3658
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Heck yeah. Game Buoy.

3659
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Our pals at Game Buoy. I'm trying

3660
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
to do like non-vogue ones but

3661
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
no one gave me a submission this week. The girl

3662
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
can't help it. And they just came back. They just came back

3663
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
from a hiatus. Welcome back. Welcome

3664
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Buoyak. Yeah. Game

3665
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Buoyak. Keep us afloat.

3666
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Aye aye.

3667
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
We don't want to you know

3668
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Other nautical terms. Yes.

3669
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Will you be our star to guide us in the

3670
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
gaming news

3671
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
realm with opinions. Possums!

3672
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Yes. We don't want to sink

3673
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
by not knowing

3674
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
all the gaming news that's not on our

3675
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
radar. Dude I am posting this freaking adorable possum in chat.

3676
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Alright. Anyway. Let's move

3677
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
on. Alright. Back to gaming news. And

3678
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Loki what do you want to talk about in gaming news tonight?

3679
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
So I just mentioned during

3680
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
our release dates that the VR

3681
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Joy-Con set is coming

3682
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
out for Labo.

3683
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
And to go along with that they

3684
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
released a video this week announcing that

3685
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
hey not only are you going to be able to use the stuff

3686
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
that's in those sets with

3687
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
this but you'll be able to use the VR

3688
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
goggles that you create with it

3689
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
with other games. So

3690
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
on April

3691
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
25th they're going to

3692
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
add support to

3693
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Super Mario Odyssey and

3694
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Zelda Breath of the Wild.

3695
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
So the way this is going to work in Mario

3696
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Odyssey you're going to have a few different

3697
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
levels or mini challenges

3698
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
they call them. Where

3699
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
basically it's all in 3D but you're kind of

3700
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
watching from like a

3701
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
kind of a fixed camera type thing.

3702
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
So you're going to do that.

3703
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
So they're just videos basically?

3704
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
No you actually play it. Oh you're playing it

3705
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
but it's a fixed camera. Yeah so it's like a fixed

3706
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
camera type thing. Gotcha. But then

3707
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
in Breath of the Wild though it's actually

3708
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
going to be full on like

3709
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
a VR first

3710
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
person view I guess. Or

3711
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
VR support

3712
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
throughout the entire game except for the pre-rendered

3713
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
cutscenes which won't be in VR.

3714
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
But apparently you'll

3715
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
be able to turn that option

3716
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
or turn that on in the options menu

3717
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
to get full VR support

3718
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
for the game. I can't imagine playing through

3719
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
that entire game in VR though especially because there's no

3720
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
there's no way to strap it to your head. You have to hold

3721
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
it. There is not a way to

3722
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
strap it to your head. You have to basically hold

3723
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
it up because it's

3724
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
basically just the

3725
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
the actual switch

3726
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
just inside some cardboard and you have to hold it up

3727
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
because it's weighted. So you

3728
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
can't really strap it to your head because it'd be pretty damn

3729
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
uncomfortable.

3730
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
It's not exactly well thought

3731
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
out for like playing a long game

3732
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
like that but I can see the Mario

3733
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
thing is a neat idea. It's a cute novelty.

3734
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
It is a cute novelty

3735
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
but yeah it'd be nice if they had straps to actually

3736
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
strap it to your head but

3737
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I can't see how that would be comfortable

3738
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
in any way being that it is just a piece of cardboard.

3739
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
You have to like not only hold it up but like

3740
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
the joy cons are there too because and Bobby's

3741
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
pointing out it tracks your head movement that way

3742
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
you have to control it up here.

3743
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Yeah you're holding it like this.

3744
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It doesn't sound comfortable at all.

3745
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
It's going to be very uncomfortable.

3746
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
That's the type of thing where it's like I will give that three minutes

3747
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
max and then I'll be over it.

3748
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'll play the Mario Odyssey levels

3749
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Yeah the Mario Odyssey one looks good.

3750
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
It'll be very short but

3751
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It's like I'll turn it on just to see

3752
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Hyrule in VR. Ooh that's neat.

3753
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Okay done.

3754
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
That's about all I would be able to tolerate of that as well.

3755
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
For sure.

3756
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Well I want the full report

3757
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
next week on the VR thing.

3758
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Yeah well I'm putting together the robot

3759
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
one now so I mean that'll be fun.

3760
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
But yeah the VR one is

3761
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
coming on Friday when it releases

3762
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
because I ordered it through Amazon.

3763
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I want to know all the details on that so

3764
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
alright. Well moving on let's talk about

3765
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
you know for VR beginning

3766
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
something else is ending

3767
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
sort of. Starlink is

3768
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
going away a little bit. Well obviously

3769
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
they can't like shut down the game. If you've already

3770
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
bought the game you obviously can still

3771
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
play it however

3772
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Ubisoft has mentioned no more physical toys

3773
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
will be made for the game so

3774
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
the toys to life things. They were clearing that shit out at

3775
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Target a few weeks ago.

3776
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Yeah and honestly like

3777
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Nintendo kind of treated this like it was

3778
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
a Star Fox game so I kind of forgot

3779
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
it was a toys to life

3780
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
game I just kind of thought it was a

3781
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
oh somebody like made

3782
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
put Star Fox in a not Star Fox

3783
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
game and now it's sort of Star Fox. I can't believe it's not

3784
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Star Fox. It's just yeah I don't know

3785
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
it's a neat idea but

3786
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
eh. Now to be clear

3787
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
the game is still being supported because

3788
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
pilots, spaceships, weapons there's going to be a

3789
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
spring update that's going to add more of that but it's

3790
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
all digital which maybe

3791
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
some people are going to enjoy is that it seems like all

3792
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
these things they had planned for future toys

3793
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
eh. Well that's you know

3794
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
funny enough that you mentioned that because that's actually how

3795
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
they treated the PC version of

3796
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Disney

3797
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Infinity was it was all digital

3798
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
you had cards you could put codes in you get

3799
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
like with the actual well originally I think it was the

3800
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
mobile they had a mobile game too I think

3801
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
so you put in codes that came with the actual

3802
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
characters to unlock

3803
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
the digital ones but of course you know

3804
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
now there's ways to you know cheat

3805
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
that but it was all

3806
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
now I think if you buy the games it just comes

3807
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
with all of the characters that they had released

3808
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
with that so

3809
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I don't know that's the only bad thing about those toys

3810
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
to life stuff is like

3811
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
eh. It's

3812
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
it has to be really something

3813
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
you want to collect because those things are

3814
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
pretty big like the Arwing thing I could see

3815
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
that would be pretty cool for someone to put on a shelf

3816
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
but like all the other things

3817
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I don't know that's a bit

3818
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
much. Alright

3819
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
now the company did make a statement

3820
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
the developers of the game made a statement

3821
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
you don't usually hear them be very frank about what's

3822
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
going on but the statement says despite

3823
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
the immense and continuous support from our players

3824
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
the sales for Starlink Battle for Atlas

3825
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
fell below expectations

3826
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
consequently we recently made the decision

3827
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
to not release any additional physical toys

3828
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
for the spring update and in the future

3829
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
not often you hear a company being very upfront

3830
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
where it's like well didn't sell enough of them

3831
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
so the end

3832
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
so it's kind of a sad reality

3833
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I guess so that's what happens when you guys

3834
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
try to jump into the toy toys

3835
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
life stuff too late in the game I mean

3836
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
come on it'll be so up to you

3837
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
maybe it'll work a little better for him digitally

3838
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
we'll see but I

3839
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
still need to play the game myself just because I

3840
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
was curious about the whole Star Fox

3841
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
you know obviously I would play on the Switch so I could see all that

3842
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
go check out the clearance stuff

3843
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
because those games I think were

3844
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
the toys themselves were like five bucks

3845
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
so like a big thing and I was like

3846
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
maybe I should get some of these and I'm like I'm never going to play this

3847
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
why am I going to buy this stuff

3848
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
alright moving on Dark Sakura what do you have for us

3849
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I got some stuff

3850
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
so Jackbox Party Pack

3851
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
6

3852
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
is coming in Q4 2019

3853
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
but at any rate

3854
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
they did

3855
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
something kind of different

3856
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
they do

3857
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
we know that it's going to be called

3858
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
trivia murder party minigame

3859
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
from 2016

3860
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
it's going to be returning

3861
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
and that it's going to give us five games

3862
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
per collection and maybe four more

3863
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
and one with a new concept

3864
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
so

3865
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
at any rate it also did like a

3866
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
really weird kind of

3867
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
trailer with people wearing sheets

3868
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
in a forest labeled ghosts

3869
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
like what is this

3870
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
it's going to

3871
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
at any rate be

3872
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
PC, PS4, Xbox One

3873
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Switch and Apple TV and iPad

3874
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
so

3875
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
hopefully it'll be

3876
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
pretty good

3877
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
we'll see

3878
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I don't know do you think you're going to

3879
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
begin to this one?

3880
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I haven't gotten any of the other Jackbox games

3881
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
although didn't they give one away

3882
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I think Epic Store had one

3883
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
for free didn't they?

3884
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I don't remember

3885
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm trying to look at this weird

3886
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I don't have enough friends to play those with

3887
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
so that's the problem

3888
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
oh you have at least three

3889
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
not that they want to play with me anytime

3890
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
oh no

3891
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I do have the Jackbox Party Pack

3892
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I grabbed that

3893
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
it was one of the free Epic games

3894
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
that they had on there

3895
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I did get that

3896
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
by the way The Witness is free right now

3897
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
so check that out

3898
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
well at any rate

3899
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I don't know if the weird

3900
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
trailer is enough

3901
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
it's kind of like people are banking in

3902
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
on this kind of

3903
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
oddity related

3904
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I don't know Trivia Murder Party was awesome

3905
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
so I'm down for a sequel

3906
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
but I wonder what type of new theme they're going to be able to do

3907
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
what was the t-shirt one that they had

3908
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I don't remember

3909
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I don't really play a whole bunch of it myself

3910
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I just remember the last time I played it

3911
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
was over at a Halloween party

3912
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
well

3913
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
well at any rate

3914
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
sometime later in the year

3915
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
we're going to have it

3916
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
so we will see it when we see it

3917
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
sounds awesome

3918
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
anything else?

3919
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
so we're having a microphone issue

3920
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and I can't tell which mic it is

3921
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
it's all of the mics

3922
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
they're all bad

3923
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I'm terrible

3924
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Radio Shack Ghosts

3925
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
well we didn't get these from Radio Shack did we?

3926
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
well it's still Radio Shack Ghosts

3927
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
you know Dan worked for Radio Shack

3928
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
and did he confirm that it's full of ghosts?

3929
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
no

3930
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I think the ghosts were like possessing

3931
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
but they used to play like the

3932
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
chill station from

3933
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
on Sirius

3934
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
so every time I go in

3935
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Loki's unplugged for a minute I want to see if the chat says it's Loki's mic

3936
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I'm trying to diagnose which mic is having the issues

3937
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I don't need a mic

3938
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I talk loud enough to be picked up by all of them

3939
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and it's please

3940
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
says I think it's Loki's mic

3941
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
interesting so they say they keep hearing static

3942
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
on their end

3943
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
it's live radio

3944
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
these things happen

3945
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
it is not the Mac Mini

3946
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
so I'm curious

3947
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
if they're saying it's gone away

3948
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
has it gone away at this point?

3949
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
because I just unplugged Loki so if it's Loki's mic

3950
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
the noise should have gone away

3951
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
it's gone away so it's Loki's mic

3952
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
don't make me sing

3953
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I'm going to sub his mic out for another chord real quick

3954
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
well Loki's got a story to do

3955
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
well nobody has a hot mic but you

3956
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I do

3957
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
so this is the Dark Sakura Hour

3958
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
and I'm going to go ahead and do my story for reasons

3959
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
well I don't have another story

3960
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
so I'm going to think of a story

3961
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
and yesterday

3962
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
you know that Burrito Week

3963
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
National Burrito Day was last week

3964
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and Dan and I went out and got burritos

3965
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
at Freebirds

3966
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
and I ended up being

3967
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
it was super good but they had

3968
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
that alternate

3969
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
meat thing, Rob, I'm just going to read your story

3970
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
because fuck it

3971
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
okay

3972
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Rob's story is this

3973
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
there is a working Mario maker

3974
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
inside LittleBigPlanet 3

3975
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
apparently

3976
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
players in LittleBigPlanet 3

3977
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
have

3978
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
basically made their own version

3979
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
it's so weird

3980
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
because it looks actually completely right

3981
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
so they can do

3982
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
blocks, pipes, coins and elements

3983
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
of Super Mario Brothers

3984
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
it's not

3985
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
and someone actually tried to recreate

3986
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
the level

3987
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
so they did the demo

3988
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
of Super Mario Maker running in

3989
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
LittleBigPlanet and it actually looks

3990
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
pretty legit, I mean

3991
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
some of the stuff is a little different

3992
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
this is actually kind of

3993
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
kind of cool

3994
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
well it's amazing what they can do with LittleBigPlanet 3

3995
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
and so I can only imagine what we're going to be able to do

3996
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
when we actually get

3997
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
he's actually talking quietly

3998
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
so I'm impressed

3999
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
different

4000
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
different cable

4001
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
same story

4002
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
talking

4003
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
talking in the yellow

4004
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
so yeah it would be interesting to see

4005
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
what actually is going to happen when Dreams comes out

4006
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
because you can do a ton more stuff in Dreams

4007
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
than you can in LittleBigPlanet 3

4008
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
so I'm very curious to see what they

4009
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
can do with that full on Mario Maker

4010
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
in that one

4011
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
but it looked neat, it's pretty impressive

4012
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 3

4013
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
even though we got it free

4014
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
even though you cosplayed Sackboy

4015
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
that was a long time ago

4016
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
in a galaxy far far away

4017
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
namely Rob's Old House

4018
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
ok so live fixing

4019
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
on the air, apparently I

4020
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
tech supported the issue, the chat is happy

4021
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
don't know you'll piss off

4022
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
the electronics union Rob

4023
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
like Bobby says

4024
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
alright anyway

4025
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
let's try to move back and talk about

4026
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
the Loki story that we missed tonight

4027
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
so there's one more we were going to do there

4028
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
so unfortunately

4029
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
speedrun.com has

4030
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
had to revert their rankings

4031
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
back to their April 1st date

4032
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
because apparently

4033
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
they had a security breach

4034
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
which left many of the

4035
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
leaderboards at risk of tampering

4036
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
and so because of that

4037
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
they had to roll back their data

4038
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
and so unfortunately some of

4039
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
these records that people may have set

4040
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
have been

4041
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
removed, so they said

4042
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
about 3 to 5

4043
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
counts moderating

4044
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
prominent boards

4045
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
were compromised and this

4046
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
cause is still

4047
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
understood to be only a few

4048
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
users using

4049
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
or reusing passwords that were compromised from

4050
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
other sites years ago

4051
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
and so because of that

4052
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
they had to unfortunately roll back their

4053
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
database

4054
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
so that sucks

4055
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
that's why you need these unique

4056
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
strong and unique

4057
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
strong passwords, symbols

4058
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
and record your shit

4059
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
yes

4060
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
alright

4061
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
the video cassette recorder

4062
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
like they had to do in the days

4063
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
of Donkey Kong

4064
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
alright well this is, sorry

4065
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
it's been a little awkward trying to get to the end here

4066
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
with all the sound issues but we're finally all worked out

4067
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I think this is going to come a point

4068
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
when I have money

4069
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
that I'm just going to

4070
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
all new mics, all new cords

4071
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
why not, we got a new mixing board

4072
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
these mics were

4073
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
graciously donated by Brad

4074
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
from Pod Culture but that was a few years

4075
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
ago at this point so I think our system

4076
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
might have just kind of lived its life

4077
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
so we might have to end up getting some new stuff

4078
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
we'll see very soon

4079
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
anyway

4080
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
let's get to our listener

4081
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
round table, so we're actually going to

4082
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
open up our Discord server

4083
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
if you want to join the green room over on

4084
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Discord at the VOG Network Discord

4085
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
which is vognetwork.com slash Discord

4086
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
we're going to be taking some calls here

4087
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
or if you have a question on chat

4088
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
or something you want to ask you can ask

4089
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
away in chat, while I get that all set up

4090
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
is there anything that you

4091
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
want to add here for Last Minute Stories

4092
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Loki?

4093
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I don't

4094
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
have anything

4095
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
other than I have to say

4096
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
one thing I didn't mention as part of my gaming week

4097
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
the whole Labo thing

4098
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
one of the things I like the best about

4099
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
the Labo software right now

4100
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
is the music in those

4101
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
building menus, it's fantastic

4102
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
it's some really

4103
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
really

4104
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
energetic

4105
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
kind of jazzy tunes that they've got going on

4106
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
there, so I really like the menu

4107
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
that's like Wii U or Wii

4108
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Shop music type stuff

4109
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
really, really good stuff

4110
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I dig that and also just like

4111
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
some of the joking around

4112
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
because a lot of the stuff you have to do the same shit over and over

4113
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
now look, isn't that

4114
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
relaxing to fold these creases

4115
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
and stuff like that

4116
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
it's kind of

4117
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I got a humor to it, like I really wanted my kids

4118
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I really wanted my kids to

4119
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
put this shit together, but they didn't want to

4120
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
do any of it, so I'm like

4121
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
do it, do it, do it, is it done yet?

4122
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I'm like, I just opened the box

4123
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
it's not done yet, you see the stack of

4124
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
cardboard here, Jesus Christ

4125
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
alright, I know

4126
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
we got one person waiting in the green room

4127
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
so let's get to it, hello, you are on

4128
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?

4129
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Yeah, this is Metal Mayhem

4130
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Hey Metal Mayhem, what's on your mind buddy?

4131
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
No, hold on

4132
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
just a very broad topic

4133
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
for you guys tonight

4134
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
seeing as that we're

4135
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
all pretty much with the

4136
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
same age range

4137
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
within a couple of years and we've been gaming

4138
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
for quite a long time

4139
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I have a

4140
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
general question for

4141
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
the three of you

4142
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
is there

4143
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
even though

4144
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
gaming magazines haven't been around

4145
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
for roughly about ten years

4146
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
give or take, because

4147
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
that kind of killed off

4148
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
gaming mags for better

4149
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
or for worse

4150
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
have there been any

4151
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
in the past

4152
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
that you

4153
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
bought on a

4154
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
regular basis

4155
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
either at the newsstand or through subscription

4156
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
so gaming magazines

4157
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
what like gaming magazines were you guys

4158
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
all into, like and what did you actually

4159
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
subscribe to or consume

4160
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
DarkSakura, did you have any magazines

4161
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
that you got on a regular basis?

4162
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Not really, I would just go steal them from the grocery store

4163
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
You stole magazines?

4164
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Yeah, like GamePro and EGM

4165
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Oh my gosh, we have a criminal

4166
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
in our midst

4167
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I admit to it, they can't prove it, just me saying so

4168
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
doesn't mean I actually did it

4169
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
You just said it to look cool, even though stealing

4170
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
is wrong, don't do it

4171
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Don't steal from the magazine rack in your grocery

4172
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
store

4173
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Honestly, I had a subscription

4174
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
in Nintendo Power for a long

4175
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
time, I think I finally let it go when I went off to

4176
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
college, but I had the very first issue in Nintendo Power

4177
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I wish I hadn't thrown it away, I didn't realize

4178
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
how valuable that thing would be

4179
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
But I subscribed to Nintendo Power for a long

4180
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
time, and that was certainly a go-to magazine

4181
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I like EGM, I picked that up a lot

4182
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Honestly, it was the type of thing

4183
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
the grocery store used to have

4184
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
a magazine section, which is where a lot

4185
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
of gaming cards are now, and so like

4186
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
every time we went to the grocery store, I would kind of be able

4187
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
to be like, can I get GamePro?

4188
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So I would kind of like

4189
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
catch up on a video game magazine

4190
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
that way, and so I kind of rotated through

4191
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
all of them. I remember once

4192
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
GamePro had this thing where

4193
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
like, you could be an

4194
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
editor or something, it was like they were gonna

4195
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
have a team of 75 winners

4196
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
that were like editors, and I ended up getting

4197
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
picked, like they sent me a thing that was like

4198
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I got picked, I won the thing because I

4199
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
had to send a little thing in writing or whatever, and then

4200
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
nothing ever came of it

4201
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I never got anything else but the whole

4202
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
congratulations, you got picked to do nothing

4203
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Alright, I guess I get to sit there and look fabulous

4204
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
So there was that

4205
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Because we have

4206
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
no editors here

4207
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
They do nothing

4208
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Yeah, I guess they went under after that

4209
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
To do a throwback, even though it's not necessarily

4210
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
100% video gaming

4211
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I also remember, I was a big Commodore 64

4212
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
enthusiast back in the day

4213
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
because that was the computer that was in my family

4214
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
so I loved those Compute Gazette

4215
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
magazines that you could type the programs

4216
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
in the back and like make your own stuff

4217
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I loved that stuff, and so there was

4218
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
a lot of classic computing magazines I really

4219
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
got into as well, VG&CE

4220
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Video Games Computer Entertainment was another one

4221
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Loadstar

4222
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
was that only a disc thing, or was that

4223
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
actually, I think it was actually a magazine for a short time

4224
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Logie, what about you? What about you and magazines?

4225
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I did subscribe

4226
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
to Nintendo Power

4227
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
and GamePro

4228
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
and then I used to pick

4229
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
up a lot at the stores, especially when I had

4230
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
like, I had

4231
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
my own PC at that time

4232
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
so like my first PC

4233
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I would pick up PC Gamer

4234
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
because they had the discs with like

4235
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
full games in them sometimes

4236
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
and so I would pick those up just for the games

4237
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
and I used

4238
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
to like also some of the import magazines

4239
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
for different

4240
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
things, because usually they had like

4241
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I don't know

4242
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Oh, the official PlayStation magazine

4243
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
OPM, I did subscribe

4244
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
to that as well, also for the demo discs

4245
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
because that was awesome

4246
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Actually, there was a magazine that Dan and I

4247
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
were subscribing to for a while

4248
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
We were subscribing to Retro Gamer

4249
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Oh, and the

4250
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Xbox game magazine, also for the demo discs

4251
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Notice

4252
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
the trend here, demo discs

4253
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
that will get me to subscribe to your magazine

4254
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Demo discs

4255
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
are a good thing. Metal Mayhem, what about you

4256
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
real quick?

4257
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Well, I

4258
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
personally didn't subscribe to it

4259
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
particularly my father did, but

4260
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
my father

4261
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
multi-year subscription to

4262
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Nintendo Power

4263
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
and this is before

4264
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
future publishing

4265
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
or whatever the name of the company is to go over

4266
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
and

4267
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
to a certain extent that

4268
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
magazine was alright, but eventually it kind of

4269
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
dawned on me that, hey

4270
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Nintendo's running this magazine

4271
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
naturally, they're in the business of

4272
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
selling games, they're not going to say, hey

4273
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
our games are crap, don't buy them

4274
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
it's Nintendo Power

4275
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
So, like, eventually

4276
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
It's that moment when you're younger

4277
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
that you realize everything you loved

4278
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
was advertising

4279
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Yeah, so

4280
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
eventually I started going to

4281
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
the magazine

4282
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I also started getting all the magazines

4283
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I initially started getting

4284
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
game foam, which I loved

4285
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and then like

4286
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Loki, I started getting

4287
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
an official

4288
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
PlayStation Magazine once I got

4289
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
a PlayStation 1

4290
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I got that for the demo

4291
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
mostly, but I ended up liking the magazine

4292
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
itself

4293
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
and eventually when I got a 360

4294
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I got an

4295
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
OXM as well for the demo disc

4296
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
and I ended up liking the magazine

4297
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
as well

4298
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Yeah, I used to love those official PlayStation Magazine demo discs

4299
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I think if you still have, I think some of those demo discs

4300
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
are kind of collectibles at this point

4301
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Well, there was some that was pretty awesome

4302
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
like the official Xbox magazine, they actually had

4303
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
DLC for free on there, I remember

4304
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
for Oblivion they had

4305
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
a few Oblivion DLC packs

4306
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
that were free in there, I was like, sweet

4307
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Yeah, it was awesome

4308
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Anyway, Middle Mayhem is a great question

4309
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls

4310
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
but great question, and happy reading

4311
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Alright, have a nice day

4312
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
You too, take care

4313
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
What's kind of cool is they had a demo in one of them

4314
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
for Timeshift, the Atari

4315
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
version of Timeshift because

4316
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
they had changed publishers

4317
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
at one time for that game, so they had

4318
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
a demo that was of a game that never

4319
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
came out, and they released later on

4320
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
another demo for the actual version that came out

4321
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
that was from another publisher altogether

4322
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Alright, well let me

4323
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
go to another call here

4324
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio, who's this?

4325
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Hey, what's going on everybody?

4326
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Hey, Rama, how you doing?

4327
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Not too much, I'm a little stuffed from dinner

4328
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
and getting ready for a brand new work week

4329
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
You know, and I learned tonight, I thought

4330
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
only Bobby and I had privileges to

4331
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
drag and drop people into other channels, but apparently

4332
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
you do too

4333
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And you see, the funny thing is, I didn't

4334
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
even realize, because I

4335
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
barely used Discord on my phone

4336
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
and I'm like, okay, this is it, I didn't

4337
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
realize, so like, wait, why is this locked

4338
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I was like, oh, oh

4339
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
oh, and I was like, my bad,

4340
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Rob, my bad

4341
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So for those that don't know, because you can't see it

4342
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
behind the scenes, you can't see the Discord activity

4343
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
but during that last call with Metal Mayhem

4344
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
like, Rama kept dropping into the channel

4345
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
and I was like, okay, Rama, I get it

4346
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
you want to be on the show, but like, you need to, like

4347
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I don't want background noise coming through, I'm like, you need to go wait

4348
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
like everybody else, you know, and I keep

4349
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
dragging and dropping him back in the channel

4350
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
and then suddenly he disappeared

4351
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
so I don't know if Rama, you dropped off, or Bobby

4352
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
saw what was going on and was like, I'll show him

4353
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
or what

4354
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
No, I realized

4355
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
after the fact that I looked in the room

4356
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I was like, restricted channel, wait, that's not

4357
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
the green room, oh damn, whoops

4358
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Oh, oh, Bobby

4359
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
said he revoked your access

4360
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
what, what, what, it's like you

4361
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
you were in the room and then the sirens started going off

4362
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
woo woo woo

4363
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
intruder alert, intruder alert

4364
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Well, I look at it

4365
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
this way, if something happens

4366
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I have my papers, I'm good

4367
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I know, I know, alright

4368
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
all that joking aside, uh, what's

4369
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
on your mind tonight, buddy?

4370
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Alright, I wanna talk about something in regards to

4371
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
a comment you made last week

4372
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
that I agree with you about

4373
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Okay, good, you agree with me

4374
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
sure, what is that?

4375
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
The 3D Zeldas

4376
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Oh, oh, when I

4377
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
gave my hot take, the Ocarina of Time

4378
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
and stuff, like, you guys, you guys

4379
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
hyped those games up a lot

4380
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I will say

4381
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
this, I got a Nintendo 64

4382
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
just for Ocarina

4383
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
of Time, I saved up my money

4384
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I got the console, I got the

4385
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
game, a few hours into this

4386
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
game, I'm like, what the hell is this?

4387
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I felt like I got ripped

4388
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
off, woo, okay?

4389
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I don't know if I would go

4390
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
that strong with it, but I, I

4391
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
personally, I think Breath of the Wild is the best

4392
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
3D Zelda they've ever made

4393
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
and I don't know if that's just because

4394
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
you know, maybe now I'm kinda more used to 3D

4395
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
games, I've just accepted it as that's where we're

4396
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
at, whereas, you know, when the Nintendo 64

4397
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
was brand new, I was still, you know

4398
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I was kinda like, all these, these polygons are

4399
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
so bulky, they're just like shapes

4400
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
floating out there, and you know, all that type of stuff

4401
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
I mean

4402
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I do enjoy my fair share of 3D

4403
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
games, I just

4404
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I just couldn't get into it, I'm like

4405
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I prefer my top

4406
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
slash 2D Zelda games, now I

4407
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
did play Breath of the Wild, and I did

4408
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
like that, and

4409
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
that game did one thing the other 3D

4410
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
games did not do, it

4411
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
actually mapped the button so Link could

4412
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
jump

4413
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Oh man, yeah

4414
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I, I wish, uh

4415
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
yeah, that, that's uh

4416
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Link being able to jump is important

4417
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah

4418
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I mean, this is a 3D game, he should be able to

4419
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
like jump over, so I'm like, there

4420
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
what do you mean, he can't

4421
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
you know what, forget it

4422
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
forget it, I'm like, nope

4423
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I, I, you know what, I even said

4424
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
you know, I'm gonna give Ocarina

4425
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Time another shot, so I went out

4426
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
and got it on 3DS

4427
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I played it through

4428
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
two hours in, I gave it the Mako

4429
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
shot, I'm like here, you can have this, I don't

4430
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
want it, I will play my 2D

4431
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Zeldas till I can't play them anymore

4432
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
What, what do you think about the whole

4433
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
um, the announcement

4434
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
or well, either the rumor I guess

4435
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
that Legend of Zelda

4436
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Link to the Past might be getting like

4437
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
a 3D style

4438
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
remake in the vein of the Link's

4439
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Awakening remake, uh, what do you think

4440
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
about that, like a 2D game kind of going to that

4441
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
sub 3D type

4442
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
of thing, what do you, what do you make of all that?

4443
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Um, I don't know

4444
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
if you saw my reaction, but when

4445
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Nintendo announced uh, Link's Awakening

4446
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
for the Switch, my,

4447
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I pretty much said, fuck

4448
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I have to get a Switch now, fuck, I have to get a

4449
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Switch now, it's like, there were

4450
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
reasons why I needed, I was gonna get a Switch

4451
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Yeah, um, I, you know, and we were talking

4452
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
earlier about how like the Secret of Mana remake

4453
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
you know, was kind of like a little bit hit and miss

4454
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
but I, I kind of expect a certain quality

4455
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
out of Nintendo, and so I think this

4456
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
um, Link to the, you know, this Link's Awakening

4457
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
for sure, but maybe even Link to the Past

4458
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
is gonna be pretty, pretty

4459
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
cool, it's gonna be up to a certain level, so I'm excited

4460
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
about it

4461
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Alright, for some reason

4462
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I've lost your audio, are you still there with us, Rama?

4463
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Um,

4464
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Okay, if you can hear us, we can't

4465
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
hear you, I don't know if maybe

4466
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Bobby's messing around with some permissions

4467
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
live on air or what, but for some reason

4468
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
we lost you, Rama, but thank you so much for the call

4469
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
uh, and we'll talk to you next time, or everybody

4470
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
should be listening to Anime Jam Session Tuesday night

4471
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
here on the Voice Geeks Network

4472
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Uh, meanwhile, I've got one more person

4473
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
waiting, so let me bring this person in, hopefully this

4474
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
person can talk, hi, you're on Orange Town's

4475
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Radio, who's this?

4476
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Hey, good, oh, we can't hear you

4477
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
So that wasn't me

4478
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
What's up, buddy?

4479
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Hi, how are you?

4480
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Yeah, it's been a while

4481
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Uh, yeah, obviously you've noticed

4482
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I haven't been on like

4483
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
for god knows how long

4484
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Probably more than a year, year and a half

4485
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Everything's good, uh, just settling

4486
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
in to my new digs

4487
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I've been here for over

4488
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
a year now

4489
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I mean, if you see the, yeah

4490
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
I'm finally out of the city, I'm

4491
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
excited about it

4492
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
I'm in Westchester now, so

4493
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
all things, you know, settling

4494
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
in with my fiance and all

4495
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
So, um, yeah, I just

4496
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
uh, went to PAX last weekend

4497
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
How was that?

4498
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Uh, hit or miss

4499
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Mostly, Thursday was probably the least

4500
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
crowded day, I was actually able

4501
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
to go to the show floor most, you know

4502
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
hit up most of the booths, or a good

4503
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
chunk of the booths

4504
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
But it was mostly me just flying

4505
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
and like, you know, just

4506
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
But it was mostly me just flying and like

4507
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
in Thrustmaster's booth

4508
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
because they had DCS World in VR

4509
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And, you know

4510
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
I love flying games, and I

4511
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
won a headset because I shot

4512
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
down, I shot down two

4513
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Russian aircraft on an F-18

4514
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
uh, simulator

4515
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
with their fancy $500 joystick

4516
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Oooh

4517
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
That's like, that reminds me of the time

4518
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
uh, it was years ago, it was when

4519
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Final Fantasy XI was being

4520
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
shown at E3

4521
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
It wasn't new though, it was already out

4522
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Maybe it was the year they were showing on 360, I don't remember

4523
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
It was the first or second year I was ever at E3

4524
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
But anyway, long story short, um, I won

4525
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
some like, I think it was like a Ballista competition

4526
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
or something like the PVTP they were doing

4527
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I won some type of Final Fantasy XI thing, my team of eight

4528
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
and then they spun a wheel to see

4529
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
which person got to pick their prize first

4530
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
and they thought for sure people would pick

4531
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
the Nobuyamatsu CDs first

4532
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
that were signed, but I was like, no

4533
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
they were giving away a full on brand new motherboard

4534
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
you remember that?

4535
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
It was a motherboard processor thing

4536
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
and I got that at E3

4537
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
and that ended up being

4538
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
the show computer later on

4539
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
uh, at some point

4540
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
so it was kind of funny the way that all worked out

4541
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
so anyway

4542
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Yeah, so, I mean, there was a lot of like

4543
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
VR, most of the past couple of years

4544
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
PAX has been mostly VR now

4545
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
like, I don't know if you noticed

4546
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
but a lot of uh

4547
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
just lots of demo boosts

4548
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
especially Facebook

4549
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
you know, and their Oculus

4550
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
their Oculus booths

4551
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
like, literally capped almost every day

4552
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
after Thursday

4553
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I have to admit, I haven't been to PAX

4554
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
in a little while because uh

4555
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
you may have caught some of the shade I was throwing last week

4556
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
but our feathers were ruffled a few years ago

4557
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
and I wasn't super impressed with the show anyway

4558
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
so I just haven't spent the money to go back in a while

4559
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
um, I've been tempted to go to another one

4560
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
but I would be curious to see

4561
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
like, what it would

4562
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
look like, and plus

4563
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
honestly, like, a lot of my money

4564
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
like, a lot of my convention money, I do DragonCon now

4565
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
and I try to get to other, like, smaller conventions

4566
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
so it's just, it's been hard to swing PAX

4567
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
as well on top of all that, but never say never

4568
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Yeah

4569
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I mean, you're not missing much

4570
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
all it is, is just like, it's a lot more

4571
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
like, esports, uh

4572
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
uh, you know, it's a lot more esports related

4573
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
now, like, most of the boosts either

4574
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
whether it's like, you know

4575
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Twitch or Discord, they have

4576
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
boots over there, apparently

4577
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Facebook with, uh, Facebook Live

4578
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
and Oculus, obviously, so it's a lot

4579
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
more, it's a heavy emphasis on

4580
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
esports now, and just streaming

4581
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
So, so it's like

4582
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
So go ahead

4583
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I mean, I haven't gotten to that game yet

4584
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
of whole, of streaming, I know

4585
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
friends of mine who are definitely in that, uh

4586
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
in Twitch, with their own channels and all

4587
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
but, you know

4588
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
that's what I've seen, it's like, either that

4589
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
or TableTop

4590
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Yes, I believe we're doing a Twitch show right now

4591
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Um

4592
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
But anyway, uh

4593
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
So I, I kinda drug you into the conversation

4594
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
about PAX and everything, but is there, is there something

4595
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
you actually wanted to talk about tonight?

4596
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Um, let me see

4597
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Uh, I don't

4598
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Uh, other than, uh

4599
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Try to remember

4600
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Like, I've been reading here and there, like

4601
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I guess most of it is

4602
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
just like, people, you know

4603
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I remember, like

4604
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
out of this whole, uh

4605
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Me Too movement and the fact that actually

4606
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
an incident similar to that happened last weekend

4607
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
in PAX East, where

4608
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
believe it or not, uh

4609
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Magic the Gathering player got, like

4610
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
one of the top players basically got dropped

4611
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
out of the tournament

4612
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
last minute because, uh, a lot of

4613
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
uh, long story short, a lot of things

4614
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
came out about his misogyny

4615
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
and other nasty things

4616
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
about women that he's, uh, the way he's treated

4617
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
them, and so

4618
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Yeah, and that, they didn't want that

4619
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I, I haven't heard a lot of what's going on

4620
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
but it sounds like the company, uh

4621
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
didn't want to take the risk that this individual would win

4622
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
and then some of that

4623
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
is gonna reflect on them

4624
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
because whoever wins that tournament is gonna

4625
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
basically end up being an ambassador for the brand

4626
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
and if there's a lot of these things that could

4627
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
drag that down, you know

4628
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
uh, I can see why the company wants

4629
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
to make sure that doesn't happen

4630
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Right, I mean, that's, that was

4631
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I mean, I get it, like, you know

4632
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
and then recalling, like, other

4633
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I guess nowadays, it's like

4634
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
you know, Twitch is

4635
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
or, or, or just having exposure

4636
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
in general just exposes you

4637
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
you know, it

4638
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
it scrutinizes all your actions that you make

4639
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
like, it, if you were a dick

4640
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
before streaming, then

4641
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
chances are, you're walking on a tight

4642
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
rope, basically

4643
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
with your behavior, unless you change it

4644
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
and, you know, obviously

4645
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
with sponsorships and all

4646
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
it's, you're putting yourself in a

4647
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
precarious position where

4648
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
any action that you may have done behind

4649
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
the scenes before, you know

4650
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
before streaming or becoming a

4651
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
streamer, which I can't even believe that's

4652
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
a profession now, and

4653
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
and it's just like, you

4654
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
you do things, it's your behavior

4655
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
that ends up reflecting poorly

4656
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
like, I don't know if you heard about this one

4657
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
uh, you know, a couple of months back

4658
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
where this streamer was playing Fortnite

4659
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
and he was beating on the, on his

4660
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
uh, I think it was his wife

4661
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
or a significant other, while on the

4662
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
stream, like literally being, like

4663
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
off camera, just like beating the crap

4664
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
out of, you know

4665
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
just because he just, like he was

4666
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
he was getting nagged by her and then he

4667
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
was like, the way he's reacting

4668
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
okay, so that's really gross and not something, I mean

4669
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
it's, that's a gross, gross

4670
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,000
incident, sure

4671
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
yeah, it is, it's bad, it's

4672
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
and it, and the thing is like

4673
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Twitch only gave him a slap on the wrist

4674
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
initially, until people

4675
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
called Twitch out for the fact that

4676
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
he wasn't, his channel

4677
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
wasn't suspended permanently after two weeks

4678
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
well, he also got arrested too

4679
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
yeah, that too

4680
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
but the fact of the matter is that Twitch gave him

4681
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
like, you know, Twitch really

4682
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
gave him a slap on the wrist initially

4683
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
it wasn't until like, you know

4684
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
public pressure

4685
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
you know what's interesting, you know what's interesting is that there was a story

4686
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
this week, and it didn't make our short roll tonight, but it was

4687
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
about something about how like, Mixer

4688
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
is really trying to figure out

4689
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
how can we like, differentiate ourselves

4690
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
from Twitch, and one of the things that

4691
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Mixer is trying to put out there and kind of push

4692
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
is that they want to be very much like an

4693
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
anti-toxicity environment

4694
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
and so they have some different rules

4695
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
and was it, and you know, I, what's interesting

4696
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
is that it would be interesting to see how Twitch

4697
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
might ultimately respond to that, because I don't think

4698
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Twitch necessarily wants to be known as like, we love

4699
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
toxicity, I don't think so, I think it's one

4700
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
of those, you know, maybe, and I don't

4701
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I don't know enough about the situation, I don't want to

4702
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
defend it, or either way, but maybe just Twitch

4703
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
needed a minute to kind of assess like,

4704
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
what do we do, because maybe we haven't been in the situation

4705
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
before, we don't have a clear policy

4706
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
let's hope Twitch has learned from that

4707
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
and on that note, we talk about learning from

4708
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
things, I think that

4709
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
you know, when we talk about what people have done in their

4710
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
past versus what they're doing now

4711
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I think a very important question to ask is

4712
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
you know, we're considering, do we

4713
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
cancel somebody over what they said 10 years

4714
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
ago, and this whole thing, I think you're gonna

4715
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
have to look at a situation like that and go, but it does sound like

4716
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
the person like, wants to do better, are they

4717
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
learning, are they apologizing, do they

4718
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
realize why what they said was shitty

4719
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
and now they're acting

4720
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
differently, or do they

4721
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
show that they don't give a fuck, and

4722
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
that whole type of thing, and I think a lot of that

4723
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
sometimes weighs into

4724
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
how people might respond

4725
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
to a particular situation

4726
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
you know, obviously these issues

4727
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
that you bring up are a way bigger

4728
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
you know, cultural issue than probably something

4729
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
we can really sink into in 3 hours

4730
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
here on OLR, but you know

4731
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
you are correct that we are moving

4732
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
more and more into a time frame

4733
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
where things are

4734
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
documented, so why on

4735
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
earth you'd want to

4736
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
take physical action on your spouse

4737
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
which why on earth you'd want to do that ever

4738
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
is one question, but then to do that

4739
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
in an environment where it's recorded

4740
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
gross, even if it's a

4741
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
joke, not funny, you know

4742
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
it's like, what the hell, you know

4743
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
I mean, if we're getting into the place where more and more

4744
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
things are recorded, you have to kinda

4745
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
make sure you're saying

4746
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
good things, and being a good person

4747
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
and putting positive stuff out there where you can

4748
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
sociopaths don't care

4749
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
well right, there's always gonna be a few bad eggs

4750
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
but you know, I'm just

4751
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I don't know, I don't know, I mean

4752
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
the way I see it is that we're at an age where

4753
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
like, you know

4754
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
probably like, like 10 years

4755
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
ago you didn't have this type of scene

4756
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
where people are making a living off

4757
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
of just streaming and just playing Fortnite

4758
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
for example, and then

4759
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
it brings out the, you know

4760
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
the bad elements, like you have certain

4761
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
individuals who haven't

4762
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
haven't been conditioned

4763
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
to, you know

4764
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
behave in a certain way, or they're

4765
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
basically just assholes inherently

4766
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
and as a result, you see their true colors

4767
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
in the way they obsess over

4768
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
what they're trying to do versus

4769
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
you know, the other things that

4770
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
kind of like, push them

4771
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
to the brink and cause them to act out

4772
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
differently in front of a

4773
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
live studio, you know, live audience

4774
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
from that, and we've, you know, hopefully moved on

4775
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
and at the end of the day, trying to do

4776
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
a positive thing, but anyway

4777
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Zaku is good to hear from you, and I'm glad to

4778
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
hear you had a good time at PAX

4779
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
ish, and I hope to

4780
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
hear from you again, don't be a stranger

4781
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Yup, definitely

4782
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Take care buddy, have a good one

4783
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
You too, bye

4784
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Alright, always good to hear from Zaku

4785
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
here, so going to our

4786
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
chat, let's see

4787
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Oh

4788
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Gosh, that's a really sick story, I don't even want to repeat

4789
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
that story, it's really sick, alright, just what some

4790
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
people do on

4791
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
stream to maybe tug at people's heart

4792
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
strings, and it's sad, because

4793
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
then it like, ruins it for everybody else

4794
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
It's just, blah, anyway

4795
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Alright, well trying to do good things here at Orange

4796
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Lounge Radio, we are the show where every gamer

4797
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
has a voice, you know, as long as you're not

4798
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
being a jerk and hurting

4799
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
other people's feelings and stuff like that, you know, we

4800
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
want positivity at the end of the day

4801
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Doesn't mean we can't be critical of the things

4802
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
we love, like EA insisting

4803
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
on using that Frostbite engine

4804
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
It's a bad decision, it's not

4805
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
you know, we can call

4806
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
that out, but it's all

4807
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
in how you do it and what you say when you do it

4808
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Anyway, hope

4809
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
you guys enjoyed this episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4810
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
and if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge

4811
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Radio, please tell a friend or two

4812
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer

4813
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
has a voice, but

4814
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
you know, we can only share those voices if they're

4815
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
actually here to share with other people

4816
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
So we encourage you to tell a friend

4817
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
or five about the show

4818
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
The hosts on Twitch, like if you put

4819
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
VoG network on your auto host list, that goes a long way

4820
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Really appreciate that type of stuff

4821
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
All the tweets, all that is great, and thank you guys

4822
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
so much for helping to spread the word

4823
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
So I think I'm gonna go around now

4824
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

4825
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?

4826
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
My final thought is

4827
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I'm going to build

4828
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
the Labo thing this week and

4829
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I don't know, I'll

4830
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
try to get my

4831
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
edits to work, that's really what

4832
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
it's been down to, it's like

4833
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
I know how that format works more than

4834
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
probably anybody, and

4835
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
yet it's not working

4836
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
It's frustrating, because it should work

4837
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
It's just not

4838
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
My final thought is

4839
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
sorry for the mic issues, but the joys of live

4840
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
radio and what we do here, thank you guys

4841
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
for participating in our live little radio

4842
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
program, and

4843
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
I can't wait for the Harry Potter

4844
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
game to come out already, Wizards Unite

4845
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
My location-based

4846
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
gaming is ready for one more

4847
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
They haven't said when

4848
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
I'm hoping the summer time, but

4849
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
yeah, and

4850
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Darzaga, last but not least, your final thought

4851
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I'm happy that Star Trek Online plays on a Mac

4852
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
and give me bursters

4853
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Alright, can do

4854
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange on Trado

4855
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Thank you guys again so much for tuning in and participating

4856
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
We will see you back here in 7 days

4857
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network

4858
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
or on the podcast feed

4859
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
However you choose to enjoy this show, thank you so much

4860
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
for being with us, and I hope you all have
