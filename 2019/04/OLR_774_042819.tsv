0	17880	This week, the team behind Rage 2 lean into Walmart Canada's League with some advice
17880	19760	in all its pastel spray-painted glory.
19760	22320	This is just one embargo to turn Lemons into Lemonade.
22320	25320	Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where
25320	28000	every gamer has a voice.
28000	34040	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet
34040	37680	and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37680	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 774, oh, title's wrong on Twitch,
45000	48460	for this April the 28th of 2019.
48460	53300	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio, welcome back to the show this week,
53300	54720	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54720	55720	Oh, hi.
55720	56720	Hello, how are you?
56720	60320	So you had a week off and how did everything go with that?
60320	61700	It was really good.
61700	66960	It was the 40th anniversary for the San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and it was
66960	71920	also our conclave so we had nuns from all over the world.
71920	74400	I had a super fun time hanging out with French nuns.
74400	79440	They were cool and we actually had a satyr for Passover in the middle of Hamburger Mary's.
79440	80440	Oh, that's really cute.
80440	85660	It was a really fast satyr and I had been holding onto the bag of stuff through like
85860	90340	the Pink Moon ritual and all kinds of stuff that was happening and we just had a great
90340	91340	time.
91340	92340	It was really fun.
92340	96100	I didn't go on like some of the big events but I went out for what I could and then I
96100	98820	had my birthday on Friday last week.
98820	99820	Happy birthday.
99820	101100	Thank you.
101100	106380	And I went to the Cherry Blossom Festival and got way overwhelmed with humans but I
106380	113460	went to look at the Paper Doll exhibits and I watched JD play Karta and I ended up kind
113460	118420	of playing a little bit with him over his shoulder just because I could read decently.
118420	123220	And what's funny is that the people there, you can read, I'm like, a bit, a bit, see
123220	124220	that much?
124220	125220	Yeah.
125220	126220	It's enough to squeeze Pikachu's head.
126220	129220	But yeah, it was pretty fun.
129220	130220	We had a good time.
130220	131620	It was great hanging out with JD.
131620	135700	I made good friends with their roommate Connie.
135700	139020	She gave me a Lolita dress that fits me perfectly.
139020	140020	It's beautiful.
140020	141020	How fun.
141020	142680	It's nice to make new friends through friends and all that.
142680	147100	I wore a full Lolita at the park, at Dolores Park.
147100	151440	I mean, in a way, you and I became friends through mutual friends at the time.
151440	154800	So hey, it's a meeting, meeting friends through friends is the best way to do it.
154800	155800	Nord stuff.
155800	156800	Nord stuff.
156800	158860	Also a friend that we met around that same time many years ago.
158860	160920	Say hello to Techmaster Loki here in studio with us.
160920	161920	Hello.
161920	162920	Hi, how are you?
162920	163920	I'm fine.
163920	167120	Are you enjoying this lovely soundtrack we have coming from next door's party?
167120	168120	Yes.
168120	171040	Someday I'll be invited to the party.
171040	175240	So here's the deal, which by the way, we can't see Loki a little bit when you lean too far
175240	176240	forward.
176240	177240	We don't need to see me.
177240	178240	It's fine.
178240	179240	You saw me last week.
179240	180240	Most of the time.
180240	181240	I'm just working on shit.
181240	182240	So here's the deal.
182240	183240	And I hope it's not picking up on the mics.
183240	187040	I don't think it is because the mics gain, and you see this on Twitch, we have to get
187040	188240	really close to the mics.
188240	191880	So I don't think the music, but let me tell you, if you were sitting in this room, you
191880	196800	could pretty much hear the song like it was playing softly on the TV or something.
196800	199400	Our neighbors are having some type of raging party next door.
199400	200800	I don't know what there is to celebrate.
200800	204080	I don't know if it's like Game of Thrones or Avengers Endgame.
204080	205080	Everybody's dying.
205080	206080	Whoa.
206080	211480	I think it's probably just like, maybe it's a, maybe it's early Cinco de Mayo, but like
211480	212480	I literally, okay.
212480	216080	So I literally like right at the end of Bobby's show there, right before he called us, I actually
216080	220120	had to send Bobby a message that says, don't call me yet because I need to go next door.
220120	221120	We have like an urgent situation.
221120	222120	Cause it was even worse.
222120	224320	Like it was louder a minute ago.
224320	227520	And like, I knew I like, like, I'm like Jamie's closest to the window.
227520	228520	It's going to drive her bonkers.
228520	232720	I can't hear the music down, especially since I've been fighting off a headache all day.
232720	234760	So I was like, all right, I'm just going to go over.
234760	237760	So I went over there and like the, the fence was wide open.
237760	241360	So I just walked right back there, invited myself to their party.
241360	244200	And it was just like, hi, I'm the neighbor.
244200	247320	We're trying to do some recording, you know, and I asked nicely and they did, I mean, it's
247320	251000	still loud, but they definitely turned it down from where it was at, but yeah, good.
251000	252520	I'm glad you guys in chat.
252520	253520	Can't hear it.
253520	255160	And of course we don't want to hear this shit.
255160	256160	I know.
256160	257160	It's just boom.
257160	258160	Anyway.
258320	263200	Of course we do tape live at Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network at six o'clock Pacific,
263200	267440	nine o'clock Eastern every week, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
267440	271560	And we're, he's always kind enough to have us on at the very end of the show, even when
271560	274040	I have to tell him, Hey, hold on a minute.
274040	277600	I have to go be that crazy old man that yells at the neighbors to get to turn down that
277600	278600	racket.
278600	279600	So they're on the roof.
279600	281600	I mean, are they up on the roof?
281600	282600	They were on the roof.
282600	283600	Yeah.
283600	284600	Is that where they smoked their marijuana?
284600	285600	No, they were dancing.
286040	290680	Because you know, because you know, it's a party and we're crazy.
290680	292240	I hope they die.
292240	293240	You know?
293240	294240	No, don't.
294240	295240	We don't.
295240	296240	I don't.
296240	297240	I don't need a scene over at the neighbor's house.
297240	298240	You don't need a scene.
298240	299240	Yeah.
299240	300240	Girl.
300240	301240	I can make a scene.
301240	303480	Anyway, you are making a scene over there.
303480	304760	What do you need to tell the Twitch?
304760	309080	And I apologize to the podcast folks, cause you can't see all this vibrant color and like
309080	314280	tissue paper and cards and all these things that, so you are, you're not wrapping your
314280	315280	own gifts.
315960	316960	No, no, no.
316960	321200	So, and y'all need to sign the card for mama, but, um, I will on a break, not while we're
321200	322200	trying to do a show.
322200	325800	It's Charlotte's birthday as in the Mel's little girl.
325800	326800	She's going to be one.
326800	330960	So of course she won't remember any of this shit, but I got her a little cute toy and
330960	336560	some sensory goods and um, I got stuff for mom too cause mama could probably use some
336560	337560	chocolate.
337560	338560	Yes.
338560	339560	Oh, that's very kind of you.
339560	344840	She, she works really hard and really, I usually say like the first birthdays are really more
344840	350520	for mama and daddy than the baby because the baby is going to go, Ooh, I can smash
350520	351520	this.
351520	352520	And then that's it.
352520	355840	I think, I think she had mentioned something too about not to like spoil everything at
355840	356840	this upcoming party.
356840	357840	Sorry.
357840	358840	Sorry if you're listening.
358840	361480	Um, but I think she mentioned that the baby was getting their own cake.
361480	363000	I think this is the thing they do.
363000	367480	Like you get a cake, just a little like, it's like the, the one slice you might buy at the
367480	372120	supermarket and that's specifically for the baby to smash while everybody else eats the
372120	373120	real cake.
373120	374120	Well, right.
374400	379080	Usually it's, uh, I think we've done like a cupcake or like a smaller cake, but yeah,
379080	382540	cause they're babies and they have no motor control and they're going to smash it into
382540	383540	their face.
383540	384540	Sure.
384540	388680	So it's, it's just like, Oh, like how gross he is or she is to show them when they're
388680	390560	18 and put in the high school yearbook.
390560	391560	Yeah, sure.
391560	392560	That's still a thing people do.
392560	393560	Right.
393560	394560	I don't know.
394560	395560	Is that a, my show my age again?
395560	396560	You never did that in my yearbook.
396560	397560	Really?
397560	399240	No, they did it in our yearbook and no one gave a shit.
399240	402000	My mom always threatened to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook.
402000	404920	She always, she always said, I'm going to put the fig leaf picture in the yearbook if
404920	409080	you don't behave because I guess they, you know, cause this is this, I mean now it sounds
409080	411320	like kind of, but in the seventies, this is what people did.
411320	415800	Uh, when I was like a year old, I was running around the backyard completely buck ass naked
415800	419820	and somebody decided to take a picture of me with just a little fig leaf holding up.
419820	425120	So um, yeah, so luckily that picture did not get put in the yearbook cause you know, Travis
425120	427720	Donovan would have put it all over the air when he had a show.
427760	433480	Uh, so that picture, um, is probably still at my parents' place and uh, if I have anything
433480	434480	to say about it, we'll be burned.
434480	436920	But I was like, I was a year old, come on.
436920	439720	So uh, they, they picked a different picture instead.
439720	443400	Probably something, I think me on the computer at five years old and there's a picture of
443400	446520	me at five years old sitting next to the Commodore 64 being such a nerd.
446520	450640	I just have the, just the default senior picture that we had to take next, leaning against
450640	451640	the tree, you know?
451640	452640	Oh yeah.
452640	453640	We didn't have anything like that.
453640	458800	They put us in these like half dress things from the waist up and the men in like, like
458800	465080	suit bibs and took our picture with that and it was just in front of like some stupid nineties
465080	466080	background screen.
466080	469120	But I was like, I don't care cause it's black.
469120	470120	It was goth.
470120	471120	That's all you needed.
471120	472120	All right.
472120	473680	Anyway, uh, we are of course a show that talks about video game.
473680	474680	Believe it or not.
474680	475680	I mean it's a long show though.
475680	477160	So sometimes we get into our personal lives too.
477160	479880	Uh, we talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
479880	481320	So let's get into some video game talk.
482000	486640	And besides my senior year, I was working on yearbook staff, so none of that shit would
486640	488640	have slid by.
488640	489640	Well okay.
489640	493680	My senior year, a video game that came out that, uh, everybody was talking about was
493680	496320	Mortal Kombat on the Super Nintendo.
496320	498640	And that's when they replaced all the blood with sweat, right?
498640	503600	So here we are so many years later where that would have been like 96 and now here we are,
503600	505880	maybe that was even like 95 might've been before my senior year.
505880	509160	But here we are all these years later now in 2019 and we are now on the, if you can
509160	513720	believe it, 11th Mortal Kombat game came out this week, Mortal Kombat 11.
513720	516240	I watched the whole, uh, story mode.
516240	517240	Yeah.
517240	520720	I think a lot of people have been, uh, kind of playing that on Twitch, the story mode.
520720	525920	I know, I know Alan's kind of been watching the story mode as well, which, um, that must
525920	529240	be a thing that developers don't like so much.
529240	531080	So I was just like, thank you.
531080	535200	I kind of dug how they did it because the rest of this was like, what the hell were
535200	539000	you thinking in all the previous Mortal Kombat, at least what were you thinking?
539000	540280	So I'm pleased with this one.
540280	545560	The last Mortal Kombat game I really played was nine or the, the reboot, if you will,
545560	546880	that they just called Mortal Kombat.
546880	551080	Um, and I liked how they kind of redid the story and you went through the first three
551080	556160	games again, but it was with a, with a twist and, um, yeah, well the game is how old at
556160	558000	this point, I'm not going to be spoiling anything.
558000	563320	Uh, basically Raiden has a vision and so it kind of goes back and small corrections happen
563320	568620	that caused this, like, you know, that butterfly effect sequence of events that change things.
568620	572580	We turned the blood, the sweat, and then it just went right from there.
572580	575900	So anyway, uh, and I, those of you guys have been listening to orange on studio for a while.
575900	581320	No, like this last, like I played Mortal Kombat nine and I was like, okay, this is fun.
581320	582740	It's a little nasty, but whatever.
582740	586820	And then around the time of this last, this Mortal Kombat X, which the 10th game and they
586820	590820	called it X, uh, even though I know that's one of Jamie's pet peeves, but no, because
590820	595700	when people talk about an iPhone X, it's an iPhone 10 in marketing, right?
596580	598580	Or Final Fantasy 10.
598580	602220	But in, but in the case of nether realm, they said, we know it's Mortal Kombat 10, but we're
602220	603580	calling it Mortal Kombat X.
603580	606100	So they like specifically said, this is the name.
606100	609380	So, um, that was the game when I started to see the fatality of it.
609380	612920	So I was like, all right, look, this is a bit much.
612920	616420	So I kind of, I ended up just kind of when you turned into your mom, I also just kind
616420	617880	of just ended up passing on the game.
617880	618880	I didn't.
618880	623940	So the 11th game came out and you know, Alan really loves this stuff and he'll show me
624180	625180	the YouTube.
625180	626940	He'll make me watch the YouTube and I'll watch it.
626940	633340	I saw the one just today where the dude kicks somebody into a big sand pile and then like
633340	636860	rips off the whole front of the it's gross.
636860	638860	It's so disgusting.
638860	639860	But here's the thing.
639860	641740	I actually kind of thought about it.
641740	642740	Okay.
642740	645180	I actually considered buying Mortal Kombat 11.
645180	646180	I really did.
646180	649040	Even though I'm, I'm kind of like, I think I might be over it.
649040	654480	I still like it as a fighting game, which is why I really like injustice and injustice
654480	658400	too, because that is basically Mortal Kombat, but without all of that.
658400	659400	Right.
659400	661160	And it's, you know, it's Batman and all the, all his friends.
661160	662680	So, you know, it's a little bit different.
662680	665560	So I like the injustice games quite a bit actually.
665560	667980	But I thought about getting Mortal Kombat 11 because I was like, you know what?
667980	669960	I don't have to do the fatalities.
669960	674560	And even if I see one online, whatever, like it's, I think we blow it out of proportion
674560	677540	a little bit on this show, how sensitive I really am to that stuff.
677540	681700	It's not like I can't like just roll my eyes or, you know, look away if it's that nasty.
681700	683020	It's like, whatever.
683020	688340	But I got to tell you in hearing some of this stuff about Mortal Kombat 11, I, I, I had
688340	689340	pause.
689340	692540	I didn't end up wanting to drop $60 on this game.
692540	694940	After all, I kind of ended up having pause with that.
694940	699780	And part of that is this controversy going on with the grinding and the difficulty of
699780	700780	Mortal Kombat 11.
700780	704100	Uh, I don't know if you're up on this as well, Loki, or what you've heard about this dark
704100	707180	Sakura because you said you were interested in this game to dark soccer, right?
707180	710940	Well, because as to my favorite lady voice actors in it, well, I know it ain't Ronda
710940	711940	Rousey.
711940	712940	No.
712940	713940	Oh, that she wasn't bad as Sonia.
713940	714940	Really?
714940	718260	You're the first person I've heard say anything remotely kind about her performance, but Jennifer
718260	719260	Hale is Kronica.
719260	720260	Okay.
720260	721260	Well, okay.
721260	722460	And Cetrion is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
722460	723460	Really?
723460	724460	Yep.
724460	725460	Oh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
725460	731020	Can't you just tell it from hearing her because she uses the same very sultry singing.
731020	732020	I didn't watch the story mode.
732020	736780	Like she, she talks like she does in the songs in silent Hill.
736780	737780	Interesting.
737780	738780	Well, that's pretty cool.
738780	739780	Yeah.
739780	740780	Three and four.
740780	741780	Sorry.
741780	742780	I should have said, so here's the thing.
742780	744820	Most everybody is like, you know, it's a good game.
744820	745820	It's Mortal Kombat.
745820	746820	It's a good fighter.
746820	747820	Yes.
747820	750500	It's gross and over the top, but if you're playing Mortal Kombat, what all do you expect
750500	751500	now?
751500	752500	Whole thing.
752500	753500	Right.
753500	755220	And I'm not talking about, there was, there was a review controversy that came up on discord
755220	761940	about how one particular, um, reviewer said, uh, the fatalities were too much.
761940	765100	But I, and then he went, the, the reviewer actually went back and corrected it to say
765100	768360	the fatal blows because I think they were actually talking about that mechanic that
768360	770620	replaced the x-ray attacks from the last game I played.
770620	771620	Yeah.
771620	772620	Yeah.
772620	776440	And I was like, all right, well like in that context, I think the dude, but like of course
776440	780340	everybody on Twitter is like, if you can't handle fatalities, what are you doing playing
780340	781840	Mortal Kombat?
781840	783620	And honestly, I got to say this.
783620	789340	I think one of the reasons even I got burned out on the fatalities, like when I enjoyed
789340	794360	fatalities and they made me laugh, like Mortal Kombat two, they were very cartoony.
794360	797460	They were very stupid and they were very fast.
797460	798460	That was the thing, right?
798460	804900	Like uppercut fall in the pool of acid skeleton comes up, set up, execution done, right?
804900	805900	It was fast.
805900	806900	It was done.
806900	812060	And now in like Mortal Kombat 11, these, these fatalities, they're drawn out.
812060	813060	They're excessive.
813060	814060	It is.
814060	815060	It isn't open.
815060	816060	What is this?
816060	817060	Knights of the round?
817060	818060	It is.
818060	819060	It's Knights of the round of death.
819060	820060	It is immortal combat.
820060	822900	And I got to say, like, I kind of had that epiphany this week.
822900	826940	I'm like, I think that may actually be a part of the problem I'm having with the fatalities
826940	831820	is it's just so fucking drawn out and you know, it's this big thing.
831820	836420	So when I initially read the review and even I was reading it in the context of like fatalities
836420	837420	are too much.
837420	842520	I'm like, actually, if you think about it, that maybe the fatalities are just too fucking
842520	849760	long and just like, like, just maybe we've hit that line of like, it just wrap it up
849760	850760	already type of thing.
850760	854060	Like I can actually, I think the reviewer is free to make a point.
854060	858900	It's not like they take the game out of it or said like seven out of 10, too much water.
858900	861540	I think they ended up giving it a four out of five at the end of the day.
861540	866100	So you know, whatever anyway, but here's, and here's the real problem.
866100	868520	Why reviewers are deducting a star.
868520	869520	This is the real problem.
869520	872480	And the thing I think is worth talking about fatality thing, whatever y'all are going to
872480	875400	have opinions on that, we're all going to have to agree to disagree on how I feel about
875400	877000	the violence and all that stuff.
877000	883840	But it's this thing about the towers of combat in Mortal Kombat and the currency that you
883840	888080	get from these towers of combat that allow you to go to the crypt.
888080	890000	And the crypt was in previous Mortal Kombat games.
890000	893880	Like I remember a Mortal Kombat game I had on GameCube, I don't know if it was Deception
893880	894880	or Deadly Alliance.
894880	898400	And you go into the krypt and you can unlock, but you could go on the internet and look
898400	902600	at the FAQ and it would tell you exactly what's in every gravestone in the crypt.
902600	903960	So you would just go get what you want.
903960	908760	And that's that you can't do that in Mortal Kombat 11 because they've randomized everybody's
908760	912040	prey and some of the currency that you use.
912040	914760	You get, you know, you get from playing the game, which you have to play a lot of the
914760	919640	game and you get it in these, these time towers basically, and they're rotating challenges,
919640	923080	but it sounds like a lot of the challenges, and again, I'm going to fully admit I haven't
923080	924080	played the game.
924080	925640	I'm only going off of what I read on the internet.
925640	929880	And I want you guys to chime in, especially if you have played, is it sounds like a lot
929880	934480	of these challenges are bullshit, like, you know, projectiles getting put, like things
934480	937480	that kind of cancel each other out and don't make sense.
937480	938480	And it's really hard.
938480	942860	And so it's kind of nudging you to buy the currency to go in the crypt.
942860	947160	And then it's like, you got to spend a ton of money to do this when it's a little bit
947160	952720	shady on when you consider the fact that you've already dropped 60, 70, maybe a hundred dollars
952720	956080	if you bought the version already has the DLC on this game in the first place, it's
956080	958440	like, it just wants more money from you.
958440	959440	Right.
959440	962760	And now when I, Alan and I were discussing this earlier this week and he said, well,
962760	965080	I mean, how's that different from Overwatch?
965080	969140	Nothing you're getting in the crypt is, you know, anything but cosmetic.
969140	970760	And it's just like loot boxes and Overwatch.
970760	971760	Right.
971760	973800	And I'm kind of like, whatever, whatever.
973800	979260	But I mean, it's, it still feels like it's almost like the difficulty of it has left
979260	985300	it to be a little bit exploitative almost now, to be fair.
985300	987380	And I'm sure, and I, I'm not even looking at chat just yet.
987380	990460	I need to bring that up because I'm sure some of you have comments to be fair.
990460	993260	And nether realm has come out this week and mentioned, we hear the feedback.
993260	997660	We know it's too difficult and they are starting to put out some patches that are a going to
997660	999760	tone down the difficulty of this a little bit.
999760	1003500	And B I think it's going to reward players that already have the game with some like
1003500	1007940	currency, just like free currency as a, you know, thank you for putting up with this bullshit
1007940	1008940	type of thing.
1008940	1011940	You know, a Goodwill gesture, but it's not going to be enough currency to buy everything,
1011940	1013700	but it'll be enough to kind of like get a taste.
1013700	1019100	So they're, they're kind of trying to balance that, but you know, I'm pretty sure these
1019100	1021980	games are pretty extensively tested and so forth.
1021980	1027740	You've got to think they didn't know that some of this was way too hard going into it.
1027740	1031040	Like are the testers just too good at the game?
1031040	1033940	It's weird that they didn't figure that out before the game hit the market.
1033940	1034940	What's up with that?
1034940	1035940	Any of you guys have thoughts on that?
1035940	1036940	Oh, they knew.
1036940	1037940	They knew.
1037940	1043940	Well, first basically it's to push it as far as they can and it's, it's based on backlash
1043940	1049640	really cause they can adjust that stuff on the flyer, make adjustments to it to kind
1049640	1055820	of balance out the grind versus whatever, but in the end it's to basically, I'm assuming
1055820	1058140	they sell the currency as well.
1058140	1059740	You can grind for it or you can buy it.
1059740	1063660	And so the whole point is to make it inconvenient so you want to buy it.
1063660	1064660	Okay.
1064660	1066780	And I need to, I need to correct something that in the way I explained it, thank you
1066780	1067780	chat.
1067780	1071240	And again, I said from the beginning, I haven't played the game and these are some of my reservations
1071240	1072240	about it.
1072240	1073240	This whole Crip thing.
1073240	1077620	So I'm being corrected that the currency isn't to unlock things in the crypt.
1077620	1080340	So a fifth dream today says you can't buy the currency.
1080340	1081940	It's not possible.
1081940	1086020	And a shad stars X and chat saying, yeah, currency is impossible to buy.
1086020	1091500	Fifth dream says you buy the crystals to pay for a random selection of cosmetics.
1091500	1095480	So you're not using the currency that you buy to open the stuff in the crypt.
1095480	1098480	You use it to buy, essentially, it sounds like a loot box.
1098480	1103400	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I, even though you guys are getting me on a technicality,
1103400	1109240	I mean, come on, they're still encouraging you to use currency to get stuff, right?
1109240	1113200	And you see all these articles about, Oh, if you want to buy stuff, it's thousands of
1113200	1117640	dollars to get all the other DLC characters too.
1117640	1119640	So that's going to be a thing that's coming as well.
1119640	1122720	I'm sure this had a season pass.
1122720	1126640	So there's, there's a lot of nickel and diamond going on here.
1126640	1129720	That's just, it's, that's gaming nowadays.
1129720	1135000	And ultimately, you know what, now we're back with where I was at with mortal combat X because
1135000	1139960	all my drama about fatalities and that aside, I almost wanted to pick up mortal combat X.
1139960	1143200	I ultimately didn't do it cause Alan got it.
1143200	1147800	So I didn't have to, um, but I almost picked it up, but I was like, you know what, I'm
1147800	1152600	going to wait for the inevitable end of the year edition or, or year gold year edition,
1152600	1153600	right?
1153600	1154600	Game of the year, the year that's it.
1154600	1158260	You cause you know, and it's the same thing will happen here too come.
1158260	1162240	And especially with it releasing kind of early this year, come November, they're going to
1162240	1167760	put out a version that has all the DLC already included some of this cosmetic currency stuff
1167760	1168960	and the base game.
1168960	1173920	And that will cost maybe 50, 40 who knows, who knows?
1173920	1174920	Sales.
1174920	1175920	Absolutely.
1175920	1178820	It'll be like half off probably in a few months.
1178820	1183280	So I just, I don't feel the need to buy it now.
1183280	1187420	And it's kind of, and I'm going to, I'm just putting it out there just because I feel it's
1187420	1192680	worth saying if I hadn't heard about all this nickel and diming stuff, you know, DLC characters
1192680	1198400	is one thing, but all this, I probably, I probably would have done it, but now I'm pausing
1198400	1199400	a little bit.
1199400	1204160	Now I'm pausing to say like, maybe I'm going to wait until I get a little more bang for
1204160	1206200	my buck for that 60 bucks.
1206200	1207200	Yeah.
1207200	1208200	Thoughts.
1208200	1209200	I mean, where, where's your head out with Mortal Kombat?
1209200	1210200	Loki.
1210200	1211280	I don't know if I'm not interested in it at all.
1211280	1214760	So it makes no difference to me what it costs.
1214760	1216760	So I don't want to play it.
1216760	1219440	I, I'll be honest.
1219440	1226360	I don't really have the, the hand strength to play a fighting game well anymore.
1226360	1233720	Um, so for me, I I've gotten everything I want to see watching on YouTube, you know,
1233720	1236800	if they did like, here's the movie version of it.
1236800	1239880	That's a whole nother thing though, is about now it's, it's interesting because I feel
1239880	1244640	like Mortal Kombat, I've heard more than any other game recently about how people are kind
1244640	1251760	of just playing it on YouTube essentially, which to be fair, kind of lends credit to
1251760	1257880	maybe why Netherrealm feels they've got to really milk the people playing it for a little
1257880	1261280	extra cash here and there is because they're losing money on people just kind of watching
1261280	1262280	the story.
1262280	1266120	I don't think you're doing anything wrong, but it's just a reality of gaming in 2019.
1266120	1271600	And how do we make a game that makes money anyway?
1271600	1276160	Somebody buy me time because I want to, because the chat is saying, okay, go ahead.
1276160	1277160	Yeah.
1277160	1279000	But I'll be perfectly honest.
1279000	1283360	Um, I, I don't necessarily see it that way because really most of the people who are
1283360	1288400	going to be interested in playing it are putting out the money there and are buying the DLC.
1288400	1294080	You know, it's like the same model where you have, um, in fact, we were talking about
1294080	1298200	this at work just the other day where, you know, you've got all these free to play games
1298200	1303440	and you know, you have 80% of the people out there who are not buying, you know, extra
1303440	1305400	points or extra time or anything.
1305400	1309440	And then you have the rabid 20% that are putting out all the money.
1309440	1315280	And so they, they should take into account their in their price point, the portion that
1315280	1316480	is going to pay for it.
1316480	1320160	You know, you are going to have freeloaders like me, and then you're going to have people
1320160	1323880	who are just base game and then you're going to have the people who are going to put out
1323880	1325760	the money because they're enthusiasts.
1325760	1326760	Okay.
1326760	1328520	Let me make sure I represent this correctly.
1328520	1331400	So I'm just going to read, I don't usually do this, I'm going to read word for word from
1331400	1332400	this article.
1332400	1335080	So I'm going to give credit to VG247.com.
1335080	1336080	Thank you.
1336080	1337080	I'm sorry.
1337080	1338080	I'm, but I just, I want to make sure we get it right.
1338080	1339080	Okay.
1339080	1340080	So here it is.
1340080	1343960	So, uh, it will cost you plenty if you want to acquire every skin available in the game.
1343960	1347960	There are 23 characters presently in each offer 60 different skins.
1347960	1351360	According to someone who did the math over on Reddit, a poster crunched some numbers
1351360	1356640	and according to the math, it will apparently cost you $6,440 in real money to buy every
1356640	1357800	skin currently available.
1357800	1361760	Four of the skins can be unlocked by playing through the character tutorials, story and
1361760	1367280	basic towers that leaves 56 skins to unlock skins are unlocked just by playing the game
1367280	1372280	or they can seemingly be purchased using in game currency called time crystals.
1372280	1376880	Time crystals can also be earned through gameplay, but seem to amass slowly.
1376880	1382400	If you are the impatient sort or just really want a particular skin, you can purchase 500
1382400	1387640	time crystals through the in game store for $5, which is what each skin runs on average,
1387640	1391600	but you still may not get the skin you want as they appear on a rotational basis.
1391600	1395480	Every six to eight hours, a new set of five skins will become available on the store supposedly
1395480	1396480	wants to leave.
1396480	1400800	Once they leave the store, well prepare yourself for a grind fest.
1400800	1404960	He goes on, the poster went on to say that he earned 760 time crystals after playing
1404960	1406440	the game four hours.
1406440	1412000	If you wanted to unlock every game skin through gameplay alone, it would take 3,390 hours
1412000	1415720	of play time and cost 644,000 time crystals.
1415720	1422100	So I don't think I misrepresented that because I said you can either play the game and amass
1422100	1426440	things slowly or they're tempting you with this pay to unlock it right away, right?
1426440	1432200	And this is not something exactly unique to Mortal Kombat 11 either, right?
1432200	1433600	We've seen this in other games as well.
1433600	1434600	Yes, we have.
1434600	1436760	And it's the whole fear of missing out.
1436760	1440880	So they, that's why it's on a limited time basis and they rotate amounts because it's
1440880	1442200	like, Oh my God, that's what I want.
1442200	1443680	And I got to get it right away.
1443680	1449880	Ah, ah, well, I guess I better buy some stuff to unlock the thing that changes something
1449880	1450880	slightly.
1450880	1451880	Okay.
1451880	1453720	So they are okay.
1453720	1457600	So chatters are jumping in like Renji to do want to say, you can't buy all the costumes,
1457600	1458600	right?
1458600	1459600	Because the rotational thing.
1459600	1462120	So you would, you know, you'd have to be patient and you have to, what?
1462120	1464960	So can you not grind it out in the crypt then?
1464960	1467600	That was the impression I was getting is that the other way to get the costumes is just
1467600	1468600	get them in the crypt randomly.
1468600	1473760	I thought that was apparently it's been already being patched out or well, right.
1473760	1477200	And I said that at the very beginning, they're already addressing some of this with a patch.
1477200	1481460	But my big question was, how did they not figure out that some of these grindy things
1481460	1484700	were a bit too much in some of the early testing that they did?
1484700	1489480	You know what, it kind of makes you go, are they, do they really, or are they just doing
1489480	1493260	it because there's enough bitching on the internet that you have people like me that
1493260	1495700	are sitting there going, I was going to buy it.
1495700	1499580	But when I heard about how grindy it was, I thought maybe not because it's the people
1499580	1503160	are testing the game, aren't paying real money to unlock the stuff.
1503160	1507460	So they're just testing the functionality of it, not whether, you know, it's annoying
1507460	1508960	as crap.
1508960	1513260	And also this also begs the question with you guys having to kind of explain it and
1513260	1514260	read the article.
1514260	1516740	Why is this so fucking complicated in the first place?
1516740	1521080	Like it's complicated to make people not want to think about it.
1521080	1525440	So Oh, so that people don't think about the distraction it's, I mean, a lot of these things
1525440	1533580	are set up in this particular, like almost like a psychological manipulation where they
1533580	1537260	know that a customer isn't going to stop and do the math.
1537260	1540100	And the average customer will not stop and do the math on all of these things.
1540100	1543000	They won't sit and look at the probability.
1543000	1546380	And at the end of the day, they're like, Oh, I can give it a chance.
1546380	1548360	It's like playing a lottery, right?
1548360	1549360	Really it is.
1549360	1552920	Well, you know, and it's interesting addicted to the gambling because you know, what I think
1552920	1557460	of is I think of the Microsoft points and yes, I realized they've retired the points.
1557460	1562160	They did that several years ago, but y'all know when the Xbox three 60 first came out,
1562160	1567240	you bought Microsoft points and it wasn't one point was one penny.
1567240	1569200	And it was almost the exact way you phrased it.
1569200	1574700	You bought, I think it was, did you get less fuck, what was it like 400 points for $5 or
1574700	1575700	something like that.
1575700	1576700	Right?
1576700	1578580	So it was, yeah, 400 points for $5.
1578580	1583900	So you, so you, you would buy things for 400 points and maybe that your brain would think
1583900	1586620	that was about $4, but it really was $5.
1586620	1588660	Most people aren't thinking through the math again.
1588660	1593700	Microsoft has changed that, but I mean, it does go to show our industry has kind of been
1593700	1594700	here before a little bit.
1594700	1601440	It's a little deceptive, but at the same time, it's, I reckon to them the financial deception,
1601440	1608680	you know, it's not like a blatant deception, but, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking
1608680	1615000	of a misleading, a little bit of misleading, you know, it's there.
1615000	1619640	If you want to stop and look at it, it, it, if you give it a first glance and you're thinking
1619640	1622140	with that common sense, 400 to five.
1622140	1628500	So I'm actually paying, you know, um, like a dollar, a dollar 10 or a dollar, you know,
1628500	1634420	whatever per, per point or, you know, per a hundred point or whatever it is.
1634420	1637820	Um, then logically it's there in front of you.
1637820	1642420	They haven't hidden a thing and just using that particular example, but when you are
1642420	1649360	going to then use the points in the store, it's not giving you that point of comparison.
1649380	1651460	It's not putting a dollar figure on it.
1651460	1655140	You are using the points at that point that you have already paid for.
1655140	1658780	What you paid for them is inconsequential for how you're spending the points.
1658780	1660620	And that's where the misleading comes in.
1660620	1667100	I don't want to call it a blatant deception cause it's not a blatant mortal combat deception.
1667100	1669700	Keep that up.
1669700	1673820	We'll have a mortal combat annihilation, total random tangent aside.
1673820	1676500	I was trying to let you, the chat room saw me trying to get Louise.
1676500	1677500	Is it just me?
1677560	1682200	The music over there just suddenly like drop off very much, very much has dropped off.
1682200	1686240	I wonder if there's, see if you can see flashing blue and red lights to the window or if somebody
1686240	1687240	else went over there.
1687240	1691720	Finally, I'll, I'll go take a look, go see if I'm going to look, go see the cops are
1691720	1692720	here.
1692720	1696440	Let me bring my tea with me so I can sip it in your yard.
1696440	1697440	You don't, don't make it obvious.
1697440	1698440	Don't just peek through the window.
1698440	1701400	Be that, be that, be that old lady peering through the windows.
1701400	1704060	Let's go see if they're on the roof.
1704060	1705720	Maybe someone finally died.
1706660	1709220	No, cause I can hear the music going a little bit.
1709220	1711180	It's just like way down from what it was.
1711180	1713380	Anyway, I can't believe she went outside.
1713380	1714380	Anyway.
1714380	1717780	Um, some other comments from chat, uh, Chad stars it, who I know has been playing mortal
1717780	1721700	combat 11 and would probably be excited to hear if I actually finally got in and played
1721700	1727260	it, uh, said it's all artificial time barriers to make you sink way too much time into this,
1727260	1729900	which is where I see most people get mad about this game.
1729900	1732860	Plus the difficulty in the towers and the randomness of the crypt.
1732860	1735420	And fifth dream today says, what's the verdict?
1735440	1737840	I didn't see any lights, but I did see people start to walk out.
1737840	1740320	Oh, so maybe parties already may just be over.
1740320	1741840	Maybe they're done with their day drinking.
1741840	1742840	All right.
1742840	1746440	Well, game of thrones is on, I guess maybe for some, who knows?
1746440	1748400	I hear the not that you should change the channel.
1748400	1749960	You can DVR it or use HBO.
1749960	1750960	Go.
1750960	1751960	I can hear the music.
1751960	1752960	Yeah, it's, it's still there.
1752960	1753960	It's just like way down.
1753960	1754960	Anyway.
1754960	1755960	All right.
1755960	1756960	Shut up about the neighbors.
1756960	1757960	No one can hear it.
1757960	1758960	I know.
1758960	1759960	I know.
1759960	1760960	But it's just, you guys, you guys don't understand if you were here in the studio, it'd be driving
1760960	1761960	you bonkers.
1761960	1762960	All right.
1763020	1768540	Fifth dream today says I view microtransactions like impulse purchases at the store, grab
1768540	1771340	a candy bar, a magazine, get fries with that.
1771340	1772340	How often a week?
1772340	1773620	Well, $5 now.
1773620	1775660	And then it's the same thing.
1775660	1776900	Very interesting.
1776900	1777900	Very interesting.
1777900	1781900	Anyway, now something else to note about this whole ordeal.
1781900	1786260	One other thing I want to talk about when mortal combat is that, you know, modders are
1786260	1787980	going to mod, right?
1787980	1789940	Hackers going to hack modders going to mod.
1789940	1790940	This is a little bit of both.
1790940	1792460	I don't know if you would call this a hack or a mod.
1792460	1794080	I guess technically it's a mod.
1794080	1800440	But anyway, there are characters that appear in Mortal Kombat 11 story, Cyrax and Sektor.
1800440	1803480	I know those names from Mortal Kombat 3 way back in the day, right?
1803480	1804880	The robot ninjas, right?
1804880	1810280	So apparently they show up in the story, but they are not actually playable as part of
1810280	1813280	the roster, which Mortal Kombat's done this before.
1813280	1818040	I remember Mortal Kombat 9 had Rain, and Rain is awesome, but Rain was in the story, but
1818040	1821200	you couldn't play Rain as a selectable character.
1821540	1827060	I'm sure somebody on the PC back then made it able to play Rain on the PC.
1827060	1828700	Sure enough, what's happened now?
1828700	1833340	Somebody has enabled it so that you can play Cyrax and Sektor on the PC with their new
1833340	1836240	character models, all the moves and all that stuff.
1836240	1841220	This also goes for the boss character, the boss character of course, Kronika in the game.
1841220	1844660	You can actually play as Kronika thanks to this mod as well.
1844660	1850380	Although for Mortal Kombat to not allow you to play the boss characters is not as unusual.
1850380	1852360	That goes all the way back to Goro in the first game.
1852360	1855680	They just don't want you to play something that's going to be completely unbalanced.
1855680	1859520	It sounds like Kronika, that might be a little bit of the issue there as well, but surprise,
1859520	1863160	surprise, that the PC players have already managed to move the boss.
1863160	1866520	So do they have all their moves, or is it just kind of mimicking other...
1866520	1867520	No, they have the...
1867520	1869080	Because in the story they do these moves.
1869080	1873680	So the yellow ninja does the bombs that throw...
1873680	1877160	Sorry, I can't remember the difference, but throws out the bombs, right?
1877180	1879940	I think Cyrax has the bombs and Sektor has the missiles.
1879940	1881820	So they have those types of moves.
1881820	1883580	And they don't look like pallet swaps either.
1883580	1885700	At least when I looked at it, they did look different.
1885700	1887420	So yeah, it's interesting.
1887420	1890740	And people are wondering if it's, oh, is it DLC?
1890740	1895260	But apparently the DLC list is leaked and I do not believe these guys are on the DLC
1895260	1896400	list.
1896400	1902180	So just like in Mortal Kombat 9 with Reign, it appears that there are no plans to make
1902180	1903180	these characters playable.
1903200	1908520	That's clearly true because they could have them on the list as like characters.
1908520	1912360	Like if there's a list of all the characters in the game and they may not suspect that
1912360	1916240	they're DLC because they're technically in the game as story characters, it doesn't mean
1916240	1919800	that they can't have them as also DLC playable characters.
1919800	1921960	So maybe?
1921960	1924800	I guess we'll see.
1924800	1928840	Some folks in chat are chiming in as well about a reptile in Mortal Kombat 1 being a
1928840	1932680	very hidden thing that you could fight, but you couldn't really play as.
1932680	1937060	Although wasn't there a thing, wasn't there like a code or something you did on Super
1937060	1938060	Nintendo?
1938060	1939060	It was a Game Genie.
1939060	1940060	That's probably a Game Genie code.
1940060	1943740	Yeah, where like you could play as reptile, but you had to really jump through hoops.
1943740	1949800	And all reptile was in the Mortal Kombat 1, all reptile was was Sub-Zero and Scorpion
1949800	1951340	stuff at the same time.
1951340	1952540	That's all reptile was.
1952540	1956700	Reptile didn't get the stuff like the ball that makes, you know, the acid spit and all
1956700	1957700	that stuff.
1957700	1960460	That didn't come to Mortal Kombat 2 when they made reptile his own character.
1960460	1964280	So believe it or not, guys, I used to the old school Mortal Kombat games.
1964280	1966840	I used to love those games.
1966840	1971200	I loved like Mortal Kombat 2, especially Katana, Molina.
1971200	1972200	You know it.
1972200	1973200	I played that.
1973200	1974200	I still remember this day.
1974200	1975200	Katana.
1975200	1976200	Finish him.
1976200	1979080	Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick, easiest fatality
1979080	1980080	in the world.
1980080	1981700	Just slam the block button, high kick.
1981700	1983320	That's the fan chopping off the head.
1983320	1986040	But it's it's two seconds and then it's over.
1986040	1988920	And it's cartoony and stupid.
1989900	1995580	And yeah, Fifth Dream says there's always seasons two and three or excuse me, there's
1995580	1996580	always seasons two.
1996580	1998100	And he makes that bunny face.
1998100	2001900	But that comment very well could be seasons two and three.
2001900	2005640	Shad Starsick says, I'll take a season two if I get characters I want.
2005640	2011100	So Tiger Claw also with a random aside here, but I think this is is a worthy note.
2011100	2015640	Tiger Claw mentioning that Arcade One Up has, you know, they're doing all those stand ups
2015640	2017580	that kind of look like a Mortal Kombat one.
2017580	2018580	Well, they're there.
2018580	2020360	They just announced recently they're doing a Mortal Kombat one.
2020360	2023980	They're going to do a Mortal Kombat one, two and three all in one cabinet.
2023980	2026320	And y'all ready for a twist?
2026320	2029440	That's the one I kind of want, like really bad.
2029440	2033200	Like I think having a Mortal Kombat one, two and three little mini cab, I think that would
2033200	2034200	be fun.
2034200	2035200	Mortal Kombat two is the best, though.
2035200	2036200	No, it really is.
2036200	2037200	It's my favorite.
2037200	2039120	I do have a soft spot for Mortal Kombat three.
2039120	2042920	Mortal Kombat one I don't think is very fun to play anymore, just because I think it got
2042920	2044480	superseded by the later game.
2044480	2045480	Slow.
2045480	2046960	Yeah, it's kind of it's kind of clunky.
2046960	2050420	But it's like, all right, we respect it for what it is.
2050420	2055620	We tip our hat, you know, but then it's like, OK, Mortal Kombat two is like superior in
2055620	2056620	every way with the characters.
2056620	2058460	Yeah, in every way.
2058460	2059460	So anyway.
2059460	2060460	Yeah.
2060460	2064540	And Tiger Claw says the Mortal Kombat three is ultimate Mortal Kombat.
2064540	2068740	And that game was just fun because of all the freakin characters.
2068740	2071780	There were so many characters in that game.
2071780	2074580	So it's interesting now that, you know, Mortal Kombat style back a little bit.
2074600	2077080	What if they did a Mortal Kombat tag?
2077080	2078080	Like tag tournament?
2078080	2079080	Kind of.
2079080	2080080	Yeah.
2080080	2081080	Or like a tag team?
2081080	2082080	Yeah.
2082080	2083080	Wasn't that a mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat?
2083080	2085920	I don't remember because I didn't really play too much of Ultimate.
2085920	2088960	I thought there was a 2v2 in one of those Mortal Kombat three clones.
2088960	2090960	Maybe it was a home version only or something like that.
2090960	2092680	Maybe somebody in chat knows what I'm talking about.
2092680	2095800	But I really feel like the tag team thing was in one of the games.
2095800	2098280	It might have been a Mortal Kombat cross Tekken.
2098280	2104480	Well, they they for it to for what it's worth, Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe was
2104480	2105480	the thing.
2105480	2106480	It was kind of their response.
2106480	2107900	They also made injustice.
2107900	2108900	Yeah.
2108900	2110860	Well, that's I think where injustice came from.
2110860	2113620	And minor spoiler alert about the DLC.
2113620	2116860	But I would imagine most of you have heard by now, but if you don't want a minor spoilers
2116860	2122780	get forward 30 seconds, apparently Joker, not persona Joker, but or Mass Effect Joker,
2122780	2126500	but Joker from DC is in the DLC.
2126500	2132140	So that's kind of interesting in a way, especially consider all the fatalities because they kind
2132140	2133140	of censored.
2133140	2135200	They made him brutalities in Mortal Kombat DC Universe.
2135200	2140080	I remember it was like Joker had the gun and he'd point the gun at the head, but the camera
2140080	2143480	zoomed just enough so that it was out of range by the time he pulled the trigger so he couldn't
2143480	2144480	actually see it.
2144480	2147540	So that was the type of stuff that Mortal Kombat DC Universe did.
2147540	2152680	So anyway, OK, Loco Poco says Mortal Kombat nine had two versus two.
2152680	2153680	I knew there was a game.
2153680	2154680	I played it in.
2154680	2155680	Thank you, guys.
2155680	2157760	Sia Tabiri suggests King of Fighters and Mortal Kombat.
2157760	2160120	Hey, I'd be into that.
2160120	2161120	Yeah.
2161120	2162380	So there you go.
2162380	2163380	So Mortal Kombat 11.
2163380	2167720	So again, I apologize that we haven't all gotten our hands on it, but I think it's it's
2167720	2169540	also worth discussing here.
2169540	2172540	You know, we all hold down day jobs.
2172540	2174300	This podcast is a labor of love.
2174300	2178580	You all know that we have to be picky and choosy about how we spend our money to like
2178580	2179580	we're not getting comped.
2179580	2183500	All these games from some some very sweet indie studios and so forth have done that
2183500	2184500	here and there.
2184500	2186860	But, you know, as far as Triple-A title goes, we don't get those for free.
2186860	2189460	So we have to think about how to spend our money, too.
2189460	2192480	And do I want to drop sixty dollars on Mortal Kombat 11?
2192480	2193760	I don't know if I want to right now.
2193760	2194760	I don't know.
2194760	2195760	We'll see.
2195760	2198880	I feel like my husband will inevitably get it again.
2198880	2201520	And then because he gets paid in a couple of days.
2201520	2205320	So I bet he'll buy it and then I don't have to worry about it.
2205320	2207400	That's always that's always a nice, nice way to do it.
2207400	2208400	All right.
2208400	2211060	Anyway, let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week
2211060	2215780	in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week, where we talk about what we have, if not Mortal
2215780	2216780	Kombat, then what?
2216780	2218400	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
2218400	2219400	I'm playing this crap.
2219400	2220400	Y'all see it?
2220400	2222620	No, but the podcast listeners sure can't.
2222620	2227980	Yeah, that's well, yeah, that's I'm playing idle pouring and playing I'm playing Ingress
2227980	2228980	again.
2228980	2230980	We took the work portal.
2230980	2235860	I still need more stuff for the anomaly.
2235860	2236860	We are.
2236860	2238860	What else am I doing?
2238860	2239860	Yeah.
2239860	2240920	Pokemon Go.
2240920	2247040	I'm playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp because a super freaking one in Animal Crossing.
2247040	2250900	I played DDR last week.
2250900	2257220	I actually played Superstar and failed it because, you know, I haven't played in a long
2257220	2258900	time, but I did pretty OK.
2258900	2261020	I like some of the mid difficulty ones.
2261020	2262980	It was how did you just get my bearings again?
2262980	2263980	But it was fun.
2263980	2267300	I played a game with JD that was really fun.
2267300	2270020	And then I played like some piano keys game.
2270020	2273220	It's like a ticket spitter, but it was kind of fun, too.
2273220	2275420	It was like really super easy.
2275420	2278560	Is that what like the supersize piano keys or whatever?
2278560	2282720	It's like just like a single, you know, like a half octave.
2282720	2283720	It was pretty fun.
2283720	2284720	Yeah.
2284720	2285720	I like that gigantic one.
2285720	2286720	They have around one that.
2286720	2288720	Well, we played at Dave and Buster's.
2288720	2289720	OK.
2289720	2290720	Yeah.
2290720	2291720	We also.
2291720	2299120	I didn't really play a whole lot else because it's just too busy all that week, but I'm
2299120	2303560	playing my phone stuff and, you know.
2303560	2306140	We got a Dr. Who pinball.
2306140	2312100	We we traded monopoly stir monopoly and got a Dr. Who.
2312100	2314840	And it turns out that one of our boards is bad.
2314840	2318020	So Dan is ordering anyone to put it back in.
2318020	2319020	I mean, it's just one board.
2319020	2320020	So it's fine.
2320020	2321500	It's not I think that super crazy.
2321500	2325640	But Dr. Who is a really good pinball with like one of my favorite multi balls.
2325640	2329260	And so I played the shit out of that.
2329260	2332180	And then, of course, more Ghostbusters, which we have Ghostbusters pinball.
2332200	2333200	Yeah.
2333200	2335720	I think a lot of our audience is going to be jealous that Dr. Who acquisition, in fact,
2335720	2339200	Bobby Black Wolf is saying Dr. Who pinball is one of my is my one holy grail.
2339200	2341320	If I could have one table in my house, it'd be that one.
2341320	2344640	Then, Bobby, I will take pictures and put them up for you.
2344640	2348000	Our play field is immaculate.
2348000	2349080	It's been fully restored.
2349080	2351960	Our side art is not so great.
2351960	2353660	It could use some touch up.
2353660	2357300	But the board plays like brand new board, like it was a home use only, which I'm pretty
2357300	2361020	sure it wasn't home use just in some of the wear and tear on some of the ramps.
2361020	2363380	But the board, the play field has been fully restored.
2363380	2364380	It's really nice.
2364380	2367400	We need to go record a midpoint break at your house at some point with some pinball.
2367400	2368400	Yeah.
2368400	2369720	We need like three fucking cameras for it.
2369720	2370720	We'll figure it out.
2370720	2371720	Yeah.
2371720	2379240	But at any rate, that's been been my gaming weeks since I was sure it's in a boot.
2379240	2380240	Loki, how about you?
2380240	2381800	How was your gaming week?
2381800	2383540	I didn't play a whole ton of things.
2383540	2385040	I tried out.
2385040	2389840	Well, first off, I finished building the last few things for the Labo VR stuff.
2389840	2397640	So I built the thing called the wind pedal and there's like a elephant thing, which
2397640	2399900	you can use to draw and stuff.
2399900	2400900	It's all right.
2400900	2402460	It hasn't worked out great.
2402460	2407140	It's hard to tell depth on it, but it is what it is.
2407140	2410320	And then the wind pedal things kind of it's all right.
2410320	2412940	The mini game that they have with that, it works better though with the bird though,
2412940	2414680	because it makes your bird go faster.
2414680	2416340	So that's kind of cool.
2416340	2419420	And I beat the bird game.
2419420	2420420	And what else?
2420420	2429300	I tried the Labo VR stuff for, um, Mario Odyssey and that was really lame.
2429300	2435080	So yeah, unfortunately I won't be playing much of that.
2435080	2440800	My son likes it, but I completely expected the Nintendo VR stuff, which I think is coming
2440800	2441800	up later.
2441800	2442800	So maybe we don't want to get in too much into it.
2442800	2446800	I was completely expecting the Nintendo VR stuff was going to be more cute than it was
2446800	2449560	going to be like actual like depth to it.
2449560	2450560	You know what I mean?
2450560	2452320	Well, it's, it's just like all the other stuff.
2452320	2458480	I mean it more the, the Super Mario Odyssey stuff is basically you're running around with
2458480	2460120	a fixed camera basically.
2460120	2466060	So you have, you're just kind of like different levels and get to find three things and like
2466060	2470840	collect a hundred coins and you're just going around as a fixed camera.
2470840	2476040	So it's like sometimes Mario gets really far away from you and I don't know, there's just
2476040	2481480	not much to do in it and the, the 3D effect and it's just not that great.
2481480	2482480	It's okay.
2482480	2489000	Um, I did pick up the finally, um, Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son's been wanting
2489000	2490080	that for a while now.
2490080	2491280	So it's such a good game.
2491280	2492280	Um, I picked that up.
2492280	2493840	You had it on Wii U, right?
2493840	2494840	I had it on Wii U.
2494840	2496520	I never played it though on Wii U very much.
2496520	2497520	I did.
2497520	2498520	Okay.
2498520	2499960	I only played like five, 10 minutes.
2499960	2503280	We did not go all this time without you like ever playing Breath of the Wild.
2503280	2506480	No, I've played Breath of the Wild, but I just haven't played it for a very long time.
2506480	2507480	Got it.
2507480	2512520	Um, but my son likes playing that when we go to the, um, GameStop or whatever the demo
2512520	2513520	station.
2513520	2518560	So I'm like, Oh, we just buy the damn game and like then complete through the whole game.
2518560	2522040	So I finally bought it and then he doesn't want to play it.
2522040	2526120	So we ended up learning Julian, our Wii U so he could play through Breath of the Wild.
2526120	2527880	He's been too busy playing Roblox crap.
2527880	2533080	So you know, whatever he plays this doing all that coding stuff, right?
2533080	2535000	Well, no, it's because he likes the Roblox stuff.
2535000	2541440	So he's been playing this Five Nights at Freddy's sim thing where he, he's, he gets, uh, be
2541440	2544440	the animatronics or something.
2544440	2545440	I don't know.
2545440	2547720	He won't shut up about the goddamn game.
2547720	2551680	So he plays that in Raft and, uh, not Fortnite though.
2551680	2554000	Cause I haven't told him like, Hey, the Thanos stuff came back.
2554000	2559320	You know, he's like, um, you should introduce him to Pirate 101 seriously.
2559320	2563040	Cause Julian is still playing this game six years later.
2563040	2569360	So I don't know, but yeah, so that's pretty, Oh, and the Pokemon go a little bit.
2569360	2570360	Sorry.
2570360	2571360	I'm ruining all your stories.
2571360	2572360	I know.
2572360	2574400	Um, no, I'm just going to say, I'm actually saying, Oh shit.
2574400	2581880	Because I'm apparently has short, but Oh Ray, all of this happens to me.
2581880	2582880	I know.
2582880	2583880	Right.
2583880	2585920	Can you, can we, Oh, you can use my mic to finish your stuff.
2585920	2588160	Here you go.
2588160	2592480	We just need new mics.
2592480	2594040	Maybe that's what I should buy.
2594040	2604200	Um, so yeah, so I just played basically that stuff this week and then is it gone?
2604200	2605200	Is it gone?
2605200	2606200	No.
2606200	2609560	Yes, it's gone.
2609560	2610560	It might be me.
2610560	2611640	I'm just very buzzy.
2611640	2612640	I'm electric.
2612640	2613640	Yes.
2613640	2634840	Everyone's going to complain because it's me anyways, so last week I didn't touch anything.
2634840	2635840	It's back.
2635840	2636840	All right.
2636840	2637840	I guess I just have to leave the show.
2637840	2638840	We're just out of mics.
2638840	2639840	Figure it out.
2639840	2645600	No, but here, here take my mic.
2645600	2646600	So that's it.
2646600	2647600	I'm pretty much done.
2647600	2649000	I didn't really play that much else other than that.
2649000	2655520	I did work on, um, some of my game, which I can talk a little bit about what I've been
2655520	2658840	working on and be just in specifics.
2658840	2665820	So I've been working on a health bar that mimics, um, like the Capcom fighting or not
2665820	2668120	fighting games, but beat them up games.
2668120	2674240	You know, the ones that like change color from, uh, I think it goes like white, purple,
2674240	2677780	blue, green, yellow, and then counts down.
2677780	2682760	So I've been working on that, but I'm not going to tell you for what and something necessarily
2682760	2684760	a beat them up.
2684760	2686240	There you go.
2686240	2688200	That's all I'm going to lose.
2688200	2689200	It's your mic.
2689200	2691200	Uh, it's all the mics.
2691200	2694920	All right, I'm done.
2694920	2697080	Here you go.
2697080	2699640	Here's your mic.
2699640	2701200	I blame gremlins.
2701200	2707480	Someone said the Mogwai after midnight, you know, they're gremlins.
2707480	2710120	So you're going to have to share with me now.
2710120	2711120	Loki.
2711120	2712120	All right.
2712120	2714480	I think we're, I think we're getting, we're do a shopping trip.
2714480	2716200	Yeah, it's going to have to happen.
2716200	2719440	Just don't let me forget this week that cause I can't, I, the first time this happened,
2719440	2722120	I said, you know, I'm just going to buy cause we've been using these hand-me-downs for a
2722120	2723120	little while now.
2723120	2724240	They've probably gone through their life.
2724240	2726960	So I keep saying, Oh, we're just going to buy a new set and then something comes up.
2726960	2727960	I forget to do it.
2727960	2732440	So just at some point this week, remind me Thursday night when I'm off work.
2732440	2736800	So you and I are going shopping when you were off work, you and I are going shopping cause
2736800	2737800	I'm off on Thursdays.
2737800	2740120	So anyway, Loki, we're going to have to try to share tonight best we can.
2740120	2743620	So we'll, we'll do our sharing is caring, right?
2743620	2748240	So anyway, or I could try it, but the problem is, see, here's the thing you say it's, well,
2748240	2749240	we did sub out.
2749240	2750240	You know what?
2750240	2751240	I could try subbing out my cable.
2751240	2754680	Because we did sub out your cable and we didn't need to.
2754680	2757600	So I should be able to pull up the cable that you have before.
2757600	2758600	Yeah.
2758600	2759600	Live tech issue.
2759600	2760600	Rob's going to pull it out live on air.
2760600	2762600	I'm going to try to fix my mic issue live on air.
2762600	2763600	We'll see.
2763600	2765440	Um, anyway, but first I want to talk about my gaming week.
2765440	2770080	So during my gaming week this week, I, uh, played still more final fantasy 14.
2770080	2772160	I have every healer at level 70.
2772160	2773480	I've hit everything on max level.
2773480	2776040	I can't remember if that was something I did yesterday right before the show or not, but
2776040	2777600	that was the thing I did this week.
2777600	2781940	And then I was playing the final fantasy 15 crossover event when I finished all that.
2781940	2786120	And I did the Easter event and, um, I've just been trying to up the gear level on my character
2786120	2788680	because now you can get 900 tombstones in a week.
2788680	2789960	So I've just been kind of grinding away.
2789960	2793660	I even did PVP today, which I don't usually do, but I was just, you know, grinding for
2793660	2797040	extra tombstones so I could kind of catch up on some of the last time I've been having
2797040	2798040	on Final Fantasy 14.
2798040	2800680	I am still playing Borderlands game of the year edition.
2800680	2806560	Um, I got to the second area, but just to, just to show you how, like, uh, how, why it's
2806560	2811040	taken me so long to get through it, I just dinged the achievement for completing every
2811040	2814320	single quest in Arid Badlands, that first zone.
2814320	2819480	So now I'm in the second zone because that's how I roll is I do like every single fricking,
2819480	2821220	uh, thing.
2821220	2823080	So there you go.
2823080	2826960	By the way, speaking of MMOs, Star Trek Online is going to start happening this week and
2826960	2827960	I might even stream it.
2827960	2828960	Oh, fun.
2828960	2830280	What made you decide to get into that?
2830280	2832160	Well, I've missed playing it a whole lot.
2832160	2836480	Um, I just was also going back and reading on the Wiki and finding how many original
2836480	2838160	series voice actors they've got.
2838160	2842400	Well, by original series, I mean the TV series, you know, up to deep space nine and all that.
2842400	2845600	And there's a lot of good deep space nine content, which is usually where my characters
2845600	2846600	hang out.
2846600	2850680	So I figure it's time to dust off the old rear Admiral and see what I can do with her.
2850680	2851680	All right.
2851680	2853560	So anyway, um, that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
2853560	2857080	I'm going to hand the mic back to Loki and I'm going to try to sub out a cable here,
2857080	2859640	live tech repair, but that's the joy of doing a live show.
2859640	2860720	It makes for interesting TV.
2860720	2861720	It is what it is.
2861720	2862720	It interesting.
2862720	2867760	She also knows to complain about watching you run around.
2867760	2868760	All right.
2868760	2870400	Well anyway, yeah, I keep like bending over.
2870400	2871400	See my plumbers.
2871400	2872400	Everyone.
2872400	2873400	Look at Rob's butt.
2873400	2874400	Anyway.
2874400	2875400	No, don't.
2875400	2876400	Um, anyway.
2876400	2877400	Uh, it will.
2877400	2878400	And the thing on top of that too is that I've been losing weight.
2878400	2881920	So my pants are already like not staying on so much.
2881920	2882920	We promise not to.
2882920	2883920	I'm down five pounds.
2883920	2884920	Where was that?
2884920	2885920	Yeah.
2885920	2886920	All right.
2886920	2889680	Anyway, I'm going to hand the mic to Loki and just, you have to excuse me on Twitch
2889840	2893120	while I dig around like crazy trying to fix the other mic.
2893120	2895040	That's okay.
2895040	2897200	So how about some news Loki?
2897200	2899880	I guess we'll talk news.
2899880	2907160	So the 3DS is going away because it is, it's just inevitable.
2907160	2908160	It's time.
2908160	2912280	So apparently Nintendo held a briefing for their investors, which they talked about,
2912280	2917320	um, that it would continue the 3DS business, but it was preparing for new software release
2917360	2919920	and, uh, for 2019 and beyond.
2919920	2926600	But, um, basically said that, you know, there's not really a lot in the pipeline other than
2926600	2928640	a few more games for the system.
2928640	2933000	Um, nothing basically said we have nothing new to announce regarding, uh, first party
2933000	2936240	software for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.
2936240	2939420	We can't confirm that new software is coming from third party publishers.
2939420	2943120	So third parties will support, but it looks like all the first party support is going
2943120	2947360	towards the switch right now, which makes sense.
2947360	2951000	So I have two handhelds out there to compete with each other.
2951000	2952000	Right.
2952000	2957240	And I mean, I know that they had, um, shot down some rumors about news.
2957240	2962080	I think we may have talked about last week about new switch hardware that was rumored,
2962080	2968520	but, um, that's been kind of shot down as far as like a smaller switch that's going
2968520	2969680	to be coming out.
2969680	2973120	So I guess we'll just have to wait and see what they actually announce.
2973120	2975840	Maybe at E3 we'll learn something or maybe later on.
2975840	2980800	Um, I think there will be a new revision to the switch at some point, but I'm not sure
2980800	2982320	about a smaller version.
2982320	2985400	I can't even imagine what they would do with, how would they would do a smaller version
2985400	2986400	of the switch?
2986400	2992160	Well, the, they could go down as low as any one of the DS screens, you know, and still
2992160	2993160	have it work.
2993160	2995000	But with the joy cons, I don't know.
2995000	2996000	That'd be just really weird.
2996000	2997000	We'll see.
2997680	3004600	Um, but yeah, so no first party support, unfortunately, um, going forward aside from the already
3004600	3006080	announced games.
3006080	3011640	Um, but I guess that means a lot more games coming to the switch, hopefully excite truck
3011640	3012640	is one of those.
3012640	3017500	I'm not holding my breath though, but, um, you and your excite truck more like Nelly
3017500	3022560	and excite truck, or just bring like some support for Wii games, like some of the Wii
3022560	3026080	games that use like a tilt, I guess some of those games might be a little bit hard to
3026080	3030640	play, but yeah, you probably could play that game, has the same number of buttons.
3030640	3032040	It's not impossible.
3032040	3033040	Yeah.
3033040	3038280	So I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see, um, what they announce.
3038280	3042000	But 3DS stuff, of course, um, from third parties.
3042000	3047760	So I know that they support like the DS stuff for a long time, so I'm sure we'll, we'll
3047760	3049760	get some new games pretty soon.
3049760	3054000	Completely off topic and this is stupid, but every time I or someone says it's not impossible,
3054000	3055480	Tom Jones starts appearing in my head.
3056080	3063040	Instead of, you know, instead of seeing it, it's not impossible, my brain's doing remixes.
3063040	3065040	What do we have?
3065040	3068480	Just seeing if they can still hear it or what's going on.
3068480	3070480	Is it busy sounding?
3070480	3071480	Yeah.
3071480	3072480	They say it's really bad.
3072480	3074480	They don't have to edit the podcast.
3074480	3076480	Oh, that's not good.
3076480	3078480	We'll just share it.
3078480	3079480	We'll just share.
3079480	3080480	It's fine.
3080480	3081480	That's okay.
3081480	3085120	That means that Rob and I can go shopping and, or Matt, if you are off, you can go shopping
3085120	3086120	with us too.
3086120	3087120	We all go shopping.
3087120	3088440	I'm off for the next two days.
3088440	3095440	I'm off Thursday for, well, I wanted to take time off on Friday, but then I got called
3095440	3100400	back into work because only I can solve problems apparently.
3100400	3102440	And then it just all went downhill from there.
3102440	3106160	How do you solve a problem like Loki?
3106160	3109300	I had the worst back massage the other day.
3109300	3110520	Like it jacked up my back.
3110520	3112240	I hope you didn't tip.
3112240	3113240	I did.
3113240	3114240	All right.
3114240	3121360	I was a massage therapist and if I gave a bad massage, I wouldn't expect a tip.
3121360	3124520	I'm going to attempt to move on to the next story here while I'm, I believe it or not,
3124520	3126960	I have more cords to test and more mics to try.
3126960	3132040	So we'll see if I can get through this, but anyway in the meantime, do not mix up my piles.
3132040	3133040	That is all broken.
3133040	3134040	Okay.
3134040	3139560	Anyhow we're going to move on to a story that talks about something that's got a lot of
3139560	3143160	people talking in the industry, especially, um, you know, the past couple of years, I
3143160	3148160	think you've heard more and more talk about, does this gaming industry need to unionize?
3148160	3153080	And one of the things that's very controversial in the industry is crunch time.
3153080	3156680	And the reason why I think this is relevant right now is because we've had a couple of
3156680	3161060	stories this week, this very week that have discussed crunch time in the industry and
3161060	3163400	how it is affecting things that are going on.
3163400	3167200	And one of them has to do with the mortal combat development cycle and mortal combat
3167200	3168200	11.
3168200	3172240	Um, so a report came out this week that talked about, it was actually some allegations on
3172240	3177320	Twitter, apparently from like a former developer who said, um, on mortal combat nine crunch
3177320	3181300	time officially began after new year's day 2011 of course we did a bit of pre crunch
3181300	3183980	before that just to make sure we were in a good spot for crunch.
3183980	3185360	This was on schedule documents.
3185360	3188720	This was not a wink, wink, nudge, nudge, passionate, hardworking thing.
3188720	3189720	This was mandate.
3189720	3192900	And that was according to James Longstreet who was a software engineer at nether realm
3192900	3193900	for two years.
3193900	3198940	I took one day off between January 1st to 2011 and the day, the day one patch was approved.
3198940	3203900	It was my birthday and it was on a Sunday, so it was okay if I was just on call.
3203900	3204900	So yeah.
3204900	3205900	Wow.
3205900	3210420	Um, a lot of time going into this stuff and even, uh, some of our folks who've worked
3210420	3214380	in the industry in our chat, uh, shad stars, like in our chats as I remember doing crunch
3214380	3221020	time at Konami on ultra mix two, nine to 11, Monday through Friday, nine to five Saturday.
3221020	3223980	That happened for only a couple of weeks though.
3223980	3228100	But in California, it's illegal to have mandatory overtime.
3228100	3234820	I don't, I think you can pay as long as you pay for it, but I know you cannot make a company.
3234820	3236980	You cannot make overtime mandatory.
3236980	3237980	Well, right.
3237980	3240100	And they don't make overtime mandatory.
3240100	3245020	The way it works is they basically say, you know, they kind of make it seem like you're
3245020	3250020	not going to be a team player if you don't put in these hours and they're not saying
3250020	3255140	and they're saying it's optional of course, but then when it comes time to being rehired
3255140	3260860	after the, your time is up as a contractor, you're going to be less likely to be hired
3260860	3262500	if you don't take that time.
3262500	3263820	That's only for contractors.
3263820	3268640	If you were a regular employee, which some people are, they're supposed there.
3268640	3274580	It's actually, I think illegal to have punitive, uh, measures for people who don't work quote.
3274580	3277260	Most of them are contractors though.
3277260	3282780	And I'm also sorry to say what we're hearing here is, is exactly what you're saying shouldn't
3282780	3283780	be happening.
3283780	3284780	Punitive measures and pressure.
3284780	3285780	Exactly.
3285780	3289980	So what they're doing is they're breaking California labor law in California.
3289980	3293260	Uh, I don't know if nether realm is, nether realm is in these other places.
3293260	3297100	And I honestly, from, from what Shane is saying is much different.
3297100	3300480	I mean, even though, you know, you got two weeks of these crunch time, that seems much
3300480	3304340	more like at least it's like planned out, you know, exactly that kind of like what time
3304340	3307900	period is as opposed to what we're hearing here where it's like months and months at
3307900	3308900	a time.
3308900	3313420	And, uh, Fortnite is the other big one we're hearing about is that, you know, Fortnite's
3313420	3318820	been super successful, but because they're doing patch after patch after patch that these
3318820	3321220	guys are in like a nonstop crunch.
3321220	3325460	And so what's really frustrating to me about this whole thing and reading it is that it
3325460	3329280	sounds like, and isn't this, isn't this the way it always goes, right?
3329280	3334560	Is that the supervisors and managers are barely doing any of it.
3334560	3338320	It's all, they're the ones that are leaving because it's the, you know, that their job
3338320	3339320	is to supervise and manage.
3339320	3344120	They're not the ones that are actually putting in the work, but then go figure this time
3344120	3347040	as it goes on and on and on for months and months, we're talking about much more than
3347040	3348040	two weeks.
3348040	3352160	It's going on and on for months and months is that people feel like, like that less time
3352160	3354280	at the time isn't being as effective than that.
3354280	3357840	They're sitting there for hours waiting for a new build and so on and so on.
3357840	3361160	It's just, it's really kind of gross and I think that's why a lot of this stuff is kind
3361160	3366640	of coming to light now, but it's also a double edged sword because you know how gamers are
3366640	3367640	in this industry.
3367640	3373000	If they don't make certain deadlines, that game's got bugs that aren't fixed, it's going
3373000	3374800	to get torn the fuck apart online.
3374800	3381740	That's why I super, though I'm supportive of workers unionizing to improve those conditions
3381740	3384680	and to remove this expectation from the industry.
3385680	3397960	Especially since we've had so many other unionizations occurring, especially for example, our teachers
3397960	3404880	as of late, you know, and if you know your history, you know that here in the US, companies
3404880	3411240	were quite abusive of their employees until unions made those changes.
3411240	3415600	So I'm fully in support of the industry unionizing, absolutely.
3415600	3416600	No hesitation.
3416600	3420080	And it sounds like there's just some kind of like a lot of like piss poor jobs planning
3420080	3421120	and so forth.
3421120	3425000	And I think if the supervisors and managers aren't there during all of this time, that's
3425000	3431320	kind of bullshit for one, you know, like, I don't know, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm being
3431320	3434800	naive on how corporate culture, but certainly I've been in the positions where I have to
3434800	3438400	work overtime, but it's, you know, planned out.
3438400	3440320	It's not nonstop.
3440400	3445560	I'm able to have time to adjust things so I can, you know, and usually all the companies
3445560	3449320	that have made me do it have been pretty good where it's like, if you put in a lot of time,
3449320	3453280	it's like, we're just going to give you a free day off later once the thing is met.
3453280	3457360	You know, it's been reasonable, much more reasonable as opposed to, well, if you don't
3457360	3462200	do it, you know, you're going to get a nasty review next time you have a one-on-one or
3462200	3466880	what have you, you know, or there's, we could just fire you and there's 10 million of you
3466880	3469360	out there looking for a job in the industry and all that crap.
3469400	3473720	Well, the other thing is they also don't expect people to know the labor laws in their state
3473720	3478920	either, to know them well, to know them well enough to be able to bring them into a conversation
3478920	3479920	to protect themselves.
3479920	3480920	No.
3480920	3486320	Anyhow, also it should be mentioned, I noticed Bobby is kind of alluding to an Apex story.
3486320	3492520	It should be noted that, you know, Respawn has kind of said some things sort of in response
3492520	3497680	to this because they outlined how they were going to handle Apex updates going forward.
3497720	3502600	Drew McCoy stressed in an update that he wrote about where the team is going, that the battle
3502600	3507360	royale game will still be alive and thriving, but they were not going to pursue updates
3507360	3512960	so aggressively that it will require crunch time that can prompt burnout or worse.
3512960	3516600	So if you want to make a long story short, he's saying you're going to be waiting longer
3516600	3522040	for Apex updates because we're not putting our team through crunch and TBH, I'm good
3522040	3523120	with it.
3523120	3524120	Like that.
3524120	3525400	People need to learn some fucking patience.
3525400	3528480	And you also know you're going to get quality stuff.
3528480	3534360	Whereas, you know, we heard a very similar story not that long ago that involved BioWare
3534360	3538280	and look where that crunch got them with Mass Effect Andromeda and all the issues that it
3538280	3539280	had.
3539280	3543080	And they're still behind in Anthem updates as well, their roadmap that they put out there
3543080	3544920	of all the things that they're going to add to the game.
3544920	3548920	They haven't even come close to doing that on time.
3548920	3553760	Now Bobby in chat to read his full comments said that the consumer response to Respawn
3553760	3558400	saying that they won't crunch for Apex Legends, so they won't get any updates until the next
3558400	3561160	patch was, well, looks like you don't care about the game.
3561160	3565480	Like Epic going back to Fortnite where they respect me and give me content constantly
3565480	3569640	will allow me to say, not this consumer, fuck that.
3569640	3576060	And I think what we as gamers can do is we can embrace companies that say that this is
3576060	3578480	going to be the policy and say, you know what?
3578480	3579480	It's okay.
3579480	3582060	Oh, a game is going to take a little longer to come out.
3582060	3583060	It's okay.
3583180	3584620	People only care about themselves.
3584620	3585620	Yeah.
3585620	3590460	So to that, I say, if you're those gamers, you're causing this problem.
3590460	3591620	Screw you.
3591620	3596540	Like you sit down and shut up, make your own fucking game, see how easy it is.
3596540	3600580	That's what I say to those gamers that, you know, are not gonna, you know, say, oh, you
3600580	3601580	don't care about me.
3601580	3603060	You need to stop being part of the problem.
3603060	3604060	Yeah.
3604060	3605060	You know what it is.
3605060	3609660	So, um, and I, so what I can do for the industry is to those gamers, I can say, I will fight
3609660	3610840	you.
3610840	3612980	Not literally, obviously, because I don't want to get banned from Twitch.
3612980	3615820	I'm using hyperbole.
3615820	3617740	I will cooking mama fight you.
3617740	3618740	I play dirty.
3618740	3621940	I will challenge you to a kitchen battle royale.
3621940	3623860	I am the iron chef.
3623860	3624860	So but here's the thing.
3624860	3631340	And you know what guys hasn't Nintendo delayed smash brothers games a million times.
3631340	3633660	Wasn't Zelda delayed twice.
3633660	3635260	Didn't grand theft auto get pushed back?
3635260	3637220	Aren't they quality products?
3637220	3642100	And those games came out a okay at the end of the day and we're all just fine for it.
3642100	3643340	I'll point this out.
3643340	3648380	How many people go to buy a shelf at Ikea and it's next to say one that was built in
3648380	3654780	the fifties by hand, which shelf falls apart sooner than you Ikea piece of shit.
3654780	3660780	The things that were, that people took their time with, built sturdy and used good material.
3660780	3662940	Those are the things that are still standing.
3662940	3666700	You know, how about all these old houses down in the, in the deep south, you know, we're
3666700	3670140	back East, these buildings that have been around since the 17 hundreds.
3670140	3671500	They're still standing.
3671500	3672500	Why?
3672500	3674500	Quality material, quality effort, quality time.
3674500	3676780	They didn't roll them out on a cookie cutter.
3676780	3678620	The same thing goes with your games.
3678620	3681100	What games are we still playing today?
3681100	3684900	The one for our classic names are playing the ones that people put time and real effort
3684900	3691100	into and didn't just whip it out, you know, because it was going to be a moneymaker, right?
3691100	3696340	They put a lot of effort and made sure when it was ready for release, it was ready.
3696340	3697340	Yeah.
3697340	3698340	Anyhow.
3698340	3701540	Um, so, uh, and I want to, I didn't get off my lawn.
3701540	3705660	I didn't think to really define this better, but in our chat, there's even a little bit
3705660	3706660	of confusion.
3706660	3707660	What does crunch really mean?
3707660	3711720	Um, because I, Kaijuta says, I thought crunch meant like numbers, coder updates.
3711720	3717260	So is crunch the rush and yeah, crunch crunch is like the slang term they give to this mandatory
3717260	3720420	overtime just heard in general crunch time.
3720420	3724420	It's it's the time that you have to finish stuff up before your deadline.
3724500	3728100	Sometimes, you know, remember everybody's got their different backgrounds and that's
3728100	3730540	like a fairly classic term that's been around since the fifties.
3730540	3736020	Well I'm thinking like, I think the term comes from like a college students crunching for
3736020	3737020	like an exam.
3737020	3738020	I know I've heard that before.
3738020	3742660	So yeah, I've always used it in regards to my deadlines, you know, Hey, I'm sorry, I
3742660	3743660	can't go out.
3743660	3744980	It's crunch time on this poster.
3744980	3745980	You know?
3745980	3746980	Yeah.
3746980	3750320	So if you have never been around people that use that word, you may not know it.
3750320	3753700	So I'm, I'm happy to define those types of things so that we all understand what the
3753700	3755780	industry is doing to the people that make our games.
3755780	3759420	So anyhow, I think we should move on though, Dark Soccer.
3759420	3761900	You have other news out of Epic, right?
3761900	3764100	Yeah, greedy fuckers.
3764100	3765100	Kidding.
3765100	3766100	Maybe.
3766100	3776700	The Epic Games dude, Tim Sweeney, tweeted that the company would end its exclusivity
3776700	3782700	agreements if Steam raised its revenue cut for developers.
3782700	3787380	The direct quote, if Steam committed to a permanent 88% revenue share for all developers
3787380	3793060	and publishers without major strings attached, Epic would hastily organize a retreat from
3793060	3798980	exclusives while honoring our partner commitments and consider putting our own games on Steam.
3798980	3804380	So basically you don't get it on Steam because we don't give them money.
3804380	3805380	That's it.
3805380	3813460	Unless, you know, the other thing is then, you know, is it that they want to be guaranteed
3813460	3818100	making a certain amount of revenue to cover the cost of putting it on Steam, but I don't
3818100	3819100	know.
3819100	3820100	It's kind of shady.
3820100	3824900	It just, it just seems really icky.
3824900	3828420	And then he said in a followup, such a move would be a glorious moment in the history
3828420	3834140	of PC gaming and would have a sweeping impact on other platforms for generations to come.
3834140	3837780	And then stores could go back to just being nice places to buy stuff rather than game
3837780	3841120	developer IRS.
3841120	3842980	This is the weirdest flex.
3842980	3847420	Like this is the weird, I don't know if I can think of a time in the gaming industry.
3847420	3851040	Maybe y'all want to correct me, but I'm not sure if I can think of a time where one company
3851040	3856140	is essentially trying to bully another company into what to do and how to set its revenue
3856140	3857140	is and all this other stuff.
3857140	3859340	It's a really weird flex.
3859340	3861740	It reeks of like 1920s business practice.
3861740	3869340	You might try to claim that maybe when PlayStation Sony got up there on stage at E3 and undercut
3869340	3873880	Microsoft by a hundred dollars, but they didn't exactly get up there and say, but if Microsoft
3873880	3876300	will do this, then we'll cut the prior.
3876300	3881700	I don't, you know, I just, it seems really, this whole thing is very bold and you know,
3881700	3885540	here's the thing, Tim Sweeney, I appreciate you for what you've done for the industry,
3885540	3887740	especially like ZZT and all that stuff.
3887740	3890740	You know, I have a lot of love for that game and all this stuff, but honestly, when it
3890740	3894880	comes to stuff like this, you just got a big spotlight showing on you with this crunch
3894880	3898000	time stuff and everything that, you know, the Fortnite staff is going through.
3898000	3904300	So making himself out to be a really big bully miser sort of Scrooge, in my opinion, fix
3904300	3907980	your own shit before you tell other companies how to fix theirs.
3907980	3911140	Like I know you might think you're trying to get gamers on your side by flexing your
3911140	3915320	dick like this with this whole trying to, you know, well, if the steam would come down
3915320	3919160	to the rate, you know, the word pan and all this stuff, I just, you need to fix your
3919160	3920360	own fucking problems first.
3920360	3922880	Don't, don't throw rocks when you live in a glass house.
3922880	3928000	It's honestly some Wall Street in the recession level bullshit.
3928000	3929000	You know what I mean?
3929000	3933440	That, you know, he's like, we've got all this power.
3933440	3938840	We've got so much over the industry right now that it would do, do you well to be on
3938840	3942560	our good side and do business the way that we want to, which is exactly what the banks
3942560	3944640	were doing with the government at that time.
3944640	3949440	And when you put these two stories side by side, which is why we did that in our show
3949440	3950440	world tonight.
3950440	3954120	When you put these two stories side by side, it kind of gets gross.
3954120	3960040	It's grosser and grosser, honestly, because it's like, well, Epic, we got the costs down
3960040	3961040	and all that.
3961040	3963080	At what cost, Epic?
3963080	3965240	At what cost?
3965240	3966960	There's no morality anymore in business.
3966960	3971440	I mean, well, there wasn't really morality in business anyway, but this is why we have
3971440	3977760	to have regulations and have them kept in check or else they're going to do this shit
3977760	3979000	on a larger scale.
3979000	3983720	You know, people like, oh, you leave business unregulated, then they're going to do the
3983720	3984720	right thing.
3984720	3985720	Bullshit.
3985720	3986720	They won't.
3986720	3987720	You want some examples?
3987720	3991080	Look to the early business models of US.
3991080	3994960	And to be clear, I am all for steam having competition.
3994960	3999240	And I honestly, I don't think I've said a bad thing about the Epic game store on the
3999240	4005280	show previously, you know, when it comes to this whole price war thing going on in
4005280	4009760	the exclusives and all that stuff, that is capitalism, I suppose, love it or hate it.
4009760	4014240	That is the competition that would allow both of these companies to thrive and so forth
4014240	4015800	where I have a problem.
4015800	4020840	And what's making me kind of come out here and say, you know, Tim Sweeney dial it back
4020840	4027720	is when now he's trying to like, he needs to let these negotiations and let these price
4027760	4029240	reductions and so forth.
4029240	4031680	He needs to let that do the talking.
4031680	4037200	He needs to not come out and say, oh, but if valve does this, then we'll even give them
4037200	4038760	our games to put on the store.
4038760	4042480	And he's like, so trying to get that rabble rabble.
4042480	4043840	We're the good guys here.
4043840	4047840	And if they just, if they, if the bad guys would just turn around and do what we're doing,
4047840	4053320	because we're all about the developers that did it, well, guess what?
4053320	4055220	What about your own developers?
4055220	4056760	Are you really the good guy there?
4057320	4060360	Well, especially think about how much work that's going to cause for their developers
4060360	4061920	bringing it out on another platform.
4063000	4070120	I mean, seriously, they're the he's really painting himself out to be just like, you
4070120	4073960	know, a twirling mustache, you know, bad businessman.
4074400	4077240	But if you make is easy to I'll shut the fuck up.
4077240	4078280	No, you won't.
4079120	4083320	And that, though, that type of shit, though, in all seriousness, is what businesses rely
4083320	4085640	on is like, hey, here's your bone.
4085640	4086640	Are you happy now?
4086920	4090920	And trying to just, you know, I'm not really going to say I would make a game in ZZT about
4090920	4092000	how to treat your workers.
4092000	4094760	That's that's the that's the petty crocker I aspire to be.
4094760	4099960	The thing is, is that all of this is what we have going on in the government right now.
4099960	4101000	A lot of smoke and mirrors.
4101440	4103480	Oh, this big, terrible shit's going on.
4103600	4105560	But here's this thing to distract you.
4106600	4108440	And that's that's what the company.
4108440	4109640	I didn't do it. I'm not lying.
4109640	4112040	You're lying. I didn't do anything.
4112080	4113480	Well, by the way, did you read it?
4113480	4115120	I didn't do anything. I'm not lying.
4115120	4115560	You're lying.
4116480	4117560	Stop talking over me, please.
4118120	4124840	But by the way, you know, with all of this, this is the you know, I'm sure this is really
4124840	4126880	bad, but look at this other bad thing that's happening.
4127680	4130680	That doesn't make the one bad less bad.
4131520	4134600	And the companies are trying to do this shit, too, because we have an enabler.
4135840	4140160	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, if steam would just stop having such a punchable face, we'd
4140160	4144120	stop punching them. But you know what, to be fair, and I know you're just saying that very
4144120	4149840	tongue in cheek, but to be fair, like we have heard from folks on this show that say at
4149840	4153720	the end of the day, even if they're getting less of a cut from steam, there's things that
4153720	4157040	steam offer them that are more attractive right now.
4157080	4162240	Right. Haven't we had folks that have said, I still prefer steam because of the integrated
4162240	4166280	leaderboards, the online that's there, you know, these other things that steam will do
4166280	4169560	that maybe that is worth it to them to have that greater cut of the game.
4169760	4172600	And that's fine. That's a developer's choice to make at the end of the day.
4172600	4174080	Right. So competition.
4174080	4177120	That's great. Competition is good.
4177320	4181440	I mean, especially it's pretty much the model for capitalism right there.
4181840	4189080	But at the same time, again, they need to not pull those bullying tactics to try to get
4189080	4191320	the companies to do what they want them to do.
4191320	4197800	They should let it the market control itself in terms of making that competition saying,
4197800	4200160	hey, this business practice is working better.
4200160	4201960	Maybe we should modify our model.
4202360	4204440	Instead of, you know, online bullying.
4205320	4208600	Sia Tabiri, and I'll let him have the final thought here in our chat, says that's part of
4208600	4210560	the problem with the 24 hour news cycle.
4210800	4213280	There's too much going on out at the same time.
4213280	4218280	And by the time there's any actual understanding of what's going on, people are tired or
4218280	4222120	no longer interested because it's been repeated and pulled in 50 different directions.
4222320	4226160	And, you know, you might think that comments about politics and it very well could be.
4226160	4230560	But I think that comment also very much applies to social media and gaming.
4230760	4236600	And, you know, gaming blogs and Twitter and Facebook and so on.
4236880	4239200	I agree with absolutely applies.
4239560	4246680	So are we're so used to having everything just instant and that's well and not not to go
4246680	4247560	too crazy on this.
4248000	4255960	We can move on after this, but it's also having a psychological effect on on how we
4256320	4258360	translate information on how we disseminate it.
4258360	4261160	But I think it's also going back into that instant gratification I was talking about
4261160	4263240	earlier, how everyone wants their stuff now.
4264360	4266760	There needs to be a big change, but that's a topic for another day.
4268560	4271360	All right, so this is pretty awesome.
4271360	4278200	So as I mentioned, I just picked up Breath of the Wild for the Switch and I still haven't
4278200	4283600	got a chance to play with the Labo VR mode, but there may be a better way to do the
4283600	4284920	Labo VR.
4284920	4292760	And actually, if you don't have Labo VR, but you have a PlayStation VR, you may actually
4292760	4296120	get to play it in VR with both.
4296960	4299360	So how exactly will you be able to do this?
4299720	4307000	Well, it's a little bit of it's a little bit of some complicated, I guess, rearranging of
4307000	4308680	cables, but you can do it.
4308920	4315640	So what you basically do is you reroute the video signal from your Switch into your
4315640	4317480	PlayStation VR breakout box.
4317480	4321880	And then with changing some of the cables around, you can actually get to output to your
4321880	4323280	TV and to the VR headset.
4323280	4329480	And because the VR mode works when docked, which I'm sure is just an oversight by the
4330000	4337720	folks at Nintendo, that now you can actually kind of play it in at least 3D on the VR
4337720	4340840	headset. So, yeah.
4341560	4344600	Sorry, I just have to jump in with a chat comment because Bobby is and he was talking a
4344600	4347800	little bit about Zelda VR on his show tonight, but he's saying you don't want to play Zelda
4347800	4348720	in VR, trust me.
4348720	4351600	And he's talking about that it kind of makes you sick, like it's just it's just not very
4351600	4353760	good the way it's done.
4353760	4357560	And I'm sure it probably has to do with the fact that, you know, it's really meant to be
4357560	4359480	done in like short spurts as well.
4359480	4362160	But it just it really just sounds like it was kind of like an afterthought.
4362160	4367320	And it's just like like even though, lol, we can hack it to run on the PlayStation VR, it
4367320	4369880	really just sounds like it's just not worth your fucking time.
4371280	4376560	I'm still going to try it once just for the hell of it, because why not?
4378000	4380080	Because I have a PlayStation VR, it's not being used for anything.
4380080	4380960	Just don't eat lunch first.
4382160	4386240	I don't know, the motion stuff doesn't really bother me too much, like just like how they
4386240	4391240	had I used to play on the Gear VR, the Minecraft on there and they have, OK, you can
4391240	4392960	teleport around or you can move around.
4392960	4395720	We don't recommend the moving around because it might make you motion sick.
4395720	4398080	And I'm just like, I'm running all over the place.
4398080	4400240	And it just it doesn't bother me too much.
4400720	4402000	So we'll see.
4402000	4406120	And I'm sure that there's no head tracking with it because obviously it's just the video.
4406120	4410120	So the video would be in 3D, but I don't know.
4411320	4414520	It I'll try it once and then I'll be done with it.
4415680	4420320	Well, Bobby is saying you wouldn't try it because you don't like puking, but also it's
4420320	4423720	saying is it's a jittery frame rate seems to be the really big problem.
4423720	4426640	And I can see I can see where that gets really annoying really fast.
4426640	4429480	And it just it really just feels like this whole thing was tacked on us.
4429480	4431560	And afterthought, yay, cute.
4431560	4434200	But like seriously not.
4434400	4439120	I have a feeling most people are going to be in the try once cap like, you know, somebody
4439120	4440880	can say don't do that. You shouldn't do that.
4440880	4442800	But of course. And Bobby, you know this.
4442800	4444040	You tell somebody don't do that.
4444040	4445920	It's make you sick. And what's somebody going to say?
4446040	4450680	I'm going to do it because somebody told me not to and fuck the law feeling cute.
4450680	4451480	Might throw up later.
4453720	4460800	But I mean, that's fine if you don't want to do that, at the very least, you got some
4460800	4465120	better load times out of it because apparently people are finding that the load times have
4465120	4468080	been reduced thanks to this newest update.
4468080	4469760	So you can enjoy that.
4470160	4476720	And I guess that's also working out good for the speed running community because it's
4476720	4479400	cutting down their times as well because there's less load time.
4480240	4480760	Neat.
4483960	4487720	All right, well, let's talk about other Nintendo stories, and this one is kind of putting a
4487720	4492400	definitive foot down on some rumors and things that we've been hearing previously is that
4492400	4495520	Nintendo was going to show off some new hardware at E3 this year.
4495680	4500360	At first it was there's going to be a more powerful and a less powerful Switch console.
4500480	4502440	And then that got dialed back last week.
4502440	4505240	The rumors were, well, now they're just going to do the less powerful one because the more
4505240	4506440	powerful one's not ready yet.
4506560	4512720	Well, guess what? Now, Shuntaro Furukawa, that is Nintendo's president, has come out and
4512760	4515320	basically put his foot down and said none of that.
4516280	4521320	So in a meeting with investors, he mentioned that the company does not have plans to
4521320	4523920	announce any new hardware at E3 this year.
4523920	4525120	That is not happening.
4525320	4527240	So that was from Twitter.
4527240	4531600	Basically, during an investor conference call, a person from Reuters who is on Twitter
4531600	4536600	says Nintendo CEO says no plan to announce new hardware at E3 show.
4536800	4541640	Nintendo CEO said nothing announced on possible new hardware, but it is always
4541640	4543520	developing hardware internally.
4543680	4547160	That part's not really news because we've said this a million times before.
4547360	4551600	The minute the PlayStation 4 came out, Sony was already working on PlayStation 5.
4551800	4553840	That's how long these types of things take to develop.
4553840	4556720	So is Nintendo working on a different Switch console?
4556720	4558080	Oh, abso-fucking-lutely.
4558160	4560520	Is there more than one of them based on these rumors?
4560520	4562520	Probably. Is it happening this year?
4562680	4566880	Well, sounds like nope because they just they just came out very for the president.
4566880	4568040	Nintendo said ain't happening.
4568160	4570080	Well, they didn't say specifically E3.
4570120	4572720	So maybe they'll do their own direct.
4572720	4576640	They could. They could do something, you know, around the time of Tokyo Game Show or
4576640	4579720	something like that. I know Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, but that hasn't
4579720	4581680	stopped them from doing announcements around that time.
4582000	4588760	But I I think the good news out of this is that this means that E3 well, for one, I'm
4588920	4593200	I'm totally OK with the Switch having another year just as it is like I wasn't all
4593200	4594880	about the hardware refresh right now.
4595280	4599400	So I think a hardware fresh in another year will be even better and it'll be more
4599400	4601080	attractive to want to buy at that time.
4601320	4603640	But that means E3 is going to be all about the games.
4604480	4608640	So I'm really hoping and Dark Sakura are relevant to your interests.
4608960	4613600	Animal Crossing ought to dominate the conversation at E3 this year, along with I
4613600	4616440	wish along with, I assume, Metroid Prime 4.
4616600	4621400	And we should get an E3 that's going to be games, games, games, games and less about
4621400	4624720	hardware since now they're not going to be trying to sell new consoles.
4624720	4629040	So that will be I don't think this is such bad news at the end of the day, to be
4629040	4633360	honest. Now, OK, you know, other other thoughts, though.
4633920	4638360	Shad Starzik in chat says, I was hoping to get a new revision for Pokemon.
4639480	4645440	That's an interesting perspective because, you know, Pokemon would be a great time to
4645440	4648520	pair up with new hardware, and I think that's why a lot of people were thinking
4648520	4652040	Nintendo might go in the direction of a smaller Switch console.
4652200	4657160	After all, was it Pokemon X and Y or was it Sun and Moon when the 2DS came out?
4657160	4658240	Right. I think it was X and Y.
4658400	4660840	The 2DS came out right when like X and Y came out.
4661040	4664680	And that was kind of a thing to try to put out, like a lower budget model for the kiddies
4664920	4665960	that want to play Pokemon.
4665960	4667360	Although is it really just kids to play?
4667360	4670760	I don't know. I think it's just me looking at my Twitter feed on who all wants to go see
4670760	4674440	Detective Pikachu next week is definitely kids and adults.
4674840	4676440	It's yeah, for sure. Let's go.
4676520	4678880	I didn't even like I haven't seen Endgame yet.
4679000	4680320	I don't mean to see that, too.
4680680	4683600	Girl, I haven't seen a Marvel movie since the first Avengers.
4683600	4684800	Captain Marvel is great.
4684800	4687600	So I'm sure it was. And Black Panther, I'm sure was great, too.
4687640	4689360	I haven't seen any of them since.
4689360	4693640	I just it's not that I have anything against this particular movie.
4693640	4695240	I've been treating all the movies the same.
4695240	4698440	I just haven't had time. But I do really want to see Detective Pikachu.
4698440	4703520	I will say that I just I'm just I'm really hoping and praying they didn't fuck this up.
4703680	4706760	And, you know, there's there's that buzz online that's saying that some of the early
4706760	4709520	press screening reviews are saying they didn't fuck it up.
4710040	4711240	So we'll see.
4711480	4712640	Grain of salt, grain of salt.
4712880	4719720	Anyway, SSU 100 Matt says, I would like to see them talk and show more Nintendo online
4719720	4724480	exclusive stuff, you know, that would definitely be an asset and something to help
4725360	4727200	sell more Nintendo online stuff.
4727840	4731800	Maybe E3 is the time they're going to put out the Super Nintendo stuff.
4732120	4733360	I would sure make a lot of sense.
4733640	4739080	But also, I think Tetris 99 has turned out to be a much bigger deal than anyone thought
4739080	4740120	it would be necessarily.
4740400	4745680	So I would expect we're going to see something else, something that's like small but powerful,
4745680	4748640	like Tetris 99 kind of was for the online setup.
4748640	4749640	I don't know. We'll see.
4750200	4751520	Loki, what are your thoughts on all this?
4752720	4755040	I just hope there's some good game announcements.
4755040	4757680	I'm sure they'll show more of the new Pokemon games.
4759400	4763320	And of course, Animal Crossing, but I guess I just want to see what else is coming up.
4764080	4766000	Metroid, too. I don't know.
4766640	4767000	We'll see.
4767000	4770600	All right, let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.
4770600	4772560	We're going to get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit.
4772560	4775080	But first, I actually found this like super randomly, too.
4775800	4782960	But it was there's this hacking that took place in 2018 that targeted the Asus Live update
4782960	4789120	tool. So it would affect various pieces of software with malware as it was figured out.
4789480	4795720	Basically, there's reports from ESET and Kupersky that says the same group is also
4795720	4803240	responsible for infecting a video game development tool that has infected several video
4803240	4808200	games on the programming level, meaning it's not because they're bootlegs, you're
4808200	4810480	downloading it from any third party source.
4810800	4815280	The direct versions of these are infected.
4815720	4819480	About 92,000 computers were exposed to malware.
4819680	4820600	They're all PCs.
4820960	4826880	But to be to be fair, all the or not all of it, but the majority of it so that our
4826880	4828000	listeners don't get freaked out.
4828200	4829960	The majority of this is happening in...
4830120	4831720	I was going to be getting to that.
4831720	4834320	Just making sure, because I'd be freaking out, maybe.
4834600	4840360	I know. Basically, it did occur mostly in Asia, especially in Thailand.
4841640	4844560	But there have been more reports outside of the region.
4844840	4850480	Two of the studios who were affected in particular are Electronix Extreme and Zepetto.
4850600	4856760	Their games affected was Infestation and Point Blank.
4856880	4858920	All one word, not to be confused with the Namco one.
4859360	4862600	And so if you've got those games, just be careful.
4862600	4864200	Run a malware search on your computer.
4864680	4868840	The malware does not affect functions on computers that are set to use simplified Chinese.
4870800	4877480	So that means that likelihood, that means that it was a Chinese developer that put out
4877480	4879720	that particular bit of malware.
4880200	4881680	And it actually spreads.
4882360	4887040	I mean, like I said, normally malware will spread through third party tampering
4887040	4888680	afterwards when you're getting a bootleg game.
4889040	4894080	But in this case, it is all through the legitimate copies of those particular games.
4894080	4895040	Those two in particular.
4895040	4896040	So just be careful of them.
4896160	4899400	Interesting. You know, I was just I was kind of thinking while you were talking about that
4899400	4902360	when we talk about like game development and thinking about like where games are headed.
4902520	4905840	Isn't it going to be interesting, though, when we start getting into more cloud gaming
4905840	4909360	where it's not necessarily going to be something that you necessarily download on your
4909400	4913280	own computer or laptop or other device that you're playing games on anymore because so
4913280	4918160	much, you know, between Stadia and, you know, and so forth will be up in the cloud.
4918200	4922840	Look at the source. And people what people just say, oh, the cloud, whatever, is that
4923320	4930240	these particular services are highly encrypted and meant to work on the device that they
4930240	4936360	connect to. What you have on your computer will not affect the cloud based service.
4936760	4939240	What they're going to deliver is what they deliver.
4939560	4946000	Even if you had and I know this from experience, even if you had like a bajillion pieces of
4946000	4952560	malware on your computer, it's not going to affect the content that you put on a cloud
4952560	4956520	based service because they have their own local protection and local encryption.
4956520	4962080	Right. So and so my kind of whole point is that this method of attack is not going to be
4962080	4968560	able to really work on the cloud, although I'm sure I'm sure there are evil people out
4968560	4972000	there, for lack of a better term, that would love to hack the cloud.
4972200	4980000	Absolutely. And again, the Amazon Web services and these big Web providers.
4980000	4982400	Right. Keep in mind, it's not a the cloud.
4982720	4985720	It is cloud service for this provider.
4986040	4987720	The cloud is a concept.
4988200	4989920	Not really. Not really.
4990080	4997800	The cloud itself, the term of a cloud is going to refer to each individual service when
4997800	4999560	people say, oh, I don't trust the cloud.
4999560	5001520	Well, which one do you not trust?
5001760	5003240	Is it Google services?
5003240	5004440	Is it iCloud?
5004680	5007080	Is it going to be Microsoft's cloud based service?
5007080	5009720	Is it going to be Amazon's cloud based service?
5009960	5013040	Which fucking cloud are you talking about?
5013240	5015080	There are how many clouds in the sky?
5015520	5017560	Well, I'm afraid the cloud is going to rain.
5017720	5020880	Which cloud? Is it the black one over there that looks like it's going to rain?
5021200	5024040	Or is it this white fluffy one over here that's doing jack shit to you?
5024200	5025280	I don't like cloud either.
5025280	5026120	His hair is too big.
5026880	5032640	Girl, but I'm saying is that people have this, like, concept of a cloud and it's not a
5032640	5033800	concept anymore.
5034120	5040560	It is a working system for each provider of this cloud service.
5040760	5043880	You're the cloud is not something up in the air.
5044200	5049760	It's a computer sitting a computer server sitting in some closet in whatever company's,
5049760	5052520	you know, IT location.
5053080	5055000	I got to read some good comments from our chat here.
5055840	5060360	Bob Coffee in chat says it's like the claw from Toy Story, only it's the cloud.
5061640	5063880	Bonds 006 in chat says, thank you, Jamie.
5063880	5066200	So many times I hear people say that exact.
5066200	5067480	I don't trust the cloud.
5068680	5069720	Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that.
5069720	5071560	But but you'll put all your money in a bank.
5073120	5075080	You don't trust the cloud, but you put all your money in a bank.
5075360	5081400	Same diff. Well, on top of that, most of our money isn't physical money, per se.
5082000	5084840	It's in line with money is just a concept.
5085400	5087760	Well, it's how it's becoming, at least here.
5087760	5094920	I know in other countries they're still very much, you know, physical money based, but a
5094920	5099760	lot of our fundage is, you know, people were like poo pooing on cryptocurrency.
5100120	5108440	But how much of your do you get a do a lot of people get a physical cash sum of money
5108440	5114560	into their hand and individual bills and coins that they are going to then put in a box
5114560	5117360	somewhere to save? Or are you getting direct deposit?
5117360	5119840	Are you getting a check? You're getting a representation.
5120280	5122160	That's anyway.
5122680	5126040	No, it's fine, because a Bobby, but not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but Bobby
5126040	5128520	Black Wolf in chat says money here is just a concept.
5128520	5131600	Yes, it only has value because everyone agrees it has value.
5131600	5134280	Social contract. You you just defined Bitcoin.
5134520	5135880	Exactly. That's what I brought up.
5135880	5138200	Cryptocurrency is the same difference, really.
5138600	5143040	You know, it's just the only reason that cryptocurrency was having such a thing is
5143040	5147240	because they told you flat out, no, this is your virtual money.
5148560	5153960	You know, they don't need to have cryptocurrency because their own currency is
5153960	5158640	digital. You can pay me and Travis Donovan fun bucks if you want, but the bummer is
5158680	5159880	Starbucks don't take it.
5160360	5167920	Exactly. We have no need for cryptocurrencies because our currency is already in the
5167920	5170120	ether. Shouldn't OLR have a currency, though?
5171120	5175160	Carl, do you know what a actual tax burden that would be for us?
5175160	5178840	Just we would have to register as it was a joke.
5178840	5180240	It was it was just a concept.
5180440	5182360	All right. Anyway, I know, but you know me.
5182360	5186320	I think actual logistics when for half a moment, I think something might be a good
5186320	5187520	idea. All right.
5187520	5190200	Well, before we scare people too much, let's move on to our next story.
5190200	5193840	Loki, I would, by the way, be paid in blood or in just Questbuster, just saying.
5193840	5201880	Well, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Game Boy, as we talked about last
5201880	5211640	week, there was this wonderful post by GitHub pointing out this GB Studio by, I
5211640	5215080	guess, Chris Molti or Moltby.
5216000	5217200	Yeah, Chris Moltby.
5217520	5223000	So what he did is he created this he created a game for a game jam called
5223160	5224200	Untitled GB Game.
5224640	5231800	And with that, he also built tools to basically build Game Boy ROMs without any
5231800	5237720	coding. And so he's actually releasing those tools to allow anybody to go ahead
5237720	5239280	and make stuff with it.
5239280	5241600	You can make actual Game Boy ROMs.
5241960	5247440	So if you're interested in checking it out, you can go download it at GB Studio dot
5247440	5256120	dev. And yeah, and it looks like it's pretty straightforward as far as like an
5256120	5258040	editor for games and stuff.
5258040	5260440	And maybe you can make something out of it.
5260440	5263840	And it looks like he made an adventure game out of using those tools.
5263840	5268840	And I think that's pretty cool to be something fun, kind of fun to mess around
5268840	5273600	with. And since it actually makes real Game Boy ROMs, that'll be handy when that
5273600	5275880	Game Boy Classic Edition comes out someday.
5276880	5280000	So, yeah, I'm going to check it out.
5281000	5283440	Are you going to start and never finish a game in GB Studio?
5284240	5285440	Probably will never start.
5286720	5288000	I think I think it's great, though.
5288000	5291760	I love it because we kind of have there was this and there was something at GDC
5291760	5294120	about the NES and you can make your own game.
5294440	5299280	So I'm kind of loving this whole like, hey, it's like the Unreal Engine, but you
5299280	5302240	make Game Boy games with it or you make Nintendo games with it.
5302800	5305640	Speaking of Unreal Engine, when you're talking about ZZT earlier, I was
5305880	5308840	wondering, like thinking about, oh, man, wouldn't it be awesome if they, like,
5308840	5311120	remastered ZZT in the Unreal Engine?
5311120	5316240	It's just super, like, super well textured and lit text characters.
5319120	5321080	All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
5321200	5325880	Something else I think some people are going to be hyped about is the upcoming
5325880	5328120	mobile title, Mario Kart Tour.
5328360	5332040	Mario Kart Tour is anticipated in the summer of 2019.
5332280	5337160	But if you want to get your hands on it early, they are opening up a beta test.
5337320	5340760	So you can sign up for a beta test from now.
5340760	5342920	It already started through May 7th.
5343440	5348440	And the beta test is planned from May 22nd through June 4th.
5348440	5351960	So I bet we're going to get a lot more information about what Mario Kart Tour
5351960	5354480	is around that time when the beta opens up.
5354920	5360920	Unfortunately, though, the beta is limited to Android, so it will not be a beta on
5360960	5362480	the iOS platform.
5362680	5369120	I'm going to assume that could be because I cannot remember the name of the
5369120	5372080	application that allows you to beta test over there.
5372080	5375800	But I used it because Niantic, you had to have the test wheel or something.
5375960	5379040	I don't remember the name of the app, but there's like a there's a side app that you
5379040	5382000	load on your phone that allows you to basically run the beta test stuff.
5382800	5387120	And I think you're limited to like a thousand deploys or something like that.
5387120	5388640	I want to say that's the thing I've heard somewhere.
5388840	5393440	So I imagine that Nintendo does not want to just open that up for an open beta test.
5393640	5396520	They're probably still testing on iOS, but they're probably just doing that
5396520	5397360	internally instead.
5397360	5398280	They're going to open this one up.
5398280	5401680	They're stress testing to Android will probably be a little bit easier to get it
5401680	5402480	out there to folks.
5402480	5404640	So that is my thought anyway.
5404800	5406920	I certainly don't know anything concrete on that.
5406920	5411160	So but I imagine those because you're the only Android person here, right?
5411160	5412400	So maybe are you going to sign up for that?
5412400	5414520	You can check out the already did or he did it.
5414760	5415720	So all right.
5415720	5417040	Cool. All right.
5417760	5419040	Well, let's move on.
5419040	5420880	We're going to take a trip down memory lane.
5420880	5424160	We're going to go back to a time when you didn't beta test games.
5424280	5428000	There was no there was a you know, if something screwed up in-house testing, it
5428000	5429640	was a feature, not a bug.
5429840	5431200	It's the classic game of the week.
5431200	5436760	And Dark Soccer is going to walk us down memory lane and visit a classic game from
5436760	5438640	her vault, her archives.
5438840	5440960	And this is an interesting one you picked this week.
5440960	5441880	I think Dark Soccer.
5441880	5443600	I tried to go for something a little bit different.
5443600	5446120	It's actually a game I didn't get a lot of play in myself.
5446120	5449080	I played the sequel a good bit more than this one.
5449160	5450440	All right. Well, I want to hear all about it.
5450440	5451520	What is the classic game of the week?
5451680	5455520	The game is Pool Radiance is one of the AD&D games.
5455520	5458120	If you don't know, it's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.
5458760	5462600	But it's a role playing video game that's put out by Strategic Simulations Inc.
5462600	5465120	SSI in 1988.
5465400	5467040	So some of you didn't exist.
5467040	5468080	And that makes me sad.
5469760	5473640	It is the first of TSR's AD&D games.
5473640	5477120	This is back when TSR owned Dungeons and Dragons.
5479200	5485160	But it was the first adaptation of the tabletop game for a home computer.
5485560	5489480	It was the first episode in a four part series of these.
5490560	5495760	It was the gold box series that used the game engine that was created for this one.
5496040	5499520	And it was used in later D&D titles, including Neverwinter Nights.
5500520	5501800	But the game is Pool Radiance.
5502200	5503640	It takes place in the Forgotten Realms.
5503640	5506560	If anyone did, you know, Forgotten Realms D&D.
5506840	5508600	I didn't do a lot of Forgotten Realms myself.
5508600	5513560	I played a little bit in it on tabletop, but mostly it was it was...
5516920	5518880	What did I play? Oh, Planescape and...
5521120	5522600	Great. Now I can't remember.
5522600	5524880	Dragonlance because I love Dragonlance.
5525120	5528760	Anyway, just a quick note, too, for those that are watching on Twitch and you can hear
5528760	5529880	the background noise as well.
5530280	5533160	I'm sure Darcic will talk about the multi platform, but you're going to see the Amiga
5533160	5534360	version of this for a couple of minutes.
5534360	5536360	It's going to flip over to the NES version here in a moment.
5536560	5541520	OK, because, yeah, it's hard to find gameplay that people aren't blabbing over.
5541560	5544760	Well, we took that gameplay and then we just put the soundtrack music over it.
5544800	5547840	So it worked out. Yeah, we're easy that way.
5549080	5557960	Anyway, it takes a part in around the port city of Flann, P-H-L-A-N, Flann.
5558680	5560880	You can make your party up to six characters.
5560880	5566800	You decide your race, your gender, your class and your ability scores.
5568600	5573120	You basically are just doing questing, really, because isn't that what D&D is?
5573120	5578320	Where you go on a quest and you do shit and then you get money for it and then you try
5578320	5579760	not to die when a dragon shows up.
5580520	5586120	But at any rate, you move around from the various characters, you know, for various
5586120	5591640	areas, you battle, you know, enemies as you do, and then you grow with experience points
5591640	5596120	that let you increase your capabilities again, just like D&D.
5597080	5599880	And then you have different perspectives in the games.
5599880	5603760	You usually start with a first person perspective, with the screen divided into
5603760	5610880	sections with pertinent information, and then combat is done in a top down what's
5610880	5612560	called video game isometric view.
5613560	5618280	At any rate, it was a very well received game for what it was.
5618280	5624320	Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for best fantasy or science fiction computer game of 1988.
5624320	5631000	Some people said it was a little bit too similar to other games, but the graphics and its role playing
5631000	5634120	and combat aspects were very, very, very well lauded.
5634120	5640280	And of course, you could export your player characters from Pool of Radiance to the
5640280	5641440	subsequent games in the series.
5642440	5649960	And it used that same AD&D set, so this was more like 1.5 era of D&D, maybe second edition.
5649960	5655440	And then, of course, you know, you had your exploration mode that uses that first person perspective.
5655440	5661280	You had, you know, different characters that you would meet, you would see your people lined up,
5661280	5663240	you had your character stat information.
5663240	5670320	In combat, it was diametric projection, where you would decide the actions that the character
5670360	5671880	would take place in each round.
5672880	5677120	Of course, you know, designed by your hit points, you would have different combat options,
5677120	5679240	depending on class, like your melee and ranged weapons.
5679240	5680640	Magic users have spells.
5680920	5684360	Thieves can do backstab by positioning themselves.
5684360	5689520	So it had like all kinds of different points from multiple different types of game systems.
5690360	5695720	But again, it was set in Forgotten Realms in the around the city of Flann.
5696480	5704640	It was located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, along the Beren River between Zentilkeep and
5704640	5710160	Melvant, if anyone still remembers their geography from Forgotten Realms.
5711040	5716160	So at any rate, it was, again, the first game built on AD&D rules.
5716680	5722600	The scenario was created by several of the big TSR designers, Jim Warr, David Cook,
5722600	5724720	Steven Winter, and Mike Brault.
5725320	5728920	And then it was programmed by the special projects team at SSI.
5730360	5738240	It was meant to be, it was actually created to play on Apple II and Commodore 64.
5739200	5744000	And then the game engine was used again for other series that were in the Gold Box series.
5746560	5751960	It actually did have books that came out later, so it brought out more manuals.
5752840	5759600	And it brought information from some of the other core D&D books, including The Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II.
5761560	5768600	And then, of course, there were books that came out afterwards, but there also were so many different versions that came after that.
5768800	5774080	So it was first on Commodore 64, Apple II series, IBM PC compatible computers at the time.
5774400	5777600	It was announced for Atari ST.
5777640	5785720	The Mac version came out in 1989, and it had a slightly different interface that was meant to work on the black and white Macs as well, like the Mac Plus and Mac Classic.
5787240	5793960	And then there was also an Amiga version that came out, as we were looking at, PC 9800.
5794240	5797960	In Japan, it had a fully translated version and had full color graphics.
5798320	5805160	There was the version on the NES that came out as Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Pool of Radiance in 1992 when it came out.
5805560	5811680	And it was the only version to have a complete soundtrack that was composed by Toda Seiji.
5812400	5819400	And he was also signed to Pony Canyon's label at the time, so there was a soundtrack release.
5819440	5822440	The same soundtrack also came on the PC 9801 version.
5822840	5830800	The Amiga version had extra music, but while the other versions just had like one song that would play through it.
5831520	5839160	It came with a 28 page booklet that talked more about the concepts behind it and the character creation, just the how to.
5839520	5847200	This is a 38 page adventure journal that had the game's background, so it really came with just a bunch of stuff for those PC versions.
5848800	5851680	Back in my day before I had to go to an Internet site to see it all.
5852080	5857680	Well, and then there was a copy protection that used lined up pictures, so you had to use a decoder wheel.
5857920	5860720	And after three unsuccessful attempts, the game would shut itself down.
5861320	5863280	So there were later versions.
5864360	5872960	The other ones that came out was Curse of the Azure Bonds in 1989, Secret of Silver Blades in 1990, and Pools of Darkness in 1991.
5873600	5881440	There's also a game called Hillsfar that was not in the Pools of Radiance series, but it was another D&D game.
5881440	5885040	And it actually, all these games got good write ups in Dragon Magazine as well.
5885760	5889040	You can import your Pools of Radiance characters into Hillsfar as well.
5890000	5894960	But they were just reduced to basic levels and didn't have any of their magic abilities or magic content.
5897520	5902080	It was really just such a big package, Pools of Radiance was.
5902320	5905120	And then, of course, there were novelizations that were released as well.
5906240	5916520	D&D put out a game module called Ruins of Adventure that used the same adventure scenario in Pools of Radiance, including the plot, everything.
5917080	5925080	And it actually has clues that would be useful in the computer missions as well.
5925800	5934000	And then, you know, Ruins of Adventure had linked many scenarios, which the whole thing is the core of Pools of Radiance.
5935600	5940200	So it was very, like I said, very, very well received.
5940200	5946440	And of course, it was compared to Might and Magic and Bard's Tale, both use very similar formats.
5947880	5958680	But in the long run, this game was really considered just one of the, I'd say, cores of that tabletop style of computer gaming.
5959880	5965160	And really, it was just, you know, one of the best.
5965160	5971800	And then, of course, the one that I played the most of, though, and I might bring this up later, was Pools of Radiance, Ruins of Myth Draenor.
5972920	5977400	So that came out in 2001 as released by Ubisoft.
5978280	5981000	So, but we'll go into that one for another classic game.
5981560	5983000	All right. But there you go.
5983080	5983720	There it is.
5983720	5984360	Pools of Radiance.
5984520	5985440	Your classic game of the week.
5985480	5986840	Where my D&D nerds at?
5986840	5988320	Second edition for life.
5988320	5991400	You got some people in chat that are shouting you out from that pick.
5991720	5992040	Yeah.
5992360	5993000	I remember that.
5993240	5994440	That was a huge series.
5994440	5995080	It really was.
5995080	5997000	Like on the home computing systems.
5997000	5998040	You're a Commodore dude.
5998040	6000600	I didn't even realize, oh yeah, I remember all those games on Commodore.
6000600	6001560	I didn't really play them.
6001560	6002840	I didn't super get into them.
6003240	6004680	Ultima was more my jam.
6004840	6013200	But I digress because, well, it was really the NES versions of Ultima that sucked me in because I played Ultima Exodus and Ultima Quest the Avatar.
6013440	6014520	I played those games on NES.
6014680	6020120	But what's funny is that as much as I was well aware of the AD&D series on computer, I never knew there was an NES version.
6020720	6023640	I somehow missed that they ported that to the Nintendo at one point.
6023640	6025600	And it came out, you know, a couple of years later.
6025600	6036720	So, yeah, it was very late in the the line of, you know, the Nintendo stuff and that is in the series of the game.
6036760	6037120	That is.
6037120	6043240	And I think you referenced it in your spiel, but that is early, early Ubisoft that we're looking at basically with that.
6043440	6053360	And that's kind of like I said, Ubisoft had the licensing for the release of the Ruins of Mythtron or later, which now when any Forgotten Realms thing that I
6053400	6055840	did, Mythtron or was the shit.
6056160	6062080	It's really interesting how many of those companies from back in the day are actually still around, especially when you look at the rest of the world.
6062080	6064680	And it's like, wow, all the stores we shop that as a kid are closing.
6064880	6069160	But Ubisoft still around Activision, still around.
6069360	6073880	ECA dropped the C at some point, became EA, but they're still around.
6074080	6079520	So it's just kind of interesting how a lot of those like old school computing game makers run at computer entertainment.
6079560	6080080	They were.
6080880	6085000	And they put out like a piano construction set and pinball construction set.
6085200	6088280	Those are racing deconstruction set.
6088280	6089880	And they had a whole bunch of games.
6089880	6091840	Those are my jam back in the day.
6092120	6093840	So anyway, but I digress.
6094160	6105440	Let's well, actually, I'm glad you brought up Commodore a little bit here because our break tonight has to do with Commodore 64 and a recent like kind of homebrew type
6106160	6108720	demake, if you will, that's been going around a lot.
6109480	6110720	This past couple of weeks.
6110720	6114320	So I decided to take a closer look in this quick little break segment tonight.
6114320	6114640	Enjoy.
6116160	6119200	OK, hello, everybody from my other studio, the office.
6119680	6126840	I thought for our break in the main studio this week, we could take a look at this this new kind of release for the Commodore 64.
6126840	6130600	Yeah, system that's well over 30, almost 35 years old at this point.
6131200	6138320	There's this new release of an old game, Super Mario 64 and or Super Mario Brothers 64.
6138480	6143360	Not to be confused with, of course, the Nintendo 64 version, but more the Commodore 64.
6143360	6147160	So as you can see on the title screen here, this is Super Mario Brothers 64.
6147160	6154600	I've actually muted the music here because we're on what's called what you would see a lot in the old Commodore 64 games, a loader screen.
6155320	6158320	And sometimes it has its own custom music.
6158320	6160440	And this particular one is very dark and ominous.
6160440	6161560	I'll unmute it for a minute.
6161760	6166960	But you can hear it's just like this really kind of like low, like like kind of scary sounding thing almost.
6166960	6170600	So I'm not sure and I will confess I'm running it through the emulator.
6170800	6175880	I'm not sure if the emulator is butchering it somehow or something, but I think it's just kind of a little bit of a weird launcher.
6176080	6177080	But it looks really nice.
6177080	6185360	So I'm going to mute that again for a minute while I set this up, because I'm sure Bobby's show tonight, I know he went to a classic computing show in the Atlanta area.
6185360	6187080	And I think he got his hands on this as well.
6187080	6195800	But I know a lot of people out there have been talking about this game a lot this week just because of the fact that, oh, this is kind of like a new release of an older game.
6195800	6202600	But it's not that we haven't necessarily seen stuff like Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64 before.
6203040	6210960	Folks have definitely done hacks of the great Gianna Sisters, which was a game that was very similar to Super Mario Brothers.
6211320	6218760	In fact, so similar that it was pulled from the market at one point and Nintendo shut it down, just like folks are saying they're shutting this one down, too.
6218760	6220520	But is anybody really surprised?
6220520	6221200	Probably not.
6222680	6224080	But this one's kind of new.
6224080	6225080	You know, it just came out.
6225120	6229160	And you see even here on the splash screen, it's been worked on for seven years by this zero page.
6229360	6240480	And, you know, considering the technology we're talking about here, the fact that this will run on an actual Commodore 64, this is very impressive how much of the Nintendo game that kind of shoved into this.
6240640	6242000	So let's actually take a look at this here.
6242000	6245440	So I'm going to unmute this so we can do the launcher screen again.
6245640	6253440	I'm going to use my joystick to start to get to make sure I'm in the right window here and start the game there.
6253480	6256320	Let me move my mouse out of the way just so it's not getting in the way.
6256600	6257360	And there we go.
6257360	6259920	You can see it's loading their little cute little loading.
6260160	6260840	And look at that.
6260840	6264040	The intro screen Super Mario Brothers, just like you might see it on the Nintendo.
6264040	6266080	And I'm going to hit my fire button to start.
6266080	6267000	And I apologize.
6267000	6269360	You can hear the clacking of my mechanical keyboard in the background.
6270400	6281200	But you'll notice one thing I noticed right off the bat is that it has a very faithful sound adaptation to the NES, which is interesting because the Commodore 64 SID chip was really nothing like the NES.
6281200	6283600	So they've really reproduced it faithfully in this.
6285200	6293760	One interesting difference between the Commodore 64 and the NES is that the Commodore 64 only has one fire button on the joystick.
6293920	6296480	And of course, the NES had the A button and the B button.
6296680	6299080	So that doesn't necessarily translate very well.
6299960	6303600	What they end up doing is that the up key ends up being your jump.
6303920	6307600	So when I say key, of course, here I am playing in an emulator.
6307600	6310400	So it is mapped to a key because I'm playing on the keyboard.
6310400	6325680	But if you were to be playing with an actual joystick, I'm sure you can imagine if you were actually using up to jump, that might control a little weird compared to what you're used to when you're actually playing on an NES where, you know, you have A and B and B is your run and A is your jump.
6325680	6329160	And you can kind of, I think, I think control things a little bit better that way.
6329160	6337040	So having up as your jump, I'm sure if you're using a legitimate Commodore joystick, it's probably going to it's going to cause you to probably jump at times you don't really want to.
6337240	6339760	But for emulation, it works pretty well.
6340000	6344200	It is interesting to note that the great Gianna sisters actually did the same thing.
6344720	6350640	Great Gianna sisters used up for its jump as well, because, of course, there's only one fire button.
6350640	6352560	But in the Gianna sisters, you couldn't run.
6352760	6355720	So controlling this is your run button slash oops.
6356000	6363160	You'll notice I threw one fireball before I screwed up there while I was talking and I threw my one fireball.
6363160	6365520	And that was that was the control key that did that as well.
6366640	6369120	I think that did that shell just clip through those monsters.
6369160	6370840	I didn't even pay enough attention there.
6371760	6374560	So it's probably not a perfect oops, I died.
6374800	6376120	Not a perfect translation.
6376120	6377840	If it was perfect, I wouldn't have died right then.
6378600	6383400	But still, again, very impressive considering the technology, how faithful it is.
6383400	6383960	I mean, sure.
6383960	6392560	It's, you know, those question mark blocks are a little, you know, not quite the same fidelity that you would see on the NES, the goombas especially.
6392560	6394160	You can probably see how different they are.
6394960	6396040	Let's see if I can remember.
6396440	6400960	And notice that slowdown when there's all the animations of the blocks, everything.
6400960	6403920	Let's see if I can probably really slow it down with the superstar here.
6406480	6409320	Oh, yeah, there's that slowdown about that.
6409680	6414960	I'm sure you could do some tricks in the emulator to help the game through some of that.
6416360	6422480	I'm just trying to make a beeline for the end here because I want to see if we can get the warp zone in this version.
6422480	6428720	But I think since this is a pretty faithful adaptation, I'm expecting to see the warp zone.
6428720	6430440	So let's take the lift up there.
6431040	6433160	And there we are running on top, running on top.
6433760	6434360	We did it.
6434360	6440200	We worked level four because every does anyone ever pick two or three?
6440600	6442400	I'm sure somebody out there is raising their hand.
6442400	6443680	Well, I did it this one time.
6444240	6448480	Most people would just want to go straight to world four to continue on.
6448480	6457240	But anyway, yeah, I mean, you know, considering that some versions of Mario that were on the Commodore 64 previously might have hacked like the first four stages or something.
6457480	6466320	The fact that somebody went out there and actually reproduced the complete game is pretty awesome and is pretty likely to be shut down by Nintendo already.
6466600	6469880	But you know what they say once on the Internet, always on the Internet.
6469880	6477160	So I can't exactly tell you where to get this yourself, but I'm sure if you know where to look, you'll find it pretty easy.
6477480	6481560	Anyway, there it is, a look at the ROM that everybody's talking about this week.
6481560	6487000	Very old game, very old system, but very cool to see these types of things remade.
6487280	6490240	You know, you love it when you see things like Halo on the Atari 2600.
6490240	6491560	Come on, demakes are awesome.
6491840	6493400	Anyway, that's going to do it for me.
6493600	6495960	Let's go back to the studio live.
6499160	6500880	Let's go back to the studio live.
6500880	6504320	Thank you, me, for that look at Super Mario Brothers on the Commodore 64.
6504560	6505720	Some comments in the chat.
6505840	6507160	Orange Right says, this is cool.
6507160	6509640	Quest Buster says, the person behind this did a really good job.
6509800	6510600	Yeah, for sure.
6511560	6514320	Darticuia says, I go three just to get all the one ups.
6514320	6515240	Oh, OK.
6515240	6519280	Yeah. When I was doing the warp zone there at the end, you can get all those one ups in world three.
6519280	6521640	OK, fair enough. And some conversation there.
6521640	6523680	Darticuia asking about the C64 Mini.
6524120	6526120	Bobby Block was saying, I haven't tried it yet, but I have it.
6526120	6528120	The C64 Mini and this ROM.
6528320	6534880	Bobby also adding, I'm still skeptical if Nintendo actually sent a C&D or if they just said they got C&D to get press.
6535200	6537880	Who knows? Well, if that was the case, it worked, that's for sure.
6537880	6543880	But as I kind of referenced earlier, you know, Nintendo would certainly be well within their rights to do it.
6543880	6546600	But it is still an impressive feat nonetheless.
6548040	6553200	Anyway, speaking of like cease and desist and so forth, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here in a moment.
6553200	6561120	But in the past few weeks at this part of the show, Dark Sakura has usually promoted a podcast or hyped something up.
6561120	6563960	I don't know if you have something this week, but I have something.
6564280	6565280	Why don't you go ahead and do it?
6565280	6567480	Well, because I have something on the other side of it.
6567960	6572760	I have something. I have something I'm going to demote this week and tell you what.
6572760	6574400	Go for it. Oh, Loki has something to promote?
6575000	6578600	OK, it's not really promotion, but we'll just go ahead and say it.
6579160	6580760	Happy birthday, Naoki.
6581320	6582200	It's his birthday today.
6583800	6585920	OK, well, I'm all about promoting Naoki.
6586080	6593920	Naoki of course, from Konami, who did pretty much all the in-house music in the early DDR and our roots in the old school dance dance revolution.
6594080	6595520	We did. We got to meet him once.
6595520	6597040	I think actually I think I met him more than once.
6597040	6600720	I met him once at that. You and I met him at that Konami thing where they unveiled Supernova.
6600960	6606080	Right. Because people don't know Loki was like the first person outside Konami to play Supernova in the U.S.
6606720	6607960	And let's see.
6607960	6609320	Also, and that was second.
6610480	6612200	And what was going to say?
6612200	6616040	Oh, E3 that year, that year they did the Kinect game, whatever that thing was called.
6616040	6619800	It was like the Para Para sorta with the Kinect was there that year.
6619800	6623760	Was that also the year like I just pretty much followed around Igarashi the whole time?
6623760	6625440	Yes. Dance Dance Evolution.
6625440	6629400	But like, yeah, I remember like everyone's like, oh, my God, Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.
6629400	6632920	I'm like, oh, my God, Supernova, who cares about your Super Metal Gear Solid 3?
6633320	6634320	I don't want to play that.
6635320	6636600	Everyone's like, I'm not playing that.
6637320	6640640	I think there was a particular reason we were because, you know, we did.
6640640	6642760	That was like the first time you and I got invited to something.
6642760	6647240	And you were, of course, I say you and I, but Jamie just had a conflict with the work or something and couldn't go.
6647240	6653480	We were all invited. But like you and I, we had to like sign stuff and like all this thing, because like that was
6653480	6654960	the first big thing we got to do.
6654960	6657920	And I think because that's what they were showing and they knew who we were.
6658520	6663720	Yes. And then then we also learned that apparently even though we all signed an NDA, everybody,
6664000	6669960	they had deals with certain outlets to break that NDA early because, you know, we're not IGN.
6670880	6673480	Yeah, we got a lesson in some harsh realities in the industry.
6673480	6676960	Anyway, I want to I actually I wanted to talk about this at some point.
6676960	6679760	So I'll talk about it during our segment. We usually talk about other podcasts.
6679960	6684920	So there's a big app that came out this week and they've been doing a lot of advertising.
6684920	6687600	And you might have heard about this on some different like websites and stuff.
6688120	6691360	And I really didn't want to name it by name to give it any additional press.
6691360	6696800	But I think I'm going to have to just to tell you to basically stay away from it and why I'm really unhappy with what they're doing.
6697040	6700640	It is called Luminary. And you've probably seen this on some billboards.
6700640	6702440	You've probably seen about it on Twitter and so forth.
6702440	6707480	And basically what they're trying to do is they're wanting to be the Netflix of podcasting.
6707480	6711120	So they are basically going to be offering a variety of podcasts.
6711120	6717480	And, you know, when they first kind of pitched it, they said they're going to be putting out like what, like 40 celebrity podcasts.
6717680	6721000	So like, I don't like Trevor Noah has a podcast on there.
6722040	6727080	John Cameron Mitchell, who was Hedwig and the Angry Inch and all that, has a show on there.
6727360	6730800	Lena Dunham, sigh, has a podcast on there.
6730800	6732760	So it's this, you know, new thing.
6732760	6736880	And they want to charge you basically a monthly fee to listen to these premium podcasts.
6737360	6745640	And that was my first problem when I first heard about this thing, as I said, well, OK, y'all, that's not like that's not really a podcast.
6745640	6748280	Now, if you're charging for it, right, you're charging people eight dollars a month.
6748520	6751160	That's like an audible dot com competitor.
6751160	6758720	That's what you are. You're an audio, you know, you're selling songs like iTunes or or one of those types of sites.
6758920	6761880	You're not really podcast when you're charging for it.
6761880	6766560	But whatever, because I kind of looked at the whole thing and I was just like, I don't know, I whatever.
6766560	6768920	We'll see what they do. But then the app came out this week.
6768920	6779000	And guess what, y'all? They added a ton of free podcasts, regular podcasts to this app without asking.
6779520	6780800	Really? Mm hmm.
6780960	6782320	Guess guess who's there?
6782880	6784080	Us? Mm hmm.
6784240	6786760	Well, we send them a cease and desist.
6787000	6790880	And we can we've you know, and I've I've thought about doing it.
6791200	6792360	Here's why I haven't done it yet.
6792360	6796160	I'll get to that point in a minute here, because here and I'm going to tell you why this pisses me off.
6796400	6803840	Because luminaries come from this perspective where they're saying, oh, well, all these free providers, we're just kind of like helping them get out there and all that stuff.
6803840	6807160	And, you know, they're we want to we want to spread their their free providers and all this stuff.
6807160	6809640	And I'm like, hold on, hold, wait, wait a fucking minute.
6810160	6815320	That's not what you're doing. You're using us to promote your patient.
6815320	6817000	They're not giving us any money.
6817720	6820640	Exactly. Here we pay to do what we do.
6820680	6824040	Are you saying Lena Dunham is more special than I am?
6824120	6825080	Fuck you.
6826200	6828160	That's what I have to say about that.
6828640	6844080	Like, I'm sorry, you're not going to use this show or any show to promote some type of like fee based gateway, as if there's these podcasts that are more premium, that are greater than others for whatever reason, because one, that's not a podcast.
6844080	6852400	You're selling a fucking audio book, audio, you're selling a spoken song, you're selling not a stand up comedy album, but you know, something like that.
6852400	6854600	We need to do a cease and desist and publish it.
6855600	6857960	Well, girl, it's start the drama.
6858680	6864600	It's done been started, like, you know, large podcasts that are already free, like Joe Rogan and all that stuff.
6864800	6868000	I have already sent those types and gotten delisted from the platform.
6868200	6872560	The only reason I haven't held up from anyone for a while or yet, as I've said, you know what, I'm going to give him seven days.
6872880	6876040	I'm going to give him seven days to say, how am I going to get paid?
6876440	6879920	Here's that. And I have never asked for money from doing all this stuff.
6879920	6889000	But in my opinion, Luminary, if you are going to use free shows to promote Lena fucking Dunham, then I want to know, where's my cut?
6889680	6890880	I'm going to tweet them right now.
6891360	6893160	You and hundreds of other people.
6893160	6898480	It's going to be like, where's the, when are you going to pay us back for the money that we put into our show if you're going to put it out there for free?
6898520	6904040	So anyway, please, when you see these types of things go on out there, please question them.
6904040	6907280	And when you see them like, I just, that's the part that pisses me off.
6907280	6911840	They're using all of these free shows and they're saying, oh, it's promotion and all this stuff.
6912080	6920960	And we didn't even get into the part where they were like, for a hot minute before they really got in hot water, they were like streaming it to their own servers.
6921360	6925160	And like, so that people, we couldn't even track stats if people were listening for Luminary.
6925280	6925640	Good.
6925680	6927960	I don't think anybody is listening through Luminary.
6927960	6930600	And I don't think, I think they've fucked this launch so hard.
6931160	6933280	They had like a million dollars investment or something like that.
6933280	6934280	They've fucked this so hard.
6934280	6935520	They're going to, they're going to go under.
6935640	6937400	Loki, I'm sorry, you look like you were dying to chime in.
6937400	6937760	I'm sorry.
6938800	6939760	Oh no, I wasn't chime in.
6939760	6944120	I just looking at their website, which seems stupid.
6944160	6946080	We give you access to all these podcasts.
6946880	6947240	I'm sorry.
6947640	6950320	Except you're not really giving people access to the podcast.
6950920	6955680	You can download their app on the app stores, which you can also download podcasts on those app stores.
6955680	6956480	I'm not really sure.
6957240	6957800	That's stupid.
6957800	6958440	Here's what I said.
6958680	6961480	If you were listening, OLR, then you need to ask for our permission.
6961480	6965480	If you were going to use us to make money for your paid content, then you need to pay us for our work.
6966360	6966920	Fair enough.
6966960	6968200	That's, that's all I'm asking.
6968360	6969040	Absolutely.
6969280	6973680	So anyway, I'm going to tag it with, uh, respect podcasters.
6973960	6983320	I do want to remind everybody the official outlets for this show where we have asked to be listed are iTunes podcasts and Google play podcasts.
6983560	6987000	There are some other apps out there as well, uh, that also carry the show.
6987000	6993960	And because they're not charging you money and they're, you know, for, you know, a tune in, I think actually is, would be one I would endorse as well because we did ask to be on there.
6994160	6996160	Uh, and there's a few others that aren't coming to me in the moment.
6996440	7005880	Um, but, uh, and I, I, uh, I have heard the request to get this on Spotify and I'm there's, I, I actually am a Spotify premium person myself.
7005880	7010840	I have no problem with Spotify and asking to be on there, uh, will be fine.
7010840	7014960	It's just a, I need to do some behind the scenes changes before we do that move there.
7014960	7019000	It's, um, nothing important or anything, but just it's, I don't want to do that yet.
7019400	7023040	Well, I do have a podcast to promote and they are Sacramento podcast.
7023080	7023640	Okay, cool.
7023640	7023880	Yes.
7023880	7025560	Let's send this on a positive note, please.
7025720	7029920	It's called our tour, our turn gaming for everyone.
7029920	7031520	It's our turn podcast.com.
7031520	7041760	Looks like they do board games and tabletop gaming, and they also highlight, um, and encourage the views and accomplishments of women, um, queer people and people of color.
7042880	7049200	So definitely, and I'm, I'm just going to say queer people instead of the acronyms, just because we're all a little queer.
7049600	7053120	So, um, but yeah, definitely give them a check out.
7053120	7061160	They've been here for a little bit, not as long as us, cause we old, but, um, I found them through, um, through, uh, brief.
7061200	7064280	So definitely check them out.
7064960	7065400	I miss her.
7065400	7066720	I hope she comes back to the show someday.
7067200	7067600	All right.
7067640	7068600	She's doing mommy stuff.
7068720	7069080	I know.
7069080	7069440	I know.
7069480	7072360	Hopefully she can get a break from that at some point when the kids 18.
7072680	7073040	All right.
7073040	7074080	We'll, we'll still be here.
7074400	7074640	All right.
7074640	7076800	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news.
7076800	7077200	Loki.
7078600	7079000	All right.
7079000	7083880	Well, Sega ages is doing some more games for the switch platform.
7084280	7101560	Um, on the eShop right now, you can actually find Sega ages, Virtua racing, and they've got some pretty cool features in here, including they've upped the FPS of the single and a two player modes to 60 FPS, which is, you know, far better than it actually ran originally.
7101720	7114360	And then, um, they also have for anything above that, when that can be anything from three to eight players on one console, you can actually do split screen there and that's a six or 30 FPS.
7114960	7119480	But, uh, looks, it's kind of funny the way they have the screen set up for that.
7119480	7122600	You like, it's literally just like three by three by two.
7122600	7127280	So, um, pretty neat, but yeah, you can check that out.
7127280	7132440	Um, I wonder if it's going to be coming out over here as well, but you know, we can get the eShop stuff as well.
7132520	7142080	I think if you have a way to purchase that stuff, um, and then of course we have a date now for shakedown Hawaii, which is a game I'm looking forward to.
7142080	7150920	It is the kind of followup to retro city rampage, and it's going to be coming out on May 7th for $20 on PlayStation four switch.
7150960	7151800	And guess what?
7151840	7156720	That system that everybody seems to forget about the Vita, it is coming out there as well.
7157680	7162680	And they're also going to be doing a physical version of, uh, retro city rampage as well on May 3rd.
7163120	7166800	Um, and you can get that for $29.99.
7166840	7167880	It's going to be limited though.
7167880	7171080	Only 4,800 units are going to be available for that.
7172000	7174320	Um, I am looking forward to this.
7174320	7178200	This one's actually, you see the retro city rampage is more like an NES GTA game.
7178200	7180320	In fact, that's actually how it started originally.
7180520	7184120	They were trying to create a GTA game and like an NES style.
7184440	7191400	Well, actually it was GTA on the NES, but then they found out that the system couldn't handle what they wanted to do.
7191400	7196800	So they ended up making a GTA style game on, um, PC and stuff.
7196840	7202000	And now this one's like a super Nintendo style 16 bit game, but same type of stuff.
7202360	7202960	It looks awesome.
7204960	7205520	All right.
7205520	7213920	Well, uh, speaking of things that have limited runs, um, the, uh, the company limited run, uh, games has announced that they're going to be putting out a limited physical runs of
7213960	7219280	luminous remastered, which of course was the, uh, you know, redone version of the first luminous game.
7219560	7223600	Uh, they're going to be putting out a special limited run on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch.
7223760	7227480	So if you are looking for a physical media version of this, uh, that would be pretty awesome.
7228200	7236360	There's going to be a regular release and a $140 ultimate edition for the ultimate luminous fan, which I may or may not be.
7236360	7236920	So I don't know.
7236920	7237960	I don't know 140 bucks.
7237960	7242880	That's a lot of money, but they're trying to tempt you with a special light up presentation box.
7242920	7243320	Ooh.
7243560	7245080	Vinyl soundtrack.
7245120	7245360	All right.
7245360	7245880	That's pretty good.
7246280	7252600	A key chain, an enamel pin, and a collector's certificate hand signed by Mizuguchi himself.
7252960	7253400	Ooh.
7253400	7255320	So kind of charging for an autograph as well.
7255320	7256000	That's pretty good.
7256280	7258120	Anyway, uh, the pre-orders already went up.
7258120	7259760	They went up on April 26.
7259760	7261320	I'm assuming it's probably already sold out.
7261320	7262200	It probably went out like that.
7262200	7264840	So even if I wanted it, it's probably already gone.
7265080	7268480	Uh, so, um, yeah, that's pretty cool that they're actually doing that though.
7268920	7276400	Um, also something that was announced that people have to look forward to persona five, scramble the Phantom strikers.
7276600	7289640	This is a game that is going to be coming out for PlayStation four and switch, which is interesting because they still haven't confirmed an official release of play a persona five for switch, but whatever there's going to be this, at least this is going to be a Musso type of game.
7289640	7291480	It was announced during a persona concert.
7291720	7293200	Uh, they showed a trailer for it.
7293200	7294480	So yeah, it's going to be interesting.
7294480	7297680	That means like, uh, what that's, um, what's the, what's the Musso game?
7298080	7298880	Dynasty warriors.
7298920	7299240	That's it.
7299240	7302800	The one was like kill the mobs and mobs and mobs of people.
7302800	7305920	So that's going to be kind of fun that a persona is getting a version of that.
7305920	7308320	I'm sure, uh, fans will check that out as an aside.
7308320	7313720	It's neat that persona gets all these kind of like side games, you know, because there's dancing games and you know, so on.
7313760	7315600	Anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?
7316200	7320000	Um, well more Fortnite bullshit, but this is good bullshit.
7320520	7322440	Um, Thanos is back.
7322800	7334240	Um, so you will be, this is a tie in with end game, but you will be able to, um, control the Chitauri from the movie, from the first movie or whoever came with them.
7334240	7336840	I didn't really watch all the way through the, whatever.
7337160	7340760	But anyway, the reality stone, uh, gives you health and shields doubled.
7341080	7345320	Uh, the soul stone is siphon for Thanos.
7345760	7347840	Uh, mind stone is jump height doubled.
7347840	7350440	Space stone is ground pound AOE tripled.
7350840	7357160	Time stone is knockback added to each hit and power stone is laser damage power.
7357160	7359200	And an awesome game on the Dreamcast.
7359240	7359720	Yes.
7360360	7370200	And then in other news, uh, Walmart in Canada, uh, basically they had a little bit of fun with the Rage 2 League with a special pre-order box art.
7371200	7378680	And, um, it says, uh, written around it, like incorrect key art, wrong font, and all all caps.
7378680	7381000	And it was just pretty funny.
7381000	7385040	They're saying like, here, hey Walmart, Canada, here's some, it's basically pretty funny.
7385440	7390120	So, um, cause they had, uh, unexpectedly leaked the list of games.
7390120	7393320	And so they're having fun with themselves.
7393560	7402640	So it's actually, um, the Walmart is the, uh, the, the thing where they were called out for it.
7402640	7403400	So it's pretty funny.
7405000	7405440	That's it.
7409160	7409640	All right.
7410720	7414240	And let's talk a little bit about what is coming out.
7415240	7420800	Not much because we're in April and it's, it's pretty, pretty slow at this time of year.
7420800	7429480	So, uh, we've got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age that's coming out on Switch and Xbox One and U-Boat on PC.
7429760	7430760	And that is it.
7431720	7432920	Enjoy your Final Fantasy 12.
7435760	7439240	Um, if I'm not mistaken, it is golden week in Japan this week, if I'm not mistaken.
7439240	7446800	So it's, um, it is the, as far as releases go, there really isn't anything you can get some third party peripherals and things like that.
7446840	7448400	Um, but that is really about the new stuff.
7448400	7449960	I think last week was your last big week.
7450000	7453480	So Japan is now I really got nothing to note this week as far as release dates.
7454240	7461880	Um, in the UK on 29th, uh, there's Final Fantasy, uh, 12, the Zodiac Age fade to silence.
7462880	7467680	Um, also on May 2nd is wasteland two uppers.
7468480	7470440	Um, sounds like a party there.
7470920	7474400	Um, the legend of heroes trails of cold steel too.
7474760	7475440	And that's it.
7478360	7478920	All right.
7479080	7480880	Let's go to the mail bag then I guess.
7480880	7481520	Full of cookies.
7481560	7482200	There's no mail.
7482720	7483520	There's no emails?
7484040	7485560	No, it's a promo thing.
7485680	7488640	Oh, well then that's, yeah, we don't, we don't read spam on here.
7488960	7495080	Um, but, um, well that means we get to talk about Drag Race if we didn't get any emails that participate at orangeonshooter.com.
7495080	7496360	Silky needs to go.
7496560	7497880	I didn't watch this last week.
7498360	7499760	I'm only up through snatch game.
7500360	7501680	Who do you want to win at this point?
7501680	7509000	Well, I don't know, cause Evie kind of disappointed me.
7510280	7516240	Um, and knowing what I know about this episode, I don't really don't want to spoil much, but I'm still down for Evie.
7517240	7525360	Um, my prediction for top four, and this is going to be excluding Silky from anything that exists.
7525360	7528000	So, I mean, I'm sure that bitch is going to make it, but I don't want to name her.
7528720	7543480	As I'm thinking Evie, Brooklyn, um, Vanjie and, um, she's probably going to be there, but I'm actually going to more, cause I don't know.
7543480	7545400	They're not, she's not saying enough good about Nina.
7545400	7548440	And I think they might have a kind of a bone to pick.
7548440	7548880	I don't know.
7548880	7551440	Just that she's still too quirky or something.
7551480	7553120	People don't really respect the campy queens.
7553120	7556360	I'm getting really irritated with Drag Race and the judging this season.
7556360	7558120	It's really inconsistent.
7558120	7569240	And I really feel like queens like Nina and sugar cane really notably like I, I find that I really stand sugar cane and like she's completely invisible on the show.
7569240	7571320	And it's like, it's at the point where it's pissing me off.
7571680	7577560	Like, especially for somebody that had like the best dress in the show's history that came down the runway a couple of weeks ago.
7577560	7581320	Like it's just, it blows my mind that she's just getting slept on completely.
7581480	7583320	And it's just like Naomi Smalls and all stars.
7583800	7590160	But the other, the other thing too, though, is that, I mean, if you think about though in the past queens that like, they're like, oh, you need to change your silhouette.
7590160	7590720	You need to do different.
7590720	7591480	You need to do different.
7591480	7595560	What bitch didn't change her look at all and is the best winner ever?
7596080	7597120	Bianca Del Rio.
7597160	7597400	No.
7598080	7601800	Anyway, if you want us to not talk about Drag Race next week, you can send us an email.
7601800	7604240	Participate at orange lounge trader.com.
7604520	7607800	Cause otherwise we're just going to assume you want to hear more about our opinions on Drag Race.
7608040	7610200	So from there, Loki, you can wake up and get it.
7610200	7622000	I'm just saying, uh, Sia Tabiri says, I think Nina has been doing much better than Vangie, but I feel like Vangie has been carried a lot and I agree Vangie has been carried a lot, but she's so addictive.
7622040	7623560	Like she's just her personality.
7623560	7624440	You just want to be a friend.
7624440	7625880	They compared her to Alyssa Edwards.
7626440	7632200	She's got that Alyssa factor where she could be a hot fucking mess and still you want to pay attention.
7632200	7633200	She's going to get her own show.
7633240	7634440	Anyway, I promise we move on.
7634440	7635080	So let's move on.
7635320	7635640	All right.
7635680	7636200	Uh, Loki.
7637200	7638120	Yeah, we'll just spoil it.
7638120	7640200	And Game of Thrones instead next time.
7642200	7642680	Just kidding.
7642760	7643320	I wouldn't do that.
7644400	7644880	All right.
7645080	7648960	So let's talk a little bit about, um, some new stuff coming to Overwatch.
7648960	7649880	So this is kind of cool.
7649880	7656960	They have this new Overwatch workshop mode, which allows you to create new game types in Overwatch itself.
7657400	7662160	So I guess kind of, um, fun ways to just mix up some of the rules in the game.
7662160	7667600	So one example map that they create or game mode is basically the floor is lava.
7667600	7673840	So if you are, I'm sorry, they're calling it molten floor, but you know, the rules of the floor is lava.
7673840	7677880	So you touch the ground, you catch on fire and that's the rule.
7677880	7684560	And so, um, there's a bunch of other fun things you can do and different, um, stuff you can script out in there.
7684920	7686520	But it's pretty neat.
7686520	7692520	I saw another example where there was one where people have to do emotes to kill each other or insta kill people or something like that.
7692800	7694840	So that was something that was interesting.
7694840	7699320	Um, but I'm curious to see what kind of fun game modes come out of this.
7699320	7702800	You know, maybe I should fire up Overwatch. I haven't played it in a long time.
7704800	7706600	Yeah, I haven't played Overwatch in a hot minute either.
7706600	7708560	And, uh, this kind of sounds interesting though.
7708560	7714920	I like, I like these, um, there's just, it's just begging to like have these silly YouTubes and silly contests and competitions.
7715080	7717080	This is really right up your alley is what I'm saying.
7718520	7718800	Yeah.
7718800	7722160	I mean, it sounds interesting some of the stuff they're going to be able to do with this.
7722160	7724760	So I can't wait to see in a couple of weeks what we have.
7726240	7726560	All right.
7726560	7732560	Well, if I'm making things in Overwatch isn't up your alley, perhaps making things in Super Mario Brothers is.
7732760	7735160	Uh, I know I'm looking forward to Super Mario Maker 2.
7735160	7736720	I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well.
7736800	7737600	And we have a date.
7737880	7740800	Mario Maker 2 will be out on June 28th.
7740800	7742640	It was announced in a tweet this past week.
7742800	7745120	Hey, that's my birthday week essentially.
7745120	7746600	Cause my birthday is June 26.
7746600	7747840	It's not too early to start planning.
7747840	7749000	It's a y'all birthday week.
7749120	7750480	So, uh, what do you mean?
7750520	7751120	You and Alan?
7751240	7755200	Uh, Alan is two weeks after me, so close because he's July 8th.
7755400	7760160	We usually celebrate together around the 4th of July makes a really good time to celebrate.
7760200	7768080	So anyway, um, Mario Maker 2 was dated and, uh, apparently some other things that were announced is that there's going to be a stylist.
7768280	7772000	So it's going to be a special official stylist that will go with Super Mario Maker 2.
7772240	7775040	It's going to be a pre-order bonus in Japan and Europe.
7775280	7779160	Uh, we haven't heard about the U S yet, but we're going to hope that that's a thing.
7779440	7780960	Uh, we haven't heard anything official yet.
7781000	7782240	I don't see why would they leave us out?
7782240	7783040	That'd be very mean.
7783080	7783480	I don't know.
7783880	7793200	But, uh, what should be noted about Europe and the release of Super Mario Maker 2 over there is that it's going to be bundled with a year of Switch Online.
7793400	7800920	If you pre-order Mario Maker 2 in Europe, uh, you get the online, um, Switch Online as well for a whole year.
7801320	7806080	I don't believe Europe is getting the Twitch Prime thing that we're getting here.
7806320	7808400	Granted Twitch Prime isn't free.
7808640	7817520	But it is interesting that maybe it's a different way to kind of at least give that same perk to the folks over in Europe where they can get a year of a Switch Online.
7817520	7818320	So there is that.
7818760	7820840	Um, you guys looking forward to Mario Maker 2?
7820840	7821360	I know I am.
7821360	7822280	I'm definitely picking that up.
7822280	7823840	That's like a day one release for me.
7824080	7825040	Uh, what about you, Logie?
7825800	7826760	Yeah, I'm getting to day one.
7827000	7827480	Definitely.
7829360	7829720	All right.
7831400	7832120	Anyway, I'm sorry.
7832120	7833400	I have a mouthful of cookie again.
7833680	7835160	I make some good fucking cookies though.
7835160	7835440	Right.
7835440	7841320	Anyway, it'd also help if I had the right window pulled open.
7841320	7849520	So, um, at any rate, Kingdom Hearts 3, um, uh, Remind DLC has been announced with new secret endings.
7850200	7861520	Um, so basically, um, it was announced during the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra World of Tress concert that, um, uh, Nomura, uh, announced that there would be additional DLC.
7862080	7864080	It's similar to a final mix thing.
7864080	7874440	And the scenario is called Rii colon mind, and it's going to have a limited cut episode and bosses, optional English voiceovers for the Japanese version, a secret episode and a boss.
7875160	7878800	You'll also receive a new form and a new key blade as a free download.
7879480	7884800	Um, no date yet, but, um, you know, the last thing that we got was the free critical mode.
7884800	7888640	So that was for more challenging, more challenging gameplay.
7889280	7889720	There you go.
7890720	7891200	All right.
7891760	7896360	Um, so this is kind of a cool thing, especially since we are fans of Katamari Damacy.
7896600	7905200	So we talked, um, probably months ago about, I think it was a few months ago about this website called noclip.website.
7905640	7910000	That allowed you to kind of fly through different 3d games to kind of check out the levels.
7910000	7917400	So, um, they had, you know, I think there was some of the, I want to say F-Zero was in there, but I know like they had a, maybe it was Wipeout.
7918400	7920440	Several different maps that you can fly through.
7920440	7932320	Well, one of the games that the creator of the website, Jasper wanted to have included on there, but was unable to figure out the file format was Katamari.
7932360	7945240	And of course he offered a $500 bounty to any buddy who could reverse engineer, uh, the Katamari Damacy file formats to be able to port that into his website.
7945680	7952160	Well, thankfully now that has happened and he was able to get, um, the data in there.
7952320	7961960	So now you can actually fly through, um, several of the levels from the game, thanks to some help from some friendly modders.
7963240	7964080	So that's pretty cool.
7964720	7967680	This is me now that we're gonna get modded levels because I want modded levels.
7968440	7968920	I'm hoping.
7970080	7970840	I sure hope so.
7970840	7980760	I think that would be, I'm surprised that hasn't already happened where Katamari Damacy PC has been like altered to add these new levels and things, but this, this maybe is a step in that direction.
7980760	7981080	I don't know.
7982280	7982760	Hopefully.
7986200	7986520	All right.
7986520	7989320	Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up discord.
7989320	7995680	So if you want to join us live on the show, you want to talk to us, uh, just join our discord server, vog network.com.
7995680	8000960	That's vog network or voicegeeksnetwork.com slash discord, uh, to get your invite.
8001000	8001880	And it's all free.
8001880	8002520	It's discord.
8002560	8004120	I think many of you are using it at this point.
8004440	8010560	Um, you can join in there and then you just head on over to the green room and just a shout out in the orange on studio channel, what you want to talk about.
8010840	8015560	Uh, and we'll be pulling you guys on air, uh, to talk with us if you are interested.
8015920	8019640	So anyway, um, before we get there though, I want to talk about Snapchat.
8020600	8021120	That's right.
8021120	8021480	Snapchat.
8021800	8024160	Do you guys actually use Snapchat at all?
8024200	8025600	Probably, okay, probably not.
8025840	8033000	I think it's more a thing that kids, even I barely use Snapchat, but it's because I found that more people were watching Instagram stories and Snapchat stories.
8033000	8036280	So I kinda, I kinda went over there, which by the way, follow me on Instagram.
8036280	8037280	It is at Mr.
8037280	8038360	Rob Roberts, Mr.
8038360	8038920	Rob Roberts.
8038920	8039200	Anyway.
8039600	8045160	Um, but you know, Snapchat and bitmoji are like tied together.
8045160	8046080	They own each other.
8046080	8048240	Have you ever used bitmoji at all?
8048240	8048680	Is that a thing?
8048680	8049880	No, I've used bitmoji.
8050080	8056240	You create silly little avatars of yourself and then you can like copy paste them in, in certain poses and text messages.
8056240	8058720	My sister uses it all the time when she sends me messages.
8059000	8060800	So anyway, interesting.
8060840	8066040	We've kind of heard rumblings that Snapchat might be doing something involving gaming and perhaps this is a sign of that.
8066040	8072200	I don't know, but Snapchat earlier this week launched a bitmoji for games SDK.
8072400	8077960	This will let game developers replace characters with bitmoji.
8078200	8085920	So that way, if somebody has downloaded that bitmoji and created a little cartoon version of themselves, which that does, now you can insert that in a game.
8086200	8099920	Essentially, it's basically like the Miis on Nintendo, but what bitmoji is doing and Snapchat as, as the owners of that, what they're doing is basically opening that up to other people to make a game where you would feature the bitmoji as the stars.
8099920	8103240	It's kind of, kind of an interesting way to try to push that concept further.
8103880	8115200	In a little pull quote here, they say, our vision is for gamers to open up their favorite game regardless of what device it's on and easily scan and play to bring their bitmoji directly into the game.
8115400	8126040	At the option to choose an avatar or character, gamers will be shown a snap code on screen, prompting them to scan the code via Snapchat to link the account and play as your own bitmoji.
8126200	8133720	So there is support right now for Unity, Unreal and PlayCanvas, which is a British VR company already in Snapchat.
8133920	8138680	That's, you know, especially what's interesting about that is that essentially they're saying that's not limited to just phones then.
8138880	8144120	You would be able to do this on like, if you wanted to, I guess, a PlayStation 4 game or a PC game.
8144320	8153240	And by scanning that link, then it's going to like, it's kind of like when you, I don't know, validate Netflix or something using a device code instead of actually signing in.
8153240	8154680	So it sounds kind of neat.
8154720	8157400	I don't know, Loki, you think you think developers may actually use this?
8157600	8159800	You think this is a good move for bitmoji?
8160000	8161880	I'm sure someone will use it.
8162080	8164840	I just don't, I don't know.
8165040	8168040	I don't think it's going to be like a must have thing.
8168240	8170000	But I'm sure someone will use it.
8170200	8173000	Obviously, they think someone's going to use it.
8173200	8180440	Bonds 006 in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, I actually like that bitmoji concept.
8180640	8182320	And Dart Tetsuya says, doesn't Mr.
8182320	8184400	Smoosh have an Instagram or am I remembering wrong?
8184560	8185520	And he does.
8185520	8186400	And so does Midna.
8186600	8187840	Sia Tabiri got it right.
8187840	8188760	It's at Mr.
8188760	8190280	But the Mr. spelled out for Mr.
8190280	8191520	Smoosh, M-I-S-T-E-R Smoosh.
8191720	8194000	And Midna is at, what is it?
8194000	8197680	Middle Patittles, Patittles, Patittles, P-A-T-I-D-D-L-E-S.
8197680	8198080	There you go.
8198080	8199360	Because her nickname is Middles Patittles.
8199360	8199640	Yeah.
8199640	8199920	Okay.
8199920	8201720	I knew it was like some type of play on that.
8201720	8205200	So anyway, if you want to follow all the pets of OLR, you can do that.
8205480	8211640	So, uh, Dart Tetsuya talking about the bitmoji says, remind me of what Nintendo and Microsoft did with their avatars.
8211640	8212360	Oh yeah, of course.
8212360	8214320	Microsoft had the avatar stuff too.
8214560	8220800	Couldn't you play like, couldn't you put avatars in, um, the, uh, Xbox XNA games?
8220960	8222920	That was the thing you were able to do for a short minute.
8222920	8223240	Yeah.
8223240	8226120	Cause I remember like a lot of the big downloads were avatar based games there.
8226120	8232440	So, uh, kind of interesting that bitmoji is kind of bringing that back, but not necessarily, uh, just on one platform.
8232440	8233760	So that's pretty cool.
8234200	8237920	Anyway, let's open up the listener round table.
8237920	8241320	So if you would like to participate with the show, you sure can.
8241360	8243880	Uh, you can just join our discord server.
8244080	8249280	Um, you can also, uh, send us a question in chat if you so desire that as an option as well.
8249280	8253840	So let me bring up discord here on the computer, uh, while we wait to see if anybody wants to call a Loki.
8253840	8257400	I don't know if you have any last minute stories, but I'm going to hand you the mic just in case.
8257400	8258760	Cause I'm trying to multitask here.
8260320	8262600	And I don't, unfortunately.
8262840	8267120	So I guess, I guess we'll just have to sit here in silence.
8267120	8273680	No, I was just reading up on that luminary site and how people are.
8273880	8274720	Jump and chip on it.
8276000	8276480	I don't know.
8276680	8278640	I think it's going to be a hot flash and then gone.
8279480	8280000	I think so too.
8280000	8281360	I think they botched it way too hard.
8281360	8286040	It's a, it's a bummer because they could have partnered with some of us perhaps and maybe been a little more successful.
8286240	8288360	And it's not even, it's not even about the money.
8288640	8296120	It's about the whole, like not asking and like, uh, anyway, I don't, I don't want to go out to a negative space.
8296120	8302400	I'm not going to, but I see you're on a gaming forum, so I assume we're not the only gaming podcast bitching about it.
8302560	8304200	So I'm sure there's other people as well.
8304200	8312720	So anyway, some, uh, thoughts and chat, uh, some folks following up on talk about bitmoji, uh, Kaijuto says one versus a hundred use the avatars.
8313000	8317560	Um, Tigerlaw says my Samsung Galaxy S9 has a thing called AR emojis.
8317800	8322400	Basically you take a picture of yourself and the software and the phone will create an emoji based on what you look like.
8322720	8325400	Um, the 3DS did that too, right?
8325440	8328360	Like it wasn't great, but it did have a version of that, I think.
8328800	8331080	And dark Tetsuya says, I think one of the key flings games.
8331080	8331480	That's right.
8331560	8334520	The kingdom of keflings or whatever it was called use the avatars.
8334520	8338840	So the concept of having you in a game certainly isn't new.
8338840	8340280	I think every me fighters.
8340280	8340680	Hello.
8340680	8341720	Everybody knows that one.
8341720	8344520	So, um, that, that concept isn't particularly new.
8345240	8346360	Well, I have an announcement.
8346720	8347200	Okay.
8347240	8355320	If you are in Northern California for the week end of May 17th, 18th, and 19th, it's a golden state pinball festival.
8355840	8356560	Oh, fun.
8356720	8358320	We will have some, we should go there.
8358400	8359160	Yeah, we should go.
8359240	8360720	I went last year after drag con.
8360720	8361480	It was really fun.
8361640	8362200	Thankfully.
8362240	8363920	It's not the same weekend as drag on.
8363960	8365280	We should film some movies there.
8366000	8366600	Absolutely.
8366840	8373600	But I just wanted to make sure to mention it that, uh, I will be all there all day, Friday, half a day, Saturday, and to help wrap up on Sunday.
8374240	8374720	Where's that?
8374760	8376240	Is that in Dixon or is that the one?
8376240	8376680	Lodi.
8376760	8377280	Lodi.
8377360	8379160	Like it moved from one place to another.
8379160	8379360	Okay.
8379360	8384400	Well, because it used to be the same thing as Pinagogo and then Pinagogo became a separate thing still in Dixon.
8384920	8386000	Oh, I didn't even know they were separate.
8386120	8388720	I don't like to go to Pinagogo because of the corn pollen.
8389280	8389960	Oh, okay.
8390640	8391440	And no air conditioning.
8391440	8393200	This place is air conditioning and has good food.
8393240	8396800	You know, where I still have never been that we really need to take an OLR trip to.
8396800	8398160	And I'm just like, I've shocked myself.
8398160	8398640	I haven't been there.
8398640	8401360	The Alameda, no, the Alameda pinball.
8401360	8401720	Yeah.
8401720	8402040	Yeah.
8402360	8403680	I almost went there the other day.
8403840	8404840	Um, we should go.
8405400	8405800	Yet.
8405800	8410240	I went to that place in Vegas and I have it there.
8411040	8414640	Oh, T-ara took me there to their old location across from the Liberace museum.
8414640	8415000	That's right.
8415000	8417120	Cause they moved and I had played pinball circus.
8417120	8420960	Were you here at the week I brought back video or were you not back from your hiatus yet?
8421320	8423520	I remember probably still in hiatus.
8424880	8429320	Tiger Claw just sent a picture from his, uh, what his phone, uh, took him.
8429520	8432120	That's not a bad, it's, it's not bad resemblance.
8432120	8433880	You don't have enough scruff, Tiger Claw.
8433920	8440040	I don't know if the thing didn't pick up your facial hair or maybe when you took the picture, but, uh, otherwise it's not too shabby.
8440040	8441160	I wonder what mine would look like.
8442160	8443800	Alan is supposedly getting a new phone.
8443800	8445360	Do you know why Alan has to get a new phone?
8445680	8449480	He dropped his old phone so many times that the screen is flickering so bad.
8449480	8450960	He can't play Pokemon go.
8451240	8452440	So he has to get a new phone.
8452520	8453960	One of us, one of us.
8454320	8457240	No, he's, he's not going to jump ship to the apple front.
8457240	8458120	I roll so hard.
8458760	8463000	I don't mind, I don't mind being a bi-phonal household.
8463040	8465840	We, we get the best of both worlds here in this house.
8465880	8466480	It's all good.
8467240	8467800	All right.
8467840	8474280	Well, unfortunately nobody is, uh, wanting to call in, so that's okay.
8475360	8485200	That's, yeah, people are doing that or the, yeah, if it's, if it's not in, uh, movies or TV shows, they're, they're watching the end of the world in one place or another.
8485200	8486080	So whatever.
8486440	8487320	It's fine.
8487520	8489440	I'm not going to be personally hurt or anything.
8490320	8493160	No, but anyway, uh, let's, uh, let's get everybody's final thought.
8493400	8500560	So, um, and wrap up the show first, let me say, um, as I always say here at OLR, thank you so much for downloading this show and checking us out.
8501400	8504600	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
8504800	8511040	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out there for all the consumes.
8511040	8512280	So please help us spread the word.
8512280	8513080	We really appreciate it.
8513320	8519440	Hosting on Twitch, adding VOG network to your auto host list goes a long, long way.
8519440	8520160	Let me tell you.
8520160	8525880	So if you really, if you don't mind doing that, that is like probably one of the biggest things you could do for us is putting us on your auto host list.
8526040	8527600	I know some of you have already done that.
8527600	8528400	So thank you.
8528400	8528680	Thank you.
8528680	8529600	Thank you very much for that.
8530280	8532040	Um, that's it.
8532040	8533600	I think it's time for final thoughts.
8533600	8536520	So, um, since I have the microphone, I'll start.
8536520	8541640	My final thought is, um, that music sure died 15 minutes into the show tonight.
8541640	8549280	I hope, I hope it's not going to be awkward between me and the neighbors now, but you think the party was just planned to be, who ends a party at six 30?
8549640	8555480	Maybe as a football game or maybe football or baseball or some, maybe they really were going to go watch game of thrones.
8555480	8556000	I don't know.
8556000	8557880	Is it that maybe, maybe who knows?
8557880	8558600	Maybe that shit.
8558640	8559360	Yeah, who knows?
8559360	8560920	Anyway, dark soccer, your final thought.
8561520	8564640	I've been sitting here reorganizing the time off that I've taken at work.
8564640	8567000	Cause I realized I took a whole day when only have five hours.
8567480	8574400	So I now have my time off planned clear up until, uh, July 1st.
8574880	8577720	And by the way, I won't be here June 30th for San Francisco pride.
8581280	8589840	Uh, my final thought is that I'm going to try to work more on games and playing them and making them.
8590800	8591120	Yeah.
8593240	8597160	Since you brought up pride before I pulled the plug for tonight's show, are you going to Sacramento pride?
8597720	8598800	Um, one of the days.
8598840	8601840	Did you, did you hear who they have closing the show on Sunday?
8602680	8605080	I'm so upset that we have this show.
8605640	8608880	I was actually told on Twitter, cancel the show and go see Lizzo.
8608880	8615760	And I'm, I thought about, but it's, it's like, it's like two weeks after we're already off for Chicago.
8615760	8617600	So, or for me, Chicago, you drag con.
8617920	8622520	Listeners, would you be mad at Rob for going to see Lizzo?
8622520	8624320	No, here's the, here's the, here's the, no, no, don't answer that.
8624320	8624720	Don't answer that.
8624720	8628360	Because the reality is we're going to be in Sacramento heat by June.
8628640	8631640	All those people, all that heat outside.
8631840	8633680	It's just, it's not the environment for me.
8633720	8634000	Girl.
8634000	8637280	That's why you sit in the Depot and lean out the window.
8637320	8638800	Cause you will have a view of this.
8639440	8640040	Oh no, that's right.
8640040	8641840	Because it's not the rainbow festival.
8642280	8643480	It's going to be on the lawn.
8643480	8643960	Shit.
8644480	8645800	So it's fine.
8645800	8647480	I'm I'm in, I don't like Lizzo that much.
8647480	8649160	I'm a piece of, Oh, how dare you?
8649920	8650480	I love her.
8650480	8652200	Well, but she's also a Coachella supporter.
8652200	8653160	So I'm mad at her.
8653200	8654840	Well, yeah, but anyway,
8654880	8660760	because remember the owner of Coachella supports anti gay charities as well and
8660760	8664080	has personally donated Coachella proceeds to it.
8664320	8668200	I went to Coachella in 2002, long before like any of this was brought to light or
8668200	8669360	whatever it was.
8669360	8673720	Um, and it was speaking about hot being in the sun too long and being over it.
8673720	8677440	If that was Coachella for me, that's why I've only gone once.
8677800	8679920	But I'll tell you what you're going to say.
8679920	8680520	Worth it.
8680560	8680960	Okay.
8681240	8683440	When I went to Coachella, I'm sure I've told you this story, but I'm gonna remind
8683440	8686720	you, it was, uh, the chemical brothers for the last performance.
8686960	8692960	Bjork was, oh no, get this before Bjork, Susie and the Banshees.
8693040	8694280	Ooh, okay.
8694280	8694800	I would have done that.
8694800	8695040	Yeah.
8695040	8695440	Right.
8697760	8699360	Oh, we found your ZZT.
8700840	8703120	And on that note, that's it.
8703120	8703640	Everybody.
8703640	8706960	I wouldn't go to Coachella for Susie because that means that she'd be doing a
8706960	8707640	tour anyway.
8707800	8708640	Yeah, that's true.
8709000	8710200	And I think they were that year.
8710200	8712080	So anyway, that's it.
8712080	8712600	We're out of here.
8712600	8713680	Have a good night, everybody.
8713720	8715960	Um, what, what would Susie say?
8716040	8717280	Uh, kiss them for me.
8717280	8717640	I don't know.
8717640	8718120	That's it.
8719320	8720520	She would raise an eyebrow.
8721520	8725720	One of her finely manicured, thick, black as death eyebrows.
8725720	8727080	Goodnight fade to black.
8727680	8730320	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
8731040	8736880	Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.

8744240	8748640	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those
