Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
This week, Sony's next console announcement is actually a new console!

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Not a refresh, not a remote service, no change of course!

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Hope you wanted to buy a new TV!

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll tell you what to start saving up for as well as the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice!

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 773 for this April the 21st of 2019.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, as usually is the case, in studio here, Techmaster Loki!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, I'm here.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Not here tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, she has the night off.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
She is doing some Easter events with the charity organization, she works with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
She's in San Francisco today, it's a big day for them because I think it's the 40th anniversary so there's a lot going on.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
She'll be back with us next week, but it's just Loki and myself here in the studio along with all of you guys who watch us

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
You can follow along at twitch.tv slash vog network and we come on at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm fine.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, good week?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, I've been suffering outside.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh, like allergies?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, because there's just pollen everywhere.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I've always been sick for two weeks with different things.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And all the trees are in bloom that smell like sex.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, the sex trees.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know if they smell like sex.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
No, they smell like, it's a thing.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
You don't know until you know.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm just saying.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes, because I've never had sex before.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Ever.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Wait a minute, don't you have kids?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Maybe the stork is real. Anyway, topic change.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Easter, did you guys do anything for Easter?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We did stuff for Easter like on Thursday.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, well that's not Easter.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Easter enough.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
We're just going to hide the eggs early.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Well, it's because like they did like a thing at their school that they're at.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So they did an Easter egg hunt there.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
And then we went over to my mom's house and they did Easter eggs or a hunt there.

02:25.000 --> 02:35.000
Because my cousin or my niece is with her dad on the weekends or this weekend.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So they couldn't get together for that.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And also because my mom's birthday is this weekend.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
So she's going to be out of town for that.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So everybody just did stuff on Thursday and stuff.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay, so it's not like one of those things like when I was younger my mom would say,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
you know, you got to be good or Santa's not going to bring presents or whatever.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And then suddenly on December 23rd all the presents from Santa are just suddenly under the tree.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And I'm like, but I thought Santa didn't come till Christmas Eve.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And my mom would just be like, well, I guess he came early.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It's just kind of like...

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Do you want your gifts or not?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Shut up. Stop asking questions.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I think she said that one year. I think she said, do you want me to send them back?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
You're right, this is a mistake. Let me throw these away.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Anyway, all right, let's get into some gaming news and gaming talk.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Because, of course, we are here to talk about video games on Sunday nights for two hours, three hours,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
however long we feel like it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
We're not bound by time constructs here on OLR.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We go as long as we feel like it with you guys in our chat.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Some would say too long.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Do you know how many a podcast panel I've attended where it's like,

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
well, you know, you should strive to make your podcast one hour long.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
One hour is a good length for podcasts.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And I'm like, who came up with that? Who invented that? Why one hour?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
When this show started.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, you see, that's all the funds we have in our Patreon to support.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And if we don't have the money, we can't do the podcasting.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So, therefore, one hour is all that we can muster.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I see.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
If only we had the more money.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Our audible.com and HelloFresh or whatever those things are,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
sponsorships only are able to let us go for an hour tonight.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
No. Well, when we originally started this show 17 years ago at this point,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
it was more modeled off of a like Sirius XM type of show or, you know,

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
satellite radio type of show.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And usually those shows, believe it or not, are about three hours long.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Now, granted, back in the day, we used to take music breaks because,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
you know, this was a show based on music games.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So we actually took music breaks, but we had to get rid of those

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
because copyright reasons quite some time ago,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
around the time we went into a podcast form.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So, yeah, it's a new show now,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
but we can still look back on things and memories.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And one of the things people are looking back on today,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
and I didn't even realize that this was having a birthday today

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
and turning this age, but the Nintendo Game Boy turns 30 today.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's actually April 21st, the day we were recording,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
was the Japanese release of the Game Boy.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
We didn't have to wait that long for it here in the States, though.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Europe had to wait because it's very clear that Nintendo hates you, Europe.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm sorry. I don't write the rules. I just report them.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
But Europe got it, like, the next year.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We got it, I think, in, like, August of that year.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
So, you know, all things considered, though, the Game Boy is 30 years old.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So I'm curious from you, as well as folks in our chatroom

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, did you own a Game Boy?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
No, I never did.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
You never owned a Game Boy?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
No, the only thing I owned that was of the Game Boy family

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
was I had purchased a used Game Boy Advance that I briefly played.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I still have it, but it's just a regular Advance,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
not the good kind with a backlit screen,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
no, the kind that you need, like, a flashlight attachment.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I actually had a friend that modded my Game Boy Advance like that.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Like, you could put a back screen in it, and that's, like, technology

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
and things I don't do very well.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
But he, like, for my birthday one year, he, like, modded it.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That was pretty cool.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
My Game Boy Advance is special, wherever it is, because I haven't...

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I mean, I played the Game Boy. I played my friend's Game Boy.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Okay.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
But I never owned one.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Although, I mean, it wouldn't say I wouldn't purchase, like,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
a Game Boy Classic Edition if they were to do that.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Do you remember any of the games on Game Boy that you enjoyed?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Super Mario Land, Tetris, obviously.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I played Metroid II.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
That's pretty much it.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I didn't play any of the PokÃ©mon games.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Not bad for someone who didn't even own a Game Boy.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
I got one... See, the reason why I thought it was, like, next year

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
is because I thought I was 12 when I got one, but I guess...

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Because I seem to remember I got one not long after they were out.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I think I got it that holiday.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
So I think they came out in, like, August.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I think I got one for Christmas that year.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And mine came with Super Mario Land and Alleyway.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Remember Alleyway?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
All Alleyway was was basically just Breakout.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It was Breakout.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I don't remember.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, I remember.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I like the capsule drops like they do in Arknoid.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I think there might have been, like, a little bit of that.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
But I don't think it was a very, like, you know,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
very full version of that game.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
But obviously I played a crap load of Super Mario Land.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
This is going to be, like, a real deep dive.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
You guys ready?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So I love the music in Super Mario Land so much

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
that one year myself and my friends were participating

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
in this thing called Odyssey of the Mind.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Have you ever heard of this?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
There's going to be, like, one or two people out there

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
who know exactly what this is and be like,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
oh, my fucking God, Odyssey of the Mind.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
So it was this thing.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It was, like, it was the Olympics for smart people,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
is basically what it was.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It was the thing that gifted and talented people would do.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I was just thinking when you said Odyssey of the Mind,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
it made me think of, like, Journey to the Mind's Eye thing,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
those stupid, like, early, like, computer graphics set

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
to, like, music things that they had.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Like, it's like, oh, hey, I remember that from Lawnmower Man.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That's a thing that they had.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So you had, like, these different competitions

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and all these teams would be made at different schools.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So I'm really trying to keep this short.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So we had, like, an elementary school.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
And I remember one year we did a play about, like, Greek gods.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I think I've told this one on the show before.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But one year we did, you had to make a structure out of balsa wood

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
that would hold as much weight as possible.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
You would put as much weight on the balsa wood structure,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
which is probably a thing that they do in, like, Boy Scouts and stuff, too.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
It's a pretty common kind of, like, construction type of challenge.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
But it wasn't just about how you put the structure together.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It was about the presentation.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
So we actually put our thing together.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And, yes, this is a Game Boy story. I'm getting there.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So we actually put the structure together and we did the presentation

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
and we did an ancient Egypt-style presentation.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So we were all dressed up, like, you know, like Cleopatra

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
and people that you would see in, you know, like, books and pictures

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
in that time and all that stuff.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And so we did this whole thing.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And for the music, get this, I learned how to patch my Game Boy

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
into my tape recorder to actually record the music off my Game Boy.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
And we used the dungeon music.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So for anybody that's ever played Super Mario Land

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and knows that dungeon music that's like that,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It sounds very, like, stereotypical, like, ancient Egypt.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Because I think you're actually in, like, that type of dungeon sort of thing.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
We actually recorded that music and we used that music.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But because there was, like, a little, like,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
so when the recording would stop and loop over,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
like, it made, like, a little, like, crack in it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So what we did is that we had, like, I don't know,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
one of my, I think the one girl we had in our group,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
we dressed up as Cleopatra, she would crack the whip

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
every time that that little crack happened in the recording.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Isn't this ridiculous?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
These are the things that, like, 12-year-olds do.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So, no, but that is, that would not have happened

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
if it wasn't for the Game Boy and the music specifically.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Because the Game Boy, the music in that thing was actually kind of,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
because it had the full, real stereo sound.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
You remember you could plug in, the NES didn't have stereo sound,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
but the Game Boy did.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
You plug in the left and rights and, you know,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
you'd get that full stereo experience,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
which I think Super Nintendo ended up doing later on.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So, there it is.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I noticed in chat VidPowers573 says,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Game Boy Tetris was my jam,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and I'm sure lots of other people's jam as well.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh, gosh, yes, I mean, Game Boy Tetris was, like, the game.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
That was, like, of that era when the Game Boy first came out.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That was, like, your Minecraft or something like that.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Like, that was the game everybody was talking about.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And the game that was kind of breaking through to pop culture

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
and making video games something that wasn't just for basement nerds

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
and, you know, your stereotypical nerds and things like that.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So, Tetris really broke through,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
and a lot of people that may otherwise not necessarily play games

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
were playing Game Boy Tetris.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
And in this, you know, very kind of Nintendo way,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
because, I mean, I mentioned that my Game Boy,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I got Super Mario Land and Alleyway,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
but, of course, the packing game was Tetris, right?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Everybody had Tetris, and that was important

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
because Nintendo has been very good about picking the right pack-in game

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
to sell off their console many times.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
They haven't done it all the time, obviously.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't think the Switch came with the game, right?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I mean, it launched with a stellar title, but it wasn't a pack-in game.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
They tried to get 1-2 Switch to be the game.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh, well, we don't talk about that anymore.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
They're still selling it for $50.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm never buying it for that much.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
$5? Never.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Nintendo sold 11 billion Switches,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
so maybe they've just found a different model for it now.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
But I remember, you know, the NES, like Mario Brothers,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Super Mario Brothers, and Duck Hunt,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
you know, those were great pack-in games.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Duck Hunt was great at showing off the laser, you know, the light gun.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
No, it wasn't really a laser, but a light gun.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Even though I think Hogan's Alley was a better game,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
just saying, don't at me.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And then what the Super Nintendo...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Was that packed in with Mario World?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I think it was, and that was obviously one of the all-time greats.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But then they also had the Super Scope 6 bundle that you could do, I think.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh, I think that was later.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Super Scope 6 didn't come out until a couple years after the launch of the system.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Wasn't it like Mario World, Dr. Mario, or they didn't have Dr. Mario?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
No, there was like Mario All-Stars later, but anyway.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And then, of course, there was the Wii and Wii Sports,

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
which, again, I think the Wii and Wii Sports is the closest analogy to the Game Boy and Tetris,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
because people weren't buying a Wii for the Wii.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
They were buying it to play Wii Tennis.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And I think a lot of people were buying the Game Boy at the time to play Tetris,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
because that was everywhere at that time.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And, you know, in many ways, still is,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
as Tetris is in some ways experiencing a renaissance,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
thanks to things like Tetris Effect and Tetris 99,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
and even deeper cuts on the internet and the fandom behind things like the Grandmaster and stuff like that.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So, you know, Tetris, obviously, is huge.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
But that was a big thing on the Game Boy.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
Link cable, right? You could actually play against your friends,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
and it made Tetris a competitive game, which it really wasn't before,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
because most people hadn't experienced the Tengen Tetris game.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That's just the reality.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
I know probably many of you know all about that and how it did have a versus mode,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
but for the most part, because of Nintendo shutting that down fast,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
most people weren't aware of that.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So it really wasn't until the Game Boy Tetris that, you know, that was everywhere.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
But some other games I remember on the Game Boy,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I remember a pinball game that I used to play with my friend

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
that we used the link cable on all the time called Revenge of the Gator.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
We played the shit out of that game.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And that was, it had a versus mode in it where, like,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
it was supposed to be a pinball table that, like,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
you're supposed to imagine it was, like, a tent type of thing.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And so you could knock the ball so much it would actually go on the other side.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Kind of like air hockey, I guess, but like a pinball table.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And so that game was a lot of fun. I liked that game a lot.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And then I didn't get into Pokemon when it first came out,

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
but when they did a bundle later on that they I think the first Game Boy color

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
I ended up buying was the Pikachu Game Boy color,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
where when you turn it on, the little power light was his cheeks,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
because adorable, right? So I bought that.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And then that either came with Pokemon Yellow or it was really cheap to get them both.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So I bought that years later when I was in college.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
So but I have good memories of the Game Boy,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
even if, you know, you were talking about with the Game Boy Advance,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
the lighting, right? You could not play those things in the dark.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
They sold little, like, did you ever have like, oh, you didn't own a Game Boy.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Did you ever see anybody?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
No, I saw that in the magazine.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
The magnifying glass thing with the additional speakers on the sides and the light.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, I saw the pictures.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
I love this story from Mir Muse in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOC Network.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
My mom is 80. Yesterday, she was telling me about a game on her phone

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
where different colored shapes fall from the sky and you fill in lines

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
and they disappear. She just discovered Tetris.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I love that, though. That's cute.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
And it also goes to show the staying power of such a, like, simple concept.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
Like Tetris is to video games like what chess is to board games,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I think in many ways, like it's or checkers.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I mean, I guess not everybody necessarily knows how to play chess.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
It is a little more complicated, but or maybe maybe a better analogy would be something like,

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't know, like blackjack or basic five card poker is to a deck of cards.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Like everybody kind of experiences that one at some point. Right.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah. Whereas maybe not necessarily everybody plays something like,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
you know, cribbage with a deck of cards.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
You got to really find or learn or what's the what's the one with the specialized deck?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
P. Knuckle. You're play P. Knuckle.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
No, not a lot of people have because I'm not elderly.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
See, my grandparents taught me how to play all these games.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
You're not helping the argument, but not everybody necessarily knows things like,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
oh, I don't know, Far Cry five or, you know, those types of things.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
But see, that that's the thing with like even like Far Cry five,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
like now that we bring it up and I was complaining about it on Bobby the wrong game.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
It's so like, you know, we're talking about games getting better and better graphics and stuff.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
And that's kind of what the industry seems to be trying to do to push things forward.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
But like Far Cry, it's been the same damn game for like the last three games, three or four games.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
It's been the same damn game, just like reskinned in a different theme.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And it's the same thing all over again.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
It's the match three equivalent of the FPS genre, I guess.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
Or Madden, which everybody jokes is roster update, which is why EA tries so hard to show,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
hey, here's what we're doing in like the single player campaign and all these other features.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Then everybody yells at EA for why are you showing off all this bullshit when we just want to play football?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Well, Madden is the only football game period that you can buy, so.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
Well, it's the only official NFL because what, Mutant Football League is a football game, right?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You know, you know, I guess.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah, that's what I thought. That's what I thought. All right. Anyway, so I don't know anything else to say about the Game Boy.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
I mean, if you think about it, the Game Boy is really like the derivatives that we have to today

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
with the 3DS or even in some ways mobile phones.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
You know, I've seen and I don't I don't know why I don't have one, but I've seen so many cases for mobile phones that look like Game Boys,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
you know, because honestly, the shape is not I mean, Game Boys are even heavy.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
They have a thing that works with the Game Boy emulators.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
They can actually plug your phone into that looks like it has the buttons and everything.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
So, yeah, that's that's silly, but fun. Yeah, no, no, it's cool.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I mean, probably cost the same amount as buying a Game Boy, but yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
You think Nintendo will do a Game Boy Classic at some point?

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
I'm sure they could. That's a little bit more engineering because they can't just use the same thing that they were using for the SNES Classic and stuff like that,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
because, well, that is powerful enough to run it.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
You have to run it off battery now and fit it into the size that it would be.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
So I don't know if they would do that or maybe just skip ahead to like a Game Boy Advance Game Boy.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I don't know.

17:37.000 --> 17:45.000
VidPower573 in chat says that feeling of not being able to see the Game Boy screen at nighttime when in a car except under a street lamp.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Yes, I know that feel very well.

17:47.000 --> 17:56.000
But, you know, they actually they really encourage or they encourage people at the time not to play in the car because I guess it's supposed to make you sick or you're more if you're more prone to motion.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, you get motion sick.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I mean, I guess that's technically still a thing today.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yes, it is.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
But I don't know if it's just a thing that like we condition kids at a younger age.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Have you done this to your kids where like you're in the you're driving the broccoli farm.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
OK, right. And are we there yet?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Are we there right over there? Shut up and watch this.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
No, they had screens the entire time.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
The way down there are fine.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
On the way back, my youngest son threw up because he got car sick.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Oh, no, because I was going to think maybe we're just conditioning him at a younger age.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
No, no, no.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
It can happen.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
It can still happen.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But they somehow they're on the way back.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
We've done it before.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Like they've we've driven down to the Bay Area and they've been fine.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
So that's why I thought, OK, well, they're fine this time.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
They're fine when we came up.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
You know, they should be fine going back.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
But for whatever reason, like he said that he was not feeling well here.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
He knew he wasn't feeling well, but he didn't say anything until it was too late.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Because if he said like, I don't feel well, I said, put your screens away right now.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And I would open the window or something for him.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
But like he waited too long and he made himself sick.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
So yikes is some other folks in chat confessing they've been motion sick as well.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Why we are saying I definitely got motion sick playing Game Boy games.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
That's what I'm saying.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Oh, yeah, I discovered Carson is playing Game Boy in the car.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
That never happened to me.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
The only time I ever got motion sick was when I was on a boat because I went on a cruise at a younger age,

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
which is funny because now I'm going to be going on a cruise for the very first time in my adult life early next year.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
But everybody's already telling me about like there's this patch and there's these there's like a wrist.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So there there's already all these tricks people are telling me like.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And I don't know if like modern like cruise ships rock as much.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Probably not. I mean, the boat we were on in the 80s was a boat.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
It was a boat. We'll leave it at that.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And I seem to remember doing other things like I don't know if you ever did these weird type of trips in school,

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
but I remember in like sixth grade, we spent the night on a boat in like the San Francisco Bay.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
No, I did that.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I remember something like that.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
But I remember there was one thing that one time, though, I did take a fit.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
We were taking a ferry to Alcatraz and I felt seasick on that.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
I didn't get sick, but I felt nauseous on that one.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, I've done those. I've done like the ferry to Victoria Island in Canada.

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
But like I've also taken a ferry around like everything and I was fine.

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
But I think the difference was the ferry to Alcatraz inside, whereas, you know, going there just around Alcatraz,

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
I was outside in that like. So I think the air probably did.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
You know, you can detect the motion a little bit better, maybe.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Whereas when you're inside, you think it's supposed to be like flattened, but it's really rocking suddenly.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And so it throws you off. I don't know.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
I normally don't get like sick on boats either, but I haven't been on a cruise ship before.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So I don't know. Well, I'm I'm sure it'll be fine.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You know, and even Bobby's and Chaz and you're going to be fine.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
No, I'm sure I'll be. I'll take the precaution.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
I'll get the little bracelet and have some drip because, you know, I'd rather buy the Dramamine cheap in advance.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, yeah. Try to buy it. Oh, yeah. My wife, she took that going down to the or we we took it.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
We bought it going down and she took some of that. She's like, oh, yeah, I feel great after taking this stuff.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
So that's the way to go. Interesting. All right. Well, you know, I'll I'll be prepared.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
There's nothing wrong with that. Right. Anyway, I don't know how we got from Gameboy discussion of that, but we did.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I actually had to kick off topics tonight because obviously we have the Gameboy celebrating an anniversary.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
But today is also Easter for many people celebrating the Easter holiday today.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
So happy Easter to those that are indulging in the holiday today.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
But of course, Easter. The funny thing is when you kind of think about video games and the word Easter

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
and something that's kind of synonymous with Easter, Easter eggs, that definitely means something in the gaming world.

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
Right. That means hidden gems, hidden little things that you love in video games, little secrets, probably to kind of start off.

21:44.000 --> 21:52.000
And I'm going to ask, of course, what are your some of what are some of your favorite Easter eggs that you've come across in video games or something you'd like to show off or what have you.

21:52.000 --> 22:03.000
And of course, one of the first probably the first one was way back on the Atari 2600, a game called Adventure, where you played a hero that was noted by a little yellow square that would go around.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
And I'm sorry, I wasn't able to get B-roll video in time today, but I had a very busy weekend.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
But you played this little yellow square that went around and, you know, went around mazes and things.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But there was a certain combination of things you could do.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
You could kind of walk through one of the walls and you would actually see created by.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And I think the initials, I remember it showed the whole name.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
No, it was the whole name.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Was the whole name because I scroll you scrolled like vertically. Right. Yeah.

22:25.000 --> 22:35.000
Yeah. So but that was a big deal at the time because Atari was kind of infamous for not really giving the game designers any credit, which certainly isn't the case now in games.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Right. Like some of our game designers have turned into like celebrities. Right.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Like, remember, like Cliffie B and Gears of War and all that stuff.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
And, you know, some of our or Sid Meier, like I'll play anything with his name on it.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Right. You know, it's kind of it's almost like with movies, like a Spielberg.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
Or. Well, yeah, sure. So anyway, but back in the day, Atari was like very big on the input like you.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
It was an Atari. They were paying you to make a game for them.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
So and this is why many people left Atari for a rival company that was.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, that was making games for Atari, but a different, you know, game maker named Activision at the time.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
And believe it or not, believe it or not, there was a point in time, Loki, when Activision was like the more progressive, cool.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
You want to be their company in video games because they would credit their designers in the manual.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
And, you know, they were putting things out like David Crane's Pitfall, you know, and things like that.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
So now the only credits they care about the ones that you pay for with real world money to buy in-game loot.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
Let's see. Bobby Blackwell points out Tom Clancy, famed game designer.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
Sometimes the source material, the author, James Bond, his name shows up in a lot of games, too, right?

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
GoldenEye, 007. Yeah, he did. They did some PlayStation 2 games.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess the only one that people really loved was GoldenEye. But anyway.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
But anyway, Easter eggs. What are some of your favorite little hidden things in games?

24:05.000 --> 24:15.000
I remember the old Apogee games they used to have on the designer's birthdays and during certain holidays.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
I think April Fool's Day was also they would kind of do an alternate version of the theme song for like during the credits roll.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
It would be like them singing it almost, but really terribly.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
And then they would have like there is one of the games they played that they like lizards and stuff replacing the spaceships.

24:33.000 --> 24:41.000
And like silly things like that. Yeah, I remember talking about Apogee made me think of like all those shareware games back in the day.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
And one of the biggest shareware games out there was Doom. And I think it was in Doom 2.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
There was a secret room you could go in and like the creator's head was on a pike in the room. Remember that?

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah. Oh, speaking of heads popping up, Mortal Kombat. That was like Mortal Kombat 2 specifically.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
It was that was one of the most infamous ones. Right. When you would, you know, do the uppercase.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
And like once in a once in a blue moon, the little guy would come out of the corner toasty. Right.

25:04.000 --> 25:12.000
Ed Boon was Ed Boon. Yeah. Yeah. But like it was one of those things that everybody would be like, I swear I saw it like I swear this thing happened.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
Because you know why I think that kind of happened was because with Street Fighter.

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
Do you remember like everybody was like, there's the move in Street Fighter where like you can handcuff somebody to you if you dial.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
Remember how like every kid was convinced that was a thing. In reality, that was not a thing.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
Unless there was like a Chinese bootleg hack that I think had a sprite motion that looked like that.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
So it's like either the kid was making it up or they had a friend that played the Chinese bootleg,

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
which is probably also explains the red fireball in the early editions of Street Fighter.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Obviously, they made that can the black belt edition, all the knockoffs, all the bootlegs.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
But I think that's funny that like Mortal Kombat did the very intentional, like, you know, toasty thing in it,

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
as well as Pong showed up in the arcade. Right. If you played like what, 250 times or something, it's a lot of quarters.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
You would get Pong that would show up. And I think that was in the Super Nintendo version as well.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah. Remember, it's been a long time. I don't think I ever sat down with the game long enough to unlock it.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
That takes a lot of work, but that was the thing that you could do. Let's see.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Bobby Black Wolf says the sim copter Easter egg. Oh, I do.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
I do remember this one being pretty infamous, but I don't remember the story off the top of my head.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
So now he's making me go to the wiki to look it up. I just. Yeah, it's a lot of it.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Was it the gay sex one? Oh, it was.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
That was sim copter. I thought that was in power. Sim copter. Oh, OK.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Why did I think it was Sim towers close? OK, so. OK, is that OK? Well, then, no.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
How have I never seen that one? I knew of that. The game.

26:51.000 --> 27:00.000
It was discovered that designer Jacques Servin inserted an Easter egg that generated shirtless himbos.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Male bimbos. That's a new term I've learned today to a himbo.

27:04.000 --> 27:12.000
You ever heard that? A himbo in speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other and appeared in great numbers on certain dates,

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
such as Friday the 13th. Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering module,

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
usually reserved for a fog piercing runway landing lights so they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weather.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
The egg caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter where they would be slashed up by the blades

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
and then need to be airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
The egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Well, you know what? Jacques Servin, wherever you are, you're the MVP of the week.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
That's it. I need to go look that one up on YouTube or something. That sounds hilarious.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
I knew that was a thing, but I thought that was in Sim Tower for some reason.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
But I mean, there were like a million Sim games at the time, right?

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
We because one Sim City did really well. Not only did we get Sim Earth, but we got Sim Ant.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
That was an underrated classic, though. Sim Ant was badass. But anyway, I'm curious what other games that guy made.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
It sounds like he doesn't really make it. No, he's a former Maxis employee and that's really the only...

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
He started a bulletin board called RTMark. That's really all the other things I noticed that are mentioned there. Interesting.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Bobby Blackwolf is asking, were their nipples ray traced?

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Well, we didn't have the technology then, but maybe in the future.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
We do now.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Stay tuned, everybody.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
We have the technology. We can remake it.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Alright, what other Easter eggs do you remember?

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Actually, there's a new one. This is back in the news today specifically, right?

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
Because there's a brand new one that was just admitted to by the developers of Spider-Man, right?

28:45.000 --> 28:53.000
Yes, and it was that if you were to play the game on certain holidays, any Jewish holiday,

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
you would find that there would be Orthodox Jews appearing like some of the citizen models or whatever.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Was it the reverse that they don't appear on those days because they're staying at home?

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
That's why nobody figured this out is because it wasn't about what you do see. It was about what you don't see.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
And so the little Easter egg is that those NPCs are nowhere to be found on those religious holidays because what's being inferred...

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
That's stupid.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
What do you mean that's stupid?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I don't know. That's lame.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Wow, that's a lot of detail.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
That's not so much an Easter egg. That's like detail. That's unnecessary detail. Like horse testicle shrinking.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Fine. You want himbos with fluorescent nipples getting chopped.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
That would be more interesting than...

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
Honestly, nowadays, I would expect that to be a title of a game that's on the Steam storefront, you know.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
What, himbos?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Fluorescent himbos being chopped up by rotor blades.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You want that on the dream game list?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You want to see if YYR's plate is full this month?

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Let's not. That's Steam store fodder right there.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Honestly, Loki, it probably already exists, to be fair.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
That is their simcopter, apparently.

30:04.000 --> 30:12.000
Let's see. SSG100Matt is saying, still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo from SimCity Action News.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Yes, the CD-ROM remake that came later on.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
What about other Easter eggs? Any others that you remember?

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
I seem to think that the little letter that you dipped in water in StarTropics, in some ways...

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
It's not really an Easter egg, though.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I kind of put it in the same category, though, because it was one of those things that jumped off the screen.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
But I guess you're right. It's not exactly hidden.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
But it was kind of one of those, like, oh, it's different, or it's like only certain people know how to do it, you know, type of thing.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
Because not everybody put that together, either. Especially if you rented the game, you couldn't.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
Yes, I know. I bought my news at a flea market, so I was unable to do that.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
I was like, I don't know what the code is! Nintendo Hotline, what's the code?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Well, you dipped the letter in water. I bought it, you!

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Finally, code 747.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I'm paying by the minute here, come on!

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
It's like an airplane, 747, done. Anyway.

31:09.000 --> 31:20.000
I don't know, like, there's, like, Driver 3 I know had, they did a parody of the character from Vice City in there,

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
because they thought their game was cooler than Grand Theft Auto, even though it's garbage, but they had that.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Would you consider cheat codes Easter eggs? Like, IQQD, things like that.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Obviously, those don't exist anymore, because, you know, they sell them all.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
But back in the day, when you would type them in, or, as somebody in chat said when we first started this segment,

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start. I mean, the infamous Konami code is an Easter egg of sorts.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Well, they have the Pac-Man level in Wolfenstein 3D.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh, they, I don't remember that.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
It was a bonus level.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't even remember that.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
The ghosts, you couldn't kill them.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Oh, interesting.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
But you had to collect, you know, um...

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I remember you could make your own levels.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Money, but yeah, they had Pac-Man ghosts in there, and you couldn't kill them.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
They would kick your ass pretty fast.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Interesting.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Oh, Pixel Pacas is bringing up the cow level in Diablo 2.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That's a pretty infamous one.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
In fact, they had to go to such lengths to say in Diablo 3, there was no cow level.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
But then they did some type of cow event later on, and they still had like a rainbow.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
They have Whimsy Dale and Whimsy Shire, and, you know, they kind of did a similar thing in Diablo 3.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
So, anyway.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Easter eggs, they're fun.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Tweet us some of your favorites over at O-L-R.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
I thought, what better day to talk about Easter eggs than on Easter.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Alright, well, here's one, actually.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
There was that, um...

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It sucks that they patched it out, too.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
On the Switch, there was the whole thing where you could play golf.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Or they think they called it, like, vlog or whatever.

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
You had to do the gesture on the certain day to unlock it.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
It was like a lotus birthday or something.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Yes.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Yeah.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
And you had to do the gesture.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
The Nintendo Direct gesture.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Yes.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Oh, that's a system-based Easter egg.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
That's a good one.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Um, like, uh...

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, this isn't so much a system-based Easter egg, but you remember, like, if you take your

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night CD, and you put it in a regular CD player?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Like, the first track would just be blank.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Like, those PlayStation discs, somehow...

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Well, sometimes...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
The second track would play.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
Unless you had a CD player that was really old and didn't understand that that was a

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
dated thing.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
They would just sound like crap.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
But, yeah, you have that.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
That was kind of cool.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
Or, wasn't there something you could do the Nintendo 64 logo or GameCube logo?

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Wasn't there something, like, you could hold a button and it did something weird or something,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
play different sounds?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Yes, you could.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I think with the other controller or something, you move it around and it plays different

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
sounds and stuff like that.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Anyway, uh, we'll close on this one, though, because this is a great one.

33:44.000 --> 33:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, how about a Namco collection that had OLR in the game High Scores?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, that is...

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
That is...

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Yes, you're right.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
OLR is an Easter egg.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Also, there is the game, uh...

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
That's when we peaked, quite frankly.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
There was a PlayStation 2 or 3 game called the Poona that had it.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
It's a Wii game.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Wii game.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
That reference was much more subtle.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It was our old, uh, orange logo.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Um, but our names, our names aren't in it.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
But in this, it's, so it's the Namco collection on PlayStation 3 and it's the digital one.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
It has, uh, Dragon Spirit, I think, Dig Dug and Pac-Man.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
So it has, like, a, it's like a collection of, like, five Namco games.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
When we first booted up, it shows, like, now you can compete with your friends.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
But if you actually look at the scoreboard, it actually shows, like, OLR and then I think

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
it actually says Sky, Loki, Dark Soccer.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
It, like, actually says the names on the high scoreboard.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
So, that is a great Easter egg.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I think that's a good one to close on.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So, that's fantastic.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Alright, well, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
been playing this week, whether they be Namco or otherwise.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I didn't play a whole lot of stuff this week.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
We went, um, to Chuck E. Cheese for, like, an hour, um, earlier this week.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
So, I played the, um, was it Luigi's Mansion arcade game?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So, that was alright.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Ah, man, it's, it's okay.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Um, and then, what else?

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
I played a little bit of Borderlands, Game of the Year edition.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Um, didn't really play it very long because it's still crashing on me.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Um, even though I tried, like, walking back some of the stuff I did to it.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
And then, um, what else?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Pokemon Go.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
I did a little bit more, uh, Labo VR.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
I put together the elephant thing and tried out that.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
They have, like, this, like, marble maze thing that's, it's alright.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
And then, the drawing was kind of neat, but not very accurate because it's hard to tell

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
depth-wise where you are.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
Um, but, I mean, it's a neat, like, proof of concept, I guess.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And then, uh, what else?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Um, that's pretty much it.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Okay.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Um, my gaming week was a little dialed back because, um, there was a lot going on this

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
week.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I hosted shows both Friday and Saturday night.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
So, pretty much this weekend has all been doing hosting gigs.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But I did play some games earlier in the week.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Um, I have been playing Pokemon Go.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
I mean, while I go, while I walk to these things, like, in Old Town and stuff, I'm

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
playing Pokemon Go.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
So, I caught one of the blue shell chuckles.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Those are so useless.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I mean, not the shinies, but, like, the shiny ones.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Not the shinies, but, like, the chuckles are just useless.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Like, I-

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Their defense is surprisingly strong for the CP they have, but I wouldn't exactly consider

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
them, like, great gym defenders.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
But their CP is deceptively, like, understates how good defenders they are.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
But it's not, like, like, again, because-

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Do they evolve into anything later on?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Is it-

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I don't remember if they do in future gens or not.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
So, yeah, the chuckles themselves are not exactly the most useful Pokemon in the world,

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
but I think the blue ones look cool.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
So, you know, that's all going on.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
I just got a push notification, too, that said it's only, what, like, four more hours

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
in that whole thing.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
So, yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Better get one.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I still don't have a pink bunny, though.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
I've been looking for those, too.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
I didn't get anything.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
But, yeah, I've been-

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
So, I've been doing that with Pokemon Go, of course.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
And then, as far as, like, the more traditional games, I've been still playing some Beat Saber.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
It's a good way to get a little bit of a workout midweek, especially if I don't get to the

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
gym in a particular day.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Good way to kind of make sure I'm still getting some cardio in a little bit.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
And then, I've been also playing Final Fantasy XIV still.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I kind of went back, like, remember I was on WoW for a little bit?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And I kind of went back to Final Fantasy XIV at this point.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
And, now, I have all of my healers at max level.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
So, Astrologian, White Mage, and, as of today, Scholar are all at level 70.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
So, I did that.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
And, I've also been playing Borderlands Game of the Year.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
I haven't played as much this week as I did, like, in previous weeks, just because I have

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
had the other stuff going on.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But, I did clear a few more quests.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm up to level 18, I think.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
So, I still got a ways to go.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
But, I'm also, I'm really slow.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I take my time.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Everything respawns.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I have to kill everything again.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
You know, it's like, it's kind of a chore every time I sign into the game.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
You can teleport, you know, between different locations, right?

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
Well, every time I go to one of those teleporters, it only offers me the DLC areas.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
It doesn't allow me to teleport to something within the same map.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Unless that's an ability you get later on or something.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
I don't know.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I think you can do it once you get more than one of those.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I'm pretty sure I've visited at least, like, four or five.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And, I don't have the ability to teleport between them.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Maybe it's something that opens up the story, like, after, maybe I just haven't opened it up yet.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Maybe.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Like, I've been doing every, like, there's a boss very clearly that I need to be killing.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
But, I've been doing, like, every side quest that keeps popping up first.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, I was Sledge, I think is who I was.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Yes, Sledge is who I need to go kill.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
But, I've been doing all these, like, I just did this arena quest.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
I just did.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, I had to do, like, was it, they're one of the side quests is I get the sniper rifle pieces or whatever.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
So, I went to go collect those.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And, one of the markers was in the middle of the air.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And, I actually did collect it. It was in a different spot.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
The piece was in a different spot, but the marker is still there and it won't go away.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
So, obviously, the quest is bugged.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Thank goodness.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
So, I'm going to have to do something else or else it's just never going to get unbugged, I guess.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't know.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Alright.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Or, maybe I'll find the pieces somewhere else.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Well, otherwise, that's been pretty much it for my gaming week otherwise.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
So, nothing new this week yet, but maybe next week I'll be able to change that a little bit.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
So, because next week will be a little less crazy.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I only have one show to host next week.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
So, but everything's been going great in that department.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
I really can't complain.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
So, anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's news stories.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
Again, if you want to participate along with our show, head on over to our chat, twitch.tv slash vog network.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com or you can always tweet us at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
For a holiday week, in which most people have been on spring break, there's not a lot of news this week.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
I would have, going into this week, I figured it would be a pretty dead week.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But we got some pretty big things this week, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, so Mark Cerny sat down with Wired and did an interview about the PlayStation 5 or whatever we're going to call it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
The next PlayStation, basically.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Which is, how are they not going to call it PlayStation 5?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
That would be so weird.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
How are they going to call the Xbox 360 successor the Xbox One, because that made no sense.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I guess.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Whatever, you know, I don't give a shit. I think they should be PlayStation 5 or whatever.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
That's just a name.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Anyway, so they were talking about some of the features that it's going to have.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
They said that it's going to basically be backwards compatible with the PlayStation 4.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's going to have a solid state drive.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
They were talking a little bit about the actual specs of the console.

40:27.000 --> 40:36.000
It's going to be based on the Ryzen chipset, so third generation based on their 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
They have a GPU that's based off the Nvidia Navi family and it will support ray tracing.

40:42.000 --> 40:54.000
And also they're going to use that ability to kind of track light or track basically beams to also enhance sound design as well.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
So that's kind of cool.

40:57.000 --> 41:04.000
They're saying that it's going to support the up to 8K resolution and that...

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Which TVs don't even really do yet, right?

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Right.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
We just kind of assume it's coming.

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
Also that the VR is apparently pretty important to them and it will support the original PlayStation VR.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I assume that they're going to have their own VR thing that would come out along with it as well.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Well, why?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Why not just the same VR headset?

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
Because I think that by then you're going to have a VR headset that's going to be able to take in...

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Because the resolution on the headset is not that great.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And so I would think that they would want to bump it up.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Comparatively not that great.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
So I would think that they would want to bump it up.

41:41.000 --> 41:49.000
Plus I'm assuming that while they may support the PlayStation Move controllers, those things are a few generations old already.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
They're probably going to become something different.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
I don't know. I don't know if I would bank on that so much.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
I would.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
I was very pleased to hear that they were planning to support.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Like that was kind of the most...

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Considering most of this news is basically spec porn, which is fine.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
You know, people want to know.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
And to my point, you know, I made earlier is that I don't necessarily trust anything that they're telling me right now.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
Because you may remember that like a while back when they were talking about the PlayStation 3 and what it could do.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
They were touting that all games on the console are going to run at 1080p and it's going to be at 120 frames per second.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
We know that wasn't the case.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Like a lot of games barely got up to that 1080p mark.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
A lot of them ran at 720 or upscale or whatever to 1080.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
And nothing ran at 120 frames per second.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
I get it. I get it.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
At the end of the day, and we've been saying this forever on this show, right?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
We've been saying that for years and years on this show.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And nothing is going to change here.

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
And it even, you know, and if you want to compare it to the PlayStation 3, you know, look at the games that they announced when they announced the PlayStation 3.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Sure, they're announcing all this cool shit and then they come out on stage.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Give me Ridge Racer, goddammit. I need a new Ridge Racer.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
You're going to fight giant enemy crabs with historical accuracy in this.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I want Ridge Racer cars.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
People weren't really looking at these games going like, oh, I mean, obviously there's exceptions to every rule.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Because I know there's going to be that person in chat going, well, I thought Ridge Racer was awesome.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Fine. But, you know, obviously the marketplace as a whole kind of rejected it in the beginning.

43:19.000 --> 43:26.000
And it wasn't until later on when Sony started getting things like LittleBigPlanet and then some of these other big things that they're really known for now at this point.

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
Like Uncharted and, you know, Last of Us and things like that that came along later on where the PlayStation 3 really started to leave its mark.

43:33.000 --> 43:45.000
So my point is this spec porn is great, but I will agree that with your reservation, Loki, about, you know, sure it says it does all this, you know, 8K ray tracing on stuff.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
For me, it's not so much about like, I don't believe it'll do it, although I think your reservation is fine.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
It's just like, OK, show me, show me what that looks like.

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
And really, like, let's be honest, like I haven't seen an 8K television, but I've seen 4K televisions and they look great.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
What more is 8K really going to do at that point?

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
Here's the thing, though. You know, it's funny because I feel like we've been saying that since forever, right?

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Since we saw games on Nintendo. How can games get better than this?

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
Well, no, I mean, like we're getting to the point of getting to the point of diminishing returns.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
Like on a 4K TV, you can't really see the pixels too well anymore.

44:23.000 --> 44:30.000
It's still going to be, I think that the technology, it's better to, I don't know, like even with 8K, I think,

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
I don't even know if that chip could drive 8K. I mean, they're saying that it can, but can it drive it actually well?

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
I think 4K with better details, better use the extra oomph for, you know, processing more detail.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
Not necessarily needing the resolution to be higher. I can see them maybe upscaling it to 8K or something like that.

44:50.000 --> 44:58.000
But there's no way that driving a game 60 FPS at 8K is going to be a thing that's going to happen with a Ryzen chip.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
And here's the other thing, and I think this is important to say, is that to be fair,

45:01.000 --> 45:13.000
we're all talking about all this news that's come out of a, you know, a discrete unveiling to one reporter from one online magazine.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
This was not intended to be some big curtain unveiling AAA event.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
So to pass judgment on the PlayStation 5 at this point is premature.

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
I think it's fair to say that because Sony hasn't taken the opportunity to show us the games.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
That's not what they wanted to do with this little slip. I don't know what their intent was behind this.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
I don't know if this was something to kind of needle Microsoft ahead of E3.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
I don't know what the long-term plan was to kind of let some of this slip now, to maybe not let Sony drop off the news rate.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
I mean, here we are talking about PlayStation, which we probably wouldn't have been otherwise.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
You know, so I don't know what the strategical maneuver was there.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
But the reality is we really can't judge this thing until we see some games, right?

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
And we got to say, okay, if it's 8K, show me like why 8K is going to like blow my fucking mind.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Well, first off, they're not going to be able to show you because no way to show you is ever going to be able to come through.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Tell me which Best Buy I'm going to have to go to.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Because they don't have like you can't. My Internet is not going to handle 8K.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I don't have any 4K monitor to watch that crap on.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
I do have a 4K TV, but like I just think at that point, it doesn't it's not going to matter.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
Like, you know, jumping that resolution is not going to be like, oh, my God, this looks so much better.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
I think it's just going to be it's going to look nice as it is. It's going to look more realistic.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
But I think the ray tracing would help more than the 8K is going to help.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
And even the ray tracing, I don't well, that may make things look more realistic.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
Gameplay wise, it's not going to matter. And, you know, you really I don't know.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
I just want to see what they're going to do with this other than make the car shinier in Gran Turismo.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
I think the solid state drive thing is is worse.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Yeah. And I realize we kind of don't know.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
And I you know, some of you want to get way more technical on which type of solid state drive and all this other stuff.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
But I think at the end of the day, what they're really trying to show is, hey, we know that,

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
like when we talk about 8K graphics, some people are sitting there thinking about the loading times that are going to be atrocious, right?

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
No, not the loading times. The download size is going to be atrocious.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
There is that, too.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
That's that's what's going to be the thing, because if we're talking like, you know, what kind of media are they going to put on this thing?

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
Where are you going to put those 8K textures? Are you going to store them on a Blu-ray disc?

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't think you're going to be able to fit them on a Blu-ray disc.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
Do you think that there's probably another type of either disc or or other maybe not even a disc anymore, maybe some type of cartridge?

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Well, but then how would it be backwards compatible?

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
It's got to have a disk drive, but like the thing I can I just.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Pushing 8K, I don't think it's going to be a thing that's going to be out the gate.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
I don't see it as even a thing you'd want to do, because there's nothing that supports 8K right now.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
There's no 8K content other than your games.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
I don't think there's 8K TVs out there. There may be some. I don't think there's a there's definitely not a lot of them.

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
YYR in chat says many current games on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro still don't run at 60 frames per second.

48:11.000 --> 48:18.000
More power should help with that. Yeah, sure. So maybe it's probably going to be less about 8K and more about smooth 4K.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, I would say smooth 4K. Let's not push 8K. Let's just make it look good on 4K, because 4K is fine.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I don't think anyone's looking at 4K. Oh my God, that's so fucking ugly.

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
I mean, no one's like this resolution. Oh my God. I can see the pixels if I put my face inch from the screen.

48:35.000 --> 48:44.000
I mean, I don't think it's going to be an issue there. I think just getting it to run smoothly with more detail is going to make it look better than trying to push 8K.

48:45.000 --> 48:54.000
Let's see. Mr. Rhizos in chat says, also speaking of 8K, does it really make a difference to the human eye if it's not experienced on a big screen?

48:54.000 --> 49:01.000
And some people are kind of talking about the whole fact that, you know, at a certain size, like, for instance, I have a 4K monitor, but it's only so big.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
Like, if that monitor were to be 8K, it's probably not going to make a difference. My eye can't see it.

49:07.000 --> 49:16.000
And maybe, I think when you were kind of talking about the whole, like, how can graphics get better than they already are, and I kind of joked with you about we've been saying that forever.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
I think where you were kind of really going with that is that we're getting, like, closer and closer to, like, what the eye can process.

49:22.000 --> 49:29.000
Like, we're at a point where it's like, you can't really move much faster. It's not going to matter. Your eye doesn't see that fast.

49:29.000 --> 49:37.000
Yeah. And, like, right now they're saying, you know, like, I was looking up, I'm like, well, how much does an 8K TV cost? $5,000.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
Okay, but that, okay, you know what, though? But I remember back in the day when a big screen TV over 40 inches would cost that much.

49:44.000 --> 49:51.000
And it was like a projection type thing. Like, the point is, the price of technology will come down.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.000
And I feel like Sony's designed this before. I feel like this is the exact same conversation we were talking about 4K in the PlayStation 4.

49:59.000 --> 50:07.000
Like, and, fuck, this show's been around long enough, it's probably documented somewhere, that, like, when the PlayStation 4 was coming out, we were probably saying all the same shit about 4K.

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
That, well, what's the point? Nobody's got a four screen TV. What four 4K TVs are $5,000? Nobody fucking has those in their house.

50:15.000 --> 50:24.000
Or 3D televisions are this much. Nobody has those in their house. And then, sure enough, the price of that stuff always comes way down as technology advances and things get cheaper.

50:24.000 --> 50:31.000
So, yes, it's $5,000 now, but this PlayStation 5's not even gonna be out until 2020 at the earliest.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
And then even from there, you can expect that Sony's banking on a 10-year life cycle, whatever that means.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.000
But you can be assured that a part of that is, most people won't get one until two years into it.

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
You know, so, what is that price gonna look like in four years? It'll probably come way down.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
If your eye even cares. I don't know.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
I don't know. We'll have to see. I mean...

50:55.000 --> 51:04.000
Now, quickly, some folks in chat were also bringing this point up, and I do want to mention it, but also there is the sound that they were emphasizing as well.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
And certainly graphics isn't just the big thing, but there's also sound.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
I also found it was interesting that they were talking about supporting a lot of the same peripherals.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
So, like, if I have the Bluetooth headset for PlayStation 4, that means it should work on PlayStation 5, right?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It's Bluetooth. Why not?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Capable of delivering...

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
It's Bluetooth. It should.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
I guess so.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
Just like controllers are Bluetooth, you know, so of course it would.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
Yeah. I wonder if that means it'll use the same controllers. Maybe we don't have to...

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Probably. I don't see that they're gonna redesign that.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
Only that they've done it every single time, Loki.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
They've redesigned that controller. Remember Sixaxis? That was the must-have thing in the PlayStation 3, Sixaxis.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
And then of course there was the touchpad. The touchpad was new on PlayStation 4, or the share button and all that stuff.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
Yeah, the touchpad, no one really uses that.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
So you think maybe they'll eliminate that in favor of something else?

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
I mean, they use it in some games, like as a click button, but I don't think it's gonna be anything like we needed the touchpad for anything.

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
And YYR does point out regarding Bluetooth and the controllers, the PlayStation 3 controllers are Bluetooth also, and the PlayStation 4 didn't support those.

52:07.000 --> 52:14.000
So the controller support is far from guaranteed, and I kinda tend to side on that. I think PlayStation 5 will come out with its own new controller,

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
and we'll be lucky if it supports PlayStation 4 controller, quite frankly, or anything before it.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Well, the 3.8 supports PlayStation 3 controllers.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
Actually, I'm gonna dial it back a little bit, because since we have the backwards compatibility...

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Or maybe I'm thinking the PlayStation 3 supports PlayStation 4 controllers.

52:29.000 --> 52:36.000
Yes, you are. But maybe with the backwards compatibility, maybe it will use the PlayStation 4 controllers for that? I don't know.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
I mean, again, this is really early on. It's one article and one preview that...

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
No, I will make all my decisions now based on this very little information.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But that's...

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
So you find it day one for $800, yes?

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
Of course, because I'm a consumer whore, of course I am. Of course I am.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I don't know if I want to buy Sony this time around.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Oh my.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
They...

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
Why don't they show the games? They'll show Grand Theft Auto or whatever, and you'll just be like...

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I'll be on both platforms.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Earth Defense Force 17.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I don't need it.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Twisted Metal.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I still haven't bought Earth Defense Force Iron Rain yet.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Oh no, what kind of world do we live in?

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
Because it's $60. That game is like a $20 game. I don't pay $60 for that.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
Alright, let's move on to the types of games that you're going to be able to purchase on these platforms,

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
because there's some talk about what's going on with the PlayStation 4 marketplace

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
when it comes to sexy games, because apparently...

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
I didn't even realize the PlayStation kind of had a sexy game problem, so...

53:41.000 --> 53:48.000
Anyway, Sony apparently has rolled out a new set of guidelines for regulating sexually explicit content

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
for games that are sold on the PlayStation website and the store and all that.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
This is all according to the Wall Street Journal.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
So a report done by them says that, quote,

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
A Sony spokeswoman confirmed the company has established its own guidelines

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
so that creators can offer well-balanced content on the platform,

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
and gaming does not inhibit the sound growth and development of young people.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
So...

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
Apparently, some folks at Sony are a little worried about the rise of sexually explicit games,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
and this would hurt their reputation.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
We've had this conversation certainly before many times in the industry, for example,

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
when Nintendo said Night Trap would never be on one of their platforms,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
and then didn't they just release it on Switch finally?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
25 years later, I think, but...

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
And ironically, the GameCube version of BMX Triple X was uncensored versus the Xbox.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
That's right, huh?

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
It was either the Xbox or PlayStation version.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I think it was the Xbox version that was censored.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I remember that because you owned the GameCube version of BMX Triple X.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Because I did.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Oh, no, I need the most porny one that's out on the market.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I will not settle for just...

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's a semi-porny game.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
We're going to get the full...

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
If I'm going to buy BMX Triple X, we want the full experience.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
We want all three Xs.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
We're not going to settle for anything less than Triple X.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Anyway...

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
Apparently, a big driving force of the concern is the software sold in Japan

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
because traditionally, they've had more tolerance for near-nudity

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
and images of young women who might appear underage.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
And I think we've all heard of the visual novel games where,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
okay, these girls are supposed to be in high school,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
so they're only, like, 16, and...

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
This is why these games sometimes don't come out.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
They're all of consenting age.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Anyway...

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
You may not actually want to say that.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Let's see.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
They're cartoon characters. They have no age.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
And also, I guess, part of what's playing into this,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
is streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
so these games that are coming out in Japan

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
with these kind of questionable things

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
are being played where, you know...

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Again, it's more like the globalization, basically, of the market, really.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
You know, it used to be easier and easier to keep the Japan games in Japan

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
and keep the U.S. games here,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
but because of the YouTube, because of the Internet,

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
it's the Internet's fault,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
now it's so easy for us to see these Japanese games

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
and talk about them.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And so maybe some of these,

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
what's okay here doesn't fly so well here,

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
and they're worried about the reputation here.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
So, anyway.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Oh my God, think of the children.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Now, isn't this interesting?

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Because Nintendo has told the Wall Street Journal

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
that sexually explicit games can be sold on the Switch

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
as long as they receive a rating from a national agency

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
like the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Nobody has yet to release an AO game,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
at least on the console front.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
You know, I realize there's some minor exceptions,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
what with Oblivion having its...

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
The 3DS had a lot of...

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
You guys know that, generally,

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
these games are not sold on consoles if they're AO.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
We know that.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
But M rating games,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
you can have some sexual content and get away with it.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Well, there's all the Senran Kagura stuff that, you know,

56:52.000 --> 56:59.000
big titty, you know, ninja girls who, you know,

56:59.000 --> 57:04.000
are very put in certain situations.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Lots of foam and phallic things in their mouth, yeah.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
All right, anyway.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
So, apparently, it's been noted.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Let's see.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Last October, the publisher XSeed mentioned

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
that Senran Kagura Burst Renewal would be delayed on PlayStation 4

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
because they had to remove the intimacy mode

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
because of the platform holder.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
As I just talked, Senran Kagura.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
You know, the game that was appropriate for the 3DS,

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
but not the PlayStation 4.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
And then later, Japanese game studio Light said

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
that a PlayStation 4 port of the 2017 visual novel,

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Silverio Trinity, was waiting on approval from Sony

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
in a quote from one of the representatives.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Right now, Sony seems to be moving towards disallowing ports

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
of ages 18 and up titles worldwide.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And this game is ages 18 and up,

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
so it's being subjected to a very strict inspection,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
and we're getting all these questions.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Isn't this interesting how now Nintendo is the porting platform of choice

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
all these years later?

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Who would have thought Nintendo would be progressive?

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Let's be real.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
It's really the PC at the end of the day.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Anyway, I don't know.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
I understand, especially when it comes to some of the age things,

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
I understand why Sony does not want to be associated with that,

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
so, you know, I get some of their reservations and concern.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Locopoco in our chat points out,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
visual novels with the 600-year-old dragon

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
that looks an axe eight years old.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
That is a trope, isn't it?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf points out,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I think Devil May Cry 5 had some J.J. Abrams lens flares.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
They did. I was looking in the article, actually.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
They did show it side by side between the Japanese version,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
which showed, oh my god, a woman's butt.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
And, you know, they had to cover it up with a lens flare

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
in the North American version,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
because, god forbid, it'll corrupt somebody if they see a woman's butt.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
How old was a woman supposed to be?

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
I think it was an actual adult.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
Well, then a butt's a butt, whatever.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
But if it was somebody that looked and acted like a 16-year-old girl,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
then, uh, yeah, you need to know.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
This is pretty rich coming from a company

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
whose one of their mainline character franchises

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
has sex minigames in it,

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
with naked, tittied women.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Oh, God of War?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Yes.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
So, I'm surprised that, you know, now they're like,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
wait, we must take the high road here.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
This is naughty. Why do we have this on our platform?

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Shame on you guys for putting this kind of crap on here.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Who cares? It's a goddamn game.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You have age restrictions. You have parental controls.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
What's the fucking problem? I don't understand.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Let's move on. We've got more controversy.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Bonds006 says, tonight's tea is hot.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Oh, we're not done yet. Let's get into another controversy,

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
shall we, Loki?

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Yes, let's talk about using emulators

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
for your console, your classic consoles.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Yes, so, Capcom, and yeah, it isn't the first time,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
because, you know, the PlayStation Classic

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
did use an emulator that was publicly available out there.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The difference here, though, is the Capcom Home Arcade,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
which is this ginormous plug-and-play fighting stick

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
that's shaped like the Capcom logo,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
it uses the emulator FB Alpha, which is an arcade emulator,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and apparently, though, originally FB Alpha, I guess,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
is based a little bit off of MAME and some other stuff,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
but FB Alpha, while it being open-sourced,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
it's distributed under a license that strictly prohibits

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
it being used in commercial applications for profit.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
But they're fucking doing it anyways,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
because what are they gonna do, like, fight them about it?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So apparently, you know, Amazon is selling,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
they're selling this already for 299 euro, or 260 bucks,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and yeah, and they're just doing this right now.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Apparently, some people that are on the development team

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
for FB Alpha, which I guess is one guy, Barry Harris,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
he tweeted that FB Alpha has been licensed by Capcom Home Arcade,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
but then there's other developers as well.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
This guy, IQ132, says,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm strongly against the camp on this as well.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I am very against someone profiting off my work,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
unless it's me, of course.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I've never accepted payment for my emulation work,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and I'm considering pulling all of my code I wrote and ported for FBA.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
This would effectively make FBA back to just a CPS and Neo Geo emulator.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Okay, here's the thing.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I'm not really interested in this thing.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
For one, I'm gonna be honest, this thing is just fucking ugly.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Like, it is like that gigantic Capcom logo.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's not cute.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Like, it's not a good-looking piece of hardware,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and they want way too much money for it.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Way too much money for it.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I understand, you know, it's nicely made,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
it's arcade-quality materials,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
and that's why they've got to charge a little more for it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Not my cup of tea, quite frankly.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
However, that being said, Loki, a lot of people have got to be thinking this.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Somebody's got to say it, even though I know y'all aren't gonna like it.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I know you're not gonna like it, but I'm still gonna say it.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Like, surely, surely somebody sees the irony

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
in people that are developing an emulator

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
getting upset that, you know, their code is getting used

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
for a different type of purpose.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Meaning, what were the emulators designed to do?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
To play these games, and sure, I know, yes, of course, of course.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We all own the boards, and this is just about preserving the boards.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
That's our sole reason for doing this, 100% cross.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We're just, you know, we all have copies of these boards in our basement.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
We're just trying to, yeah, sure, this has nothing to do

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
with trying to get everybody out there playing these games

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and those sorts of things.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You've got to see some irony in this.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Okay, I'll see the irony, but then if Capcom's basically saying,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
buy this, and this isn't necessarily Capcom, this is Koch Media doing this,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
so let's just assume that,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
let's just assume for the argument's sake that Capcom said,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
we are okay with using this emulator because people steal our ROMs,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
you know, to play them through the emulator.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We think it's okay that we're doing this, then that's fine.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Then if that's the agreement, then you cannot fucking be mad at me

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
to play your stupid ROMs.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The argument done will allow this to happen,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
but then you've got to allow it to happen the other way.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You can't bitch that people are playing your games illegally

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
if you're doing illegal acts as well.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's a wash then.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But that's not what's going to happen, of course.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Of course not what's going to happen.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And here's the thing, too.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Here's the thing that's really dicey, because to be fair,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
you mentioned as part of this, Capcom did license the emulator, but...

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Well, they licensed the ROMs.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But due to the open source nature of the emulator,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
you have all of these contributors to it,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
so some people that have worked very hard on volunteering

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and contributing to these as emulator

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
now feel like their work is being profited off of.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Which it is.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And so forth.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
So they're feeling pretty salty about it,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
like that guy that said the comment that he's thinking about pulling out.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But to be fair, Capcom tried to license from the entity.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That is a part of this as well, right?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So Capcom isn't just stealing it.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Well, Capcom tried to license it, but yeah.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So apparently they've gotten permission from somebody,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
but maybe that somebody wasn't the person that actually owns this,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
since it's a group of people doing it,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
so you need kind of everybody's permission to do it.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Honestly, I just kind of feel like at the end of the day,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
this is just a harsh reality of playing in the emulator game.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Well, MAME's open source, and MAME can be used for commercial purposes,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
so why don't they just use MAME?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh, it's because it's not as good as this other one?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Is what it is?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I don't know.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Whatever. I'm not going to buy it anyways, so no big deal.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Let's see.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Going to chat, DJ Rama S says,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Here's the million dollar question.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
How long before this Capcom arcade stick is hacked?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Before the sentence left your mouth.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's running an openly available...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Yes, it'll be hacked immediately.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It's using an emulator that it's obviously running off of just the straight ROMs.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I'd be curious, though, if these ROM dumps are going to be any better

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
than the ROM dumps that they have already,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
since they would be done by Capcom, I'd assume.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I don't know. You can only dump a ROM so many ways, I guess.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
YY Orange Chat says,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It's like they're finally bringing us Alien vs. Predator.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
What an amazing game, but it's locked behind having to buy this huge, ugly thing

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and keep it in my house.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Sell the collection on consoles and I'll buy it.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And honestly, at the end of the day, despite everything else I've said,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and maybe playing Devil's Advocate, I suppose, on this a little bit,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
even though nobody asked me to, but I'm a gamer.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
At the end of the day, I'm kind of with you.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The reality is, I'm not paying that much money for that.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I'm pointing at Loki's laptop, because he's got a picture of it up on his laptop right now.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It's ugly. It is ugly.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And that doesn't cost $260 to make.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
No, of course it doesn't.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
No, it's wood.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I wouldn't be surprised if that's classic.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
But I'm with YYR.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
If they were to release this collection for, I don't know, $30 or something, I don't know,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
on a console, then I would be much more open to picking it up.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Because the collection of games is pretty good.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You've got things like Mega Man Power Battle in there,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
although I think that was in a recent collection, wasn't it?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But anyway, there's a variety of different fighting games and stuff in here.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's a pretty decent collection, but not for $260.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I like this last comment, though, out of the community that's around FBA.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They were saying that it's bad enough with the shady use of FBA.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
They didn't have to make the product hideous on top.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Tigerclaw is asking an interesting question.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I'm not sure we would know the answer, but it's worth repeating.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The Alien vs. Predator game, don't they need to get the license for that,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
given now that Alien and Predator are owned by Disney?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Perhaps there was something written into the agreement

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that maybe some other gaming companies didn't think of.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And I don't know, I'm just theorizing,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
maybe Capcom had something written into their agreement

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that when they made the game, they have the rights to it

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and to keep putting out that game for so many years,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
that they would not have to, despite whoever owns it.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I don't know. That's just my thought.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Maybe it's their agreement just being different,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
that they're allowed to do that without having to go back to Disney

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and try to get money.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But if they did have to go to Disney and Disney wanted money,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that would explain why this thing's $260.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Maybe. I don't know.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's just not worth it for that price.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It isn't.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
For how many? $260 for how many games?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Emulator controversy aside, it's just not...

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
No, that's a no from me, dog.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's what it is at the end of the day.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's just not something I desire at all.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
How many games here? So like 16 games?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
16 games.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
No. Well, okay.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Why am I that guy tonight?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm being that guy tonight.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
To be fair, they sell those things at Walmart

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
that are like these type of cabinets,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
the tabletop cabinets that are a replica of the old arcade machines

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and they want, what, like 200 bucks for those

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and there's maybe four games in them?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah. I mean, those are only like four games.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
They want $200 for those.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Granted, there's a TV in them or some type of display.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
There's a monitor in there.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
You know, a nice looking set with that,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but I mean, talk about value.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
You don't get a lot of games for that either,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
but I guess maybe that's more about the presentation.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Those look nice.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
This gigantic Capcom logo looks really bad.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's just...

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Arcade 1-Up. Thank you, Bobby.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Thank you, Bobby. That is the name of that.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
All right. Let's move on, shall we?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Maybe to something less controversial?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Ha ha ha. Nope. Still more controversy.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Super Smash Brothers got updated this week.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Big new update in Super Smash Brothers

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
because Joker is now not the Batman guy,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
but the Persona guy, is now an official DLC character in the game

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and the other big thing that people are talking about is the stage builder.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So, you can now create your own stages,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
which is basically...

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I admittedly have not had the time to play around with it,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but the things I'm seeing, it's like,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
oh, it's like Mario Paint, but you're painting stages.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's like Little Big Planet, sort of.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Okay. But obviously, if you allow people to paint whatever they want,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
people are painting things like dicks, boobies,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
you know, Princess Peach, Spread Eagle,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
things like that. These are the types of levels

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
that people were making within seconds, right?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So, now Nintendo has a content moderation problem.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I almost forgot that the Wii version had a stage builder as well.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Remember that?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah, it did. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Because you couldn't share them as easily on that one.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Yeah. You had to use codes or something.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Yeah. Well, I don't even know if that really worked on the Wii one.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Like, if it was easy sharing.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Oh, we had to lay it as a website.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I remember now because I made a question block one

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and had to go to some site to get it.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So, anyhow, of course, Nintendo has been, like, removing these,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
but it's also led to some controversy

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
because there's been some things that were, you know, a little more like,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I was reading something about somebody had made a stage out of a trans flag

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and it got pulled for being political.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I'm hoping that's just a one-off and not some type of direction.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Well, and you know, of course, what the response was.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Now there's 5,000 of those stages that are out there on the platform.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It's like Nintendo's never been to YouTube before.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Or it's like Nintendo has never dealt with online before.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Honestly, in my honest opinion, they should just,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and this is not going to be the popular,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
they should just not have the public facing thing.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Just leave it so that you can see what your friends make

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and you can use codes to get whatever stages you want.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Just get rid of the public facing store.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It's not going to do you any favors.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Just get rid of it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
There's no way.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I mean, I think that the trans stuff,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
they're probably just catching it based off of the name.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
There's no way a person's going to be able to go through all of this stuff

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and actually view these.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Right.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Or that there's going to be any sort of like consistency between it

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
because I really hope something like the flag thing getting taken down

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
is just because somebody with an itchy trigger finger

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
didn't know what they were doing, basically.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That unfortunately, you know, that's the one that gets reported.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Now, you know, gets run everywhere on the internet

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
because, you know, it's it's just it's it's it's just a flag.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
It's not offensive.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So but anyway, but with the dick levels of those are pretty funny.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I've seen some because you can make stuff move around.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So, of course, did you see the one that one of my friends made?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
One of my friends made that one of my friends made a goat's a level

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and the little the little I don't get banned from Twitch.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
No, let's talk about it.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Come on.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.000
The arms, as they do in the picture, will kind of like expand and collapse

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
and the legs will expand and collapse with it.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And that's the question, though, is, is the butthole like if you were the stage,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
what would happen? I'm not doing that.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
But you know how they have like the hazards, like they actually have like lava

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
or whatever is the hazard was they butthole a hazard because I need to know.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I don't know, I I told them to delete his his account

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and then I moved on to the next post, as you do on the Internet, Loki.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
That's awesome.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
A dark to see in chat says, I know they were trying to police the level gallery,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
as shown here.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Matt says there were some very elaborate stick figure fornication stages going on

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and the Internet ruined everything.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Yes, the Internet tends to do that.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The Internet completely ruined the complete shock to no one.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
On a related note, but a little a little more wholesome.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The Switch got a firmware update right around the same time.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
So even if you aren't a Smash person or have zero interest in these stage builder stages,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
which, quite frankly, I don't blame you.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But the Switch switch firmware got an update to 8.0.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And it sounds like a lot of like bug fixes and things like that.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
But there are some new icons.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So Splatoon 2 and Yoshi Craft a World have some new icons.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
There's like some the way you view the news, a way to transfer your save data.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
There's a zoom feature that's on.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That's kind of neat because that's an accessibility thing.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
If you think about it, it's pretty cool.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You can prevent the system from waking up when the AC adapter is disconnected.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I guess it's probably a battery saver type of thing.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And then there's a VR mode restriction in parental controls.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So if you are afraid that VR will warp your children's eyes, you can disable it.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I've actually played because they do have that in, ironically enough, in the Labo VR,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
where you can disable VR for anyone under seven.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And so what it does instead is you actually have a separate thing you build for the screen.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It's basically kind of like an AR camera type thing.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So you don't put the actual goggles on, but it still shows you an image of what you're seeing.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So you can still play all the games without it being right up against your face.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And I'm assuming that's what it is as well.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It's kind of neat that they're going to have that.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So I would assume that other things will work without the VR stuff.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
All right. Well, there you go.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
So you can update your Switch firmware, even though the Zoom feature might be kind of neat to play with.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Especially maybe you'd want to zoom in on things in some of these custom stages.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I don't know. But anyway.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Actually, to that note, because I was just trying to make sure it wasn't in our show role.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So I know for a fact that, speaking of not needing VR,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000
the VR stages that they're doing for the Super Mario Galaxy will not require VR as well.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
So you can play that without the VR mode on there.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I still think the Zelda thing does require VR, though, because it's just making the game 3D.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So what would be the point if it wasn't VR? It'd just look the same.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So that'll be a thing. But we'll find out next week. Or later this week.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yeah, it's pretty soon. It's coming out.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So I'll have to check it out and see how it is.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I'm tempted, yeah. I'm actually kind of tempted to get the Nintendo VR thing.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I never thought I would say that, but that Labo, the stuff that comes with that, there's so much.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I'm actually so impressed. And the fact that they're going back and updating these other games,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
even if they're silly things, they're just silly things.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And they're fun to build, but here's the weird thing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I saw someone actually playing, somehow, and I was trying to figure it out because I saw it on my phone,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
that they streamed themselves playing one of the Labo games.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Now, I could tell that they weren't in VR mode for it, but somehow they were getting the video capture out of it.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Because I don't think you can play it docked when you're doing the Labo stuff, unless you can.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I don't know, because that would be odd that you have somehow shoved the dock in there,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and you're holding the dock while tilting everything around.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I don't think that would work, but I don't know.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
There's probably some way to split the signal that's not being thought of.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I don't know.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Without hacking the system.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Or maybe it is hacking the system, who knows.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But anyway.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
All right, well, let's move on.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I think we've talked Sony, we've talked Nintendo, let's not leave anybody out.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Let's talk Microsoft.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Now, I know this is going to sound a lot like kind of just talking about the same stuff we talked about last week,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
but it's basically just confirming all the things we were rumored last week.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
As our pricing and the official details, right?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So, they did confirm during their Inside Xbox video that they are going to be doing that Game Pass Ultimate.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It is going to be $15 a month, and it's going to be out apparently later this year.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
They didn't say if they're going to offer a better deal for annual subscription,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000
because apparently you could sub them by month, I guess, for $60 a year anyways.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It says both sub separately can be $60 for a year or so.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Yeah, and what do we do?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I already have Xbox Live on a yearly thing right now.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
What's my incentive to jump in and get Game Pass?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I would think that they would need to offer a discount for something like that.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I would think so too.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So, we didn't really get the full scope of that.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.000
But, you know, it's still a start in kind of bringing these things together in one price for everything.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Then, of course, they officially announced the all digital version of the Xbox One S.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
It's going to have a one terabyte hard drive.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
It will be priced for $250.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I'm sorry, but the acronym is so great.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The Xbox One S, all digital.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
The Xbox One, sad.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Wow. Wow, Microsoft.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Maybe it was intentional. It's kind of funny.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It's going to be $50 less than the standard Xbox One S.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And right now, you're saying the game is going to come with three games.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Just like we had originally said, Minecraft Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 3 are going to be pre-installed.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And then they're also going to have, apparently, trials to Game Pass and Gold.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Which I think, are they saying a trial for Game Pass and Gold for like a dollar?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But that's currently what's available for anybody.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So, that's not really an exclusive thing for any way that buys this.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But, whatever.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yeah, they said option of paying $1 for a three month subscription to Xbox Game Pass.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You can do that anyways.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Here's the thing. I don't want to sound anti-Microsoft because I'm really not.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
There's a lot of things I'm really rooting for out of Xbox.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Oh, and it's coming out May 7th.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I'm probably more excited to see what they're going to unveil pretty soon for the future than probably anybody else.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Because I do think Microsoft is going to go in a different direction.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
All that being said, I think this is a miss.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Because the price is low enough.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It's $50 less than what's out there.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Which means you can get a used Xbox One regular thingy out there probably for cheaper.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
If you just walk into a used game store.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I was at the game store the other day, yesterday actually, and they had Xbox.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I was even joking about that.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Why would I buy this new all digital system when I can buy a used system and these games and get it even cheaper?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Or, you don't even have to purchase the games.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You just subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass for three months and you get them anyways.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
What's the point?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I really think they should have just bundled in a year.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
They should have.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Ride it off to move some consoles.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
No games.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I don't even know how much those games would be.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The value of those games.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But no games in a year of Game Pass or something like that.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Because they can say you get 200 games in your library and all those games were included anyways.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Pre-owned Xbox One consoles.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
$149.99.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
They are pre-owned of course.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I really feel like the fact that they couldn't get this down to $199.99 is the most sad thing about it.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Unfortunately.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
The Xbox One is a fine console and obviously some of the things they are bundling in there.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Especially things like Forza 3 was a fantastic game.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Minecraft is obviously a must.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Sea of Thieves is pretty cool.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I understand they are trying to bundle them in and give some exclusives.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
They didn't get the price low enough.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
To be fair, a one terabyte console.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
We are going to tip for tat.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
$199.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
It's a bummer they couldn't get it lower.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
But at the same time.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's not like this is a make or break console for Microsoft.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
This is very much a bridge.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And probably what's going to end up being a very short bridge into June.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And the major hype that's about to begin for whatever Microsoft has next.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Whether they make this holiday or they are targeting I think would be more likely March next year might be something they are targeting.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
So they are going to get a little jump on next year but not a big one.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
That's my guess anyway.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
They will put it in the fiscal year but they are not going to put it in the holiday.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Because the Nintendo Switch and so many other things in gaming have shown that the holiday calendar is no longer like the definitive guide to a game release schedule that it used to be.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So I would say Microsoft is going to show something in June that they are going to put out in March.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And that's going to be far more exciting than this bridge system to close out this era of the Xbox.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I would say hold off on getting anything.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Honestly at this point you might as well wait until the next generation or buy used.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
If you really want to get in on that.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Honestly this isn't interesting to me at all.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I'm just going to play stuff on my PC because I get the Xbox games that I want on there.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
All the first party stuff.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I wish they had Game Pass on my PC so I could run all those Xbox One games on there.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But they don't have that yet.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And I'm not getting anything less than an Xbox One X.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And it would be pointless for me to get it now because anything I would probably plan there would be a multiplatform anyways and I would already own it.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Well Johnny Wu-Fei in our chat kind of echoing some of this here saying I haven't had much of a use for it since I can play the Xbox One games on PC.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And Bobby says well Microsoft says the Xbox is a platform and not necessarily a console.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
You know not to build the hype too much.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
We have one more little bit about E3 for Microsoft right?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yeah.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I want to bridge into this.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
So tell us what to expect for E3.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So E3 they're going to be doing their Xbox conference on June 9th at 1pm.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So that's going to be a Sunday.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Let's see here.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Look at my calendar here.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
June 9th is a Sunday.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So Sunday at 1.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
That's going to be a big day for OLR.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Yeah.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And so they're going to be doing something.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
This is the same day as Bethesda.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I think that was the same as last year as well.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And yeah.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So that's going to be they're going to make their announcements then.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So we'll have to wait and see what they announce.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Do not forget y'all.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
One of the biggest news stories that came out of this previous E3.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Just how many game studios Microsoft has working for them right now.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I don't want to set the bar too high.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But I'm fully you know Microsoft is going into this E3 essentially uncontested.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I mean you could say Nintendo is going to be doing their thing.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
But Microsoft and Nintendo are now kind of buddy buddy.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah they're kind of like winking at each other.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
You know that they're hooking up on the side.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You know it you know they fuck it.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
We got we got.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
There's so many fan wank ideas out there.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It's like.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
So here's here's the thing is that.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Oh my God.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
What if Reggie's going to Microsoft.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
No no put.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Take that out of the universe and put it back in your mouth.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
He is not going to Microsoft.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
He's taking a well-earned fucking vacation which by the way is on Twitter now.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Did you notice that.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I did.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I'm following him.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So anyway I'm fully expecting we're going to get it any three or it's just we're just going to have game pow game pow game.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I think we're going to have a Nintendo partnership pow.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I don't know if I go that far but I mean we I don't know.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I don't even want that would be pretty awesome.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I don't I don't want to get into that kind of fan wank here on O.L.R.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
But I mean certainly people are thinking the new powered switch game pass on the switch something like that.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I mean you know even something like rare replay come into the switch would be like a huge deal and Cuphead just came out on the switch this week.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I know that's a game a lot of people have been playing so who knows.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But anyway that all kind of ties back into what Bobby said we're like Xbox is more of a service if you think about it that way.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
So it's like you know even though we keep talking about next console next console next console.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.000
There's a very distinct possibility Microsoft could be coming out to this E3 to say all right we're here to show off what our game developers are making and we've got a lot.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So it's going to be interesting.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I'm very excited.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I'm very exciting for June.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Mr. Rizos in our chat says agreed with Rob if Microsoft doesn't come to E3 with a load of games it's going to be a miss.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Bobby says a game game game game no sports no TV game game game.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Akuma JP in chat says developers developers developers developers.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yes except this time they're all Microsoft developers essentially.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
All right anyhow let's move on and talk about let's talk about why not.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
We're talking about all the modern consoles let's talk about retro consoles because everything retro is new again.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
The Sega Genesis Mini.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I know some of you all are excited about that.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Well some more titles are coming to the Sega Genesis Mini or the Mega Drive Mini depending on where you live.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Ten more were announced and that that's going to be Thunder Force 3 Super Fantasy Zone.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Musha World of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I'm surprised about that one.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah Streets of Rage 2, The Hybrid Front, Landstalker, Contra Hardcore, Dinah Brothers 2, and Gamaeno Kanzume Otokyo.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So those were only Japan titles over there so the US I guess is getting different games.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Oh yes no they did announce the US differences.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So US is also going to get Castle of Illusion.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Let me just start the list over.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
God it's like completely different.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Good lord. Earthworm Jim, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Castle of Illusion World of Illusion, Contra Hardcore, Streets of Rage 2, Thunder Force 3, Super Fantasy Zone, Shinobi 3, and Landstalker.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So I mean as far as like definitive Genesis game collections go this is shaping up pretty good.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
You know what they need? They need the Lion King and Aladdin and those other. Why not?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
If they got Castle of Illusion why not go in on those other Disney Genesis games.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Yeah. Why not Jurassic Park on the Genesis 2? Shoot.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000
So I don't I yeah here we go again with how did they get the licenses for those things back where they can put out a Mickey Mouse game.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Either they worked out a deal with Disney or it's part of the original agreement that they get to put out as many rehashes of the same game as they want.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But remember if I remember right the Castle of Illusion got an HD retreatment at one point on the 360 and they already well and PlayStation 3 and I think at that time.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
So they already worked out all those arrangements at one point so anyway.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Bobby does point out the downside for me on the Sega Classic all the games I want to play I already have on the Xbox 360.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. True.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
YYR follows that up with the same question I would have asked but do you still have your 360 hooked up at the moment? I don't.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Well at some point it's not going to matter if your console is hooked up because Xbox is a service.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.000
But we're not talking about Xbox anyway. This is about the Sega Genesis Mini. Does this sound like something you might be interested in picking up?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Maybe. I mean I have the SNES Classic which I don't play very much at all. So I don't know. Maybe.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I'll see what the retail release kind of full thing all the games and how much they want for it and all that good stuff.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I just need to get a better set up for all that stuff because right now it's just kind of sitting next to my TV. It's not hooked up.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I need to hook it up to my actual like monitors that I use my computer on to I think it'd be better that way.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Alright well speaking of classic games why don't we take a moment to take a break and take a trip down memory lane with our classic game of the week. Sound good?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yep.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Alright so we're going to open up the portal of time and take a trip down memory lane in a segment that we call the classic game of the week.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:56.000
But as I mentioned earlier in the show Dark Sakura she is out of town right now so she is unavailable today to take us into the vault for the classic gaming week.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:08.000
But I called on one of our good pals here at Orange Lounge Radio another host of a show here at the voice geeks network of vognetwork.com and one of my long time gamer buddies to help fill in the segment for tonight.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Say hello everybody to from gamebuoy.org Captain Spike.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Hello hello hello thank you for having me tonight Rob.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it. How are you?

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
You know I am doing lovely tonight. How are you doing?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I am doing good. Did you have a good holiday?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
It has been a lovely holiday weekend for me. How about yourself?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Good of course I'm talking about Easter I wouldn't be talking about any other times holidays going on this weekend of course.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Of course of course all the children were walking in nature.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Of course. Anyway Spike you know the drill so every week Dark Sakura usually picks a game from her collection or otherwise in the past to highlight as the classic game of the week.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And you know what I know over at gamebuoy you guys like to highlight a lot of things that might not necessarily be in the mainstream kind of off the off the radar.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So and I know you've also played a lot of games over the years you know a lot about your classic games your modern games.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.000
So I wanted you to pick something for tonight. So Spike what do you want to highlight as the classic game of the week this week.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Oh my gosh. Well of the three people that I told I was going to be doing this this weekend.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Literally all three guess what game I was going to be picking. So I get that you probably guessed too Rob.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I'm highlighting Demon's Crest. This is a classic Super Nintendo game Super Famicom in Japan obviously.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I was released there as demons plays on. It's a spinoff of the classic ghosts and goblins series as well as an indirect follow up to the spinoffs of that series gargoyles quest and gargoyles quest 2.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It was released in Japan in October of 1994 in North America of November of 1994 and in the PAL regions in March of 1995.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The reason why I picked this game this week in particular is because while it is my very favorite game of all time.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And I think a real underappreciated gem right this very moment in gaming where I think there's sort of this real focus on games that merge sort of classic 2D elements along with like world exploration.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:38.000
A lot of like metroidvania interconnected like environmental interactivity kind of game design elements.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000
The thing is all these things are like super popular now, but demons crest was doing them in 1994.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Oh what a hipster choice. My game was doing this back in 94. No but you're right. You're right.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Like there's a lot in common with one of my favorite Super Nintendo sleeper hits Actraiser right where you kind of go between like over the world and then you have like side scroller elements like you know it's kind of a little bit everything.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Well exactly and you know it's funny that you bring up the Actraiser comparison because you know they both very similarly for world navigation use a sort of top down style perspective looking down on the world using in fact the Super Nintendo's much vaunted mode 7 effects to rotate you know like a giant sprite of the world map around you really to create that really cool looking visual effect that was I think at the time really unique to Super Nintendo games.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I don't really think you were seeing those kinds of visual effects on any other hardware.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:51.000
No and funny enough mode 7 is also all over the news this week with that emulator that is like rendering the more HD images of the mode 7 stuff kind of neat.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I was literally just going to say that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Oops my bad I'll stop stepping on your toes.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:20.000
No no it's perfect in fact I was going to say I would actually like to run this game in an emulator I just thought about it while I was talking about it like oh wait, I have something exciting new to see now because I would really like to see that world map rendered in that higher resolution and see maybe what kind of details I've been missing in one of my all time faves.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.000
But because I'm already getting a little long in the tooth and I've literally not even described the game itself.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I will note, for those of you who have played the ghosts and goblins ghouls and ghosts any of those games in that series in demons crest, along with gargoyles quest and gargoyles quest to actually take control of one of those red armor enemies you know the the flying little baddies with the gargoyle wings.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And basically, you're sort of almost like the review of demons.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:06.000
You're playing this red armor you're named fire brand, and you're basically just out there looking for, you know, the biggest challenge you want to test your powers you want to become you know the most powerful demon.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And if you can save the world while you're doing that. Awesome.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Which is actually kind of like my favorite like anti hero type stories because I'm very 1990s because of when I was born.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
It is what it is.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So following this you basically take fire brand on this adventure through the world to find you know six different magical stones that are going to combine to form you know the demons crest it's a whole thing.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:46.000
But the neat thing is as you find these stones which you would be forgiven for thinking they were the Infinity Stones from powerful universe because it's like the time stone the heaven stone that earth stone that air stone.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:59.000
But the really neat thing is when you get each of these stones you actually unlock a new form for your gargoyle. So, each of these forms has completely different abilities so one of them has the ability to freely fly.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:16.000
One of them has a really cool tackle ability that can destroy, you know freestanding obstacles within the world. You know, one of them can swim incredibly well and can can breathe underwater which none of the other forms can do, which enables you to explore all the underwater areas.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Basically, this, this was Capcom very much having a how do we put mega man in this moment.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:33.000
No, I'm just kidding. Maybe exactly and I was actually going to note you know a lot of the people who worked on this game did in fact work on the mega man revitalization of mega man x.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:48.000
When you look at the staff listing of mega man x and compare it to demons crest. You see a lot of names in common among the two, and this really does feel like almost the mega man x version of a ghosts and goblins game.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So it becomes this very challenging metroidvania style almost maze where there's just tons of like hidden stuff and optional things that if you really just want to like beat the game you can actually play this game through in like two hours and 30 minutes, but if you want to find everything

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:19.000
and unlock like the most ultimate gargoyle form, then yeah mega man x style expected to a lot of exploration, a lot of platforming and ultimately to see some really cool hidden stuff.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So what is it about this game that makes it your fave because to call something you know your absolute favorite you've played a lot of games I hope our listeners understand this you've played a lot of games.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:42.000
What is it about this one especially when you consider that the critical reaction I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't you know it wasn't a 40 in famitsu either. You know what is it about this game really that makes it yours your fave?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Well I'm sorry it wasn't a 40 in famitsu not every game can be nintendogs, but that game got a 40 in famitsu and I bring that up every time.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I know I did it's it's it's a plus shade it's great.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I will say, I actually am team famitsu on the nintendogs thing it's just convenient shade.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:14.000
When they gave nintendogs that a they basically said it was the best virtual pet simulator they could imagine. I can't really disagree with that at the time.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Okay, but Demon's Crest.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Okay sorry the thing is with Demon's Crest first I think it has some of the most interesting sprite work I've ever seen.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:37.000
The sprite work in this game it's very detailed but it's um in that like super nintendo capcom high detail type so it's all very like textured and gritty and dark.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Lots of really interesting uses of the super nintendo's color palette to really sort of sell this like brooding dark gothic fantasy.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And the thing is when you say brooding dark gothic fantasy that is literally my exact jam.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It really is.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Right and then you marry you know this game has like a ton of like really challenging giant beautifully animated boss encounters.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:16.000
This soundtrack is just this like really low key atmospheric creepy like japanese malice miser like visual kei goth rock type atmosphere I just.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:28.000
For me, if you were to ask me to design my ideal game I would say oh why don't you take Castlevania symphony of the night, fill it with more demons and spooky shit.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Make it a much harder game, and give me a more fun upgrade system.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And that's what this game is to me symphony of the night but better. And that's why it's my favorite, except it was before most of those things you mentioned which made it like hipster and awesome.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Well, and that's, that's actually the thing is, um, you know, people will often say to me, like, Oh yeah, you know, after symphony of the night like what's my next step I'm like no actually you have to take a few steps back.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And that's actually also I always try to call attention to this game you know it's been, it's gotten virtual console releases on the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS which is delightful obviously it is still on the market, you can still access it.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:24.000
But I'm also always trying to raise hell about this game, pun fully intended, because I would really really like it if this could get back on somebody's radar over at Capcom so, you know, wink wink.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:36.000
So for all those hundreds of people at Capcom that are listening right now but I'm an all seriousness like how can somebody revisit this game, legally, like, is, I mean, I guess you can find the Super Nintendo cartridge.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It was on the Wii Virtual Console right is there any other like collections or anything. Well yeah as I just noted it was released on the Wii U Virtual Console, and it was released on the 3DS Virtual Console.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Got it. But unfortunately I think that's only on the new 3DS that you can do the Super Nintendo games. Yeah, that's right.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Well I think we all kind of forget that the 3DS can do that in the first place. So right, right now this is, I think, kind of a harder title to play legitimately but it's one that is absolutely worth it.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:18.000
The easiest way probably the Wii U Virtual Console second easiest probably 3DS Virtual Console, and there's not really a third way presently.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Alright well there it is, your classic game of the week, Demon's Crest, great choice, underrated soundtrack, all those things you already mentioned, it's great.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Before we get back to the live show tonight, Spike, I know you co-host a show with our pal Slidekick called gamebuoy.org video game podcast.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And you've been on a little bit of a hiatus but you're kind of like, you're back, you're like back and bigger and better than ever, right? Tell us a little bit about gamebuoy.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:42:04.000
That's correct, in fact we'll be recording an episode either later today or tomorrow night, but gamebuoy is your sort of weekly, we're still working on our schedule, but we are your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar but most definitely should be.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And what that means in practical terms is we like to take games and news stories that we think maybe aren't getting enough attention or getting enough light or viewpoints, you know, alternative takes that we are just maybe not seeing yet enough light.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And we sort of try to shine a light on those things and you know just sort of make the gaming space a little more equitable for everybody and ideally, you know, just maybe talk about some serious issues while enjoying our weird hipster games.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I love it, great pitch and it's a great show, I do, I highly recommend it and I'm not just saying that because you guys are my buddies but that's part of it too for sure.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Well thanks for that, I do truly appreciate your support, we wouldn't even do what we do if not for Orange Land Radio, y'all really inspired us and made our lives better.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Oh stop, thank you so much, that's the ultimate compliment. Well Spike, thank you for being on Orange Land Radio tonight and highlighting one of your faves here for the Classic Game of the Week, I know Dark Soccer would be very proud and best of luck with everything over at gamebuoy.org.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Gamebuoy.org, thank you so much, thank you for having me, have a happy Easter and to the OL Army, I love y'all, I hope to see y'all over on the SS Buoy and thank you for having me.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Alright thanks again very much to Spike for helping out with the Classic Game of the Week while Dark Soccer was unavailable, I was hoping to bring in some more guests, I know it's fun when you and I get to do it but it's also really fun to let some of our friends of the show do that.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:44.000
So obviously we don't like not having Jamie here but you know, breaks and vacations, those types of things are going to happen so big thanks to Captain Spike over at Game Buoy for stepping in with the game.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I've known Spike for some time, over 10 years, probably much longer and I already knew Demon's Crest was one of his favorite games, I was just more surprised Jamie had never picked that one herself quite frankly but it's a good pick, it's a very good pick.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And one of those games that wasn't super well reviewed when it came out as we kind of addressed there in the clip but definitely has things that feel influential in games that were after it, it was really a whole package of a game.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And I noticed in our chat She-Hulk says, looks fun, I'm sold on it, and yeah, I think Spike would be very happy to hear that, that you're sold on it.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Alright, well let's get back into some rapid fire news and talk about some other news going around around the industry this week.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Yes, and as alluded to in the classic game segment, there is a brand new mod for BSNES that allows HD Mode 7, so it actually improves the quality of Mode 7 up to 4 times horizontally and vertically.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Which we referenced in the bit there because Demon's Crest used that, yeah.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:05.000
And it looks quite good, so they have several comparison screenshots showing everything from Pilotwings, Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, and just the difference is pretty crazy.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah, over at our Discord, a cheap plug for vognetwork.com slash Discord, some folks had posted articles about it and I was looking at some of the screenshots that they were posting too, it just looks like the F-Zero one you've got up right now, the F-Zero.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Oh my gosh, it looks great. I mean, for a Super Nintendo game, it's not suddenly going to make it 8K, but it's like, wow, you really see the difference.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Yeah, so it does look quite a bit different, especially with Mario Kart where the whole game was pretty much just Mode 7, so it does look pretty nice.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So you can go check that out, they had a link on the emulator, or emulation subreddit on Reddit there, so I'm sure you can find it, or Google, you know, and check it out.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Yeah, BSNES version 107.1 Beta 1, the HD Mode 7, so looks cool.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:15.000
And then another game that might benefit from enhanced resolution, Minecraft. Still no 4K output for it, or HD or version with better lighting and stuff, but we're going to be getting that movie at some point soon.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:24.000
So, March 4th, 2022, Warner Brothers and Mojang will release Minecraft the Movie. They said it's about a teenage girl and her unlikely group of adventurers.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Oh, so it's not even Steve.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Yes, it's after the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, they must save their beautiful blocky overworld.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
And unfortunately, I know that they've had a change of director and writers on this, so...

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Yeah, things changed hands a few times at this point.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Yeah, so we'll have to see what it's like when it comes out.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Well, moving on to other news happening around the world, Mortal Kombat 11 is out, is that this week or next?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
It's next.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Yes, it's pretty soon though, and I think early retail copies...

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I'm sorry, this week, this coming week.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:10.000
This coming week. So, but the retail copies are already making their way out there, so of course, you know, early copies are leaking and so forth.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And apparently what happened is that the Switch version of Mortal Kombat 11, apparently the Switch version, some data miners went to town on the Switch version and guess what?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Figured out all the DLC characters already. So not only did we get the whole roster spoiled for us, but now we know all the DLC characters.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
So at your own risk?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Allegedly, yeah.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Well, allegedly, but like, I don't, like, this is a pretty solid way of doing it. So anyway, if you don't want to spoil yourself, just mute for about 30 seconds. I am going to read the list here real quick.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
The list includes Shang Tsung, Joker, I'm assuming that's...

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Probably not Persona 5 Joker.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Probably not Persona 5 Joker.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Nightwolf, Sindel, Terminator, that's pretty rad.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Spawn, Ash, that's very rad.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Fujin and Shiva, so not to be found.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Molina, unfortunately, it looks like Molina really, really is dead, so she won't be coming back.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But that's pretty cool about Fujin. I don't think he's been in a game since, like, what...

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Well, Mortal Kombat Annihilation, I think everybody was in that, but like, I don't remember him since 4.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
He was the Air God, like Raiden's the Thunder God, so...

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yeah, so very, very interesting.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Ash is awesome.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Yeah, heck yeah.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So, alright, well, we'll see if that holds true or not. It's going to be interesting to see how they respond to it.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Anyway, also, something to talk about is the upcoming Final Fantasy concert, specifically a Final Fantasy VII concert.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
This Final Fantasy VII official concert, a symphonic reunion, is going to take place on June 9th in LA.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Hmm, what else is happening right around that time frame in LA?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
A lot of people will be there for in the game industry. Oh, yes, E3.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000
What's happening during E3, okay, or right around, well, June 9th is the same day as...

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Bethesda and Microsoft.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Yeah, so basically this is happening at the same time as Bethesda's conference.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And you know what's funny? I remember at my very, it was my very first E3, my very first one,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Jason, who does our voiceovers here, and he's a great guy who helps out so much behind the scenes here at OLR.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Him and I went to the first Dear Friends, like the first Final Fantasy concert that was at the Walt Disney symphonic thing.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
That was the first E3 we went to, so that was like, that was a while ago, it was probably about 15 years ago at this point.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.000
So it's kind of interesting they're doing this again kind of all these years later, but this one is specifically for Final Fantasy VII.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So it will, they're boasting a massive orchestra, over 100 musicians, HD video projection of all the games.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Arnie Roth is conducting, which I remember he did the one like 15 years ago, so he's still doing it, so that's great.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:52.000
They're going to be doing, the tickets are on sale now if it's not already sold out, but they went on sale yesterday.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And get this, they start at $77.77.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Get it? Because of Final Fantasy VII.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Anyway, if you're going to be in LA and want to check out that concert, I'm sure a lot of people will be wanting to go to that.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:12.000
It'll be interesting to see if maybe any CDs or other types of official soundtracks, digital soundtrack, if nothing else, on Spotify, Apple Music, things like that.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Makes its way out there, it'll be pretty cool.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some video games that are going to be coming a little sooner than the Final Fantasy VII remake.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Well, this week we've got Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen on the Nintendo Switch.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Mortal Kombat 11 on PC, Switch, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
A game called Cytus Alpha on Nintendo Switch.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Let's see, Imperator Rome, it looks like.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
That's going to be on PC.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Steam World Quest, Hand of Gilgamesh on the Nintendo Switch.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000
And Umehara Kawase Fresh, that's also on Switch.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Box Boy and Box Girl, that's on Switch.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Days Gone on Playstation 4.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Oh hey, finally that's coming out.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Finally check one off the list of games that they show us at every E3.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
That's finally making its way out.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
That's out on Playstation 4.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And last but not least, Super Meat Boy Forever on PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
No Mac.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Speaking of games they show us every E3, what did you think about that buzz, rumor, people on the internet speculating,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
what do you think about all that talk that Death Stranding might actually end up on Playstation 5 at this point?

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I don't think it will end up on Playstation 5.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
We'll see. I had to ask, sorry.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I mean, it'll be disappointing if it is.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Alright, let's move on and take a look at Japanese releases, then I'll have Loki take care of Europe.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:56.000
So over in Japan this week, several games still coming out this week, even though I think Golden Week is next cycle,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
but we still may be trying to get all the games out before then.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Eve Rebirth Terror is out this week in a regular limited edition on the Playstation 4.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.000
The Starlink Starter Edition, yeah, is finally coming out in Japan on the Playstation 4.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I didn't realize they had to wait for it, but I guess they did.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Maybe they're just taking all the unsold ones here and putting them out in Japan, I don't know.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Anyway, that's not what they're doing, it's localized I'm sure.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Satsujin Tantei Jack the Ripper comes out in Japan this week as well.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And guess what, Days Gone is the same date that we get it, as well as I believe Europe.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.000
That is also out this week in Japan, so if you're looking forward to Days Gone over there, this is your chance.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I should also mention the Nintendo Switch releases this week because they have some big stuff on Japan this week, actually quite a bit, wow.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Cytus Alpha is out this week, Starlink Battle for Atlas, also in Japan this week.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization, a deluxe edition supporting several different languages is out this week in Japan on the Switch.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arisen, and probably the biggest title here, the Final Fantasy XII Zodiac Age Switch release is out this week in Japan, so that is on April 25th.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Also, that Jack the Ripper game I referenced a moment ago, also out this week, there's a new Yu-Gi-Oh! game, Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Konami is still putting out Yu-Gi-Oh! games, so that's out in Japan as well as this week.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And if you need something maybe a little less stressful, Pixel Puzzle Pack 3-in-1 from Rainy Frog is out this week.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
So there you go, that's what Japan looks like. How about Europe?

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Europe, we have Mortal Kombat 11 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
The Wizards on PlayStation 4.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Bomber Crew on PlayStation 4 and Switch.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Dragon Marked for Death on the Switch.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And Days Gone on PlayStation 4.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Alright, so pretty busy week, especially with the always-rumored, always-speculated Days Gone.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I mean, you know, obviously we knew they were actually making it, but it's like, whoa, it's finally here. Finally.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:08.000
And actually, I'm sorry to correct myself, because I just assumed that it was out at the same time.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Mortal Kombat 11 is only out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next week. The Switch version doesn't come out until May 9th.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Is that a Europe thing?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
That's a Europe thing.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Interesting, I wonder what... Boy, Nintendo. I wasn't kidding earlier, Nintendo really does hate you guys, I'm sorry.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Alright, anyway, I wonder what that's about.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Alright, AkumaJP is confirming, because I know he's over in Japan, Golden Week.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
We have 10 days holiday this year, so, yeah, all these games are coming out in a bit.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
It's kind of like Christmas for us, in a way. You got all these holidays back to back to back.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000
So, what's happening, it's like they're getting all the games out before everybody's gonna be home for an extended period of time.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
That makes sense. Alright, anyway, let's go to the emails.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangelandtrady.com, and we read our favorite emails and respond to them here live on the air.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
So, again, if you want to email us, participate at orangelandtrady.com, and we actually have quite a few emails this week.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Well, three, that's a lot for us, so we're gonna...

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Better than none.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
That's right, it's better than none, so it means you all get spared a week of Drag Race talk, and I had a lot I could've talked about this week.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
But, nope, we're gonna go to emails.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I appreciate it.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
So, Loki can start by thanking Robert M. for this first email, who says,

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I just got to the part of my music library with Anamanaguchi, the chiptune artist, right?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Yes.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:27.000
And thought the title Airbrushed RAC Remix looked familiar, but couldn't place it until I actually heard it.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I instantly recognized it from when I tried out LittleBigPlanet Racing.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Sony really hasn't done much with the character Sackboy, who raises the question,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Who's your favorite video game character who is fundamentally designed to be a blank slate?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
That's a tricky question.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
The only other example I can come up with is Steve from Minecraft.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Does his name still use the question mark?

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I prefer to keep it to myself.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I assume Commander Shepard from Mass Effect is too much his own personality to fit the concept,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
and I would correct you, because for some people, Commander Shepard is very much her.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So, I think Shepard works as a blank slate character, so to speak.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
It just depends. I think it kind of depends what you mean by blank slate.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Do you mean a character that you're really kind of designing to be your own,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.000
or do you just mean a character that you kind of paint up and costumeize and all these sorts of things?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
So, that is from Robert M.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Well, mine would have to be...

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Well, it depends on which game you're referring to, because in the earlier games,

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
he was the player, but in the later games, he's the boss.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
So, Saints Row.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Bobby Black Wolf called it in chat.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
There is Saints Row for you, of course.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Yes, of course.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Favorite blank slate character?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I don't know. I mean...

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Really, it's Troy Baker. He's my favorite blank slate character.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I play so many MMOs.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I kind of feel like the generic MMO archetype is kind of like my favorite blank slate character.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I do really like the characters that I roll in different MMOs,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000
both World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, XI, you name it.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I've always enjoyed MMO characters.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I mean, I'm not really the type to go and write a backstory to my character and all that,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
but some people do that and really get into it,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
and that's a really big blank slate for some people as MMOs.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Anything else that comes to mind, Loki?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I guess the...

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Dragonborn, Skyrim.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Skyrim? Okay, yeah.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I was going to read some answers from chat.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
AkumaJP suggested Elder Scrolls.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
AkumaJP also said Fable.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
That's a good answer.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Fable was kind of infamous for that, especially when we got into Fable 2, especially in 3.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
And then, let's see, Questbuster says,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
any RPG where you make your own character.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
To be fair, there are a ton...

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I mean, so many RPGs where you make the hero yourself in your own making.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Johnny Wu-Fei suggests Dark Souls.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
So, for some people that like those insane difficulty type of games, yes, certainly.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
So, yeah, those are some good answers, guys.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
So, there you go. Thanks for the email.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Next email from Rettertainment.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Hello, peoples.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
By the way, I love this because the subject is

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
weird shit you've seen at a con, so we know where this is going, right?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So, here we go from Rettertainment.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Hello, peoples. I'm currently at FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
which is what they call it now that San Diego has apparently gotten the trademark on a common term.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Well, they can't stop me from saying it, so I'll say Comic-Con Salt Lake City.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Is that what they call it? Salt Lake Comic-Con?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
That's what they used to call it.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
But, okay.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I've been passing by a booth on the vendor floor all day,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
which is selling something that I've never seen in real life,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
much less on sale in the real world.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
This makes me wonder, what's the weirdest fucking thing you've seen at a convention?

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Can you top a wide selection of waifu pillowcases?

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And we got a picture to go along with it of, I think if I just...

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I'm doing the technology, sorry.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And unfortunately, I can't show it. It's a very low resolution image anyway.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
But you can see there's all these pillowcases that just have, you know,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
waifu maids, costumes, catgirl costumes, and everything you would expect.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
It's not that weird.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I know, I'm kind of like, that's kind of normal.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
But yeah, if you don't go to conventions a lot, you probably don't see that sort of thing.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
They sell, I think Bioware might even officially be doing it.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
There's like a Garris one now.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Because you know that got posted to Jamie's Facebook wall like five times.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Yes, I saw that, yeah.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
So, it's not just waifu maids.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I mean, I thought it like, if you're saying weird stuff,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I thought you're gonna have like dragon dildos or something like that, you know.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
That's kind of weird, but even that's not that weird anymore.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I honestly, I thought, because I laughed when I first saw this for the first time.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I want to say it was at PAX, actually.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Is I saw those mouse pads, but the part, the wrist rest part are boots.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Oh, the booty mouse.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
The booty mouse pads.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I think those are commonplace now, but the first time I ever saw one of those was at a convention.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.000
And what's funny, now where I think it's funny, now obviously it's a lot of the same waifu stereotypes

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
that you see like on those mouse pads, but now you're starting to see really funny shit.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I've seen a Deadpool one where it's Deadpool boobs.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
That's awesome.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
And then I saw one, not that long ago, online somewhere where somebody took Reaper from Overwatch

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
and made a mouse pad with Reaper, but with the giant cleavage.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And that's the stuff I think is funny, is when you take those sorts of stereotypes

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
and apply them to characters that were not meant to be stereotyped in that way,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
but that's what makes them funny.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
So, I mean, well Deadpool is...

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I don't know, like some of the early anime conventions I went to,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
we used to hang out with some of the artists at the artist's row or whatever,

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.000
and I remember talking with one of them and we were there when they were talking about

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
some of the weird requests and commissions that they got,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
and there was one that someone had to do a...

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I think it was a sexy Stalin or sexy Abraham Lincoln or something like that,

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
and that was kind of funny.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I had to pull this up because somebody in chat mentioned at the ACT DEV said there's an Isabelle,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:06.000
but instead of it being breasts, it's fruit from Animal Crossing.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So it's Isabelle like holding up fruit.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
At least that's wholesome.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Yeah, it's very wholesome, but it's the same idea.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000
To get that for like Jamie and just wrap it up and so she'd think that it's like boobs and...

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Oh my, oh that's a good idea.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Shh, don't tell her, don't tell her. We're gonna do it.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
We're gonna prank her with that gift.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
But she'd love it because it's Animal Crossing, right?

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Yeah.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Or, I'm sure there's a Geras.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Is there a Geras one? Hold on, I gotta Google that.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Fill time.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Alright.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
While you're shopping online there.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Yeah, I mean, that's the only weird thing I could think of.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
No, I didn't find a Geras boob.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Just a heart-shaped mouse pad with Geras.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Anyway.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
You knew that's something I had to look for.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
ActDeftInChat says those mouse pads are actually really great for your wrist.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I mean, all joking aside, yes, that's the type of mouse pad I use at work.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And not the booby ones, but obviously just the very generic like Office Depot type of like gel pad and mouse pad type of thing.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
They really are great to use.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
So, anyway.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Moving on, we got one more email tonight.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Thank you very much, Redertainment, for that email.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
We got one more email tonight from frequent contributor YYR.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Always good to hear from him.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Hello, LR. Just wanted to say hello and offer my thoughts on last week's show.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
There was a piece of Destiny 2 news.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Bungie messed up and offered some items on non-PlayStation platforms that were still supposed to be timed PlayStation exclusives.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Players who obtain these items simply can't use them until the exclusivity window closes.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:48.000
You suggested that players could consider filing a lawsuit over the fact that they are able to obtain items that can't be used.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I feel like I didn't...

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
No, I think we said it would be ridiculous to do that.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
No, I think I said, how long until this is going to happen?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
More like one of those, we live in this type of society.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
But I said, you know, it's not going to probably happen.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Or I wouldn't be surprised if...

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Because by the time that they do end up filing a lawsuit or it goes through, it's already going to be out and who cares.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Or who knows, maybe I did say it, I don't know.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.000
If Bungie were to simply let players use these items, I believe that a lawsuit absolutely would happen.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Only it would come from Sony, who would be suing Bungie for breach of contract.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I am sure they paid a pretty penny to put the PlayStation logo all over the marketing.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:31.000
And to get that item, exclusivitsity, you need to stop using that word in emails.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I don't know why it trips me up every time.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Exclusivity?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Exclusivity.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I don't know why I can't say it.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
It's like my Achilles heel of talking.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.000
I can talk for like 10 hours a day and I often do, but that's the one word that will slaughter me.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Anyway, that word is officially banned from emails. Don't use it.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:59.000
You can say exclusive window, exclusiveness, exclusive time, you can use any other combination.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000
If they're not getting what they paid for, I'm sure they'd get their lawyers on it right away.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.000
So as stupid as it sounds that players obtain items they can't use, I believe there's a good enough reason why not.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Look, it's not that I disagree with you, but the problem is here we are siding with the corporation.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And it's not that what you're saying is wrong, but I also just kind of feel like, hello, it was a mistake.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.000
They closed up the mistake as fast as they could in good faith and stopped selling the items.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Sony should, because of that reason, just let it fucking slide in good faith.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Mistakes fucking happen.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Do you think Sony's never made online mistakes before in their life?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
So that's kind of like ultimately the point I was getting at is that, you know what, let it fucking go.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Because, again, if people bought something that they ultimately can't turn around and use, that's where I kind of think people are going to be like, this is fucked up.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Like, this isn't my fault.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So it just kind of sucks that we're siding on the side of the consumers.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I'm not faulting your logic.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:08.000
You make a very logical argument, and it is ultimately what's probably going to persevere in this scenario.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
But I just feel like it's fucked up.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
As a gamer, don't I get to complain about things that are fucked up?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Alright, anyway.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Moving on.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Because there's more to this email.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
So YYR continues on.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I'll just mention a couple more things.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
First, yes, Jackal is awesome.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
That was last week's soundtrack of the month.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
My father and I both played the heck out of that on the NES.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Years later, I tore through the whole thing, and I still enjoy the game today.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And yes, the music is fantastic.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Finally, don't worry.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Buzzer is still on the air, running the same old game show as usual.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
You did worry me a bit for a minute, though.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.000
They are streaming from their website 24-7 at buzzerplay.com.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
So try that on the web browser on your favorite devices.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
But they're done on Twitch.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
That's unfortunate.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
The thing I liked about Twitch, though, is all the portability, because I can watch that on the PlayStation 4.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I can watch that on the Xbox One.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I mean, sure, I could watch it in a browser window on my PC, on a tablet, on my phone.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I could do all those things.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I'm only losing it, I guess, on the consoles.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
But I thought it was kind of a fun thing to have on Twitch.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I liked having something to host when literally nothing else was streaming.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I could always fall back on 70s game shows, and now that's gone.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Oh, well. Thanks for the update, nonetheless.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
I'm glad the channel is still around.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I guess there's just always Bob Ross.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
That's true. There's always Bob Ross.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Or, God, they're probably still running the old Pokemon stuff.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
I was also going to say, I'm sure there's probably rights issues.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.000
You know, when things, you know, we want to get into legal talk again.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
There's probably rights issues, because I know Buzzer recently got, like, Supermarket Sweep.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Well, they were never showing that on Twitch, because they probably didn't have the rights to be able to do it on Twitch.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I'm sure if they are just putting out there on their own site what they're putting out over the air,

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
they're probably more allowed to do that.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And so they're probably actually able to show more game shows doing them on their own website.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
But I still liked it on Twitch. Anyway, that's it for now.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I'll have a few announcements soon.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Ooh.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
We always hear...

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Enjoy hearing stuff from YYR.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Hopefully it involves fluorescence and helicopters.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Just kidding. I'll look forward to whatever it is.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
So please look forward to those. Have a great week.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
We sure will, YYR. Thank you for the email.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000
And if you want to send an email in the future, you can send an email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Pixel Kvaka says, they did have a marathon, a Supermarket Sweep, on Twitch a while ago.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I think when they got the show.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:46.000
YYR says, I listened to VOG Network Radio and my Xbox One browser when it existed.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Yeah, Xbox One, I think, also had TuneIn, if I'm not mistaken.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Because I still remember listening on my Xbox One as well.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Regardless, now Twitch, obviously, I think Twitch is even easier in that capacity.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000
But yeah, you could listen to the old Shoutcast and a lot of different things.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
But it's the future, y'all.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
So anyway, there you go.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
That's it for our mailbag this week.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Again, we hope we get more over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Let's get to some more news stories and then we'll see if we get any calls on Discord tonight.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000
So apparently there is an SNK investors event in South Korea.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And the exec, I'm going to butcher this name.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:33.000
But it looks like Jizihui had reported that they're in the planning stages for Neo Geo 2 and Neo Geo 3.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Apparently that these are not going to be successors of the Neo Geo Mini that they did.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Also that there's a new Metal Slug in development as well.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
So that's interesting that they're going to come out all of a sudden with new game consoles.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And they're saying, what other stuff?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
This is kind of translated so I'm not really understanding a lot of it.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
But they're talking about VR and blockchain or something that they're interested in as well.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Oh boy!

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Everybody's interested in blockchain.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, interesting though to see what comes of this.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I'm surprised that they would even see it too.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And we're developing a console and the sequel to that console.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Plus the fact that we're talking about the Neo Geo.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
We're not talking about something like PlayStation where you know they're already developing the next one.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
The one before it comes out.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Is it just everybody getting into the console market nowadays?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
You got Atari.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Whatever happened to the Atari console?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Is that ever coming out?

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
It's probably still a thing.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Well it's kind of like Intellivision.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
It's quiet on that front.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I thought they've announced a date next year.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But it's in 2020 so of course they're not going to say anything about it until closer to next year.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
And I imagine Atari's probably in a similar boat.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Although honestly, I just feel like based on what we've heard so far the Amico will at least kind of have that.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Maybe I haven't seen that before kind of factor to it.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000
But anyway, as far as Neo Geo goes, to me is this more of just banking on classics?

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Because SNK does really love their classics.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
When I heard Neo Geo 2, my first thought honestly was it's probably like a classic console.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
But that they can kind of maybe expand on with maybe some games that they never finished.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Or some games that didn't come out in certain regions.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Honestly that's what my gut kind of was like.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Maybe that's what they're talking about with Neo Geo 2.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I just don't see SNK suddenly getting back in the console business.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Unless maybe it is a console developed for the Korean market or with a different market in mind.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
After all that happened in Korea.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It would be cool to see them and just develop new games with that old hardware.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
There's a new Samurai Shodown coming out.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:47.000
But it's on the standard Playstation 4 and all those consoles.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I would like to see a next gen Metal Slug.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Bobby Blackwell points out by the way since we got off track a little bit there.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Pointing out that Intellivision has an E3 press conference this year.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Cool.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Interesting. I imagine it's probably not on the same level as what Bethesda is doing or anything.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
It's probably a little bit of a smaller thing.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.000
But maybe they're going to show us the first game concept screenshot.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I don't know what the hell Bethesda is going to show us this year.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Curious.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Well I meant Intellivision.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
No I know. I'm just saying to be on the level of Bethesda.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I don't even know what they're going to even show us this year.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And the reason why I say that.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I'm not trying to poo poo what Intellivision is doing.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000
But we know that Bethesda, Microsoft, we're talking about the AAA level, huge budget games.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
When Intellivision has kind of come out and said,

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
RMO is lower budget type of titles that are going to be cheaper.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000
So obviously that's why I'm saying the expectation level is going to be very different between those two press conferences.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
We'll see.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Yeah. For sure.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about Apple getting into things as well.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
We talked about that a few weeks ago when Apple did their big conference.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
They talked about how the Apple games service is going to be coming soon.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
And we don't know the pricing details on that yet.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000
But there are some rumors about how much Apple may be spending to make this happen.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:16.000
The Financial Times reported that Apple is apparently expected to exceed a half billion dollars in funding for these games.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.000
But you know what? We know that Apple's done very well with a lot of the products that they have out there.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
And so they probably have the cash on hand to be able to do this. And in some ways it's a risk, right?

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I mean, those shows on Netflix weren't made for free.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Somebody had to put up the money to fund that first season of Orange is the New Black, you know?

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:42.000
And so this is what it takes to, you know, really get your foot out and to probably secure the exclusive things from studios like Mistwalker.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
You know, some of those other developers we talked about when we first talked about the Apple arcade.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I'm sorry, it was the actual Apple games, Apple arcade.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Anyhow, let's see. So yeah, apparently this company is, or Apple's also going to be moving into television and films.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
We also knew that in the news partnerships. We know that already from the recent iOS update.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:12.000
But yeah, this investment is going to be apparently part of that one billion total that Apple's investing in the whole package, including film and TV and all that.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Apparently most of more than the hundred games that are planned for the service have budgets in the millions of dollars.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:26.000
That's a lot of money considering it's mobile stuff. But again, Mistwalker, you know, you got some big makers in there.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'd be, I don't know. I would just have to wait and see what they have.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Because I don't think that a lot of stuff is not very memorable.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I know that they had, wasn't there a game that was from that game company or something that was supposed to be on their platforms or something like that at one time?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And I don't even remember that game coming out or it being a thing.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:56.000
I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that they're pushing that just in that marketplace is just going to get drowned out by everything else.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Unless it's like a Pokemon Go or like a big AR game or something like that.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Or even mobile games. I don't play a lot of mobile games, so I don't really know what the marketplace even looks like.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Well, you say that, but Pokemon Go is open on your phone right now.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.000
It's only open so that I can auto-catch everything. I'm not actually playing it. The game's playing itself.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
You're playing it. You're playing it.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
It's playing itself.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Okay. But my point...

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.000
And the only reason I have to keep this open is because the app is dumb and it will shut itself off if you turn the screen off.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:38.000
My point is, though, is that I think for the games to really be successful on the mobile format, they have to be designed for a mobile format.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
That's why Pokemon Go does so well. It was designed completely with the mobile phone concept in mind.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:50.000
But what makes that game interesting is it's a different type of gameplay, because honestly the AR stuff is still a bit new.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.000
And so it's different in that sense where that makes it interesting and that's the draw to it.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:02.000
But if it's just, we're going to put a triple-A game on this phone, I don't know.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
How's it going to control? How's it going to play?

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
They have PUBG and Fortnite stuff on those, but I don't know.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
In my opinion, it's not fun to play on mobile at all.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I don't know.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Other people play them on mobile and love them on mobile, so I don't know.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Apparently Carson Daly plays PUBG at the Emmys while he's sitting there.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Who gives a shit what Carson Daly does anymore?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
This isn't the 90s anymore. No one gives a fuck.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Playing PUBG or whatever.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Well, he's on The Voice, which still gets a lot of ratings, believe it or not.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000
But anyway, my point is, a lot of people play that on mobile. I just don't get it.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I cannot control a game like that.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
But maybe I'm just old. I don't know.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It's not that you're old, it's just that it's not as good as having physical buttons and actual controls.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Yeah, you could do it, but there's no feedback. It's not a good way of doing control.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
But, if you have a phone, that's kind of all you got.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So, I mean, you have to work with what you have.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000
So, that's fine, but I don't prefer games on a phone.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I prefer games having some sort of control method that's more traditional, but...

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I mean, there are other games that get away with it just fine.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
It's just, I don't know.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:20.000
I just can't see what they're envisioning with this to be so worthwhile that I actually want to pay for this service.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
It just doesn't seem like it's ever going to get to that level.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Well, we have to wait and see when the actual games come out and see how much are they going to charge for it.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
How many games are we talking? What do these games look like?

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Are they things I feel the need to play?

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I mean, it's just still early on.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:46.000
But, I mean, at least it sounds like Apple is really taking the financial risk to really believe in this.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
So, we'll see what happens.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Why can't they do that with a Mac instead?

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
You know, Apple Arcade focused on Mac.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Because gaming on Mac is like...

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Apple Arcade will work on Mac if I recall.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Okay, fine. We'll see.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000
But I was going to say, because gaming on Mac is kind of a sore spot right now.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Well, and to be fair, Apple Arcade is trying to address that.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
It is going to be a Mac thing, too.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
We'll see.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Alright.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Questbuster in chat says,

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
One thing to also keep in mind, Apple has something like $240 billion in cash on hand to burn if they want to.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
And that's also very true.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000
You have some other updates out of Nintendo, right?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Yeah, so there was a report out of Nikkei newspaper talking about some of the future Nintendo Switch hardware and different stuff going on with that system.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I know we've kind of talked about rumors that there may be some new Switch consoles coming soon.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And I think that's still more along the lines of this as well.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:54.000
So there's a report they said out of the Wall Street Journal that is talking about a smaller, cheaper, more portable Switch model coming this fall.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
And of course, they confirmed that as well.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Nikkei saying that Nintendo is planning on putting out a smaller Switch that is geared towards more portable play.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Curious to see how that's going to work.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
If that just means the screen is going to be smaller.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I mean, I don't know how that's going to work with the way the Joy-Cons are set up.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
But okay.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I mean, we'll see what happens.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:28.000
And then also that they are going to be releasing a more powerful Switch model that's going to come out sometime next year.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
And it's going to be more of a refresh.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.000
But they're not sure what exactly the form factor is going to be or how that's going to even work.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I mean, it's not unlikely for Nintendo to come out with a refresh to hardware because they do that all the time.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
But I don't know.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
It's pretty quick, I think.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
It's only been out for a few years.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
And then they also have this other device which I was completely unaware of.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Apparently that they were working on since 2014, 2015.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:09.000
That was going to be some sort of sleep tracking device, some wearable that they were working on to monitor your sleep.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000
But it's on indefinite hold since 2016.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And now they're saying that they're exiting the health business entirely.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
So they're not even going to work on it.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Which is fine.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I sort of feel like they missed the boat on that because so many people do sleep tracking through.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
And I know they were supposed to be doing something that was not something you actually wore.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I don't know how that was supposed to work.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I guess if we knew, the device would be out.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
But I know so many people that use...

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I know you have a Fitbit. I have Apple Watch.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
And I don't know if you wear yours when you sleep.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I do.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.000
But yeah, I wear mine when I sleep and I can actually see, oh, here's how much I spin around at night.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Or how my heart rate is.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I don't know how accurate some of that is.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I think it's pretty decent because I do notice if I let the machine at the gym monitor my heart rate,

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.000
and then I check out what my watch is doing, it's usually about the same.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
So I think the watch is measuring.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I mean, I don't know Fitbit super well, but I can't imagine it's much different.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
It's about the same technology-wise.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
So it's measuring your heart rate and stuff.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So it is kind of interesting, especially since I have been trying to get more active lately and been exercising more.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
It does cause your heart rate to dip more when you sleep at night.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Which is supposed to be one of the positive side effects of that.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
And I can actually see that from the sleep tracking.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:29.000
But anyway, my point is, I think the Apple Watch and the Fitbit and all that other universe kind of beat them to it.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:35.000
I feel like if Nintendo were to come out now and say, we got sleep tracking, it would be like, okay, but I'm already doing that.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I mean, now granted, Nintendo was supposed to be something not wearable.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.000
But what does that mean?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Something you would put next to the mattress or something?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I don't know how you would not wear something.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It's got to track your breathing and heart rate and stuff.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
So I don't see how they could do something not wearable.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000
ActDeftInChat says, remember the heart monitor from Nintendo or whatever that was called?

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
The Wii Vitality Sensor.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Yep. That was garbage.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Well, it never happened.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Well, then they also tried the, remember there was the, from Ubisoft.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:11.000
It was the, I want to say they were doing something for Relax, like Wii Relax or something like that.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And, but they had some sort of Vitality Sensor thing with Ubisoft as well that they tried.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Ubisoft went through a lot of really creative stages where they come up with stuff and then nothing ever come of it.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Like for example, they had that relaxation sensor with the breathing exercises.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
They had laser tag.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
What the fuck happened to that?

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Oh yeah.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Well, they probably just didn't sell it in the video game aisle.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
It probably didn't sell very well at all, but yeah, that's the thing.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:43.000
ActDeftInChat suggests the Nintendo Switch sleep tracker was having a screen come on at 1 AM saying, go the fuck to sleep.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Maybe if Samuel L. Jackson was doing it, it might be effective.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
I don't know.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Alright.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Moving on to more information on the Nintendo Switch.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Apparently, the Nintendo Switch may finally be coming out in China.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Which, you know, is newsworthy because China is a pretty big market, right?

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
There's a lot of people that live in China.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:08.000
But usually it takes the consoles a little while to come out in China because, you know, China has some strict regulations on, you know, what can be released there.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
And especially when it comes to, especially if you talk about what's been going on lately with some of the tax rules and things like that.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
So, it can be tricky.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.000
But it should be noted, Microsoft has started selling the Xbox One there within, I think, the past year.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
And Sony now offers the PlayStation 4.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
So, Nintendo should be able to offer the Switch soon.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Apparently, they are teaming up with Tencent, which has been doing a lot of stuff with gaming in China, to be bringing out the Nintendo Switch there.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:43.000
There has been the game regulators in China have provisionally approved a trial version of New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Which, you know, was obviously the Wii U version that came out on Switch about a month ago.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Maybe two months ago at this point.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
So, that's pretty interesting.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Nintendo did confirm to Reuters that they have applied for the approval to sell the Nintendo Switch.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Of course, it is a long process.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
So, it will probably take some time.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
But they are taking those steps to put out the Nintendo Switch in China.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000
So, many more of those consoles perhaps to sell.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So, we don't talk about the Chinese market very often.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.000
But obviously, with so many people there, you know, even if a console doesn't do so hot here or in Japan.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I mean, as the case of the Xbox maybe.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Like, the Xbox ain't a factor in Japan at all.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
But, I don't know what success it's having in China.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
But, it would be interesting, maybe it's selling more there.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
If you sell enough there, it can kind of make up for some of the difference, right?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Yeah.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
So, anyhow.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Moving on, Loki.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
We're almost to our call segment, if you want to get on our Discord in the green room.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
And then mention in Channel Orange's launch radio what it is you'd like to call in about tonight.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Alright.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:54.000
So, Ubisoft is going to be donating 500,000 Euro to help rebuild the Notre Dame Cathedral after the fire that happened this week.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
So, that's pretty awesome that they're doing that.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:05.000
They said, of course, that they stand in solidarity with their fellow Parisians.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Or, I guess that's how you say that.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:13.000
And everyone around the world by the devastation the fire caused.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
And they said it was an integral part of Paris.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
A city which we are deeply connected.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Seeing the monument in peril like this affected us all in light of Monday's events.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:31.000
We'll be denoting the 500,000 Euro to help with the restoration and reconstruction of the cathedral.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I was not going to be the one to correct somebody on their pronunciation, but Bobby does confirm it is what I was thinking.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Parisians.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Parisians.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Persians is something very different.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
No, no.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Parisians.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Yes, because Paris, obviously.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Anyway.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Parisians.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I thought that's how you...

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000
That's alright.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Again, I didn't want to correct on pronunciation tonight.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
There's a word I completely cannot say for some reason, so.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.000
But to go along with that, which is kind of nice, is they also have some other stuff.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
This is where it kind of ties in the gaming a little bit more.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Apparently they're offering a free PC copy of Assassin's Creed Unity for a limited time between April 17th and midnight of the 25th.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
So you have some time to actually do it.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:20.000
So in order to do that, if you haven't already, Ubisoft has a special link that you would follow.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:29.000
So it's register.ubisoft.com slash acu dash notre-dame dash giveaway slash en dash us.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
That's a big link.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000
So you might just want to Google it.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Just Google it.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
You would sign into your Ubisoft account.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:40.000
If you don't have one already, you would create one and you just add it to the cart and you get it for free.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
So that's pretty awesome.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I did that because I do have a Uplay account for when I play South Park.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
And also Far Cry.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I have not played Assassin's Creed Unity, so it will be interesting to check that out.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:05.000
And then, of course, because of this generosity from Ubisoft, people have taken to Steam to review bomb the Assassin's Creed games.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
But not in the way you might think.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
They are putting positive reviews because of that.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Basically thanking them for their contribution to the repair of the cathedral.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Thanking Ubisoft for giving away Assassin's Creed.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.000
And thank you for Uplay and its contributions and all that stuff like that.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000
So is Steam going to be taking down those reviews?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Because I know that they try to combat review bombing in the other way.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.000
I'd be curious to see how that would probably be not going to do anything.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
You should write rules or rules, right?

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Rules or rules, but that's going to be bad press.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Well, maybe if the internet would stick to this type of positive review bombs.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
If you don't like something, just shut up.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
You can always keep your mouth shut and you can talk about the things you do like.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Or if this is allowed, then you know what you need to do the next time you don't like a company.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:06.000
You review bomb their competitors and you give them positive scores because they're not douchebags like this other guy.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Sure!

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Because that apparently is allowed and that'll...

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Sure, why don't y'all go tweet Nintendo something nice.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Thank you for allowing my waifu sex games, Nintendo.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
You're the best, XO.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Reggie forever.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Why not?

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Yeah.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.000
They don't allow Balzette, but they'll allow their other waifu sex games.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Look, if they are going to positive review bomb things,

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.000
If it was only that, then that's...

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:45.000
So, I'm guessing this is probably a yes, but I'm wondering how many Balzette levels are out there in Smash Brothers.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Probably.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000
You're saying a lot of things tonight, I just really wish you wouldn't say.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
And that's one of them.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000
The other one, Reggie going to Microsoft. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Well, I didn't mean he'd actually work for Microsoft.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I mean, he would just go there to kind of like introduce the partnership.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Just think it, just think it.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I'm going to think it out loud, because how are they going to pick up through the power of podcasting my thoughts if I do not speak them.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Oh, because I'm sure they're all listening right now.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Alright, well then they'll be excited to hear about this, because I was very excited to hear about this collaboration.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:27.000
That's right, it's a partnership between the Tetris company and Hello Kitty.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.000
That's right, so to kind of bring this full circle, because we talked about Tetris at the beginning.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.000
There was a tweet from the official Tetris account this week at Tetris underscore official mentioning,

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:43.000
You love Tetris, you love Sanrio, now get ready for a brand new online game featuring both on June 3rd.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000
For more information on the Tetris Cross Sanrio partnership, head over to Tetris dot com.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
And yeah, so that's going to be, I guess, coming out on June 3rd online.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So, fun, cute, exciting.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:00.000
It's unfortunate they're going with such a violent route, but crushing Hello Kitty with Tetra-

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Stop it. You will not be crushing Hello Kitty with anything.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:11.000
It should be noted this is timed for the 35th anniversary of Tetris and the 45th anniversary of Hello Kitty.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:18.000
So, I mean, and it's interesting because this article I'm looking at is suggesting why don't they just put it in Tetris 99 or something.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
But, you know, Tetris, like I said earlier, Tetris is kind of having a little bit of a renaissance because of things like Tetris 99.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
And obviously Tetris Effect was a very different way of looking at Tetris.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
And, you know, Tetris Hello Kitty, well that'll be a thing too.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
To do a new Tetris Effect level.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.000
With Hello Kitty?

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Yeah.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I'd be all about that. Why not?

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I haven't played that game in a long time.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Why not?

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:46.000
We're going to go to the listener round table, so if you would like to give us a call, you can join our green room over on Discord.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Or, of course, you can also just send us a message in our chat room if you have anything you'd like to ask about or what have you tonight.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
We can do that as well.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:58.000
So, nobody is wanting to call in yet, but that's alright.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Sometimes people are just shy or they might be watching that television show we have to worry about for about five more weeks.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And a lot of people say-

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
It's also Easter too.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
A lot of people say, oh yeah, it is Easter. I guess that's a thing.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Doesn't everybody do Easter things in the morning though?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Everyone's hungover from 420 yesterday.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Oh, let's see. Now that I believe a little more.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Anyway, do you have any last minute stories? You had a lot of stuff assembled for tonight's show, didn't you?

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I guess. I don't know. I was-

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:32.000
There was something I saw that Kojima was teasing some stuff about streaming.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:40.000
But I think it was more of just talking on the subject of where he thinks gaming is going to go with the whole stadium stuff.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Or stadia. And how that might change gaming with being not really bound by console limitations.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:57.000
I'm still so curious what consoles are going to do to incorporate that sort of technology.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Well, what are you talking about?

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Crackdown 3 has an amazing multiplayer thing where you can destroy the really crappy looking map that they have.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Because that was totally worth the power of the Xbox cloud or whatever. Microsoft Azure cloud.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
It was a disappointment. That's what it was.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:20.000
EA shutting down the last gen servers for Burnout Paradise.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Oh yeah, I heard about that too. That seems like a long time running for those servers though.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Well, they've got the remaster now, so you can do that.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Did you ever get Dangerous Driving? I heard-

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
I didn't.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I didn't pick it up yet.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I have too many games I'm playing. If I'm going to pick up a game, it's going to be probably Iron Rain, the new Defense Force game.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:46.000
But unfortunately I haven't been able to watch TV because now my wife's gotten into another series.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
She's now watching Big Love because now we have the HBO app. It's the one about polygamy.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Yeah, that show's been off the air for a while.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Yeah, forever. But she's now picking it up. She's watching the whole series.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:05.000
So she's doing that. I think at this point I just need to move my PlayStation 4 to my computer monitors because I'm never going to ever get to play anything on it.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Bobby Blackwell, by the way, points out 11 years for those Burnout Paradise servers.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
That's a pretty long time.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Especially when you consider it's EA. That's really impressive. Because EA, that's unheard of.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:24.000
So that's pretty good. What else? Which TV show is going to be coming out this year?

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Is it this year? Well, it seems like a fast turnaround. Last call if anyone wants to call in. Or any questions in our chat.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I don't know. I have to see what else I had. I'm not really looking at my showreel stuff here.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:43.000
That's alright. I know I surprised you with that because usually we have somebody waiting.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Looking in chat, SJ100Matt says, Loki's wife watches shows on a five-year delay. It happens sometimes.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Sometimes I don't discover shows until way later too.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Bored. I don't know. I picked up Hulu because she's like, there's nothing to watch on Netflix.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I'm like, what are you talking about? There's nothing to watch on Netflix. There's nothing to watch on Netflix.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I don't want to watch any of that. Fine. I'll get you Hulu. We'll watch stuff on Hulu.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So I've been paying for Netflix and I have CBS All Access, right? Because I have to have Big Brother and Star Trek.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:13.000
And I've got to watch that new Twilight Zone. I really want to see that too. So I have those two.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:19.000
But now, because I have Spotify, and I actually personally, they're not paying me to say this.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I really enjoy that platform and it's been great for like music at the gym and things like that too.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:29.000
But now as a Spotify person, you get Hulu. So now I have all three.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.000
So yeah, Hulu, we watch mainly just, we were watching South Park. We're watching Family Guy again.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Because I miss a lot of, I miss most of South Park because I haven't watched that for seasons.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:47.000
And Family Guy's alright. So we do that. I was trying to get in the Brooklyn 99, but she doesn't want to watch that either.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:52.000
But now with HBO, she remembers, oh yeah, we have HBO because we get it with our cable.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
And so we've been watching Game of Thrones, which we'll watch that again tonight.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:08.000
But I don't know. It's like, I don't get, I had an opportunity to be able to, when she was tied up with Animal Crossing,

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.000
to actually get to play console games. And then I just didn't want to at that time.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
And then now that I do, oh, now she's in a new TV show.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Have you thought about getting your wife a booby mouse pad?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I don't know if she would want, I don't know what she's got as far as mouse pads and stuff.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.000
And she, she uses her laptop, so no real room for a mouse on our couch.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Yeah.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I've got a mouse pad at home, but I've got one of those gaming ones that's like super long.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Because it was mainly just, the thought originally was that everybody's going to be using that desk, not just me.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And that, that would save the, because the desk isn't, it's that particle board, but it's got like the fake wood look on the outside.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
And so I thought, oh, the kids are going to do homework here and they're going to fuck up everything.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
So this is going to protect the surface of the desk.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.000
No, I, no one else uses that desk. I'm the only one that uses it because, you know, even though I built it for my wife,

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
because she wants to do work from home, she's like, ah, yeah, I can.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know, I built this all for you and now no one wants to use it.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000
So now I use it because I get a triple monitor set up and, um, yeah.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000
All right. Well, that's gonna, that's gonna do it.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Uh, wrapping up for the show tonight. Um, I guess, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff going on out there in the world, but I hope you all had a great Easter.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Uh, thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight. Appreciate it. Um, let's go around.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Oh, I did want to mention one more thing.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I don't know if we talked about it last week, but I was going to say that Konami revealed all the Castlevania games are in the Castlevania.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000
I thought this came up last week, which is why I didn't address it, but I could be wrong.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I think they announced some of them.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Yeah, all right, go ahead.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
So Castlevania, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Castlevania the Adventure, which was a Game Boy game.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Uh, Castlevania III, Dracula's Curse, Kid Dracula, which I think is the first time coming out over here.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Castlevania II, Belmont's Revenge, which is on Game Boy, Super Castlevania IV, and Castlevania Bloodlines, New Generation, Vampire Killer, which is a Mega Drive game.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I would be more impressed if they would have like taken that Wii remake they did of Castlevania Adventure and put that out.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:20.000
So I don't know. And I've heard, um, that the, the arcade collection that came out kind of has some problems because like the, um, arcade archive stuff is more well-rounded.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:27.000
It supports things like the Switch being in vertical mode. Nope, Konami arcade thing doesn't. The Konami arcade thing, region, region locks the game.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Meaning like if you want to play the Japanese version of Gradius II, which is very different from the American version of Gradius II, you have to buy the Japanese collection.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.000
They don't just put both versions. And again, if you get the arcade archives one, it has all that in it.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:47.000
So it sounds like they kind of cut some corners on the collection. So it makes me a little less excited about the Castlevania one.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Who would have thought being disappointed by Konami in 2019 again, but here we are.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Anyway. All right. So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Uh, Dark Soccer will be back with us next week in studio. I'm sure she'd say something witty if she were here.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Uh, but, uh, we'll, we'll welcome her back to the show next week. So it's just us. So thanks. Thanks for being here tonight, Loki.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Um, not really. I've been working on, uh, my game.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Not much, not much has happened this, this week. I didn't get much done.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I was trying to get the camera angle right because the silo game I'm doing, it's, I don't know.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:39.000
It's kind of weird the way I'm doing it because it doesn't really work with the silo game I'm trying to emulate.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:50.000
That was very vague, but it's just, it's hard to figure out how I need to get the camera set up to actually have enough space to do everything and to make it look right.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Anyway, I'm sure later on that makes sense, but all right. Fair enough. All right.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:00.000
And then my final thought with apologies to the podcast listeners is going to be a visual for Twitch.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Um, it's a, it's a callback to earlier in the show. Oh yes. With the goat safe thing.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Yes. Thank you, Logan. We understood. All right.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:16.000
It's for the podcast listeners. All right. That's it everybody. We're off for tonight. Thank you so much.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Happy gaming, uh, over the next week. Have fun, stay safe and all that good stuff.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Hope you all had a good Easter and we will be back in seven more days to do it all again. Hope to see you then.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
