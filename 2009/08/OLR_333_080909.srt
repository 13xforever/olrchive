00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, August 9, 2009, Sony pulls advertising from one of their games

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Details are revealed on Final Fantasy 14

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Could you soon get a new game for the price of a used one?

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening, August 9, 2009

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we're a little broken tonight

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let me introduce the cast first and I'll tell you what's going on

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining me as always

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Say hello to the one and only Sims-loving DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yo

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I see you creating a character right now

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Actually, you know, I'm redoing an old one because I got some new hairs and clothes and stuff

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I'm going back to one of my older games that I've kind of neglected

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I see

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Isn't that nice hair?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's very pretty

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There you go

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hi

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How are you doing, Loki?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm doing well, I guess

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know, I guess I could explain everything that happened

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, I don't know

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, I should start because the first week we were gone was kind of my fault

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And, you know, it was something that was unanticipated

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And by the way, I apologize for my speech

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Speech is all screwed up tonight

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have the hiccups really bad

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like, we were just on Bobby's show doing our little tease over to this show and I was fine

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And right after we were done, we usually have a couple minutes

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because Bobby always likes to read the chatters at the end of his show and wrap everything up

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm taking a little swig of water and, I don't know, like, water went down the wrong pipe or something

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now I have the hiccups, like, terribly

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Which is the worst possible thing that can happen to you in radio

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I've got it right now and they're not going away

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
At least you can go through and kind of, like, you know, see the gaps that you hiccup in and go in and amount

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, excuse me

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So anyway, I'm going to try and hopefully get rid of the hiccups

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyway, we were gone the first week, my fault

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I was getting sick, like, I was really sick

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And most of it was exhaustion

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because I've been really pushing myself between training at work

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Some other things I do outside of work besides just the show

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And, you know, the show, I pretty much almost collapsed and died Sunday

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not really, but, you know, just collapsed

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And was feeling really, really horrible

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I called it off for Sunday and was like, let's all take a night off

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But then we announced that we were going to go on hiatus

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We're actually back kind of quicker than I think some people thought we'd be back

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I'll let Loki take over

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, so basically last Friday

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, last Friday

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, actually, let me start

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The week before that, the week before Friday

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So two Fridays ago

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Basically, you know, during labor you get

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Or I should say during pregnancy you get false labor pains

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They're called Braxton Hicks contractions

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Basically kind of going through the whole, you know, contraction cycle

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're not supposed to hurt

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They're basically, you know, you feel a tightening and then that's it

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And you get them all throughout the entire duration of being in labor

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, she was getting some that were painful

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And now they can be painful, but usually they're not

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So anyways, long story short, we went into the hospital that day

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
To have her checked out

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And they looked at her, they did an ultrasound

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They did, you know, an exam

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You know, and her cervix was closed

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And, you know, it was five centimeters long

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which is, you know, long for, you know, the birth canal

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But usually it's like three centimeters

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So everything was basically looked to be normal

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So we went home

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know, she was basically taking it easy

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Laying on the couch and stuff like that

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Monday she went into her normal doctor

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because she had an appointment

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And she actually had her looked over again

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And once again everything seemed fine

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
To have her, you know, have them check her out

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because now she was getting some sort of, like, fluid leaking out of her

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And she didn't know what that was

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Normally that's not normal

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So they took her into labor and delivery

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Looked at her, and they did, you know, an exam

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And they said, okay, well it doesn't look like anything's wrong

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So she finally insisted, listen, you know, give me an internal ultrasound

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I want you to make sure everything's correct

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So sure enough they give her an internal ultrasound

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And they realize that now within the time frame of Friday to Wednesday morning

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She's now completely, her cervix is completely effaced

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Meaning that it's shortened up

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which is what happens before you go into labor

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And she's actually three centimeters dilated now

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And the sack of one of the babies is actually hanging out into the birth canal

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Which means that any moment her water could break

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So Wednesday they call me down to the hospital

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So I have to go down there

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And basically she let me know what was going on

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And we, they tried basically to reverse the process

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They gave her drugs to stop contractions

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into her uterus

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And, you know, basically the contractions would, you know, were stopped

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And they were going to see if maybe the dilation would go away

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, 24 hours later they examined her again

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It wasn't getting any better

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The contractions were already stopped

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But she's continuing dilated

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So at that point there was no way that they could stop anything

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Basically, you know, they were giving us the option of

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, we can break your water now and induce labor

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Or you can go home, wait for your water to break, and then come back in

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And, you know, it's basically, okay, when do you want to kill your children

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is basically what they were giving us the option for

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, because, you know, as far as we could tell the, you know, babies were fine

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
They were moving still

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Which makes it the hardest

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because everything was okay

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But we had to deliver them now

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So they induced labor

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Actually, before that, you know, they were, you know, trying to figure out

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We were trying to make the decision

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So she got up to use the restroom and then her water broke on her own

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So it was pretty much, you know, the decision was made for us

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And, you know, they induced labor

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Which normally, you know, fewer full term

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Takes about five hours before, you know, you go into labor

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And deliver the baby

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, because she wasn't full term, it took 15 hours, you know, to do that

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So Friday morning at 5 AM

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They examined her again

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To see, you know, how it's going

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because actually during the night and everything, like around 1 in the morning

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She got an epidural because the, you know, contractions were getting stronger and more painful

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then, you know, they checked her again at about 5 in the morning

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And, you know, to see if she was dilated enough

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And they saw feet hanging out of her

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So they were like, well, looks like you're ready to go

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So they went ahead, delivered the first baby

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It came really quick

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And my boy Michael was delivered first

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He had died before he was delivered

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Basically, probably from all the trauma

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know, his water or his sack had been broken for, you know, 15 hours

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And, you know, because he's being contracted on

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And he was breached, you know, just all that combined together

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You know, he died before he got born

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then, luckily right after that

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because, you know, one of the scenarios they gave us was

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That, you know, the boy would be born

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then the girl, you know, might not, the sack might not come down and descend

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And you might have to go through the whole labor process again

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Which we were just at that point, like, let's just get this over with

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Luckily, though, right after he was born

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Her water basically broke

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And then Sarah was born right after that

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And, you know, she was born alive

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Everything was okay with her

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But because it's only 21 weeks, you know, she doesn't have any lungs yet

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So, luckily, you know, they're oxygenated really well in the womb

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In case, you know, the mother dies or something like that

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The babies can survive a little bit

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But because she has no lungs, she, you know, only lived for two hours

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, you know, basically, you know, we got to hold them

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And, you know, say our goodbyes and stuff like that

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And, you know, it was really, really, really tough

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You know, very sad

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
At least our family got to see them and everything before, you know, we sent them away

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But, yeah, so that was my week last week

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But, you know, it's just unfortunate

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They don't know what happened

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They don't know why, you know, this happens

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They think maybe incompetent cervix, which is a possibility

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Usually, though, this might not be the case

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Because incompetent cervix is a scenario where your cervix gets smaller during the duration of the pregnancy

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It slowly happens

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This happened, like, three days

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Which, you know, that doesn't happen

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, you know, free term labor

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They don't really know what happened

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And we probably won't know what happens

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, it could be an infection, you know

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who knows

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So they sent off the placentas to pathology

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So maybe we'll learn something from that

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But I doubt it

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, basically, the whole thing was just, you know, very sad

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Luckily, we got taken care of really good

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Except for one nurse was completely retarded

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I'll get into that later

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But, I don't know

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's just, it's sad

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And, you know, wish it hadn't happened

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But there's not really much you can do

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's why I'm here this week

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because, you know, everything's kind of getting back to normal

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And, I don't know, just got to go on

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So, yeah

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's basically everything that happened

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And we, you know, took care of all the female

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because they are actually considered, you know

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
20 weeks

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like, if they were born at 20 weeks

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Basically, the hospital would dispose of them

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They wouldn't, you know, really be named or anything like that

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But 21 weeks are considered, like, a live birth

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or, I don't really know what they consider them

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But, basically, they get death certificates

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And the girl actually gets a birth certificate

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because she was born alive

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But, you know, we had them cremated

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Sometime this week

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think they're, those we do

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But we went and took care of all that

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So we get their ashes back

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This coming week

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sometime

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And, you know, we got, basically

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They took pictures and everything

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because, I mean, you don't have anything

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
To take, you know, to remember them by, basically

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So, they take pictures

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
To do footprints, handprints

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Measurements

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All that stuff

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But, yeah, they were

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
10 inches long

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And under a pound each

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
14 ounces, I think, was the largest one

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But, yeah

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So I think the reasons why we weren't here last week

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are then pretty obvious

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I mean, Dark Soccer and I just didn't feel right

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Kind of doing it in that, you know, type of situation

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, you know, we called it off last week

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And we said, Loki, take whatever time you need

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We'll come back when we're all ready to come back

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And Loki, as he mentioned before

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He's ready to kind of just get back to normal, so to speak

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And so here we are

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And kind of given, you know, everything

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Which might come as a surprise

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
To folks who are ready to tune into a video game show

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But I admire that you can

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That you can talk about it very professionally, you know

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know, it's still kind of upsetting

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I mean, I'm a little upset right now

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But it's just like

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's not as bad as the first day

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh my god

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was just, it was tiring

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The whole process was tiring

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, just got no sleep for like two days

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And just

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The emotional rollercoaster

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, the first day we're like

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We're like, okay, well that sucks

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And then

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, there's nothing we can do

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And then one of the nurses comes in

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, well maybe they can save, you know, one of the babies

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And, you know, deliver one

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And, you know, the other one will be saved

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You know, just keep the other one in or whatever

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And you can't do that

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because, I mean, let's say

290
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For example, you know, the what ifs

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Even for like three weeks

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Which would make it a viable pregnancy

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Even though it's a viable pregnancy

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Does not mean that they're gonna come out normal

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They're gonna have, you know

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Developmental, you know, mental issues

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You never know

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's just, this was the easiest way

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And thankfully, you know

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The whole birthing process took like five minutes

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Once you gave birth to them, it was just done

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Super quick

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And everything came out because, you know

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If the placentas didn't detach or whatever

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They had to go and scrape that out

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's just not fun

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So, uh

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, I mean

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You know, Brad Pod Culture is saying that I posted something on Live Journal

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, I did

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Like the whole process, you know

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I kept thinking of how I wanted to

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know, kind of

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Get everything out

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And that was the way to do it

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I just kind of wrote a letter to them

320
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So, it helped

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Obviously, there's a lot of outpouring from our chat right now, you know, about the situation

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And, you know, everything

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I found that to be very true, you know

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
With your updates on Twitter and so forth, you know

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think Dark Soccer and I didn't really want to

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We didn't want to say anything about what was going on

327
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Because we didn't know what, you know

328
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What was cool to say and what was not cool to say

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So we just kind of said, shut up, it's private

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, but then you came out and said something about it

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And, you know

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Exactly, exactly

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And, you know, I thought the letter obviously was very, very touching

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And some folks were saying they got, you know, a little teary-eyed reading it

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But, you know, I

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I guess the next thing to ask

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And I apologize for continuing to kind of drag this out, you know

339
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I think, I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What next? What do you do next now?

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, now, the next

343
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, obviously we still don't have children

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Nellie's not

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I mean

346
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We can't, you're not supposed to try right afterwards

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because there's a higher risk of, you know, preterm labor

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So, basically now

350
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is unfortunate

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The way they kind of, the whole medical thing is

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's like they want you to fail once

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And then they'll take everything seriously

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's just, you know, they don't

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess

356
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Or whatever, I don't know

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Or she goes in with a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You know, just healing and everything

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Later on, we'll meet with somebody

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In the high-risk clinic

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
To see what we need to do

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
She thinks, I mean, she has her own theories of why it happened

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She thinks that her progesterone levels dropped

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because she has PCOS

367
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Which, basically, her body interprets insulin as testosterone

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or something like that

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And it throws off her hormone levels

370
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And that can also cause preterm labor

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
To keep, you know, an eye on that

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The other thing they can do is a cerclage

374
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They couldn't do that this time

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That was one of the options that they gave us

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But the problem was that the birth

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You know, the sack of the first baby was distended so much

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That there was more of a chance that they were going to pop it

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Than them actually successfully doing it

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So it just wasn't an option

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And, you know, pretty much we'll try again next year at some point

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Before we can try again

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know, just to be extremely cautious

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And even then

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hopefully this time what we're going to do

388
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Is we're going to do one round of Clomid first

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It overstimulates her ovaries

391
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's why we got twins

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But we're going to try

393
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
One round of Clomid first

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then not try an insemination at all

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then another round of Clomid

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So we get one baby and not two

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two

398
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And this question might sound kind of weird

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you

401
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I think a lot of people out there

403
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
When they were reading about this on Twitter

404
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And even hearing about it now

405
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth

406
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They were kind of wondering like, what can I do?

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is there something I can do to help?

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Is there anything I can do?

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Is there any charity?

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Is there something I can do to help?

411
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Not really

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know

414
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you want to do a charity

415
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess March of Dimes

416
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They research

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Pregnancy loss

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't know

419
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There's that I guess

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We talked about getting in a group together

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
For when they do the next March of Dimes walk

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't know

423
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I've actually done that quite a few times

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And it's a really great charity

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I think it would be very perfect

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'd definitely go in on that

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't know

428
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Do whatever you guys need to do

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
See that's the thing too when we got home

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone wants to help out

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I totally understand

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's there to do?

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't know

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's fine because at first

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We did not want to go out of the house

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My mom would come over

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
She'd bring us groceries that we needed

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'd have friends come over and they'd bring

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Food and stuff

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That was fine

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But now we've got a fridge full of food

442
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What do you want us to do?

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You want us to do something around the house?

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know

446
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's nothing really you can do unfortunately

447
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's nice to know that you guys

448
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Care

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right now

451
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't really think of anything

452
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's nothing really we can do

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well maybe if we decide

454
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
To go the charity route later on

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I know we've always been

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Toying with the idea of doing a marathon

457
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Of some sort on some weekend

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So that might be something we have to look into

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Might be a lot of fun

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
For a good cause

461
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's pretty much it

462
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Right now we've got a lot of stuff

463
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Taken care of

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
See

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I feel so guilty right now

467
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I really shouldn't be

468
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I should be glad that I'm kind of

469
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Over everything

470
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This whole week

471
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was perfectly fine

472
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I was

473
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sitting at home

474
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
At first I wanted to stay home

475
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because I wasn't ready to go back to work

476
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Probably like Tuesday

477
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mainly just staying home

478
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
To keep Nellie company

479
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Because she's got

480
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well she can't go to work

481
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
For four weeks

482
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Doctors orders not to go back to work

483
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For four weeks

484
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Rest up

485
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Make sure that you're okay

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And healed and all that stuff

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But

488
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I've been editing Grand Theft Auto

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
For the last few days

490
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I've been just

491
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Getting back to normal

492
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah it's pretty much getting back to normal

493
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I feel so guilty

494
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because she's still upset

495
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I just

496
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Can't

497
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The most I get upset is now

498
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Where I'm just talking about it

499
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But even then

500
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's not

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's probably just naturally going to take her a little longer

503
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah definitely

504
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So she's been having to

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Deal with the pain of that

506
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because

507
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're supposed to let it reabsorb back into

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Your body and

509
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Cramping after

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She gives birth and everything

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And cramping based on that

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And you have to give yourself massages in your stomach

514
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
To force it to cramp

515
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So that it will shrink back down

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
All the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people

517
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Don't know about

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know

519
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I mean

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's like

521
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I have pictures of them

522
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
They give you these little

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Layets, they're little

524
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Outfits that they basically dress them up in

525
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And take pictures and stuff

526
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
As morbid as that sounds

527
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But that's all you got

528
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I actually have pictures but

529
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's hard for people to look at

530
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Especially the boy

531
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Their skin is still transparent

532
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And he was really bruised

533
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Coming out and he's all red

534
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And stuff

535
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let me read this from Kitsune

536
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because I think this is really good advice

537
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And we'll try to move on from here

538
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Kitsune in chat says it would probably be worse

539
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you didn't get back to normal

540
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I mean if you stay in a good spirit it would help her

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah exactly

542
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I think that's what it is

543
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I know we spent a lot of time talking about that

544
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But it's important

545
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And I think Brad

546
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If you want to join me in our chatroom again

547
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Chat.orangelandraday.com

548
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
After listening to OLR for so long

549
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We feel like you guys are kind of like family

550
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody

551
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this

552
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You know because

553
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't want to go through this again

554
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Fair enough

555
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Alright well let's move on

556
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Let's get back to gaming

557
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let's talk about video games

558
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And the stuff that distracts us from the real world sometimes

559
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And gets us

560
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Makes us happy

561
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Video games

562
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
DarkSakura I'll go to you

563
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How was your gaming week we always start off the show?

564
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Well not very

565
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Busy just given that I can't

566
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Hold the controllers for very long

567
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Before my hand starts to hurt

568
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We got in

569
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're borrowing a couple pinball tables

570
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That we actually got

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
After we did the video

572
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Attack from Mars

573
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Which I really love

574
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Which I love but I really like Attack from Mars better

575
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Dude you got an Attack from Mars?

576
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That's awesome

577
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's the pinball I have the holograms and all that stuff in it

578
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Play after the show

579
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And so

580
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I've been playing a little bit of that off and on

581
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But like I said my hand starts hurting me real bad

582
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So I can't play for very long

583
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And

584
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Playing Sims 3

585
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Off and on

586
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Some of the

587
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Newness has fallen for me

588
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But um

589
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I go back every so often and now I'm actually

590
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Going to pick up one of my old families and play them

591
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Somewhere now that you know better hair has come out

592
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Um

593
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I've been playing Peggle

594
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I beat Peggle so now I'm playing through it again

595
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's

596
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Pretty fun

597
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Some Cooking Mama last night

598
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000

599
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Played Light Cycles on my iPhone

600
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Played La Solitaire on my iPhone

601
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You've been getting into iPhone gaming

602
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Quite a bit huh

603
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You know my roommate downloaded something

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
For the iPhone and you know he's not a huge huge

605
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Gamer but he got really into some role playing

606
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Game that was on that phone I apologize I didn't catch the

607
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Name I'll try to check it out for next week

608
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The puzzle RPG game

609
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh I have a

610
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Title and I have it on my iPhone

613
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I've also um

614
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Been playing some of the little games on

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Gaia online cause my account

616
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Is still there

617
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Including Booty Grab just cause I think it's funny

618
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's where you go into the

619
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Aquariums and if you

620
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Manage to get one that's active they'll throw gold everywhere

621
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And you grab Booty

622
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I just laugh because I'm grabbing Booty

623
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Nice

624
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Cause I'm five years old that way

625
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Um

626
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And uh we picked up a couple of games

627
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We actually picked up some Tengen

628
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Games that were in the

629
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Regular Nintendo cartridges

630
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We got Gauntlet

631
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And um I don't think we

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Picked up RBI Baseball cause hello

633
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's RBI Baseball

634
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And uh one other

635
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That I can't remember

636
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And uh here comes the husband

637
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What was the other game?

638
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We didn't?

639
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh I thought you bought the games

640
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Okay well we didn't get the games then we saw them

641
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You just saw them

642
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I thought he got them You had a daydream where you were gonna

643
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Buy them and leave No because I went back

644
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I bought movies I bought the

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Doctor Who movie

646
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That just came out I found it brand new for like ten bucks

647
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh nice And then I got this movie

648
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Which I love Saved

649
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh that's funny That movie is cracked out

650
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I got um Elf

651
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Cause you know I normally

652
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy

653
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The crap out of me until I saw that movie

654
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny

655
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Especially when you smell

656
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You smell like beef and cheese

657
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But um

658
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But also uh

659
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
For other games Dan got me

660
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000

661
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I will be

662
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is the game that we are in

663
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But you're actually

664
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You got the 360 version

665
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That's the arcade stuff

666
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We're in the PS3 version We're in the PS3 one

667
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes we're in the PS3 one The Namco Museum Essentials

668
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Which I thank you for reminding me

669
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners

670
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
About this um we actually

671
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Have a cameo in a video game

672
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
In the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials

673
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We're in the PS3 one

674
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's a PlayStation Network title

675
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah it's a download title

676
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a download title on PlayStation Network

677
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You have to get it online

678
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The one that we're in is the one online

679
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So anyway

680
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Now they're talking about that

681
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But yeah if you, here's the thing

682
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's just a little cameo

683
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But when you start the game, not the demo

684
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But the retail version of the game, you're not gonna see it in the demo

685
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
When you start the retail version of the game

686
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Then it comes up and it shows like

687
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hey now you can use High Scoreboard with your friends

688
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And it actually on the High Scoreboard

689
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It says Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3

690
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And then there's some initials thing on the side too

691
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Where OLR is some of the top initials

692
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
On the High Scoreboard

693
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So it's really cool and awesome

694
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But it still has a lot of good games on it

695
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh yeah I mean that's still a good collection

696
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they released

697
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online

698
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Galaxian Pole Position

699
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So yeah

700
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
As soon as my hand

701
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Cause my hand is actually still pretty crappy

702
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I actually heard it yesterday

703
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Holding my friend's son

704
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And she is listening right now

705
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And sorry your son killed me

706
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But no

707
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I actually ended up hyper extending my middle finger way too far

708
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And that's

709
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh come on

710
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I know it just sounds funny sorry

711
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The technical term is hyper extension

712
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I was using my middle finger too much

713
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Hey hey

714
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I was showing you see look at my finger

715
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No and the suture is still in my palm

716
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So I'm actually going to call my doctor

717
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And tell him to get it the hell out of my hand

718
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Because it's really

719
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I pretty much think it's what's slowing up my healing

720
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Cause I

721
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's taking longer than it's supposed to

722
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It really is taking longer than it's supposed to

723
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Other than that

724
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I really haven't played a whole lot of other things

725
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh I did watch Dan play the Arkham Asylum demo

726
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And that looks hot

727
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That is just oh my god

728
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J

729
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast

730
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different

731
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But other than that hey I mean

732
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It actually

733
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up

734
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try

735
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm going to

736
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo

737
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh

738
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh oh oh

739
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I came this close

740
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Really tiny close to playing BeatMania

741
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And I was like nah let's just go home

742
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Probably not good for your hand though

743
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Nah really not good for my hand

744
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm a right side scratcher but nah

745
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know what's funny I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania

746
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday

747
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What? Where?

748
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Tahoe

749
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I was in South Lake Tahoe

750
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It was either Harvey's or Harrah's I can't remember one of those two had it

751
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And yeah I almost played it but then I was like

752
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Dude it's 5 key this is old

753
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh and I released a ringtone pack

754
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
For iPhone owners

755
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Did I send it to you?

756
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think I saw it

757
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I did a limited giveaway just a random giveaway

758
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
To give away 10 video game ringtones

759
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That I made for iPhone

760
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I'm going to do it again

761
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
This time instead of doing it on

762
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Twitter

763
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm going to do it on Facebook

764
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So the first 5 people to send me a message to my inbox

765
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
On

766
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Facebook

767
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So the first 5 people to send me

768
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
A message to my inbox

769
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
On

770
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Facebook with

771
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Your email address

772
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Actually I'll be better than that I'll say 10

773
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Will be able to

774
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Download the pack

775
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's just 10 different ringtones

776
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Nice

777
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I can tell everybody

778
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What's in them later

779
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Alright

780
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well let's move on with our gaming weeks

781
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto

782
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah I was playing

783
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I got so much playing Grand Theft Auto

784
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
As I was editing Grand Theft Auto

785
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Still

786
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's almost done actually I think it's probably done now

787
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I think I've edited pretty much everything

788
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I could possibly edit in it now

789
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I am going to record some stuff for it

790
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I finally got my video capture thing

791
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
For doing HD video

792
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And

793
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Assuming everything works on it

794
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We should be able to record some stuff

795
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I've been having issues with the

796
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Program that came with it

797
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
To get it to work

798
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
For some reason it's just crashing randomly

799
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Hopefully we'll be able to record everything

800
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And it will be awesome

801
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So you can finally see

802
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto

803
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's insane now

804
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Now the jets fly around at street level

805
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And it's just kind of crazy

806
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by

807
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Just like what the hell is going on

808
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Other than that

809
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I didn't really play a whole lot this week

810
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I brought my DS with me to the hospital

811
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It was something to do

812
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So I played a little bit of Lego Battles

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Which that game is kind of boring

814
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I mean it's an okay RTS game

815
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But the AIs are retarded

816
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And like I would tell

817
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You have these

818
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You can harvest wood and stuff like that

819
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Or it gives you bricks or whatever

820
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So I'm telling them to go chop down these trees

821
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And they just stand there

822
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They're like, huh?

823
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You want me to do what?

824
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Or like I say, chop down these trees and they run the opposite direction

825
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Absolutely retarded

826
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So that got really frustrating and boring

827
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme

828
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Which was fun

829
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And also some Planet Puzzle League

830
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Which was pretty fun

831
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Those games are good standby puzzle games

832
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And

833
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Let me think

834
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think that's pretty much it

835
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Really not a good week for games

836
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Even though I was home all week

837
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I was just preoccupied

838
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
With just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff

839
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And then before that

840
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Putting away boxes

841
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And cleaning up the house

842
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But I have my giant HDTV

843
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Now in my room

844
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
To do video capture on

845
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So it'll be awesome

846
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Alright

847
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
As far as my gaming week

848
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Even the fact that we've been gone a little while

849
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I didn't play a lot of new stuff

850
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I made my way to disc 3 now

851
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Which is way past where I was before

852
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So that's pretty cool and I'm still enjoying that

853
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I play Blackjack for real

854
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
When I went up to Tahoe yesterday

855
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I took a day trip to South Lake Tahoe

856
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's so funny up there because

857
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They have these huge casinos

858
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Literally adjacent to the state line

859
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Like you're walking down the street

860
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There's some California little built up things

861
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You literally walk across the street

862
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And you're walking across the state line

863
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And there's these huge casinos right on the other side

864
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's not like Reno where you still have to drive in

865
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Like 5 miles at least to get there

866
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But yeah I had a good time

867
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And I played Blackjack for real for the first time

868
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And it's kind of freaky because

869
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It was $10 minimum bet and all that stuff

870
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And I put in $60 and I left with $52

871
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So I lost a little bit

872
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But considering I was entertained for about an hour

873
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And came out basically even

874
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm not too upset

875
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So that was kind of a thrill

876
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It sounds like you did pretty good for yourself otherwise

877
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I mean you didn't come out broke

878
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I was down to about $20 at one point

879
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I was like ah fuck my life

880
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm going to be losing all my money

881
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But I did okay

882
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It was very nerve wracking

883
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It was a lot of pressure but it was fun

884
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But please gamble responsibly if you're over $21

885
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's see what else did I do

886
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I did play one new game

887
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I can't really review it because it's a beta

888
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And it's actually one that I know somebody emailed

889
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Us on before

890
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game

891
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
To check it out

892
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And it's from NCSoft

893
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And it's a new MMO that's coming out

894
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's actually

895
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If I understand right

896
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's been out in Korea for some time

897
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's just finally getting its localization over here

898
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So it's finally in beta and so forth

899
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And I didn't really play the game enough

900
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
To get a real sense

901
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
To review it fairly

902
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I will say it's pretty

903
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It definitely had some things in common with WoW

904
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well

905
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't know if this is the way it looked or what have you

906
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But as far as like

907
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm just talking about the way the game looks on a purely

908
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Superficial level

909
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm not talking about how the insides of the game work

910
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into

911
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Such as

912
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
When you get to level 10

913
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You can actually evolve your class

914
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I guess your characters get wings and whatever

915
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And you can evolve your class

916
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's an interesting little game

917
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But it was hard to tell a lot about it

918
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Because in the beta

919
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You just get thrown right into the game

920
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There's no tutorial

921
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There's nothing

922
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You just got to figure it out

923
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The first few quests kind of help you a little bit

924
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But it doesn't hold your hand as much as Warcraft did

925
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Or even Warhammer

926
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Which is another one I played recently

927
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's more that Final Fantasy 11

928
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Like WTF do I do now

929
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Type of thing

930
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But I don't want to make you think

931
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's Final Fantasy 11

932
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Because it definitely felt a lot more like

933
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
WoW or Warhammer did

934
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm going to check it out

935
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't want to review a game based on a beta

936
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But I will say the game kept me interested enough

937
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
To want to play it again next weekend

938
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And that's what I plan to do

939
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It sounds like fun

940
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah I'll have to talk to my source

941
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
See if I can get you another code

942
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It'll be kind of fun

943
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I like a good MMO but you know which one I'm waiting for

944
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Final Fantasy 14?

945
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Heck no!

946
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
What was that line from

947
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Chasing Amy

948
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Bitch you almost made me laugh

949
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Let's move on

950
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Into some housekeeping real quick

951
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And of course we are back

952
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Here after a little bit of a hiatus

953
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And for the foreseeable future

954
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Tonight is episode 333

955
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

956
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Believe it or not

957
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
We were on Bobby's show before we were live tonight

958
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf

959
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Who hosts the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio

960
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
At 5 o'clock Pacific 8 o'clock Eastern

961
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Before we were on

962
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He was making fun of us tonight

963
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth

964
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Or half the Mark of the Beast

965
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I was saying it's a holy show

966
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Holy moly

967
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And of course we have a new YouTube up

968
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So check that out on the channel

969
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
www.youtube.com

970
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And we are Channel Orange Lounge Radio

971
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Or you just search for OLR

972
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And you get all our videos, they come right up

973
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Let's get into some gaming news

974
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We're not going to cover anything that happened

975
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
In the past few weeks

976
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I heard a lot of interesting stuff happen

977
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I have to be honest, while we were away from the show

978
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I kind of didn't pay attention to the gaming blogs

979
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I did read a few interesting stories

980
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Such as that promotion that went really

981
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Really wrong by EA

982
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
At Comic Con

983
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The whole take a picture with our booth babes

984
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Thing

985
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It was dumb

986
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't know if you heard about this

987
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I actually didn't

988
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It was some lame brain in the marketing department

989
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Their scheme went way wrong

990
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
At least it wasn't a goat head

991
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe

992
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And you

993
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Send it on your Twitter

994
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Or something like that

995
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And you'll get entered in a drawing to win a

996
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Date on the town with two women

997
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And basically

998
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
The star treatment where you get

999
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
A paparazzi

1000
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Or basically a chaperone

1001
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
A limo and that kind of stuff

1002
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But the way that it was phrased

1003
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It made it sound like you get two prostitutes

1004
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That you get to go have sex with

1005
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Right because the whole thing was around

1006
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The seven deadly sins and what was this

1007
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Lust was probably the thing

1008
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So the whole thing was built around lust

1009
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And it made it kind of sound like

1010
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It was encouraged like go harass booth babes

1011
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And take pictures of them

1012
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes

1013
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
From what I understood from their thing

1014
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Or was it supposed to be I don't know

1015
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
This is why you need parameters set

1016
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Here's the thing

1017
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm sorry to get far into this

1018
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Here's the thing

1019
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Is that I actually

1020
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world

1021
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
They thought outside the box

1022
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They came up with a new competition

1023
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Was it a very limiting competition?

1024
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Did they kind of close this off

1025
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
To a lot of people by only thinking

1026
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Of the horny straight male? Yes they did

1027
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Did somebody in marketing fuck this up

1028
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Big time by taking it from idea

1029
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
To fruition? Oh yeah

1030
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh yeah like where was the quality check on this?

1031
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Come on. And seriously you got to think about this

1032
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You don't do that

1033
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
At Comic Con you do that at Vegas

1034
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Where you can actually

1035
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Fulfill your contractual

1036
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Obligation to get those guys

1037
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Laid. And I just don't

1038
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like the only thing I really

1039
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Didn't like about it is it just reinforces

1040
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The stereotype that

1041
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Gamers are a bunch of desperate horny male

1042
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You know folks who can't get laid

1043
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You know what I mean?

1044
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And not that I think you see but at the same time

1045
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write

1046
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
All these rules

1047
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Well you get on a date with two women

1048
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But if you're a woman you can get guys

1049
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Or if you're a gay guy you can get pretty guys

1050
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Or if you're a lesbian

1051
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme

1052
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Well I mean

1053
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Just let me cash out the damn prize

1054
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
How about that?

1055
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You also won

1056
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh yeah you won booty as well

1057
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But that's funny

1058
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I don't know

1059
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Like I said I think they should've done it in Vegas

1060
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
People just need to get over this shit

1061
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's a contest you don't like it

1062
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Don't enter it

1063
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Don't get offended by it it's a contest

1064
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
My god

1065
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Do we need to take it seriously?

1066
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm not offended but I'm just like

1067
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Stupid. This is stupid

1068
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
This is so so stupid

1069
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And that's probably not what people want

1070
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You know us to be saying about their upcoming game

1071
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Dante's Inferno. Stupid.

1072
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't know about the game itself

1073
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Anyhow let's get into some gaming news

1074
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
From the now. Loki please start us off

1075
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yes so

1076
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Sony decided it was an awesome idea

1077
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
To go ahead and add

1078
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Some

1079
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Ads to their

1080
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Game Wipeout HD

1081
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And these would be you know little commercials

1082
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That would play before your races

1083
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And what not

1084
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What's interesting though is

1085
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The ads that they have

1086
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Actually increase the load time

1087
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
From

1088
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Basically like

1089
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
8 seconds to 19 seconds

1090
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Now

1091
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That doesn't seem like a whole lot but

1092
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That's still annoying that you have

1093
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
To wait 19 seconds to get into

1094
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
A race because they want you to watch an ad

1095
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
For a game that you paid for

1096
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Already

1097
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Thankfully enough people bitched

1098
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And so they went ahead

1099
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And got rid of those ads

1100
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Or at least that one ad that was that long

1101
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But still though

1102
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I mean come on

1103
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Adding ads after the fact because

1104
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
They want some more money

1105
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm sorry I can understand if you want to do that for like

1106
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A free version of the game that may be ad supported

1107
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But if I bought this game

1108
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't want to have to

1109
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Pay extra

1110
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't want to have to wait extra

1111
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Seconds or whatever to play my levels

1112
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Just because you want to make a few extra bucks

1113
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Running a State Farm ad

1114
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Or something like that

1115
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The ad had nothing to do

1116
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You know what's funny

1117
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I actually own Wipeout HD but I haven't played it in so long

1118
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I totally missed this

1119
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
State Farm? Really?

1120
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Like what gamer is going to be sitting there

1121
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Playing Wipeout HD going

1122
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Damn I was just thinking I need life insurance

1123
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I mean really?

1124
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well the races are pretty dangerous and if you die

1125
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
As much as I do in that game

1126
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's fake!

1127
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Exactly but still I have to wait real time

1128
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know

1129
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think it's fucked up though that they can go ahead

1130
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And inject ads into a game

1131
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That you've already bought that didn't have ads

1132
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know the billboards

1133
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
In certain games you know like

1134
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Burnout and stuff that's fine

1135
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Whatever you know I'm not going to get bent out of shape

1136
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
By that because it doesn't really affect my game

1137
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I drive past it so fast I don't give a crap

1138
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know um

1139
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Same with like Crackdown they have the same thing

1140
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You know how like some games will have like

1141
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Especially like the sports games will have the

1142
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You know such and such sponsored

1143
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Like you know Wheaties sponsored

1144
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Car garage or something you know or

1145
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You know something like that where like a logo is inserted

1146
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Suddenly in the game

1147
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I see that kind of crap on TV although you know

1148
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I don't like the fact that I pay for it

1149
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this

1150
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because this is very in your face

1151
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Captive audience that's the problem

1152
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It makes you a captive audience to these commercials

1153
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's like those ads in the bathroom stall

1154
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's just

1155
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's just that they do

1156
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Do it after the fact you know

1157
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It kind of devalues your game

1158
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You know people might not purchase this game

1159
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because it has a 20 second load time

1160
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Or you know you have to watch it

1161
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Ad for State Farm

1162
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
DarkSakura I don't

1163
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You know unlike you I don't get mad at the

1164
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Ads in the bathroom because

1165
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You know again unlike you

1166
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
If I don't like the ad I can always piss on it

1167
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Well no it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom

1168
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That I don't like it's this thing that they do at my work

1169
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
With these little security posters

1170
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That they put in the bathroom stall

1171
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Which I'm glad I haven't had a look

1172
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The hell is that big brother is watching you poo?

1173
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What is that?

1174
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's like give out confidential information at work blah blah blah

1175
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Don't talk about this blah blah

1176
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Security risk blah blah blah

1177
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And they look like stupid motivational posters

1178
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But not really

1179
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I hate that more

1180
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick

1181
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yay tangents

1182
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The dates back to high school you love my tangents

1183
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Admit it

1184
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There was once this kid

1185
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That ran for student government

1186
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
When I was in high school and I think he was running for

1187
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Like I don't know like they used to

1188
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Like a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they

1189
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Called it he would basically be the host of all the pep rallies

1190
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Biggest loser

1191
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Okay biggest loser was what he was running for

1192
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And his campaign

1193
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You know he put up a bunch of posters and stuff

1194
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But in the men's bathroom he actually put up posters

1195
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
In the urinals

1196
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And what have you and it actually said

1197
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You hold the future in your hands

1198
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And vote next Friday

1199
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I actually thought that was kind of creative

1200
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's brilliant actually

1201
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh my god

1202
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And now he works for EA creating failed

1203
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You know advertisement

1204
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh I don't keep in touch with the assholes

1205
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
From high school except the ones I liked

1206
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who knows what that asshole's doing

1207
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But you know I just thought that was funny

1208
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That actually is pretty funny

1209
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Here's what I think they should do with these ads

1210
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And I think it's fine

1211
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If you want to place the ads in here

1212
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But I think that they should have to spend

1213
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The time to make the ads

1214
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Seem like it fits in this universe

1215
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
For example like

1216
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
You know the movie Running Man or you know

1217
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Fast and Furious

1218
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
On DVD and Blu-ray or something

1219
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Not even necessarily that like

1220
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay wipe out HD

1221
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Let's make it, it can be a state farm ad

1222
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But have them like ensuring like these space

1223
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Vehicles or something like that

1224
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It fits in like the universe

1225
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It fits in everything but it's actually

1226
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Still an ad for state farm

1227
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's just like you know

1228
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
What was it? Demolition Man

1229
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The other Sylvester Stallone movie

1230
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That sucked was Sandra Bullock

1231
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No the one with Sandra Bullock was Demolition Man

1232
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh it was Demolition Man

1233
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's like Demolition Man with like Taco Bell

1234
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You know where it's like a restaurant

1235
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But it still fits in their universe

1236
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You know you could do something like that

1237
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But just make it fit in the game

1238
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's something ridiculous like you know

1239
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
The 2009 Honda Civic

1240
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Or something like that in a futuristic

1241
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Racing game that takes place in the year 3000

1242
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
No one fucking cares about your thousand year old car

1243
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But what about the point that you're sitting there

1244
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Making me wait, you're increasing my

1245
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Low times in this game

1246
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
To be a captive audience to watch this

1247
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Ad on a game I paid for

1248
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I mean granted what, Wipeout HD

1249
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Is only about 10, 15 bucks

1250
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I can't even remember how much I paid for it

1251
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's not an expensive game but the fact is I did still pay

1252
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
For it and also I just don't like

1253
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
The fact that they snuck all this shit in after the fact

1254
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
After the reviewers got to

1255
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Copy it and after I mean this

1256
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Is where the fact that you can patch games

1257
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
After the fact is kind of dangerous

1258
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Like what the hell is this

1259
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Really I mean

1260
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
What's to say they're not going to go back and patch

1261
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Other games to suddenly throw in advertising

1262
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You know surprise

1263
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's just low

1264
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because then

1265
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You know when the game is reviewed and all the

1266
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Previews go out

1267
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This has to be breaking a law of some sort

1268
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I don't know how, it has to be

1269
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Like it's just shady, you're raping my eyes

1270
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You are raping my eyes

1271
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And I am unwilling

1272
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's just weird

1273
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Unconsensual eye porn

1274
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes this is unconsensual eye fucking

1275
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
That's what this is, thank you Sony

1276
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Here's the thing though

1277
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Poor State Farm because you know

1278
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
They probably just buy out of some company

1279
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's not even State Farm

1280
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's not even State Farm

1281
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Don't blame State Farm for this

1282
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Just remember State Farm is there

1283
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
State Farm is everywhere

1284
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Apparently even in Wipeout HD

1285
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So there you go

1286
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Hey at least it's not another

1287
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Fucking Axe commercial or something

1288
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Like that

1289
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah, comments from chat

1290
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

1291
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
GameGuru says if ads are in my game

1292
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It needs to be either flavor or cheaper

1293
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Tigerclaw says

1294
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I think the ads came after the Fury

1295
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Add-on pack for Wipeout HD

1296
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And continues to say maybe if you buy the regular

1297
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Wipeout HD without the add-ons it doesn't have the

1298
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Ads. I never noticed them

1299
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed

1300
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
The ads but I didn't play it in the last three weeks

1301
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And just to be

1302
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Clear the ads are gone now right?

1303
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They were patched out right?

1304
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Well they're not patched out but they're working with the company

1305
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Now I think that ad is gone

1306
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But they're working with them now so that

1307
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Basically the ads are shorter and they don't

1308
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Interfere with the load time or something like that

1309
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Is what they're saying. They're not seeing that the

1310
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Ads are going away they're just saying oh we're working with

1311
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
This company because we fucked up

1312
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Or they fucked up by making the ad

1313
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Too long or something

1314
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So basically they're saying hey

1315
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's not that we're getting rid of the advertising

1316
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We're just trying to find a way to keep it into

1317
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The eight second window basically

1318
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's just I don't know it's shady

1319
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah

1320
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I mean I expect those types of ads

1321
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
On like let's say like a pogo.com

1322
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Type of website which are like if you've

1323
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Never visited this website it's just a ton of casual

1324
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Games it's all middle aged

1325
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Crisis women games and I love

1326
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Them like you've got like Boggle

1327
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And Scrabble and like all this stuff on there

1328
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I have no problem with them doing like a free version

1329
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Of this game or something. Yeah but they're all free and you

1330
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Expect that you're gonna have to sit there and look at an ad

1331
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
For you know Metamucil in between

1332
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You know games or what have you but

1333
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Or Special K

1334
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's the big one. I love Special K

1335
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's delicious

1336
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Special K is like

1337
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Food of the lifetime network

1338
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm very pissed off that they

1339
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Really focus the demographic

1340
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
To chicks okay

1341
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Fuck games for a minute this is more important

1342
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Than any other revelation that's come out

1343
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
About ads and games. Fuck that whole thing for a minute

1344
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Loki

1345
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Loves

1346
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Chick cereal. True story. No I love

1347
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Special K. The fact that they're like saying

1348
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's like oh chick cereal

1349
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's unfair. That is really unfair

1350
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That's just like Captain Crunch and they're saying

1351
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
That it's like pirate cereal or kid's cereal

1352
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm sorry I still like it

1353
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's good. It's alright

1354
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean if you're gonna eat like healthy cereal

1355
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
At least it's not like Total or something like that

1356
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You know which is like old people's cereal

1357
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I like Total. I used to eat that

1358
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
When I was five. Or like

1359
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't even know if you remember this

1360
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Product 19. Yes

1361
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I remember that. Yeah that's almost like

1362
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Special K. Because if you even say mini wheats

1363
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Or old people food I'm gonna come over there and beat you

1364
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Mini wheats are freaking amazing

1365
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I like Crispix too

1366
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Crispix is pretty damn good

1367
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm the person with all brands

1368
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Sitting up there in my cabinet

1369
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No but it's alright

1370
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Instead of eating you know like

1371
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles

1372
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Or Captain Crunch I'm eating

1373
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Special K because you know what at least

1374
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
That's not too bad for me and

1375
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It tastes alright. I don't have to put sugar on it

1376
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It's not like corn flakes which

1377
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That could be hit or miss

1378
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I am amazed

1379
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
At the vast of knowledge some of our listeners

1380
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Have of the show. AlphaKananagram

1381
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
In chat says to quote from guys on a show

1382
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge

1383
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Radio when it was a station

1384
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Like it was like on Thursday nights or something

1385
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I did that with my old roommate Xfer. It's been off the air

1386
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
For like four years. But says this quote

1387
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Sky thinks Special K's

1388
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice

1389
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Did I say that?

1390
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You made that up. I did not say that

1391
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Did I really?

1392
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
From experience I can tell you

1393
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That I don't think pussy juice is in

1394
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Special K

1395
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well how would that attract women too?

1396
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well lesbians maybe

1397
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But you know

1398
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's not bad. It's just the thing is

1399
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The only thing I don't like about Special K

1400
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Because first off they don't have

1401
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Mazes and little stupid dumb

1402
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles

1403
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And you know

1404
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Captain Crunch does. But they have like you know

1405
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
All this breast health

1406
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Awareness crap and like

1407
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You can lose you know

1408
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Inches off your waistline

1409
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Or something like that if you do the Special K

1410
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Diet and crap

1411
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm like I'm sorry. I eat your cereal and I lose

1412
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No weight whatsoever

1413
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
But then again they want you like

1414
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
McNuggets don't help

1415
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But they also want you to have it with skim milk

1416
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Because that's like disgusting

1417
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Might as well eat cardboard or something

1418
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know

1419
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to get off topic

1420
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But I just we had to have the Special K

1421
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Chat on this show because I think we've never had

1422
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It on the main show and it's been like seven years

1423
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long

1424
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's good

1425
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I mean it's

1426
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I don't know I go back to Captain

1427
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Crunch every now and then but Captain Crunch is sharp

1428
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I mean it's seriously like for the record

1429
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I hate Special K

1430
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
For the record I hate Captain Crunch

1431
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I love Special K

1432
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I like fiber cereals. Okay I grew up on Grape Nuts

1433
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran

1434
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I hate marshmallows

1435
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And you have a smooth bowel movement every day

1436
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Shut up

1437
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The only kids cereal that I ever

1438
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Liked was Frosted Mini Wheats

1439
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And I still to this day it's my favorite cereal

1440
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
In the universe and Rice Krispies

1441
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me

1442
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Oh I'll eat that stuff dry

1443
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Out of the box

1444
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I hate Cheerios

1445
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You know what else is good too that I can't stop eating

1446
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Once I get some?

1447
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Golden Grahams

1448
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You can still get Golden Grahams I just had some the other day

1449
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I know they're awesome

1450
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Here's the thing though it's funny you say

1451
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I can actually eat it dry

1452
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I only eat cereal dry like I hate milk that much

1453
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't eat cereal with milk

1454
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
See Special K that would taste awful dry

1455
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I can't stand Special K

1456
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me

1457
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It is that disgusting

1458
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's gross

1459
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Alright anyhow

1460
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh yeah so the ads and games

1461
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That idea

1462
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Unless you run an ad for Special K then Loki won't mind anymore

1463
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Alright

1464
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Let's see let's move on with some more news

1465
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And talking about Netflix a little bit

1466
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And Netflix of course streaming has been

1467
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Huge on the Xbox 360

1468
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It's rumored once again

1469
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And it seems like this rumor comes up

1470
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Every few months or so ever since Netflix

1471
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
At the Xbox 360

1472
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But apparently an industry executive

1473
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Familiar with Netflix plans

1474
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Has talked to the website Multichannel

1475
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
That the company's streaming service

1476
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Is soon coming

1477
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
To the iPhone or iPod touch

1478
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
As well as the Wii

1479
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
By the way that doesn't mean you're gonna get to watch

1480
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Netflix on 3G that would be way too much

1481
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth

1482
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And you know

1483
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Boy oh boy

1484
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
AT&T the

1485
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T

1486
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Because they are just like

1487
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They're putting the clamp down on everything

1488
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That was other big news that came up even though it's not game related

1489
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The whole thing like Google Apps

1490
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Maybe the T stands for twat

1491
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Getting shut down by

1492
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Assholes, twats, and turds

1493
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
There you go

1494
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So asshole, twat, and turd

1495
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Isn't gonna let you use their 3G network

1496
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Because it's way too much

1497
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Of their precious bandwidth

1498
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So you'd only be able to use Netflix over the

1499
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Streaming

1500
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Over Wi-Fi

1501
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Which makes sense

1502
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I mean it would be horrible quality over 3G anyway

1503
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It takes forever as it is

1504
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've

1505
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Been hinting at that for a long long long long time

1506
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But

1507
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Nothing about

1508
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Sony Playstation 3

1509
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting

1510
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Because Apple

1511
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
If I'm not mistaking kind of has

1512
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Their own thing I mean you can't see

1513
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
They don't have a Netflix type service per se

1514
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But they do have the movie rental

1515
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That you can do on

1516
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The Apple and you can play that

1517
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
On your phone

1518
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So I would see something like this getting shot down

1519
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Just the same way the Google

1520
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What was the Google Latitude app got shot down

1521
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Google Voice that was the big one

1522
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That got shot down by Apple as well

1523
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
By Assholes, turds, and twats

1524
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
There's other phones out there

1525
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That do

1526
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yes but realize whether you like it or not

1527
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The iPhone is the one everybody

1528
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Seems to have right now

1529
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It is the most popular phone

1530
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
What's second behind it is the Blackberry

1531
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Probably

1532
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Which is also an AT&T

1533
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Name too

1534
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Or AT&T brand too

1535
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm trying to read some comments

1536
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
In the chat room let's see Decipher says

1537
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Atrocious telephones and technology

1538
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Frisbee says all twats talking

1539
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So there you go

1540
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And Misty says

1541
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's a fucking cheap phone

1542
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Hey I love my iPhone

1543
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Bad bad bad

1544
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Well I mean I'm just saying

1545
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
That it actually is

1546
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Really good

1547
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I mean seriously

1548
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's a really good technology

1549
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So whatever

1550
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yes and Tigerclass says

1551
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Let's not forget there is an all games app on the iPhone

1552
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And it lets you let OLR on it

1553
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah I downloaded it too

1554
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Did that come out in the past couple weeks? I guess it did

1555
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
If you haven't checked out the all games app search for that

1556
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Cause it lets you, it's free

1557
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And you can tune into all games radio anywhere

1558
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Plug in your ears, plug in the headphones and go

1559
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I always plug in my ears

1560
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Plug it in a car transmitter and go

1561
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Like Mr. Potato Head

1562
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Alright

1563
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So there you go Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone

1564
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I think it's inevitable

1565
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's probably gonna come to

1566
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
If AT&T will let it

1567
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It'll come to the iPhone

1568
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And Apple also

1569
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But I don't know about the Wii

1570
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't know

1571
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kinda like

1572
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix

1573
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
They could do it

1574
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I think you could do it

1575
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I mean especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan

1576
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Why not

1577
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You could get the Netflix channel

1578
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I mean honestly though do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix

1579
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I mean granted there is some stuff I watch

1580
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's mostly TV shows

1581
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We actually cancelled ours

1582
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I have Netflix and I find that the most stuff I watch

1583
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Is TV shows

1584
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Like NBC has a lot of stuff on there

1585
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But we were doing that

1586
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
But TV shows is the thing I'll stream the most

1587
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And oddly enough

1588
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And I'm surprised you cancelled because of this dark saga

1589
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
BBC everything is on there

1590
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
That I know but there's still behind on

1591
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
There's still behind on a few things

1592
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's old BBC stuff

1593
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You want BBC stuff from the 70s and 80s it's all there

1594
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't know if Monty Python was there but like tons and tons of stuff

1595
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They don't have any old tomorrow people though

1596
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I mean not the old stuff but like the series I was wanting to watch

1597
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But a lot of it is real shit

1598
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm gonna tell you there's a lot of real shit

1599
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I mean some cool indie films but a lot of crap

1600
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Diversity is your friend

1601
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You can stream Hulu

1602
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You have G4 on there

1603
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
YouTube stuff

1604
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Or in my case pirated videos

1605
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Alright well let's move on

1606
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Obviously Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year but nothing now

1607
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Dark Sakura

1608
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Well something that's actually really good for

1609
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
For people who have an Xbox in the United States

1610
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support

1611
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
The option is

1612
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You can buy your Xbox points using PayPal

1613
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com

1614
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Find

1615
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts

1616
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And then

1617
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But it really only works

1618
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Through the website not through the console

1619
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And it's right now only in America

1620
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
In other words any way you want to give us your money we'll take it

1621
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Hey it's convenient

1622
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Especially if you sit with your laptop by you when you play Guitar Hero and want the song

1623
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't know

1624
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Not Guitar Hero

1625
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Never Guitar Hero

1626
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Maybe it's just me but I don't understand how this is like super beneficial and provides more accessibility

1627
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But maybe that's because I have my Xbox tied to my debit card

1628
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So when I go on there and buy the

1629
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Virtual Bucks

1630
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't mind

1631
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I mean we're talking about Microsoft

1632
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
They're not going to give out my information

1633
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
My bank protects me from any violation of information

1634
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So I'm fine

1635
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But I'm not real worried about that

1636
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth

1637
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade

1638
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I was buying everything and it was very tempting

1639
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But I've gotten a lot better at that

1640
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
But I don't see how PayPal

1641
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Helps that

1642
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You're going to run everything through PayPal

1643
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I mean isn't giving your credit card to PayPal just as bad as giving it to Microsoft?

1644
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I guess that's what I don't get

1645
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's really just as though I think for having another option

1646
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's like when you buy stuff on eBay

1647
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You might be able to use your credit card

1648
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal

1649
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way

1650
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But I mean it's really just giving people another option

1651
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I don't see any harm in it

1652
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account

1653
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And you can use it to track your purchases that way too

1654
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So why not?

1655
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online

1656
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff

1657
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
They have ripped me off in the past

1658
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Like there was an error one time

1659
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Where I paid for something that was $50

1660
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And they charged me for $500

1661
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And got a bunch of overdraft fees and stuff like that

1662
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Because they're super awesome

1663
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And thankfully though the guy that received the $500

1664
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Refunded me my money

1665
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
But they take a portion off of each thing

1666
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
But if the whole reason why you want to use PayPal is because you're under 18

1667
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And you don't have a credit card

1668
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Dude go to the store and go buy a card

1669
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I mean seriously if you want the points that badly

1670
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Just go to the store, pay the tax on it

1671
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And just go buy a card

1672
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And just redeem it online

1673
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards right?

1674
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You can get a prepaid Visa card

1675
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap

1676
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Because if you don't have a credit card

1677
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You're going to have to tie your bank account to PayPal

1678
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways

1679
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I mean it's been a while since I did that

1680
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But it's just easier if you're under 18

1681
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Just go buy a card at the store

1682
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Hell you can go to your favorite game store or whatever

1683
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Trade in some games or trade in crap

1684
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And then get store credit and trade it in for a card

1685
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I've done that too because then that way it's a little easier

1686
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
A little cheaper

1687
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But I don't know

1688
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It seems like good that they're supporting it

1689
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
They give someone another option but I don't think it's a good option

1690
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Good for them

1691
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I guess the more ways the better

1692
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal

1693
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever

1694
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But I don't know

1695
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Not something I really plan on using

1696
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But see even with that though

1697
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Yeah you can build up money from PayPal

1698
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account

1699
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
One click of a button and it takes like two days

1700
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Done

1701
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So that's kind of a lame excuse if that's

1702
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Oh I got all this money built up in PayPal

1703
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too

1704
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah they would love it free just to spend that PayPal money

1705
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
On stuff that their company is selling

1706
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Or transactions through them

1707
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction

1708
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And are they going to be charging you tax?

1709
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Because that would be something interesting too

1710
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I don't know

1711
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I guess it depends on what state you live in

1712
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
True

1713
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So other interesting stuff

1714
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got

1715
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test

1716
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I can't imagine this working full time

1717
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But their new thing is

1718
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Why buy used when you can buy new?

1719
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Best Buy will now match prices of new video games

1720
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
At used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy

1721
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So basically you go to GameStop

1722
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You say okay

1723
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I see this used game for five bucks cheaper

1724
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy

1725
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Get a new game

1726
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Call this GameStop to see

1727
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Check the price and done

1728
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You get the new game for the price of the used game

1729
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Awesome plan but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off this

1730
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Because they're going to be losing money left and right

1731
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Especially if

1732
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Somebody at the GameStop or something like that

1733
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Is a real dick

1734
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh yeah we're charging $20 for that game

1735
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Get a bunch of the game

1736
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Go sell it back to GameStop

1737
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
For more than $20

1738
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Now something that should be stressed though

1739
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Is that this is only available

1740
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
In one certain market right now

1741
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
This is not something

1742
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You can't run into Best Buy after hearing this

1743
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And expect them to do it

1744
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
West Jordan Utah

1745
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So they picked a really small freaking market to do it

1746
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So to our listeners in West Jordan Utah

1747
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
All one of you

1748
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If we even have that many

1749
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You can go check this out

1750
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
But at the same time

1751
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You kind of said it yourself Loki

1752
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The price of a used game

1753
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
At GameStop is typically only $5 under that of a new game

1754
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off

1755
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
On all their new games

1756
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Is that really that bad of a loss?

1757
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
If they can create loyalty

1758
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Because that's a big big thing

1759
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I think a lot of people build up loyalty

1760
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
To one certain place to buy their games

1761
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And here's the other thing too

1762
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
About that

1763
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You see retailers like this

1764
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Basically they can sell a game at cost

1765
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And it's still beneficial for them

1766
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
If they're able to sell enough units

1767
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Because they get back end rebates

1768
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
To buy X amount of pieces

1769
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Or whatever

1770
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Like a company like Activision or EA

1771
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Or whatever will give them money

1772
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Whether that be ad dollars

1773
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Or just incentives

1774
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Or whatever

1775
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
To get them to buy more

1776
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So what they could do with this

1777
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Is if they are able to launch this full scale

1778
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Really there would be no reason

1779
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
For you to go to a GameStop

1780
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Or GameCrazy

1781
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
To buy a used game

1782
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Or basically the same price

1783
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Now the question is

1784
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Are they going to also count the discounts

1785
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
That you get with your GameStop card

1786
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Are you going to be able to

1787
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Get the extra 10% off

1788
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Probably not

1789
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I would say just assume no on that

1790
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And store credit

1791
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now

1792
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But isn't that something else they're testing?

1793
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yeah the kiosks are testing that

1794
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But right now they're not

1795
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So they're not really doing

1796
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Any trades yet

1797
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
But it still

1798
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Helps and then they got to do

1799
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
More of the gift with purchase stuff

1800
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Because people seem to eat that crap up

1801
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Even though a lot of the incentives

1802
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Suck

1803
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But at the same time

1804
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And this goes for both Best Buy and GameStop

1805
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
They got to fucking watch

1806
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The prices of their goddamn accessories

1807
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That they're selling because a lot of stuff

1808
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
If you don't watch it they're actually selling it over retail

1809
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Like $5 over retail

1810
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
For example

1811
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Wii Motion Plus at GameStops

1812
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
$5 more than what it should actually cost

1813
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I was an idiot and bought it

1814
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Because I have store credit

1815
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So I didn't give a crap

1816
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But if I was more cautious

1817
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Then yes you could go buy it for $20 instead of $25

1818
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Same with some of the accessories

1819
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I know on the 360

1820
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Like their video cables

1821
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Or $10 over retail or $5 over retail

1822
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So you got to watch that shit

1823
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And they got to stop doing that

1824
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
On top of all that if you're cautious

1825
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Then yeah I don't see why this would be a bad deal

1826
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
If you're just interested in getting a used game

1827
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off

1828
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I got to read this comment from chat

1829
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Because it's really funny

1830
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Brad from Pod Culture says

1831
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They play video games in Utah

1832
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
To which Rama follows up with

1833
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Brad yep they play Super Mormon Brothers 2

1834
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh I'm sure Utah listeners appreciate that one

1835
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Alright

1836
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I just like that idea for a game

1837
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Super Mormon Brothers 2

1838
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
There's a ROM hack somewhere

1839
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Surely there's a ROM hack somewhere

1840
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Well hey I like cheaper games

1841
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
No matter how it happens

1842
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But let's not count out what GameStop might be doing

1843
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Not necessarily in retaliation

1844
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But certainly all the companies are trying to think

1845
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Of ways to one up each other

1846
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And GameStop is apparently looking for a new

1847
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Rewards program

1848
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Because you know the way it is right now

1849
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Is that they have what you get their little card

1850
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
You get the 10% discount or whatever

1851
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
10% more on trades

1852
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
You get some magazine I've never read in my life

1853
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Game Informer is actually not bad

1854
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah it's not a bad magazine

1855
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And the subscription price is cheaper than

1856
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Whatever

1857
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Honestly I couldn't tell you

1858
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine

1859
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Actually it was a couple weeks ago

1860
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I actually picked up a Barnes and Noble

1861
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's a magazine out of the UK

1862
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Retro Gamer I think it's called

1863
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh that's good we have an issue with Retro Gamer

1864
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
That was a pretty good one

1865
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
But other than that I mean thanks to the internet

1866
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
For the magazines

1867
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
The reason I buy their card each year

1868
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
One because the magazine subscription gives me something to do

1869
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Like to stare off in the space

1870
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
At work sometimes

1871
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And because the extra

1872
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Trade in value that you get

1873
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It pays for the card

1874
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Within a few uses for me

1875
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's the only reason I do it

1876
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It's basically a cost advantage for myself

1877
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Granted I could probably

1878
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Sell my games on eBay

1879
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Or whatever

1880
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I don't want to go through the fucking hassle

1881
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So that's my own choice

1882
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Whatever

1883
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Alright well apparently here's two versions

1884
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
They're testing some different

1885
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Rewards versions

1886
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I'm not sure let's see where did this come from

1887
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It was a survey I see

1888
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in

1889
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And here was one

1890
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Take your game to the next level

1891
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
With GameStop Rewards

1892
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So apparently if you sign up for this new

1893
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Free program

1894
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Sign up with your email address and so forth

1895
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
If you do one purchase or trade in a year

1896
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You would get a birthday surprise

1897
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Meaning discounts on your birthday

1898
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas

1899
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Level two would be

1900
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Make any combination of five purchases

1901
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Or trades per year

1902
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You would get 20% bonus

1903
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Trade in credit because you're a power trader

1904
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I guess and you get early access

1905
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
To purchase collector's editions of games

1906
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That's kind of interesting

1907
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release

1908
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
That's retarded

1909
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Because you know what the early access

1910
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Collector's editions is?

1911
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You get the pre-order before everybody else

1912
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And then level three is

1913
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
10 purchases or trade-ins a year

1914
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
To get you know 25%

1915
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Bonus on trade-ins

1916
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Guaranteed access to exclusive in-game

1917
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Accessories and so forth

1918
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Let's see

1919
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And then there's another one that is just like a two

1920
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Level thing where if you do one purchase

1921
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Or trade in a year you get the birthday

1922
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Surprise but if you do 20 purchases

1923
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Or trade-ins a year you get the

1924
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Subscription to Game Informer you get the power

1925
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Trades you get guaranteed

1926
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
In stock new games or free

1927
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Shipping that's kind of interesting too

1928
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So if they're out of your game they'll ship to your house for free

1929
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's interesting early access to purchase

1930
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Collector's editions of games $5

1931
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Shipping of new titles shipped on day of release

1932
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And guaranteed access to

1933
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Exclusive in-game accessories etc.

1934
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So you know more incentive programs which I'm

1935
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Sure make some people excited but again it's

1936
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
About building customer loyalty

1937
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Is huge you know

1938
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of

1939
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Making 20 trades because

1940
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You know

1941
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Once again it's cheap enough to where

1942
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
$25 that will pay for

1943
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Itself especially with the extra 10%

1944
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
On top of all that probably in

1945
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
One use so

1946
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Why not why wouldn't you do that

1947
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Especially if you're buying games on a regular basis

1948
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
You know why I've never signed up for their

1949
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Program and why I don't pre-order games

1950
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And I still stand by this I don't

1951
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Pre-order games because

1952
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I find that when the

1953
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Games are released because the companies

1954
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Are trying to one up each other if I pre-order

1955
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
The game at GameStop or whatever put $5

1956
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Down it's going to come out and Best Buy is

1957
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Going to have a sale where you get a

1958
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
$10 gift card if you buy the game or something

1959
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
That's why I don't like to pre-order games because

1960
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see

1961
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
What the competition is the day of release

1962
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And plus sometimes you see these really interesting things

1963
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Where GameStop gets

1964
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
One little incentive game crazy gets

1965
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Another Best Buy gets another you know

1966
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Like all the companies get their own little

1967
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Free weapon or whatever

1968
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And I want to pick the one I like the best

1969
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I don't know I just that's my whole thing

1970
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I'm pre-ordering and joining these

1971
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Incentive programs and stuff I just really like to shop around

1972
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order

1973
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Collector's editions and that's if I'm buying

1974
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
A collector's edition

1975
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Like Grand Theft Auto

1976
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Which we've got sitting right over there

1977
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yeah

1978
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But that's it

1979
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I mean that's all I really would pre-order

1980
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I order most of my stuff through my work

1981
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Just because you know

1982
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I tend to get them early

1983
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
D5T1 in chat says

1984
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Rob must be a Pepsi fan need to stick to a brand

1985
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Actually I am Pepsi is way better than Coke

1986
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Pepsi is way better than Coke

1987
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Only

1988
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And I've said this before

1989
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It's weird because Pepsi

1990
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It's better out of like

1991
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The can is good

1992
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And the bottle is okay

1993
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
The tap is alright

1994
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Coke on the other hand tastes like shit

1995
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Out of a can

1996
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Tastes alright out of the bottle

1997
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Actually pretty good out of the tap

1998
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's so weird

1999
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I can agree with that

2000
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I can agree with the tap changing

2001
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Like A&W out of the tap is so good

2002
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yes

2003
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Can's alright if it's cold enough

2004
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But I will say this because

2005
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Before the Coke lovers start hating on me

2006
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Vanilla Coke was superior to

2007
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Vanilla Pepsi

2008
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
They're both disgusting I'm sorry

2009
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Whatever I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap

2010
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
The other day still

2011
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
In the year 2009 at Rubio's

2012
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Yes I was floored

2013
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
They were also one of the first places to have it in town

2014
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You know what else is good with A&W

2015
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Out of the jug

2016
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Like they actually sell it in milk

2017
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Jugs

2018
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yes out of their stores

2019
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
That's best

2020
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Let's go ahead and move on

2021
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And Dark Sakura

2022
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
With some more news and we'll get into release dates

2023
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Well there's

2024
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
A channel in the UK called Bravo

2025
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Which is completely has nothing to do

2026
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
With our Bravo

2027
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
That has a show out

2028
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Called Game Face

2029
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
For casual gamers

2030
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Pretty much

2031
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You just watch

2032
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
These guys play TV

2033
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Play video games

2034
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And they'll have some

2035
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Girl come out and be stupid

2036
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And then you get to see

2037
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Some game footage and then you hear

2038
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The people reviewing the games

2039
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Over the footage basically

2040
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
What we've already had

2041
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Better people doing on

2042
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
YouTube for free

2043
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You know

2044
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And

2045
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It just really seems like

2046
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It would be really boring to watch

2047
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Because

2048
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Usually anything that's got

2049
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Some type of corporate design behind it

2050
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Tends to get the imagination

2051
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Sucked out of whatever it could have been

2052
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Yeah I mean

2053
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
True there's people that'll sit there

2054
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And watch other people play video games for a long time

2055
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I do when they're at my house

2056
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey

2057
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Even though he doesn't really play the game himself

2058
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
He loves to just watch me kind of play through it

2059
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And see all the cinematic scenes and stuff

2060
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So it's kind of interesting that they're

2061
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Kind of making that a TV show

2062
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You know that they'll just kind of show

2063
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff

2064
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Also you know this kind of tangent

2065
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Sorry but they have these interesting things on the

2066
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Comcast on demand

2067
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Where you can actually go in and they have these things

2068
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something

2069
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And it's actually I don't know if it's G4

2070
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
One of the other networks puts them on there

2071
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right

2072
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
But you can actually watch

2073
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
In HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay

2074
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Of certain games

2075
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Around release time

2076
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
To help you decide if you want to buy it

2077
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Or not I guess

2078
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Really get to see what it looks like

2079
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
That's kind of interesting

2080
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I actually think that's a good idea

2081
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I think that's a really good idea to have that

2082
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Well my question is you know

2083
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
We kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows

2084
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Come out and they're stupid

2085
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
What video game TV show should they make

2086
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Do you think

2087
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
How could they make a video game TV show

2088
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
That's cool

2089
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
They need to bring back the old school stuff

2090
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Where you have the person talking about the new games

2091
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
That are coming out well I guess we're already

2092
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Doing that but you know

2093
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I think that

2094
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
That's really what I'd like to

2095
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
More see because it was really cool back in the day

2096
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Or you know like the

2097
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Video game related game shows

2098
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of

2099
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
But like the ones where the people had the Velcro best

2100
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And ran around that was kind of cool

2101
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
StarCade and all that stuff

2102
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And I would like to see something like the

2103
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Screen Savers used to be

2104
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But more about video games

2105
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Which I know you might be thinking well isn't that Attack of the Show

2106
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm not really because that's kind of got that

2107
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Maxim Magazine spin on it basically

2108
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And you know that's not

2109
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
All inclusive really of all the gamers

2110
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It's also annoying

2111
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I don't know I'm just

2112
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I'm a much bigger fan of what that

2113
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Show used to be than what it is now that's for sure

2114
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So I don't know

2115
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I kind of like the idea of a

2116
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Gaming kind of TV show by gamers

2117
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Who somewhat know what they're doing

2118
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I also would like to see kind of current

2119
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
More current things I like the idea of

2120
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
A daily show that you know

2121
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Is kind of current

2122
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah

2123
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And really if you want to

2124
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Get reviews and everything

2125
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
There's more amusing things to watch online

2126
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Like the Angry Video Game Nerd

2127
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And the one that

2128
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh god I can't remember what it is

2129
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
The one that my husband watches all the time

2130
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
That's kind of like that only older

2131
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched

2132
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
He was drinking New Castle

2133
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It was pretty good

2134
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And somebody in chat says Orange Lounge TV maybe?

2135
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
No

2136
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I don't know I think we might be

2137
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Getting too old it's a sad thing

2138
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Not too old he doesn't have enough time

2139
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah it's true

2140
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I'd have to be getting paid for this

2141
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Exactly we'd have to all quit our jobs to do it

2142
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah I would like to get paid

2143
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So I don't know

2144
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I honestly

2145
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Wouldn't even know where to begin with that

2146
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm not even going to think about it

2147
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Let's move on with some release dates

2148
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Low key

2149
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Well there's not a whole lot coming out in the US

2150
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Unfortunately it's a little bit of a slow time

2151
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
But there is some big stuff this week

2152
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Including Madden NFL 10

2153
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Coming out this Friday

2154
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Pretty much can't expect that on

2155
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Every single system out there

2156
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Except for the DS I don't think it's on the DS this year

2157
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Fossil Fighter is on the DS

2158
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Actually today

2159
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Or tomorrow

2160
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I don't know I thought it was supposed to be today

2161
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Anyways tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo

2162
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Imagine Soccer Captain

2163
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Another crappy game from Ubisoft

2164
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That's on the DS

2165
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Active Life Extreme Challenge

2166
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It's the game that has

2167
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I don't know

2168
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Like a two player DDR mat or I guess

2169
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Kind of like a power pad

2170
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
But it's for the Wii and it's

2171
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
All the mini games you could possibly want

2172
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And that's available

2173
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Or not want is the case

2174
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
We have a budget Fire Fighter sim

2175
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Real Heroes Fire Fighter

2176
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That's on the Wii

2177
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Also this week Core on the DS

2178
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
From Graffiti Entertainment

2179
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Hopefully actually coming out this time

2180
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Because it's been delayed forever

2181
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
ATV Quad Kings

2182
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
On the Wii

2183
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It's a game from Zoo Games

2184
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And I can tell you this much it's gonna suck

2185
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Because it's just like all those other Destiny games

2186
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And they all suck

2187
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Let's see

2188
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Five Two coming out on PC

2189
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I don't know if that's a re-release or not

2190
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Phantom Brave Wii Meet Again on the Wii

2191
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That's actually pretty cool

2192
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
If you're a Japanese RPG fan

2193
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And if you possibly want one

2194
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Even though you don't own Lips

2195
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
They are selling the Lips Microphone

2196
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Separately now

2197
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
You can purchase that this week

2198
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
For the Xbox 360

2199
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And that's it

2200
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's like I said

2201
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Slow week

2202
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's also a slow week over in Japan

2203
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
As we go take a look at the Japanese release dates

2204
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Really on the big systems

2205
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
There's only one new game coming out

2206
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
But it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game

2207
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And some folks may get a kick out of that

2208
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It's coming out on the Wii

2209
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Hagane no Reckon Jutsuji

2210
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsuki no Oji

2211
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Comes out

2212
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It's a game based off

2213
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Clearly the series Fullmetal Alchemist

2214
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Not sure what type of game it is

2215
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It looks to be like kind of an adventure-y

2216
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Not quite a role playing game

2217
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But a little more adventure-y with some little mini games

2218
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Built in like I see one where you're like shooting guys

2219
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
With the buttons and stuff

2220
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So fans of that series may be into that

2221
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Otherwise that's really it on the big systems

2222
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
If you go to the handhelds

2223
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
You have a little bit coming out on the Nintendo DS

2224
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
The localized version of Bolt comes out

2225
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
From Disney Interactive

2226
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So Obuncha Derojun

2227
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Rikishi DS and Rika DS

2228
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Both come out this week

2229
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Sounds like a wrestling game

2230
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Or sumo game

2231
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Could be

2232
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But there's two different versions of it

2233
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And then lastly on the PSP there is a new game

2234
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Infinity Plus Portable comes out

2235
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And this is

2236
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I think a bunch of games

2237
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's produced by Cyber Front

2238
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
With different scenarios written by

2239
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Utsukoshi Kotaro

2240
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's done scripts for famous adventure games

2241
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Like Memory Off

2242
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And it's part Danish simulation and part adventure

2243
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You have to rack your brains

2244
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
To work your way out of pressing situations

2245
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Time leaps and messed up dimensions

2246
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Are just a few of your troubles

2247
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
There on the PSP

2248
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That's really it for this week in Japan

2249
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Well for our friends in the UK

2250
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
There's a few releases

2251
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
On the 12th is Trials HD

2252
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
On Xbox 360

2253
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Marvel vs Capcom 2

2254
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands

2255
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Both of those on the 13th

2256
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3

2257
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
For PC and

2258
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Madden 10, whatever

2259
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That's it

2260
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And

2261
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Madden BLEH

2262
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Not your cup of tea, huh?

2263
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
BLEH, barf

2264
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Um

2265
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So this is interesting

2266
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Sony has trademarked a new

2267
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Um

2268
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I guess a new logo

2269
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
For something called PlayStation Thanks

2270
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Um, no word on what this is yet

2271
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
However, if you were to ask me

2272
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I would say that it's probably gonna be some sort of

2273
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Um, incentive program

2274
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Very similar like, you know, the

2275
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Club Nintendo stuff

2276
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Very interesting tonight, we have a lot of

2277
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Discount and reward stories

2278
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I guess a sign of the times, I don't know

2279
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
To help in the economy

2280
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yeah, I mean, maybe

2281
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I mean, that's the only thing I can think of

2282
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Unless they're gonna come out with a new system named

2283
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Thanks, which would be retarded

2284
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I mean, I'm sorry, that would be absolutely retarded

2285
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Thanks for giving me your money

2286
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
But then again, you know, hey, we said the same thing about the Wii

2287
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
When that was named, but uh

2288
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I hope not

2289
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Um, yeah

2290
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So

2291
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
No word on what that is, but I'm sure we'll find out about it

2292
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Soon enough

2293
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Dude, let's go play Thanks

2294
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Nice

2295
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I don't know, that would be awful

2296
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
PlayStation Thanks

2297
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Uh, any type of speculation what it is?

2298
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Do you think it's just to compete with Club Nintendo

2299
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Or do you think this is just gonna unlock shit and home?

2300
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I think it's just a redemption program

2301
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Just basically to incentivize people to buy stuff

2302
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
S2100Matt in chat says

2303
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I approve of these discount stories

2304
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories

2305
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
It's just kinda interesting, it all seems to be hitting the same week

2306
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And you know, we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed

2307
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
This is all for work this week

2308
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP

2309
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You know, they get you to buy stuff

2310
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And you get codes and then you can like redeem points

2311
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And get crap

2312
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Maybe that's what they're doing

2313
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
That would make more sense to me

2314
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
PlayStation 3, since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3

2315
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Um

2316
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I don't know

2317
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It'd be a nice bonus

2318
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Tigerclaw says perhaps this thanks thing could be a reward system

2319
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Where they offer you discounts on any games purchased in PlayStation Network

2320
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Who knows, $5 off or something

2321
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I don't know

2322
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I don't know

2323
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this

2324
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing

2325
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Well I say thanks to Square Enix

2326
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Because this week we got some more details on Final Fantasy 14

2327
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
A more full website has opened up for the game by the way

2328
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
If you want to check that out

2329
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And I guess some more information was released on an 8 minute video

2330
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
That came out from Famitsu Wave

2331
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I guess which is available on YouTube

2332
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
But boy oh boy

2333
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
If you want to check that out

2334
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It didn't really end there

2335
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
A lot of new information came out

2336
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
On Final Fantasy 14

2337
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What's kind of interesting is that

2338
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Some of the jobs from 11

2339
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs

2340
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Is going to be somewhat similar

2341
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But the focus is going to be on the weapons

2342
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And they're saying that okay

2343
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
What's also interesting

2344
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
They're not using any of the Final Fantasy

2345
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Very typical names for classes

2346
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Like you have swordsman and sorcerer

2347
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Like all these new type of jobs

2348
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
That you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before

2349
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But apparently the way it works is that like let's say you have a sword

2350
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Okay well that makes you a swordsman

2351
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But then let's say you're going to go off on an adventure

2352
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Where you need to go heal

2353
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Well you switch from your sword to your staff

2354
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And now you're a healer

2355
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And that's why you see in the Final Fantasy 14 logo

2356
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Out of the trailer that there was a lot of weapons poking out of it

2357
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Because the weapon system is kind of the central part of that game

2358
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And they say

2359
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
That experience points and leveling

2360
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Doesn't even work like a normal game

2361
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Like there are no experience points in leveling

2362
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's all based on the weapons

2363
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
So it sounds kind of interesting

2364
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
But more importantly they've also talked about

2365
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
They are building this game so you can play it

2366
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
If you have only an hour of time to spare

2367
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Or if you have all day to spare

2368
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
They are looking at certain features that are only

2369
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
15-30 minutes in length

2370
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Also some other things released about the game this week

2371
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Is that the classes have been revealed

2372
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And what's really interesting is that

2373
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
They call them completely different names

2374
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
They're not all even the

2375
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Same names that you might be used to

2376
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Like Taru Taru

2377
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Is now called a Lalafel

2378
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Which I keep saying a falafel

2379
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
But their name is a Lalafel

2380
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Or something like that

2381
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I know they changed all the names

2382
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Because it's a new world

2383
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh it's not a new world, they're the exact same races

2384
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Come on

2385
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
The characters do look slightly different

2386
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
But they're also saying that the difference between the races

2387
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Is not going to be that great

2388
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But that the differences between the genders

2389
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
There's some translation I read

2390
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Which some people are thinking might be a throwback

2391
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
To the old D&D

2392
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Where men were typically more strength

2393
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Women were typically more mind intelligence

2394
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Kind of interesting

2395
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That's not true at all

2396
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I don't think it's funny to call them falafels

2397
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Do you also have Hummus as another class?

2398
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Probably

2399
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
There's a Humaya or something like that

2400
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Is what they call a human

2401
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Why can't they just use Hummus?

2402
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Seriously

2403
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
They're elven

2404
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Just call them elves

2405
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
They're not elven

2406
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Or elephanten

2407
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Or whatever the hell they're calling them

2408
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I think my friend Shane was calling them Lalafels

2409
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
They don't look as cute as Taros do

2410
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
They look bigger now

2411
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
They don't look like Taros did

2412
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Apparently they're more customizable

2413
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Are they going to have male Mithras

2414
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And female Galkas

2415
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Or whatever the fuck they're calling them

2416
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
These guys are unisex though

2417
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Not yet, we haven't seen anything yet

2418
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them

2419
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
That they might come out later

2420
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
That we'll see male Mithras later on

2421
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Or whatever they're calling them now

2422
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Cat people

2423
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
You say that and I have thought this ever since

2424
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I always think of Mithril

2425
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I will say this though

2426
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Some screenshots have come out from the game

2427
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It looks really nice

2428
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Not really a lot from in-game

2429
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
But just of some of the scenery and things

2430
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics

2431
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
To look a lot more like Oblivion

2432
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But very colorful

2433
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Oblivion started to look very monotone after a while

2434
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics

2435
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
But Final Fantasy 14

2436
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
They've shown some landscapes

2437
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
That are just very lush and colorful

2438
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And I'm very excited to see

2439
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
How the game looks when it comes out

2440
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year

2441
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Because the game's coming out in 2010

2442
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I don't know how they're going to do that

2443
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
When Final Fantasy 13 hasn't even dated yet

2444
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I think people are getting their hopes up

2445
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I don't think this game's coming out until 2011

2446
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I realize Squeenix is saying 2010

2447
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
But come on, how many games get delayed?

2448
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Do we trust them?

2449
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Do we really trust them?

2450
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
So best case scenario

2451
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Like Christmas 2010

2452
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Is when you'll see this game, I think

2453
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But hey, don't get me wrong

2454
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm kind of excited about this game

2455
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Because I'm really excited at the notion that they have

2456
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Fixed a lot of the problems

2457
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Big problems that Final Fantasy 11 had

2458
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Especially in regards to

2459
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
How long of an investment you have to make

2460
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
With the game each time you play it

2461
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I mean like a month at a time

2462
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Right?

2463
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So anyway

2464
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
We're going to go into now another segment

2465
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
We like to do here

2466
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane

2467
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And recap a

2468
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Favorite game that we love

2469
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
In a segment called the classic game of the week

2470
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

2471
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And find the game

2472
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That she thinks you all ought to be playing this week

2473
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
In Dark Soccer's classic game of the week

2474
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

2475
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
The game of the week is

2476
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn

2477
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
In Japan it came out

2478
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
As a Zell Panzer Dragoon RPG

2479
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
It is

2480
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Like I said, a role play game

2481
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Came out in 1988

2482
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
For the Saturn

2483
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series

2484
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Not including

2485
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Panzer Dragoon Mini

2486
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That came out on Game Gear in Japan

2487
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And also it's also the only one

2488
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
That's not a rail shooter

2489
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
It's

2490
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It was done by

2491
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Team Andromeda

2492
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And this was

2493
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Their last game as

2494
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Team Andromeda

2495
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
So you're playing a boy named Edge

2496
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Who is looking

2497
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Who's actually trying

2498
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
To save the world

2499
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And has his own dragon and everything

2500
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And so you play through the game

2501
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
With real time

2502
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Well sort of real time

2503
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Combat

2504
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And

2505
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Your different interactions

2506
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
With the characters

2507
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
The really really cool thing about this

2508
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Is that

2509
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You actually

2510
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Don't

2511
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Stay on the dragon all the time

2512
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
You can go around

2513
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And explore different areas on foot

2514
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And then you can fly around the world

2515
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
You know different places that you can get to

2516
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
You

2517
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Control your dragon

2518
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Pretty much completely

2519
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Instead of it being predetermined

2520
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Like it was in the other games

2521
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
You actually tell the dragon where to go

2522
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And can go anywhere you want to

2523
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
You also have other commands for the dragon

2524
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Like breaking things and accessing

2525
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Lovers and switches and things like that

2526
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And your dragon has different

2527
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You know weapons

2528
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
It's

2529
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Like you have lasers for your dragon

2530
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Dragon with lasers that's pretty cool

2531
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Dragons with lasers awesome

2532
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Why didn't they just call the game

2533
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Laser Dragons? I probably would have checked it out

2534
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
When it was first out

2535
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Well it actually was really good

2536
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It used a lot of dramatic camera angles

2537
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It really

2538
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Had just

2539
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It was really really a

2540
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Traditional RPG with some

2541
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Really unconventional aspects to it

2542
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Like for example you're in air combat

2543
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And it wasn't necessarily

2544
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Turn based it was

2545
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Real time based

2546
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And you know you have your attack

2547
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
You can use items and then you have your berserks

2548
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Which are like your spells

2549
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And then you know you've also got

2550
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Your gauges that determine

2551
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
You know where you are for your initiative

2552
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
You know sort of like that

2553
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The other

2554
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Now this is what I really liked is that

2555
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You can get different abilities

2556
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
You can equip your dragon

2557
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Well it's technically called

2558
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Morphing they also put this in

2559
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
In Panzer Dragons VI and

2560
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Orda which came out on Dreamcast

2561
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You can change

2562
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
The dragon into all these different forms

2563
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Which actually the specific

2564
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Thing about Saga is that

2565
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
You literally had hundreds

2566
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Of different forms that you could do

2567
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
You would affect different attributes

2568
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
By sort of upgrading

2569
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Parts of your dragon and it would

2570
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Take a different appearance

2571
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Have different abilities, do different things

2572
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
And it would actually

2573
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Change physical form

2574
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
As you did everything

2575
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
There were

2576
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Really different extreme forms

2577
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Based off of agility, spirit, attack

2578
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Or defense

2579
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And then it would change something within

2580
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Those four extremes

2581
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You would

2582
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Also be able to make some

2583
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Unique forms by getting D units

2584
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And then

2585
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
There were hidden forms one of them is called

2586
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
The light wing where if you get all 12

2587
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Of the D units in the game

2588
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
You get the ultimate dragon

2589
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Pretty much the light wing has

2590
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
All of the special berserks

2591
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And

2592
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
When you charge all of your action gauges

2593
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Then all of your status

2594
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Your health points and your berserk points

2595
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
All go to normal

2596
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Then there's another one called the solo wing

2597
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Which really didn't do crap for you

2598
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But it was harder to get so

2599
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It bothered

2600
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But it is considered one of the

2601
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Pinnacles of

2602
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
The Saturn RPGs

2603
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And Saturn RPGs are

2604
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Barely

2605
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
You know, at least for the ones

2606
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That we got out over here

2607
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Few and far between

2608
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And we actually have

2609
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
An American copy of this game

2610
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And we paid

2611
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Quite a bit for it

2612
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Good luck finding it

2613
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
It's really really difficult

2614
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
But it is considered

2615
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
One of the best RPGs

2616
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
On the Saturn

2617
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Especially the few that came out in the US

2618
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
So

2619
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
There it is

2620
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Your classic game of the week

2621
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn

2622
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And I've never really seen this game before

2623
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But especially for that era

2624
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I like the backgrounds, they're very pretty

2625
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's all these dragons shooting their lasers

2626
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And pretty sunsets and so forth

2627
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Really good music and not a lot of talking

2628
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Was one of the dragon battles

2629
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah, it's kind of fun

2630
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
The game has some

2631
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Gorgeous music and also it's in

2632
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Japanese

2633
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
With subtitles

2634
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So the voice acting was actually

2635
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Pretty good in it too

2636
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
There's a few familiar voices

2637
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
For at least those who were onomie

2638
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Nuts

2639
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Well if you actually have a Sega Saturn

2640
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Still around the house and kicking and working

2641
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
You can kind of copy that and check it out

2642
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Or I guess you can always try to emulate it somehow

2643
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
But do they have Saturn?

2644
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
They have Saturn emulators, you usually have to have a good working BIOS

2645
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But other than that

2646
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yeah, they work

2647
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
They work fine on your PC at home

2648
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I have one because

2649
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I just wanted to try it and it actually works on my

2650
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Disc games that I have a few Saturn games

2651
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out

2652
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It works great

2653
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Alright, well we're going to take a break here on

2654
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet

2655
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
We've got plenty more to come

2656
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
We've got our rapid fire news when we come back with Part B tonight

2657
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
As well as some more discussion

2658
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up

2659
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
We're going to talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSI

2660
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
And Pax 09 news

2661
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break

2662
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Here on Orange Lounge Radio

2663
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
So don't go anywhere, stay tuned

2664
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Music

2665
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio

2666
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
On this lovely Sunday evening

2667
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Of 2009, of course we do tape live

2668
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
On all games radio every Sunday night

2669
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

2670
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
9 o'clock Eastern Time

2671
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus

2672
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that

2673
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
In Part A, but you will just have to download

2674
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
The podcast at this point, which I know

2675
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Is very slow in updating during our podcast

2676
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
But should be back on a more regular schedule

2677
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
This week

2678
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So anyhow, let's jump right back into some more gaming news

2679
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
We have some rapid fire news

2680
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
News that we're probably not going to talk a lot about

2681
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But we wanted to get it out there anyway

2682
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight

2683
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Yes, Pearl Jam's next album is actually

2684
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Becoming simultaneously to

2685
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Rock Band as well as retail

2686
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And of course

2687
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Their new album, which

2688
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I believe is called Backspacer

2689
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Which is kind of a weird name, but okay

2690
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It'll be available

2691
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
The same day

2692
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
On both Playstation Network and Xbox Live

2693
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Marketplace, September 20th

2694
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Is going to be the

2695
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Date for that

2696
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition is now

2697
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Also being ported to

2698
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
The iPhone

2699
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And it makes perfect sense that they would be

2700
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Putting that out there

2701
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Definitely worth checking out

2702
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I believe it's actually coming out as

2703
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Pac-Man Remix

2704
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Oh no

2705
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
They had one called Pac-Man Remix

2706
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
My mistake, it is Championship Edition

2707
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
That'd be kind of cool

2708
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
And then a new

2709
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
It's going to suck on the iPhone because the music

2710
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Was awesome in the Xbox one

2711
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I don't know if they're, well I guess you know

2712
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
iPhone is an MP3 player, but

2713
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
And they've got some kickass tunes, but I don't know

2714
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360

2715
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
One being reproduced on the iPhone

2716
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Sorry, had to get that out there

2717
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
We'll see

2718
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Champions Online is actually doing something

2719
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Interesting with their subscription service

2720
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
They're actually, besides the monthly

2721
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
subscription that you could do

2722
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Which would be

2723
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
$15 a month

2724
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I guess

2725
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
You can actually purchase

2726
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
A six month plan

2727
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
At a slightly discounted rate for

2728
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
$59.99

2729
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Or if you want to

2730
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
If you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game

2731
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
You can get a lifetime subscription

2732
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
For $199.99

2733
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
$200

2734
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And I know for a lot of people that are

2735
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Playing WoW, if you get a lifetime

2736
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Subscription for $200, that probably would've been

2737
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Worth it when it launched

2738
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I don't know, if you're really into

2739
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Champions Online, that might be the way to go

2740
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
But aren't you

2741
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Getting also something about Star Trek Online

2742
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
With that too? That was the part that caught my eye

2743
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Yes, if you pre-order

2744
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
One of the subscription plans

2745
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
You will also get

2746
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Access to the closed beta for

2747
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Star Trek Online

2748
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Which is coming out later this year

2749
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
See, I really want to play

2750
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Star Trek Online, but not $200

2751
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Sadly, especially when I don't really know anything

2752
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
About Champions Online, except that

2753
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
The series has a cult following to it

2754
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I play Champions offline

2755
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
With books and paper and dice

2756
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Does the prospect of an online one

2757
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Because, you know, that wasn't really my thing

2758
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Is the prospect of an online version of that

2759
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Appeal to you?

2760
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Maybe? Could be hit and miss, I guess

2761
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
But, dude, Star Trek Online

2762
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Early, that's cool

2763
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
But, man, that's a mean thing to do

2764
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I mean, you gotta pay, what

2765
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
$200, or what's the other subscription plan

2766
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Like $50 or something? $60 for six months

2767
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
You gotta pay upfront

2768
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Just to get into a beta, it's not worth it for that

2769
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I bet you, though, there's some people

2770
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
That'll pay that $60 just to get in that beta

2771
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I am positive of that

2772
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
You're gonna pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO

2773
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
To play a beta for another MMO

2774
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
That you're possibly gonna go to

2775
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Kind of a waste of money if you ask me

2776
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Well, you know what? People can spend their money

2777
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
However they want, right?

2778
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Alright, sorry, I didn't mean to go off and talk about that

2779
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But I just thought that was too interesting

2780
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Anyhow, let's- I think it's funny

2781
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Let me dive into some more news, we'll start off with

2782
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
This actually is a little bit of old news

2783
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It did come out a couple weeks ago, but

2784
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
We have some staffers at Orange Launch Radio that love

2785
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Love, love a little indie game called La Mulana

2786
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And that was a game that came out

2787
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It actually came out in like 2005

2788
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
But it has extremely retro graphics

2789
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It's kind of like

2790
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Metroid-ish style kind of game

2791
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game

2792
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX

2793
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
If you've never seen this game before

2794
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Well, if you've never seen the game before

2795
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You will get to see it soon

2796
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare

2797
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit, surprise

2798
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades

2799
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It won't really look 8-bit

2800
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
But it'll look kind of more 16-bit

2801
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
With a little bit more hand-drawn art

2802
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Is what the look they're going for

2803
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Should be kind of fun

2804
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
The WiiWare version will also have downloadable content

2805
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
New stages and game modes

2806
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Such as Boss Rush

2807
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The game is very, very difficult

2808
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
So I'm not sure if the level of difficulty will still be there

2809
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Or what they plan to do

2810
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
But that is all part of it

2811
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Moving on to talking about Rockband

2812
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I thought this was interesting

2813
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Rockband.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart

2814
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
This is interesting because

2815
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You've seen some blogs and some websites

2816
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Do instrument compatibility charts of their own

2817
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
But this is coming right from the source

2818
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Harmonics meaning

2819
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And includes games such as Beatles Rockband

2820
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
What I think is interesting about this

2821
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
They make no shame about listing

2822
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Guitar Hero games on here as well

2823
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting

2824
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
They also put in their compatibility chart

2825
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
As well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth

2826
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
If you're curious, just briefly

2827
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
You can look at this at Rockband.com slash compatibility

2828
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
You get the whole chart

2829
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But it actually looks like most of the instruments

2830
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Are compatible with all the games at this point

2831
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The only things you're going to run into is

2832
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
You're going to run into problems with some of the Rockband paraphernalia

2833
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
In Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3

2834
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
On the Xbox 360

2835
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And drums are all pretty cross compatible

2836
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Unless you own the Rock Revolution drums

2837
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
They just don't work with Rockband games

2838
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
But if you want the confidence that your instruments

2839
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Will work with the Beatles Rockband

2840
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Here's some good news for you

2841
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Beatles Rockband will run on

2842
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Every single instrument will run with

2843
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Beatles Rockband as well as

2844
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Rockband 2

2845
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
The only thing that doesn't work with Rockband 2

2846
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Rock Revolution drums

2847
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Same thing with Beatles Rockband

2848
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
No one bought Rock Revolution anyway

2849
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
They might, it's cheap now even with the drums

2850
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I guess it's true

2851
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Find an unloaded one

2852
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Anyhow, one other one

2853
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Quick follow up to a story previously talked about on Orange Launch Radio

2854
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled

2855
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And the game will be released in October

2856
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game

2857
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal

2858
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed

2859
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But the game will be coming out in October

2860
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So get ready to rock those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend

2861
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
That was a really messy situation

2862
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Because there was counter suits and all this other garbage

2863
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Yuck

2864
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news

2865
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
What actually was going to be coming out is

2866
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Revenge of Shinobi

2867
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
For Mega Drive for the Genesis

2868
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Over here will be coming out for

2869
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
800 Nintendo points

2870
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And on WiiWare there's Bonsai Barber

2871
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Which is a tree sculpting and painting game

2872
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It's actually running a business

2873
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Doing both of those

2874
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And that's a thousand points

2875
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And then there will be a bunch of city maps

2876
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
For DS city transport

2877
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
For DS city transport map volumes 1 and 2

2878
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
There will be

2879
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Parasite

2880
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And then there will be

2881
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And then there will be

2882
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon

2883
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And then there will be

2884
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
London, Amsterdam

2885
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Moscow, Berlin, and Prague

2886
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
So that's pretty cool

2887
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
And that will be for 500

2888
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Also in other news

2889
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And this makes me a happy fangirl

2890
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Is we will have gorillas in rock band

2891
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Yay

2892
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Where's the yay?

2893
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Yay

2894
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
That's right

2895
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are

2896
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But I'll download them for sure

2897
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Definitely

2898
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Heck yeah

2899
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Well there's going to be Feel Good Inc, Clint Eastwood

2900
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And Rehash

2901
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
For pack 1

2902
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And that's going to be pretty cool

2903
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's supposed to be out

2904
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
For

2905
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Excuse me

2906
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
On the rock band music store

2907
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
This week

2908
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I believe

2909
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Tuesdays are usually the day those come out right?

2910
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Exactly

2911
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
There's also going to be some other

2912
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Download tracks

2913
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
We get some Janis Joplin

2914
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
We get Piece of My Heart

2915
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That's awesome

2916
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
This is going to be the best week ever for rock band

2917
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
We get White Rabbit

2918
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Dude! Jefferson fucking airplane

2919
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
This is the greatest week ever for rock band

2920
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
We get Magic Bus

2921
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Nice

2922
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But also for the Wii

2923
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
There will be a number of songs

2924
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Yeah

2925
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer

2926
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Thin Lizzy

2927
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas

2928
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Or no, my birthday?

2929
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I still haven't spent it

2930
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week

2931
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I have to get the gorilla stuff

2932
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I have to get Jefferson airplane

2933
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So

2934
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Look forward to that at my next rock band party

2935
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
The other thing

2936
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Sega is teasing us

2937
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
With the new RPG

2938
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
We will be able to see

2939
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
What it is on August 20th

2940
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
But

2941
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
There are a few clues though

2942
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Saying that there's going to be

2943
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's a wooden ship wheel

2944
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And a silhouette of a woman

2945
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
In a weird pose

2946
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So

2947
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
There's a few people who think

2948
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
That there's going to be

2949
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
A

2950
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
PSO

2951
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
But

2952
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
PSO

2953
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Like

2954
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
A new fantasy czar

2955
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Fantasy star roleplay game

2956
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Fantasy czar

2957
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
That's set in the

2958
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Future Russia

2959
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
In outer space

2960
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
No

2961
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But

2962
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
This to speculation they really pulled it out

2963
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Of some HTML code

2964
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
AKA their ass

2965
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So that's it

2966
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Now Kyria Chronicles 2 or something

2967
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
But I guess we already know about that

2968
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Or I'm thinking if they've got

2969
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
A big captains wheel

2970
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
What about Eternal Arcadia

2971
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
That was out on Dreamcast

2972
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Where you had the air pirate ships

2973
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Wow that's obscure

2974
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
That's not obscure I haven't

2975
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I never

2976
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Doesn't mean anything

2977
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Look folks go look at the

2978
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Video of the vault on YouTube

2979
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And tell me she does not have some obscure shit

2980
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
The lady pulls out a dish

2981
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
That came with a video game at some point I kid you not

2982
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Or perhaps

2983
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
That's obscure

2984
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It's a new party game collection

2985
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Sonic vs the Somalia pirates

2986
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
No

2987
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Good times

2988
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
No

2989
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Very cool

2990
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Alright

2991
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I hate you Spyler

2992
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Oh yeah that's right it came out as Skies of Arcadia

2993
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Over here or whatever

2994
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name

2995
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Oh now Skies of Arcadia

2996
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I've heard of that okay

2997
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I get it now

2998
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Not obscure

2999
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Alright let's get back to some more gaming news Loki

3000
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Alright

3001
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Well

3002
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
There's some interesting stuff that they were

3003
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Showing off this week for Guitar Hero 5

3004
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Including

3005
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
That much like the Wii version

3006
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Where you can throw in your own Miis

3007
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Although that version kinda

3008
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Eh the Miis thing's kinda lame

3009
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
The Xbox

3010
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Avatars will now be able to be featured

3011
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
In your Xbox 360 version

3012
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Of Guitar Hero 5

3013
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
To rock out I guess on stage

3014
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Which is

3015
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Interesting

3016
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And on top of that

3017
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Also Guitar Hero

3018
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Van Halen this week got its full

3019
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Track list

3020
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Some people

3021
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Are less excited about it

3022
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Um

3023
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Eh

3024
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Anyways

3025
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Some of the tracks feature

3026
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Are featured

3027
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
In the game I guess

3028
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Jump, Hot for Teacher

3029
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Let's see

3030
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls

3031
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Panama

3032
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
That's gonna be awesome

3033
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Pretty Woman

3034
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
So This is Love

3035
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Unchained and You Really Got Me

3036
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Of course those are all Van Halen tracks

3037
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Other artists featured in the game

3038
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
As well

3039
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Billy Idol, White Wedding

3040
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Um

3041
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Foreigner with Devil Vision

3042
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Third Eye Blind, Semi Charmed Life

3043
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
The Offspring, Pretty Fly

3044
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
For A White Guy

3045
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Do do do do do do do do

3046
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Queen, I Want It All

3047
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Lain Cravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead

3048
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Man just when I think

3049
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Like a song list kinda blows

3050
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm not really interested. They have to go in and throw in a Queen track

3051
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
That suddenly takes it from Suck to

3052
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Awesome. Which by the way

3053
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Sing Star Queen is apparently out now

3054
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
And I'm surprised I don't already own it

3055
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
It's not out yet. I thought it came out this week

3056
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh yeah that's right they changed the date I forgot about that

3057
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
It like got bumped up or something

3058
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin though

3059
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Cause Sing Star games usually end up in the discount bin

3060
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
In about a month

3061
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah

3062
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So yeah

3063
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
All those tracks and you know

3064
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Of course those two stories just

3065
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games

3066
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
And not for any other reason at all

3067
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Of course not

3068
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Cause that would be purely hypothetical

3069
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Now I was

3070
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
In South Lake Tahoe this weekend

3071
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And at the basement of one of their

3072
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Casinos there, Harvey's

3073
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
They have a Cabo Wabo

3074
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And that was kind of a fun place to go

3075
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Cause you get good drinks and so forth

3076
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You know who started that?

3077
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Somebody that's missing from Guitar Hero

3078
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Exactly

3079
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
So I was gonna say I saw some

3080
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Well I didn't see him there but I saw someone this week

3081
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
That I'm not gonna see in this game

3082
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Sammy Hagar

3083
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I was gonna

3084
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I was gonna also say though

3085
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
That

3086
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The game is scheduled

3087
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
To come out

3088
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd

3089
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
For most people

3090
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
That seems way pushed back from what we were originally

3091
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
It is way pushed back

3092
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Interesting

3093
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It is interesting now isn't it

3094
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Hypothetically speaking

3095
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Very interesting

3096
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Just before Christmas

3097
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Just before Christmas

3098
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
The Christmas will come early for some

3099
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Guitar Hero faithful

3100
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Hypothetically

3101
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Anyhow hey one thing that's not hypothetical

3102
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
This is fact ladies and gentlemen

3103
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Facebook is now integrated with the DSI

3104
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
The whole switch happened on

3105
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I think it was the 3rd of August

3106
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
When this all went down

3107
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
But I know I've been seeing it show up on my

3108
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Friend feed on Facebook

3109
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
None of my real life friends

3110
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Have it but some of the OLR listeners

3111
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Have me friended on Facebook and some of them are using it

3112
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So you know here's the thing

3113
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
The DSI Facebook functionality

3114
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Is pretty much the same thing with your cell phone

3115
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Because when I was on my Tahoe trip

3116
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
This weekend for anybody that has me friended on Facebook

3117
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I was uploading pics for my cell phone

3118
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
The whole way like I uploaded

3119
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Some things and we were stopped in this

3120
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
This town I can't even remember what it was called

3121
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It had a hilarious name it was like

3122
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It wasn't pond scum but like pond spring

3123
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It was something really silly

3124
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
We uploaded pictures from there and you know just as we were

3125
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
On the way there and actually there's some pictures from

3126
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Cabo Wabo in there

3127
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
It's the same thing but with your DSI

3128
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
You basically just you know instead of your cell phone

3129
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
It's your DSI but since

3130
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
The DSI has all the picture

3131
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Altering modes on it where you can draw

3132
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And have the borders and all the

3133
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
You know weird distortion pictures

3134
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
You can upload those

3135
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Pictures too which I guess you can't really

3136
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah I know

3137
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Honestly it's the same functionality

3138
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
You'd find in a cell phone which

3139
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
You know whatever okay

3140
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing

3141
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
On my Facebook I guess

3142
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Not something that has me bouncing off the walls

3143
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
But I can see where some people find this cool

3144
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Especially if you don't have a decent camera

3145
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
On your cell phone or you like to

3146
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Edit pictures as somebody

3147
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
On my Facebook loves to do because all the pictures

3148
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
He's posted of himself are all like

3149
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Drawn on and mirrored imaged

3150
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And all just distorted

3151
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
But hey

3152
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Have fun with it that's what DSI is about

3153
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Having fun right? Is there anything else

3154
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
They could really do with Facebook integration and the

3155
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
DSI I mean I'm kind of glad it's just this

3156
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying

3157
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
So and so is now playing Pokemon

3158
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
So and so just stop playing

3159
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Pokemon because I would block

3160
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Those posts from Facebook so fast I mean is there

3161
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
A lot of other integration the only other

3162
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Possibly cool thing I can think of is like an

3163
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Interactive high score board like you see this

3164
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
With like Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games like

3165
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So and so just beat your high score

3166
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Click here to try and beat it

3167
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
You know one thing I do like about

3168
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Facebook is if you find that shit annoying

3169
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
There's always a hide button and you can block

3170
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Any application and all that stuff

3171
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
You know Facebook used to be a lot worse but it got a lot

3172
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Better so

3173
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Anyhow

3174
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Just curious if anyone else thinks

3175
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That there might be something cool they can add to Facebook

3176
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Nope, nope, alright

3177
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
How about fewer

3178
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Invites to

3179
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Sorority girl or whatever the

3180
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Fuck that is I love sorority life

3181
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I quit that so fast

3182
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Did you block it? Yes I did

3183
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I was going to say because I try not to send like

3184
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I try not to let those things go out but sometimes they do

3185
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And I only send gifts to people that I know play regularly

3186
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I blocked it, I blocked

3187
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Farm town, the only thing that I

3188
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Play on there are the retarded quizzes

3189
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
And

3190
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
The

3191
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Pet thing, pet society

3192
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I will admit I play Bejeweled Blitz

3193
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I play sorority life, I'm level 47

3194
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Thank you very much and I play

3195
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Farm town now, my boyfriend got me addicted to

3196
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Farm town which in reality is

3197
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
It really is kind of one of the

3198
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Dumbest fucking games but

3199
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You know what it's something that Jeff really enjoys

3200
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
To do so I play it to kind of have a friendly

3201
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Competition with him although he's so much more addicted than

3202
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I am so

3203
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
But I told him if he likes farm town he really needs to play

3204
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Animal Crossing sometime because I think that would be right up his alley

3205
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Anyhow

3206
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Enough about casual Facebook games

3207
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Let's talk more about more video games

3208
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Dark Sakura

3209
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Well we might have some other

3210
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Video game news

3211
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
How about Braid?

3212
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Braid is actually going to

3213
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
PlayStation Network finally

3214
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
It's supposed to be

3215
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Actually looking for

3216
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
No they don't have a

3217
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Date on it yet

3218
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
But

3219
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
They are saying though that

3220
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Hopefully

3221
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It will be out soon I guess

3222
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
It seems like a little late

3223
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I mean didn't this game come out

3224
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Like a year and a half ago or something

3225
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Maybe it wasn't that long ago but at least a year ago

3226
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Right?

3227
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network

3228
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I mean I guess

3229
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
You know

3230
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Wherever people want to play the game

3231
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Let them

3232
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
The designers make their money however

3233
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
But it just seems like this game's on

3234
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Xbox

3235
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
This game's on PC

3236
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN

3237
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I have no interest in rebuying the game that's for sure

3238
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Yeah but there's people who have PS3s

3239
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
That don't have an Xbox 360

3240
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since

3241
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Or have a PC

3242
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
That they could download the game on

3243
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
But I guess not everybody likes to game on PC

3244
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I would be more interested in this if there was like

3245
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
More levels or something

3246
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
But I just, to be honest

3247
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid

3248
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Without kind of dumbing it up

3249
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool

3250
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Is the storyline

3251
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Which is very finely contained to those episodes

3252
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage

3253
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Or anything like that

3254
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I think it is what it is

3255
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough

3256
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
That's for sure

3257
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Frisbee brings up an interesting point

3258
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Talking about Facebook in our chatroom

3259
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
chat.orangestory.com

3260
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I'm sorry, not Facebook, but the DSi

3261
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Remember when the DS was going to have

3262
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
VoIP at hotspots?

3263
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Whatever happened to that?

3264
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
That's a good question. Remember they demoed that at E3 one year?

3265
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
The Skype type thing on the DS?

3266
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Why did that suddenly go away?

3267
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Anyone know?

3268
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I think they just integrated it into some games

3269
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
To know how they have voice chat

3270
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And like certain games

3271
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that

3272
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You can do voice chat with the DS

3273
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I think that's what it came down to

3274
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Hmm

3275
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
That's what some folks in chat are saying

3276
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
EasyHP in chat says it's called

3277
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Pokemon voice chat

3278
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Probably because the DS isn't that powerful

3279
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Shit, it can't really run a web browser

3280
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
That well without an expansion card

3281
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
It has no real RAM in it

3282
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
It has a few megs of RAM

3283
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
But that's about it

3284
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I would think it would be very tough for it to

3285
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Process that kind of stuff

3286
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I don't know

3287
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I'm very interested to see

3288
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
What Nintendo's next handheld

3289
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Is going to be like

3290
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And I bet we see it in about three years

3291
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'm very curious to see

3292
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Maybe even two

3293
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit

3294
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
It'll be GameCube graphics

3295
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
We'll see

3296
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
It makes sense, it's the progression

3297
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
That's true

3298
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I wouldn't mind a portable type F0 though

3299
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
That's for sure

3300
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And yeah, I agree with Frisbee in chat

3301
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I'll just use Skype

3302
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Alright, a few more stories

3303
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And we're going to get to the mailbag tonight

3304
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Loki

3305
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yes, well unfortunately

3306
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
For Starcraft fans

3307
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
You're going to have to wait a bit longer

3308
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Yes, Starcraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010

3309
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And that makes a lot of people sad

3310
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
And you won't be able to buy the trilogy

3311
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Or at least the first entry in the trilogy

3312
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's still annoying

3313
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
The fact that they got rid of LAN

3314
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
And it's still being sold as a trilogy

3315
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Instead of all three things being part of one game

3316
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Huh, that sounds like an Activision move to me

3317
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I'll get you to buy the game three times

3318
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Well what's also kind of sucky about this

3319
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Is the fact that everything is fucking getting delayed to 2010

3320
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
There's tons of games

3321
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Bioshock 2 got delayed to 2010, right?

3322
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
There's been other games

3323
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It seems like what's left this year?

3324
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Well they want to announce a lot of games

3325
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It's just not already

3326
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Well they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter

3327
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
First off they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines in 2

3328
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It just gets buried under everything that comes out

3329
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2

3330
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Because they don't want to release a game out around the same time

3331
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Because they'll just get ignored

3332
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And

3333
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I don't know, I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out

3334
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
But at the same time

3335
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff

3336
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Like Kane & Lynch 2

3337
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Stuff like that

3338
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year

3339
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Because

3340
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I don't know, they just weren't ready yet

3341
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Hmm

3342
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Alright

3343
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Well hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009

3344
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
You're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet

3345
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
But only if you were one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omega-Thon

3346
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
The game Halo 3 ODST

3347
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Is going to show up in round 3

3348
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omega-Thon

3349
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
The other games

3350
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Mario Kart Wii is round 1's game

3351
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Round 2 is Bookworm Adventures

3352
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game

3353
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
They don't know what game it is yet

3354
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
But speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet

3355
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Like Rock Band Beatles

3356
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Or DJ Hero

3357
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And round 5 will be Connect 4

3358
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
The final round, as always, is a mystery game

3359
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That will probably be either something new

3360
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Or something really old

3361
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So

3362
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Like Epic Pong type of thing

3363
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
They've already done that

3364
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
What were the games they did last year?

3365
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't even remember

3366
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
The Omega-Thon stuff from past

3367
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I think Combat was one year, I remember that

3368
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Combat was one year, Pong was one year

3369
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
They did Halo 3 one year

3370
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Um

3371
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I don't remember what was last year

3372
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I think we were broadcasting

3373
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Versus Excitebike was the last game last year

3374
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
That's right

3375
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I remember now

3376
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
So by the way

3377
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Speaking of Penny Arcade Expo

3378
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Sadly, it looks like no one from OLR is going

3379
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Loki, obviously, is not going to be able to go

3380
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Dark Sakura

3381
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Has not been planning on going

3382
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I was kind of on the fence

3383
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Right now, I'm a real heavy no on PAX

3384
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
If something comes up

3385
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Like a really great opportunity in the next few days

3386
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Um

3387
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Then I'll change my mind

3388
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
But right now, there's just so much other stuff going on

3389
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I just think there's other stuff I can do

3390
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Besides Penny Arcade Expo

3391
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
There's others up there and so forth

3392
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But I'll just have to try again next year

3393
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Someone must pay for me, I'll go

3394
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen

3395
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
And here's the other thing

3396
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I am still aiming for

3397
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And this should be clear

3398
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
The one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year

3399
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Is because I am still definitely

3400
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Set on going with that

3401
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Unless something happens to PAX Boston next year

3402
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Which I know is weird

3403
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Because I'm on the West Coast

3404
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
But I do want to go visit the East Coast

3405
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
With all the appointments and time off

3406
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I've been taking during the pregnancy

3407
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And last week and stuff

3408
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I've just run out of

3409
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Oh, and this week, I've taken the whole week off

3410
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I've run out of my paid time off

3411
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Sure, sure

3412
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
New trips for a few years

3413
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So

3414
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Yeah, that's my plan

3415
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Again, if there's this huge opportunity

3416
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
For OLR, all games that I've heard

3417
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting

3418
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Again this year or anything

3419
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I think Bobby was heading all that up last year

3420
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And I think he's trying to do something

3421
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
For at least his show this year

3422
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
But I don't know if it's going to be as big as last year

3423
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
And you have to remember guys

3424
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
As I think some of us thought might happen

3425
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
E3 did pull some of us away

3426
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
And our money and time

3427
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
That we were able to spend on PAX last year

3428
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
There it is

3429
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Alright, but I am still hoping for PAX Boston

3430
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
We'll see

3431
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
But if you're going to PAX online, don't get me wrong

3432
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
PAX is a fun con

3433
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Just because we're not going

3434
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I don't want people to get the wrong impression

3435
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
It's just economy and so forth

3436
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
The reasons why we're not going

3437
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
But PAX is a fun con

3438
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
If you just want to sit around and geek out

3439
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
That's the best way I could describe PAX

3440
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Just geek out all weekend long

3441
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
It's like an anime convention with a whole lot of games

3442
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Yeah, it's cool

3443
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I do want to go again

3444
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston

3445
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Because then it won't only be like

3446
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
OMG PAX, but OMG

3447
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before

3448
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And I have friends there, so

3449
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Cool

3450
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
What we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our

3451
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Email bag, and I'm sure the mail bag

3452
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Is busting at the seams this week

3453
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Because we haven't been on in a little while

3454
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I don't know, I think it's just average size

3455
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
What are you doing over there?

3456
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
You got a dude standing in his underwear

3457
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
On The Sims, what are you doing?

3458
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It's a bathing suit, he's in a Speedo

3459
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Look, just the one problem

3460
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It looks like tighty whities from back here

3461
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Well, I think that they were based off

3462
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
The same model, but

3463
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Wait, this doesn't answer the question

3464
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
What are you doing

3465
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Designing a naked dude?

3466
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
He's not naked

3467
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Half naked

3468
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in

3469
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You should have seen what I had him in

3470
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Here, here's what I had him in before

3471
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Yes

3472
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
This makes for great radio, it's alright

3473
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I've seen these little short things before

3474
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
That's what he was in before

3475
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
He can stay in those, fine

3476
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
No, I don't care, I just think it's funny

3477
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
That I look over there and then suddenly

3478
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Yes, this is Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock

3479
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
But the problem is that I

3480
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Changed out the default skin

3481
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
So he's like extra buff now

3482
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
And besides that, the underwear is better

3483
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Alright, let's

3484
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Go to the mail bag

3485
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
You can go to orangeonsradio.com if you want to send us some emails

3486
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So, the first email

3487
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Duh duh duh

3488
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I'm trying to go in chronological order

3489
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
But, um, this comes from

3490
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Okay, I'm really not gonna read the explanation

3491
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Of the guy's name

3492
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
So, um, I apologize for fucking up your last show

3493
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I accidentally sent all my

3494
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Contacts that message

3495
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Do not hate me, I hate spam too

3496
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
My email is filled with spam

3497
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
As for the Skype shit, I was

3498
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Using my PSP on a horrible connection

3499
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I am in the market for a computer

3500
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
This is one, isn't it? I remember reading this

3501
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Okay, that's who it is

3502
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Fuck Windows Vista

3503
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Do you know any good operating systems?

3504
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Yes, Linux Mint, it's free

3505
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Windows 7 is gonna be better than Vista

3506
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Linux Mint is better than it all

3507
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Um, next

3508
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And he sent a couple by accident

3509
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So I am just going to read the one

3510
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
That looked like it made the most sense

3511
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Um, hey, O.L.R.

3512
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
All I wanted to say

3513
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
That almost all the game purchases I've made

3514
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I've recently made have either been

3515
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Talked about or recommended on your show

3516
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And I love them all

3517
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose

3518
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
And it is this

3519
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well

3520
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Alive for the

3521
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Now old school gaming

3522
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
And I would like to expand my gaming horizon

3523
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
To include some old school stuff

3524
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
So I was just wondering if you guys had

3525
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
A good starter console for someone like me

3526
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Thanks guys, Mike V

3527
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
13 years old?

3528
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
13 Dude, I think

3529
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
We had a listener that claims to be our youngest

3530
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Listener at 14, I think he just got beat

3531
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Sorry dude

3532
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Just pick up one of those, um

3533
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
You know, used

3534
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I would say, like, if I have the Famicom

3535
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Um, NES

3536
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Systems that are kind of third party now

3537
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
You can pick up, pick up one of those

3538
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Go to, like, one of your youth game shops

3539
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Or even, I was reading

3540
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
There's a lot of people that found pretty good deals

3541
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
At thrift stores and stuff, you can find some old consoles

3542
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I actually found

3543
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Discontinued games at thrift stores, like I found

3544
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase

3545
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And Casey Munchkin

3546
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
For the, uh, Odyssey 2

3547
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Wow

3548
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Or, you know, Dark Tetsuya makes a good point

3549
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Get the Wii

3550
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Or the Virtual Console

3551
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
It's a pretty faithful recreation

3552
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Of the original stuff

3553
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13

3554
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I feel so old because that means I would have been

3555
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
18 when he was born, oh my god

3556
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
But, uh, Super Nintendo

3557
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
If you missed out, I mean

3558
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Honestly, Super Nintendo, I don't think has ever

3559
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Been beaten in terms of great consoles

3560
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Super Nintendo was the best

3561
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Gaming console, purely 100%

3562
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Game console, Super Nintendo

3563
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Was the best gaming console they ever made

3564
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
If you're gonna start anywhere, I say start there

3565
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Actually...

3566
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
If you wanna start where we started, go to Atari 2600

3567
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
But if you wanna just jump to the good shit

3568
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
The Genesis, though, did have better versions

3569
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Of some games, like the copy of Mortal Combat

3570
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Well, Mortal Combat 2

3571
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
And, um, Samurai Shodown

3572
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
That was on Genesis for better

3573
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Super Nintendo did have a few better

3574
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Versions, like, um, Super Street Fighter 2

3575
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I thought was better on Super Nintendo

3576
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Um, the other, and this is

3577
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Of course, just for sampling purposes

3578
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
You know, disclaimer, disclaimer

3579
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try

3580
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Um, GameTap, or

3581
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
You know, Zofar's Domain

3582
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
But, I actually

3583
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
The Wii's gonna be your best bet

3584
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
You know, you can sample the

3585
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world

3586
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Neo Geo, you know

3587
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Go that way

3588
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
That's actually not a bad recommendation

3589
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
If you do wanna go all the way back to some of the

3590
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
2600 games that we grew up on

3591
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Things like Adventure, Kaboom, uh

3592
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Keystone Kingdom, Kangaroo

3593
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Popeye, you know, you wanna go back to the

3594
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Really old school stuff, um, GameTap

3595
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Does actually have a lot of Atari 2600 in their

3596
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Library, I was actually playing, believe it or not

3597
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
A couple weeks ago, I was playing Sword Quest

3598
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Cool, well, another thing too

3599
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Valve

3600
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
The Steam Clan, you know, if you're

3601
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
They don't have a lot of old

3602
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
School stuff, but they have the old PC

3603
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Stuff that we played

3604
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Some of it, some of the old LucasArt stuff

3605
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Oh, yeah, I'll give you that, like, I just downloaded

3606
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Loom for five bucks, I'll give you that

3607
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I still wanna go buy

3608
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
The TurboGrafx version that's 35

3609
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
At a local store, but, hey

3610
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
But, um

3611
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
You know, and if you want a

3612
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
List of actual games

3613
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Um

3614
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Go ahead and, go ahead and

3615
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Sample the different systems, see what you think

3616
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
It would help to know what kind of games you're into

3617
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Like, are you liking the old school RPGs?

3618
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Are you liking the very simple things

3619
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
On the Atari, cause you have the older

3620
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
RPGs, you're gonna wanna go with the SNES

3621
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
These arcade games were very much

3622
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
All about repetition

3623
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Look at some of the greatest video games of all time

3624
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
They came out of the 80s, Pac-Man

3625
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
That board never frickin' changed

3626
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
The whole time

3627
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Until it degraded

3628
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Donkey Kong, basically a loop of the same

3629
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
What, three screens, right?

3630
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Three with the, um, the Pie Factory

3631
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
The Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one

3632
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Yeah, play the one with the Pie Factory

3633
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
You're not really playing Donkey Kong

3634
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Play the Kill Screen

3635
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yeah

3636
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Beat What's-His-Face, Billy What's-His-Face

3637
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Yeah

3638
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
You know what, that's what I'd like to see

3639
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Our young 13 year old listener accomplish

3640
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Make it a life goal to

3641
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Beat some of these scores on these 80s games

3642
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
But if you're into repetition games, go for the

3643
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Old games from the Atari 2600

3644
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I know repetition often sounds like a bad thing

3645
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
But it's not, I mean, Bejeweled is kind of

3646
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
A repetitive game, you know, you realize

3647
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
A game like Bejeweled could've been made on the Atari

3648
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
2600, there's no reason that

3649
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Game could not have been made on the Atari 2600

3650
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Um, seriously, it wouldn't be as pretty, but hey

3651
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
No, it wouldn't be as nice looking, it probably wouldn't have

3652
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Caught on back then, but

3653
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
That's totally a game that I could've seen back in the day

3654
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Okay

3655
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay

3656
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Um,

3657
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Hi all, as per usual, I thought

3658
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
That I'd write in with a few topics

3659
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
First off, I'd like to get some opinions

3660
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
On an ongoing debate that I've been having

3661
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
With a neighbor. You see, my neighbor

3662
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Is a rabid, no, not in the literal sense

3663
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
If not fanatical Beatles fan

3664
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I don't know anyone like that, do I?

3665
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Tease, tease, tease

3666
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I mean, it's to the point that I'm

3667
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Surprised he hasn't already built an

3668
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Altar enshrined to them and started a Beatles

3669
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Cult. The debate specifically

3670
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Centers around whether or not the Beatles

3671
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Right band game should be made or not

3672
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
My neighbor's attitude or position, if you

3673
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Will, is that it shouldn't be made at all

3674
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
To do so would essentially

3675
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Be sacrilege. He believes that the band

3676
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Is something special and not a game

3677
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And he further continually states

3678
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
That you had to be there

3679
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I, I

3680
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I assume this is an older neighbor

3681
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Then, um, I continually remind

3682
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Him that the Beatles are a band, not the

3683
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it

3684
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not

3685
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
The game gets made

3686
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Lies with the band, the copyright

3687
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Owners of their music and

3688
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
EA, and really, he has

3689
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
A very rare say. All he can do is decide

3690
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Whether or not to buy the game. I tell him that

3691
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Even though the band may enjoy

3692
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Uh, enjoy playing music

3693
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Ultimately, they, as well as

3694
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Just about any band out there, have three goals

3695
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Become famous, become rich, and get laid

3696
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I don't think so

3697
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
You need to remember this, too, is that

3698
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And this is something to tell your neighbor, is that

3699
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
At E3, let's not forget

3700
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Paul McCartney

3701
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Ringo Starr

3702
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Yoko Ono

3703
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
To Harrison's wife, sorry, I forget her name

3704
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
They all came out on stage

3705
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
In support of this game

3706
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Yeah, so

3707
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
The end, sorry

3708
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Yeah, tell your neighbor that

3709
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Um, I ask him that if he were in the Beatles

3710
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Would he have turned down buttloads of money

3711
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
That EA was shelling out to make the game

3712
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Every time he tries to say he would have

3713
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I outright call on the bullshit answer

3714
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Well, you know

3715
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
There are people who

3716
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Um

3717
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Who actually

3718
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Are really talented

3719
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Musicians who are

3720
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
In bands for the purpose

3721
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Of enjoying their music

3722
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
That they play

3723
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
These are, now maybe they don't all become

3724
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Famous, maybe they have a small

3725
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Following, but the first reason

3726
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
That I think anyone

3727
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
If anyone has any integrity

3728
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
And wants to get into music

3729
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Is because they love it

3730
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
You know

3731
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Can I read these real quick?

3732
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Marissa Cungusto has a great comment

3733
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent

3734
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
With their image or message

3735
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
But if it creates new fans, cool

3736
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
And yeah, especially when we talk about generation

3737
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And this whole thing, you know

3738
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Certainly the 13 year old who emailed us before

3739
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Wasn't around when the Beatles

3740
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Were big, but you know

3741
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I wasn't around when the Beatles were big

3742
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
But I can appreciate their music through things like this

3743
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
But I like this too

3744
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Geekboy2424 says

3745
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Yoko the neighbor will go crazy

3746
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Good point, leave Yoko out of that story

3747
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Don't say Yoko came out on stage

3748
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
At any rate though

3749
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
I don't think that

3750
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I think it's a generalization to say

3751
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
That people

3752
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Get in a band to be famous

3753
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Rich and get laid

3754
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Seriously, I think that

3755
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
The first thing

3756
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
And this is honestly

3757
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Because I've done things

3758
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
With groups before, like I was in a jazz band

3759
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And I played in a jazz band

3760
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
We didn't get paid for shit

3761
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I mean, they maybe gave us some gas money

3762
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
But we did it because it was something that we loved to do

3763
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
That you know

3764
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You like getting the crowd into it

3765
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Knowing that you're sort of evoking

3766
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
That emotional response

3767
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
And you know, the people that you're performing for

3768
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I think that's a big thing

3769
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
It's a massive adrenaline rush

3770
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
You know, I think that the

3771
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
The people who I think

3772
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
They've had staying power

3773
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
The people that love what they do

3774
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
In the end, that's honestly what I think

3775
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Yeah, usually these bands

3776
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
That are created to get laid

3777
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Are the ones that break up after one album

3778
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Yeah

3779
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Next area here

3780
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
This may be old news to the three of you

3781
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
But for the sake of other listeners

3782
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I thought I'd throw this out there especially

3783
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
For those who own both the 360

3784
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
As well as the PS3

3785
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Apparently if you have an external

3786
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
32 with miscellaneous media on it

3787
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Music Fodios, whatever

3788
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
The HDD will work

3789
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
On both systems

3790
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
This does not mean you can play system specific

3791
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
DLC or downloadable games

3792
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
On the other system, it just means that you can

3793
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Use the other media on both systems

3794
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I discovered that my external hard drive

3795
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Worked on my 360 last week

3796
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Last weekend, shortly after the last show

3797
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Typically I use them on my PS3

3798
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Finally

3799
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
As per usual

3800
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I hear that as per usual

3801
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
It makes me think of Eddie Izzard

3802
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
We've left you a huge fuck off horse

3803
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
As per usual

3804
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Sorry

3805
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I thought I'd end this email with some of my

3806
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Visual recommendations from the video section

3807
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Of the PSN store

3808
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
This week I have three recommendations

3809
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Season 1 of the original Transformer series from the 80s

3810
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Woohoo!

3811
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan

3812
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And centers around two warring clans

3813
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8

3814
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Okay

3815
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
The rest 4, 5, and 6

3816
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
In limbo

3817
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
With these selections, you can't go wrong

3818
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Zarkon ate them

3819
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
As they are all pretty good

3820
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email

3821
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
It's appreciated, this email is brought to you by Florida

3822
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
The Lemp Wengus of America

3823
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Who's that from?

3824
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
MrSpazzinator

3825
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Is that it, or we got more?

3826
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me

3827
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Huh

3828
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
The band that was formed mostly to get laid

3829
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Was poisoned

3830
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
And they were very successful

3831
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
That guy's still getting laid

3832
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Seriously

3833
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Good point

3834
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid

3835
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
This comes

3836
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Okay

3837
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I originally intended this message to be

3838
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
A Rob I miss you

3839
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And wow type of thing

3840
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And then I came to the website to see the

3841
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
OLR's template

3842
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I hope on hiatus

3843
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Say I think so

3844
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things

3845
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Are well with everyone

3846
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Guess I'll have to wait and see

3847
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Oh and Rob, I do miss seeing you and well

3848
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Maybe we can play together again sometime

3849
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Your old pally

3850
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Ghoulie

3851
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Nintinctus

3852
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
99

3853
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Oh I see

3854
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
It's 99 cents without vowels

3855
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Yep

3856
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
You know I have my reasons

3857
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
For leaving wow and

3858
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO

3859
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I'll be in Final Fantasy 14 for sure

3860
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
For sure, no doubt

3861
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
At least when it first comes out

3862
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I'm gonna have to play it for the first month

3863
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Just to see

3864
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Whether it goes beyond that I don't know

3865
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Just you know wow I think I just finally

3866
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
You know you play something for so long

3867
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
You just finally like I just don't have it in me anymore

3868
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Rob with two B's

3869
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Our dear friend who always links me to informative

3870
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Articles

3871
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Linked a couple that were on

3872
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Game politics

3873
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
One of them saying that video games

3874
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Are blamed for low vitamin D

3875
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
In children

3876
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Because they're not going out in the sun enough

3877
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I would suppose so

3878
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure

3879
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I

3880
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Think that really it's more

3881
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
For the high blood pressure I would really think that it's

3882
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
More of the

3883
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Not getting out and getting enough exercise

3884
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Sort of thing

3885
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And also low vitamin D

3886
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Exactly you said kids aren't getting enough sunlight

3887
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things

3888
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And I don't watch Oprah but it was on in the waiting room

3889
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed

3890
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Is that

3891
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Most people

3892
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Especially in America

3893
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
And in big cities

3894
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Are very vitamin D deficient

3895
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Because of sunblock

3896
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I actually

3897
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I'm not allowed to use sunblock because I

3898
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Am very vitamin D deficient myself

3899
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I have to use sunblock

3900
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Or I'll have to take supplements or something

3901
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
If I'm lacking it

3902
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
What they say is that everyone should have

3903
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
15 minutes of

3904
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Unfiltered sunlight

3905
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
15 minutes a day

3906
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I can handle that if I wear a hat

3907
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Well you can put it on your face

3908
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I still use my makeup past sunblock

3909
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
In and on my face

3910
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
But I um

3911
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I can be outside for like

3912
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Intense periods of time

3913
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And even then I only really wear an SPF 15

3914
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Because I'm that

3915
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I was pretty on the dangerous side of low

3916
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I always wear like an SPF 70

3917
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
But that's only when I'm going to be out all day

3918
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Disneyland

3919
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Or Great America

3920
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
It's just dumb not to do that

3921
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Well the way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies

3922
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Is the synthesis is made with vitamin A

3923
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And UV radiation

3924
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Sunlight

3925
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Not

3926
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I'm kidding

3927
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
What are we talking about I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention

3928
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Like breakfast cereal

3929
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
That's why you eat special K because you get lots of vitamins in it remember

3930
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Drink fortified milk

3931
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Eat your Wheaties

3932
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I would love to drink the vitamin D milk

3933
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
You can't by the way supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish

3934
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
What are the vitamins

3935
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Since I'm going to ask

3936
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Totally tangent that you can get too much of

3937
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Like C you can never get enough vitamin C

3938
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Like you know if you get too much you go

3939
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
You peep it out

3940
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones

3941
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Or is there a limit

3942
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I know zinc has a danger

3943
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Your minerals will have a limit

3944
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Iron, zinc and all that

3945
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
With vitamins actually you can have an overdose

3946
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Of niacin but it takes a long time

3947
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
To build up

3948
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Beta carotene turns your skin orange

3949
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I did that when I was 2 true story

3950
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
When I was 2 years old I had my parents I dated in the ER

3951
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
What was your name on the Partridge Family

3952
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Susan Day

3953
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
The Partridge Family

3954
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Come on get happy

3955
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
She ate so many carrots

3956
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Because that's all she ate

3957
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
That she had a build up of beta carotene in her system

3958
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But you know the yellow rice

3959
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
That they passed out internationally

3960
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Is actually beta carotene fortified

3961
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Because of deficiencies in those areas

3962
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I'm just saying

3963
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
There's just certain

3964
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
You know me

3965
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
She's not a doctor

3966
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I'm a big nutrition nerd

3967
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
You know even if I don't even follow my own advice

3968
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
All the time I still know it

3969
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Because I worked at GNC like freaking forever

3970
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
So I had to be able to warn people

3971
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
You know because I'm not one of those idiots

3972
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Who just says oh you can take it you're fine

3973
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Have some ephedra with your hypertension

3974
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
No you won't have a heart attack

3975
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Anyway

3976
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
So to go ahead and back to the rest of the email

3977
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Two back to back articles on game politics

3978
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Link two different studies blaming

3979
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
The health of defects of children on video games

3980
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
We all know how ridiculous that is

3981
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
To put it in perspective

3982
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
To a non-game player

3983
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
The claims are also stating

3984
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
These two things are also caused by video games

3985
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
One playing video games reduces

3986
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Incidence of skin cancer

3987
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
That's back to the sun

3988
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Two playing video games reduces

3989
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries

3990
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Well duh

3991
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
It sounds even worse

3992
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
When you talk about the benefits

3993
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Of video games benefits in quotes

3994
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It points out that the events

3995
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Playing video games and ailments

3996
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Very independently of each other

3997
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Silly pseudo-scientists

3998
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
It's just a bunch of ridiculousness

3999
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Also

4000
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Playing video games gives you

4001
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
A rash

4002
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Kidding. Itchy

4003
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Last email

4004
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Hey O.L.R. Crew

4005
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Hey

4006
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Hey

4007
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
A.C.H.P here

4008
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I got a joke for you

4009
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Was it Kelly? Hey

4010
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
No what do gay horses eat?

4011
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Hey

4012
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
We are the Supreme Court

4013
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Alright read the damn email

4014
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I'll put the mic down I promise

4015
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Okay

4016
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
See you heard it. That was Rob putting down the mic

4017
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
A.C.H.P here

4018
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
First of all I'm glad that

4019
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Where's the duct tape? Let's just tape his hands together

4020
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
First of all I'm glad that my last email

4021
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Was a gold star

4022
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Now I doubt this one

4023
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Will earn similar acclaim

4024
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
But I want to relate to you all briefly

4025
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
A synopsis of the way

4026
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Way off broadway DDR musical I came across

4027
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
On the internet. What?

4028
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
And hopefully it will distribute you all as much as it did me

4029
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Well it got a let from me

4030
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Stop me if you've heard this one

4031
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Long story short there's a guy named

4032
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Moonbeam Funk which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first

4033
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Who carries around

4034
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
A fetus in a jar on his belt

4035
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And starts a dance revolution in the city

4036
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Where dancing is prohibited

4037
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Wasn't that Footloose?

4038
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Anyway

4039
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
He is joined by a small child named

4040
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Small Child

4041
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
And Small Child's

4042
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Prostitute Sister Trampoline Sally

4043
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Moonbeam is about to

4044
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Unleash a dance move called

4045
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
The Flaming Rooster

4046
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
But it is stopped by a policeman who

4047
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Wears kilts

4048
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
The revolution disbands Moonbeam Funk

4049
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Leaves and comes back later to have

4050
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Sex with Trampoline Sally after performing

4051
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
The Flaming Rooster

4052
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Kills her during sex and ends up in a

4053
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Catastrophic level 9 dance off

4054
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
See what they did there?

4055
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Ordered by a judge where he faces off against

4056
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Jacquece who loved Trampoline Sally

4057
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
That had his legs broken by the police

4058
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
However Trampoline Sally's ghost gives

4059
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Jacquece dancer juice

4060
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
And he wins despite having broken legs

4061
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Okay I can't take it

4062
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I picked the mic up

4063
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Moonbeam Funk returns to his home

4064
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Planet using gravity shoes

4065
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
You can't make this stuff up

4066
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
This is somewhere between

4067
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Camp that they know as

4068
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Camp and the most pretentious

4069
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Goddamn modern art bullshit

4070
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I've ever heard of in my life

4071
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Remember they made a DDR movie

4072
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
One time in Japan

4073
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Whatever, stop trying to make a movie

4074
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Out of DDR, they are all stupid

4075
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan

4076
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
No it wasn't

4077
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
There's more

4078
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I remember that, sorry I just remembered how hilarious

4079
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
That movie was

4080
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Now while this may still seem

4081
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Still sound like the best musical ever

4082
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Bullshit

4083
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
The one thing

4084
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
It could do to ruin itself

4085
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
More than it already had it did

4086
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
They didn't use Tack

4087
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
They didn't use B4U

4088
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
They didn't use Oh just name of the money artists

4089
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
They didn't use them

4090
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
No they used DDR, Disney's rave music

4091
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Yes, Zippity Doo Da and Chim Chim Cheree

4092
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
And Night of Fire

4093
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I left out a lot of things but you can check out the article

4094
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
At vjarmy.com

4095
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I'll go ahead and read it

4096
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I'm actually going to put it in the chatroom

4097
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
But it's vjarmy.com

4098
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Slash archive slash 2008

4099
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Slash 12 slash bucket of

4100
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Tears dot PHP

4101
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
And that's all

4102
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Separated by an underscore

4103
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
For details

4104
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
The best word I can think of to describe this play

4105
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Sounds like is gay-tarded

4106
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I mean that's really what it sounds like

4107
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Like you know you don't want to say that's gay

4108
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Because that's offensive, you don't want to say that's retarded

4109
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Because that's actually really offensive too

4110
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
So I'm going to make up a new word

4111
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So when it's a new word it wouldn't be offensive to either group

4112
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I still like my word, but-tard

4113
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
But-tard?

4114
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I've been using that for years

4115
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
So this play sounds completely gay-tarded

4116
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Is what it sounds like

4117
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I can't fathom

4118
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Paying money

4119
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
New York City theater can sometimes be expensive

4120
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Like how much money do they want for this?

4121
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I don't know

4122
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Wow, I mean anybody can do theater

4123
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make

4124
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
That's pretty nasty

4125
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Hopefully this email isn't too long

4126
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
To make it to the show

4127
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Because I think a lot of old fans of DDR

4128
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Will get a laugh

4129
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Or at least a facepalm out of this

4130
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I got both

4131
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Long live DDR EZHP

4132
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
That's for $20 says Rama

4133
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
No thank you

4134
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
That's $20 I could spend on like

4135
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Cocaine or something

4136
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
You know, like

4137
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And I could probably see the same things

4138
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
We did get a couple more emails

4139
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Don't do drugs kids

4140
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
We also did get a couple more emails

4141
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
But one's for Loki and one of them we just got

4142
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
So I'll read it next week

4143
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Winners don't use drugs folks

4144
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Unless you're on steroids

4145
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
And are on the Chinese swim team

4146
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
If you would like to send us an email

4147
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And the folks in chat are pointing out

4148
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
It's way off Broadway

4149
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
As in way way way off Broadway

4150
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Like it's in Staten Island

4151
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
That's how far off Broadway it is

4152
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I don't know if that's true or not

4153
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
A couple more stories for you guys

4154
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
And then your calls on the skype line

4155
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
At 877-GAME-OLR

4156
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Loki

4157
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion

4158
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
That's gonna actually

4159
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Build upon

4160
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Some new modes here

4161
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Wrecking Crew mode

4162
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Which features different challenges

4163
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Including

4164
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I guess different combinations of

4165
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Weapons

4166
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Backpack settings

4167
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
And sub modes

4168
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Basically you just destroy as much crap as possible

4169
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
And then you get put on leaderboards and whatnot

4170
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
They've added some more levels

4171
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
For that

4172
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I guess the 4 pre-order bonus levels

4173
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
That everybody got

4174
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
That are pre-ordered in game

4175
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Now are unlocked for everybody

4176
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Including 10 more levels as well

4177
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And they've added

4178
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Weapon and backpack disabling in multiplayer

4179
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
If you feel like doing that

4180
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
XP multiplayer for matchmaking

4181
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Playlists

4182
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Double XP playlists are now possible

4183
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Or deposits

4184
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
On the mini-map

4185
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
And support for upcoming

4186
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Download content as well

4187
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And then other fixes

4188
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
They've done

4189
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Just some other glitches

4190
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
That they were running into

4191
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Drops in multiplayer

4192
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Certain ties not being recorded

4193
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
In leaderboards and whatnot

4194
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
So overall

4195
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
A pretty nice update

4196
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
But

4197
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I still haven't played this game yet

4198
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
And that makes me really sad

4199
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Is this a game that's very popular?

4200
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Are there a lot of people playing this?

4201
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
This isn't usually the type of game that's up my alley

4202
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
It's kind of popular

4203
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
It's like Saints Row set on Mars

4204
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
But you can blow up everything

4205
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Sounds good to me

4206
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I always like blowing things up

4207
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Saints Row set on Mars

4208
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
That's a really good way of describing it

4209
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Well I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row

4210
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
But it's the same developer

4211
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And it's that open world kind of feel to it

4212
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I think it's a little bit more linear

4213
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
This game

4214
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
But it looks fun

4215
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Interesting

4216
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And of course when I hear Wrecking Crew mode

4217
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew

4218
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Remember that?

4219
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
It was crap

4220
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Woot explosion says Missy in chat

4221
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Absolutely

4222
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Alright let's go on to one more story here tonight

4223
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And then we're going to open up our skypelines at 877-GAME-OLR

4224
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And this story has to do with porn

4225
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
That's right

4226
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan

4227
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
They are going to be bringing on demand

4228
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Blu-ray quality

4229
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
HD adult movies to the Playstation 3

4230
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Woohoo

4231
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Console wars over

4232
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
That's right

4233
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Didn't I say that

4234
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
The system that gets porn first would win?

4235
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
No that was HD DVD

4236
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
And Blu-ray wasn't it?

4237
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I don't remember

4238
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show

4239
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
The problem with that is they adopted both

4240
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Anyway

4241
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
You do have to have a broadband connection

4242
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
An HDMI cable of course if you want the high def

4243
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And of course a Playstation 3

4244
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
You will download the movies for a fee

4245
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,000
You go onto this dmm.tv Blu-ray website

4246
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
And then you can search for titles by

4247
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Actress, keyword, what have you

4248
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
So if you've ever wanted to see

4249
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators

4250
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
There you go, you can watch that on

4251
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Playstation 3 in full

4252
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
High definition, congratulations

4253
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Now what's kind of interesting about that

4254
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
It's kind of bypassed Sony somehow

4255
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
It sounds like you're logging into their website

4256
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
And downloading them to your PS3 or something

4257
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Isn't that what it sounds like to you?

4258
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
This can't be sponsored by Sony

4259
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
This must be using the web browser

4260
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
And some type of backdoor or something

4261
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Pun intended

4262
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
It might be downloading

4263
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Video files to your PS3 or something like that

4264
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Or downloading them to your PC

4265
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
So you can watch them on your PS3

4266
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
I don't know

4267
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there

4268
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Who knows

4269
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Vidpower calls this 1080p-ness

4270
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Ba-dum-bum

4271
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
God I love the listeners

4272
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?

4273
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
At least all the ones I've ever seen

4274
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Of course I always saw the funny ones

4275
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Like Final Fuck X and all that

4276
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Where they did blur it out

4277
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Yeah they're all blurred out

4278
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Unless it's softcore

4279
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
It's just all the Vash P and stuff gets blurred out

4280
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
SSJ100Matt says

4281
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:02,000
All we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples

4282
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
We got a bunch of comedians

4283
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Tonight

4284
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Oh god this is awful I'm reading that article by the way

4285
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
D5T is calling

4286
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Dot fuck apparently

4287
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Instead of dot hack there's a

4288
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Porn called dot fuck

4289
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
That's funny

4290
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Oh my gosh

4291
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
You know what?

4292
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Whatever

4293
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Something I think

4294
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I don't know do I want to go on a tangent?

4295
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Why not? We have plenty of time

4296
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
We're going to be opening up the skype line soon anyway

4297
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Something to remember

4298
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Everybody has sex

4299
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
That's how we get here

4300
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Granted I realize that some people define themselves

4301
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
As asexual

4302
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Which means you don't really

4303
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Care for sex

4304
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
But I'm still assuming that at one point or another

4305
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
You've tried it

4306
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Everybody has sex

4307
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
So what's the big deal at some point

4308
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
I mean if you're the 13 year old listening

4309
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
You should not be having sex yet

4310
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
According to Oprah

4311
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
You probably already are

4312
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
You know what?

4313
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I don't have

4314
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
That same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week

4315
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
For better health

4316
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I don't have a problem admitting

4317
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I was 20 so you know

4318
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
By Oprah I would be a late bloomer

4319
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And I know there's people that wait even longer than that

4320
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I was 30, 35, 40

4321
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
That's fine

4322
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
But I'm saying at some point

4323
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
This is not a spiel about virginity

4324
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
My spiel is about everybody

4325
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Has sex

4326
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Or thinks about having sex

4327
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
So why is porn

4328
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Such a big taboo, big deal thing

4329
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I mean you know

4330
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
They should just get over it and put porn there

4331
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
We're in a country that was founded by Puritans

4332
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Because they have 100 masturbators

4333
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
In that film

4334
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
That's just way too much

4335
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Masturbating

4336
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
And besides

4337
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
You own a PS3

4338
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
If you're interested in this

4339
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Therefore you have access to the internet

4340
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Therefore you have access to U-Porn

4341
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And many other porn alternatives

4342
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
That are free

4343
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Why would you pay for porn

4344
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
When you can get it for free

4345
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Do you have a day on chat that says

4346
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I was 21

4347
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
My cousin is almost 25

4348
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
And she's still a virgin

4349
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Nothing wrong with that, but she probably thinks about it

4350
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I mean she probably still thinks

4351
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
That doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex

4352
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn

4353
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
In fact

4354
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
The other day we were

4355
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
For the hell of it, just for fun

4356
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Shits and giggles I guess

4357
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
We decided to watch the triple x parody of

4358
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Friends

4359
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
And I can tell you it was awful

4360
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
What was it called, fucks?

4361
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
No, frenzy triple x parody

4362
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
It's ridiculous, none of the characters look like

4363
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
The other characters from the show

4364
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And they're really exaggerated

4365
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
As far as how they act

4366
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It's just so ridiculous, but it was funny

4367
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Did somebody at some point

4368
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Look at one of the girls and go

4369
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
How you doin?

4370
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
No, unfortunately no they didn't

4371
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
But the woman's name was Monika instead of Monica

4372
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Cause of course they have to do that

4373
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I love porn parodies so much

4374
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
They're so funny

4375
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I still like the Ali McFeel one

4376
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I liked Beaver and Buttface

4377
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I haven't seen that one

4378
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
They have Office

4379
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Seriously, all the TV shows now

4380
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Are parodies, Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek

4381
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
The best line I've ever heard

4382
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
In a porno was in Beaver and Buttface

4383
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something

4384
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Laughing

4385
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
That's awful

4386
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Laughing

4387
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
And on that note, let's open up the phone lines

4388
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
1877-GAME-OLR

4389
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Our username on skype

4390
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4391
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
There we go, we're off the Do Not Disturb mode now

4392
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Laughing

4393
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
1877-GAME-OLR

4394
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Our username on skype

4395
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
We will take calls here tonight

4396
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
And look, we're already ringing

4397
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4398
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
This is Ronman, I wanna know

4399
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
When did this become Porn Lounge Radio?

4400
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
You know what, it's been a few weeks

4401
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
We have a lot of pent up energy

4402
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
What can we say, what's on your mind tonight?

4403
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Yeah, I can see that

4404
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Before I start

4405
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Loki, just because the porn is free

4406
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Doesn't mean it's that good

4407
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Just so you know

4408
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
You're just not looking hard enough

4409
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I look more to my fair share

4410
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Okay, I look more than anybody else

4411
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
In the chat room, okay?

4412
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Laughing

4413
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But um, the reason why I called

4414
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Is to make a comment about the whole

4415
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Best Buy price matching

4416
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Thingamabobber here

4417
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Yeah, pretty

4418
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
It pretty much did still make their money

4419
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
How so?

4420
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Alright, I used to work for Best Buy

4421
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
And the discounts at the time were great

4422
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
5% above retail core

4423
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
They paid for it

4424
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I bought a cable for my PS2

4425
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
That retailed for $9.99

4426
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I paid $1.72 for it

4427
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Interesting

4428
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I mean

4429
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Even if they take a $5 loss off the games

4430
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
They're still going to make the money back

4431
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Off of the accessories on the games

4432
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Accessories for the consoles

4433
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Accessories for home theater

4434
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
The electronics, everything

4435
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
That's absolutely not true

4436
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I mean, yes, it's true in the long run

4437
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
They're going to cost average that stuff

4438
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Across all the different lines

4439
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
That they carry

4440
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
That's why they can take a loss on games

4441
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
And still be fine because they mark up everything else

4442
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
And it just averages out

4443
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
But if you're looking at strictly games

4444
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I mean, okay, let's say

4445
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
The average Xbox 360 game

4446
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Is $48

4447
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Their cost

4448
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
And they may get it cheaper

4449
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
It's roughly the high 40's though

4450
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Is what they're paying for

4451
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
And yes, there is a markup there

4452
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And yeah, if they drop it down $5

4453
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
They're not really losing a lot of money

4454
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
So, I mean, they could do it

4455
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
And it's definitely possible

4456
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
That the margin on accessories is about 20%

4457
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
On average, if not more than that

4458
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
But, um

4459
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess there is

4460
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
They won't really be losing

4461
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Out a lot

4462
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
But it could get ridiculous

4463
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Especially if they're dropping the prices

4464
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Of used games at GameStop or whatever

4465
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
And they continually do this

4466
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I don't know, I don't see this program being very successful

4467
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I mean, it's going to be successful

4468
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
But not their benefit, I guess

4469
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Well, it depends

4470
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I mean, if they do this

4471
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
They probably won't be having to do their

4472
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Fire sales that they have on games

4473
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Like every 8 or 9 months, give or take

4474
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Hmm

4475
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
I guess we'll see

4476
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Do you really think, though

4477
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
They're going to expand it past this Utah store

4478
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking

4479
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Honestly

4480
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
I don't think so

4481
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
And if they do

4482
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
It probably won't hit New York City

4483
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Case in point, like back in March

4484
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
The blowout sale on anime

4485
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
50% off

4486
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City

4487
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
To see if I can find it

4488
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
None of the stores in the five boroughs

4489
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Were participating

4490
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for

4491
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth

4492
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
That's right, something we sometimes forget

4493
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions

4494
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
That they don't necessarily have to participate

4495
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Mmhmm

4496
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Very interesting

4497
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Alright, well any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Rama

4498
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Um

4499
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
The Screensavers rocked

4500
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
The Off-Broadway DDR musical

4501
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Was way, way off-Broadway

4502
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
It was around the corner from where you saw the Rocky Horror

4503
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Picture show when you came to New York that time

4504
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And according to Japanese porn laws

4505
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
They're not allowed to show that type of stuff

4506
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
But you can still find uncensored

4507
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Stuff

4508
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Interesting, huh? Yep

4509
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Alright, well thank you very much for the call, Rama

4510
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
No problem, take care fellas

4511
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Love you, Jamie

4512
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Bye-bye

4513
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
1877 game OLR

4514
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

4515
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio

4516
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Who's this?

4517
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Hello?

4518
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4519
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Uh, Deathwishing

4520
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Hi, Deathwishing, we can hear the speakers a little bit

4521
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Matt, I want to turn them down, what's on your mind?

4522
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Yeah, sorry

4523
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
It's okay, we'll forgive you this once, what's up?

4524
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Well, thanks for making me not be able to sleep tonight

4525
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
With all the porn talk

4526
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
That's what we do here

4527
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Scarring listeners for life

4528
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Hey, look, we've got like three weeks to make up for it

4529
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I don't know, but did you guys hear about

4530
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
How they're raising prices on like

4531
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

4532
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
And like Britain and stuff, from what I heard

4533
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I haven't heard about this

4534
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus

4535
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I heard about it

4536
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Are they doing it here also? Because I think they did

4537
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
No, it's still 60 bucks

4538
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Because I felt like with the

4539
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I pre-ordered normally collector's editions

4540
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Like 70 bucks and this time it was like 80

4541
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Well, not all collector's editions

4542
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Are 70 dollars either

4543
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Yeah, because I saw like they're raising the price

4544
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Way up and it's just like

4545
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I don't know, kind of not right

4546
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
People care about this, but no one gave a crap about

4547
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
The Wii version of Guitar Hero

4548
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Being 10 dollars more here

4549
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like 40 or 50 dollars

4550
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
More than the regular?

4551
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
The legendary one, the one that came with the cat suit

4552
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Well yeah, but this is all

4553
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Look at the collector's editions

4554
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
For Modern Warfare, I mean that's like 200 bucks

4555
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Yeah, this is true

4556
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
And also

4557
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I also

4558
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I picked up

4559
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
ChromeHounds

4560
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Ah yes

4561
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
The old school met game that dates back to

4562
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
When the 360 first came out

4563
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
And Loki was a big fan of this game

4564
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Everyone should pick it up

4565
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
What do you like about ChromeHounds?

4566
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
It's like

4567
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I've been seeing like

4568
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
There's these ingenious designs people make

4569
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Like of mechs

4570
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Like so far

4571
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
I made one where now I can't like be hit

4572
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Like directly

4573
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Kind of cheap I guess

4574
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Remember when we always talked about how we were gonna have this big blowout

4575
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
ChromeHounds tournament between us and the Bobby Black Wolf show

4576
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
And we were never able to do it

4577
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Because we couldn't get enough people

4578
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Here we are 3 years later, we could have recruited Deathwishing

4579
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
For our team and now just

4580
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
A distant memory

4581
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Before I

4582
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
It's not crap, shut up

4583
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I wanted to get it because it was like

4584
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Armored Core

4585
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether

4586
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
The problem with the game was

4587
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
It was too slow

4588
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Armored Core is very quick

4589
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
And it's a mech fighting game very similar to

4590
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
ChromeHounds, but it's a lot faster

4591
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
It's a lot more faster paced

4592
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
ChromeHounds is just slow

4593
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Slow, slow

4594
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
What type of person did you play?

4595
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I played a four legged mech

4596
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
That's why

4597
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Four legs are slow

4598
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Well I wanted a lot of weapons on there

4599
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
You could have used chicken legs

4600
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
The most important thing to Loki

4601
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Is firepower

4602
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Clearly, I mean I've never even watched him play

4603
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
ChromeHounds, but I could just tell

4604
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Not necessarily

4605
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
It was trying to be more all around

4606
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
That's what I was trying to do

4607
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
You can't be all around, you gotta specialize either

4608
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Close up or far away

4609
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
That's the strategy before you build

4610
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Well, Deathwishing

4611
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

4612
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2

4613
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Please?

4614
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
No, we're broke, I don't even own it myself

4615
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast

4616
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
No, Xbox

4617
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast

4618
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
These days

4619
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
But no online play

4620
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
You kids and your online play

4621
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us

4622
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Redemption codes for the game

4623
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
We will send you the first one we get

4624
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
How's that sound?

4625
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
There you go, have a good one Deathwishing

4626
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Bye bye

4627
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Capcom, if you're listening

4628
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
You can send those to

4629
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Rob Roberts

4630
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Hey, I haven't even reduced those into the calm line

4631
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4632
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Legend of Zaku

4633
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Hey, Legend of Zaku

4634
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Have you checked out the DDR play yet?

4635
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Which one?

4636
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
The one that aired last winter?

4637
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
No, the one with...

4638
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
What the hell is this?

4639
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever

4640
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
That sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit

4641
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
The one with Moonbeam Punk

4642
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly

4643
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Yeah, that's the one I was referring to

4644
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Because that one was actually late last year

4645
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Did you see it?

4646
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Unfortunately, no

4647
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets

4648
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected

4649
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
So

4650
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
I mean, it was shocking

4651
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
To say the least, the fact that it sold out

4652
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
You know, for the first few days

4653
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
It was really hard to get

4654
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Even will call for that matter

4655
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Was Tom Cruise in it or something?

4656
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Like, why did so many people want to see this?

4657
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I don't understand

4658
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I guess it's because of DDR

4659
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
That's the only thing I could pretty much boil down

4660
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
From the fact that it's DDR

4661
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Or people thought it was DDR

4662
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
In a musical

4663
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Which is far-fetched

4664
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
To say the least

4665
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Anyways

4666
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Where was I about to get to?

4667
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
I think I mentioned this earlier

4668
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
But yeah

4669
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5

4670
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
From the looks of it

4671
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
It looks like the

4672
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Activation is in a pissing match

4673
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Between Konami and seeing

4674
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Who can whore out the franchise

4675
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Who can whore out their top franchises

4676
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
The farthest

4677
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?

4678
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Well, many people

4679
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I mean, I'm referring to the fact that

4680
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
There's a lot of hostility towards the fact that

4681
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
They're just doing it

4682
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
For the sake of just milking

4683
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
The franchise even further

4684
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
That's what I've gotten

4685
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
In terms of all the comments that I've read

4686
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
So far regarding this story

4687
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Yeah, but you know

4688
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
It's not like there's a Guitar Hero

4689
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Johnny Cash game coming out

4690
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5

4691
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
And I mean, ever since the third one

4692
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
You would have just random

4693
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Band characters show up in the game

4694
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And I've got to say, you know

4695
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
It doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash

4696
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
I think you hit it on the nail right there

4697
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
After the third one

4698
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
The series pretty much went downhill

4699
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Because by then

4700
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Rock Band came out

4701
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
And the rest was history

4702
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
The fact that you could add as many

4703
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Guest appearances

4704
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Many guest stars

4705
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Famous people in that game

4706
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
And make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise

4707
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Loki asked a good question

4708
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?

4709
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Um, I heard

4710
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I heard of that game

4711
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Is that the one coming out for the DS?

4712
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
No, it's exactly Guitar Hero

4713
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Now it's with more family friendly songs

4714
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
In other words, it's just another excuse to put out

4715
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Another fucking Guitar Hero game

4716
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
There you go, there you go, Loki, see

4717
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Exactly, that's the milking

4718
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Of the franchise

4719
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero main game

4720
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?

4721
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
When you have

4722
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
When you basically have all your clothes

4723
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Strewing around in Hot Topic

4724
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
When you're basically on cereal boxes

4725
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
When it has nothing, you know

4726
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
When you have those little minigames

4727
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
That you find right there

4728
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
You know, inside the cereal boxes

4729
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Right there

4730
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR

4731
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
The way Konami has hoarded out with the toys

4732
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
In both Subway, Burger King

4733
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And to an extent

4734
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
No, milking the franchise is not about merchandising

4735
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Milking the franchise is about having

4736
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Five releases for the damn series in one year

4737
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
That is milking

4738
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
No, I'm sorry, six releases

4739
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
I can see what Zaku is saying though

4740
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games

4741
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
That have the Guitar Hero name on it

4742
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Such as little portable things

4743
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
You see in Hot Topic or whatever

4744
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Well yeah, that sucks too

4745
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
It gets to the point of prevalence

4746
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Where it's just ad nauseam

4747
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Rock band keeps the whole thing

4748
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Consistent on the fact that

4749
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
You hear a diverse set of music

4750
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
In rock band, you don't just hear like

4751
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Nothing but, you don't hear

4752
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
All number one hits

4753
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
All you hear is just like some schmuck band

4754
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
From nowhere getting into rock band

4755
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Versus a lot of

4756
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
A lot of A listers on Guitar Hero

4757
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Mostly A listers

4758
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
You know, it's just, Zaku

4759
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
It's not that I disagree with you

4760
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
That Activision is milking the shit out of their franchise

4761
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I just

4762
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash

4763
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
In the game, that's actually the first thing in a long

4764
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise

4765
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Where I'm like, that's kinda cool

4766
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I'm the devil's advocate, alright

4767
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Johnny Cash's inclusion into Guitar Hero 5

4768
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Would pretty much introduce

4769
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Him to a new generation

4770
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Of fans, that's one way

4771
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
That's one argument

4772
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
That could be made to defend

4773
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
The milking of the franchise

4774
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
But then again, with the Beatles

4775
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
At least it has its own game

4776
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
And it's done within the

4777
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
It's done in a way that actually

4778
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Brings out the

4779
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Culture and the history of the

4780
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Beatles

4781
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
And it actually does a good

4782
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Chronology of the whole

4783
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Band's history

4784
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Through their music

4785
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5

4786
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists

4787
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
So you don't

4788
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Like this because you don't

4789
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Think it's respectful enough

4790
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
They just kinda threw him in there

4791
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Yeah, that's pretty much

4792
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
The case, they just threw him in there to make more

4793
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Cash, no pun intended

4794
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Now I'm following you

4795
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
A little better, I get it

4796
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
You think the milking is coming from the fact

4797
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
That you're just kinda like, let's just

4798
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Reskin, let's just slap

4799
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
A face of a popular rock star

4800
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
On this and put it in our game

4801
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
When somebody like Johnny Cash

4802
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Deserves epic

4803
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Style treatment

4804
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
With Guitar Hero

4805
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Metallica

4806
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
They did it differently

4807
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
It came out to be a good game

4808
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Not only had Metallica's music

4809
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
But it had a whole bunch of other

4810
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Metal bands that were probably

4811
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Personally picked by the band

4812
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
For all we know

4813
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
It's almost the same as

4814
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Beatles Rock Band

4815
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
It wouldn't

4816
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Do any

4817
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Chronology to the band

4818
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
It put it to a level where it's

4819
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Respectful, it has its own game

4820
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
It has the

4821
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Entire catalog right there of Metallica's

4822
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Music, that would be the only

4823
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Exception to the

4824
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
To Activision's milking of the franchise

4825
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
I guess it'll get worse

4826
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Once Van Halen gets their own game

4827
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Obviously with the whole Aerosmith thing

4828
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
It's gonna be very interesting to see

4829
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
What develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into

4830
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
2010, but Zaku, I understand

4831
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time

4832
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
I'll let you go

4833
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Have a great one, okay Zaku?

4834
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Alright, later dude

4835
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
1877 Game OLR, we can probably squeeze in one more phone call

4836
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Oransons Radio is our username on

4837
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Skype, we'll go ahead and take one more

4838
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Call if you want to give us a call

4839
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Do we have any last minute stories tonight?

4840
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I think I forgot to put it on the show roll

4841
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
We have a call coming in

4842
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Hi, you're on Oransons Radio, who's this?

4843
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Hi, this is Fazinator

4844
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Hi Fazinator, what's on your mind tonight?

4845
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Two things

4846
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Unfortunately that email

4847
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
That I sent you

4848
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Was a couple of weeks old

4849
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
And I just wanted to update a couple of things

4850
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Yeah, first and foremost

4851
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
It's probably

4852
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
More directed to Loki

4853
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
But I just wanted to

4854
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Send my condolences

4855
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
To you and your wife over what happened

4856
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Thank you

4857
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Yeah, believe it or not

4858
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
I'm not gonna go into too many

4859
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Details

4860
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Because they're running late right now

4861
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
But I definitely know exactly

4862
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Where you're coming from

4863
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
So I can't totally relate

4864
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
So

4865
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Now

4866
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
As for the second topic

4867
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
I'm kind of

4868
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Surprised you didn't mention it already

4869
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
But

4870
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
I don't know if you guys are into

4871
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Sports games at all

4872
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Or at least the arcade style ones

4873
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
But

4874
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Recently there was an announcement

4875
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
That EA's

4876
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Could be making

4877
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
I'm sorry, did you start

4878
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Something?

4879
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Did we lose him?

4880
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Oh, I'm still

4881
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Here

4882
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Echoing

4883
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Oh, sorry, I'm not following you

4884
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
So what type of games were you asking

4885
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
If we were into? Sports

4886
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Sports games?

4887
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Yeah, recently

4888
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
We announced that they're gonna be making

4889
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
A

4890
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Madden arcade

4891
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Which is

4892
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Could be kind of like

4893
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
A Maddenized

4894
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Version of 3 on 3

4895
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
NHL arcade which came out

4896
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Earlier in the year

4897
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
So, you know, if you like

4898
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Arcade style games

4899
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
You know, sports games

4900
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
They may be up really

4901
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
If not, then

4902
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
But

4903
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Let me explain

4904
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
My kind of thing with sports games

4905
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I've kind of been wanting to try and define

4906
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
This on the show for a long time because

4907
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
The interesting thing is that

4908
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
We're a show that we're not really big on sports games

4909
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
We don't really talk a lot about them and that's kind of our audience

4910
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
But I do enjoy

4911
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Casual sports

4912
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Games, if that makes sense

4913
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?

4914
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I like casual sports games

4915
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
I don't mind them at all

4916
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
I kind of

4917
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Desire those old school sports games

4918
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl

4919
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
The Blades of Steel

4920
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into

4921
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one

4922
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
The ones today, I have a really hard time

4923
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Just kind of pick up and running with

4924
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them

4925
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Like, you know, and hey

4926
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
For the hardcore sports fan

4927
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Cool, you know, more for you

4928
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
They don't play role playing games that I play, probably

4929
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
They play their sports games and that's cool

4930
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
You know, there's a lot for you

4931
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
But like, I actually think

4932
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Probably one good way to define the type of sports game

4933
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
That I can get into is an arcade

4934
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Type of game, insert, quarter, play game

4935
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
You know, it's just very, very easy

4936
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Like NBA Jam, that was one of my

4937
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Like, favorite video games like years ago

4938
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show

4939
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
That I was ever into a sports game at some point

4940
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
But some of them, I can get into

4941
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
But we, yeah, we haven't had

4942
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
A lot in a long, long time

4943
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
So EA's trying to

4944
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Bring out more casual sports gaming, is what you're saying?

4945
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Yeah, basically

4946
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Yeah, it's

4947
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Well, I

4948
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
I don't know if you've ever

4949
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Tried to release a demo on

4950
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Either the 360 or

4951
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
The PlayStation 3

4952
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
But last year they, you know, earlier this year

4953
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
They came out with

4954
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
An arcade style

4955
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Hockey game

4956
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Basically, you think NBA Jam

4957
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
To hockey

4958
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Have you ever played that? Do you know the name of it?

4959
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
It's called

4960
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
NHL, or, you know, 3-on-3

4961
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
NHL Arcade

4962
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
It's basically NBA Jam with hockey

4963
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
I will have to check that out

4964
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
I don't think I ever played it

4965
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kinda like

4966
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Ah, sports game pass, sports game pass

4967
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully

4968
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
I check it out, I mean, Wii Sports

4969
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
And Wii Sports Resort, aren't these kind of

4970
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Casual sports games in a way, too?

4971
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking

4972
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Video game of the past

4973
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
10-15 years

4974
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Oh yeah, yeah

4975
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
I can't say I really know much

4976
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
About the Wii games

4977
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Because I really haven't been following them

4978
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
I don't even

4979
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Know what it's like

4980
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Most of my knowledge

4981
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
About video games are about dollar

4982
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Two systems

4983
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
One less

4984
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Touch

4985
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Before I do, you know, hang up

4986
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Yeah

4987
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I know if it's something

4988
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
The 3 of you would be interested in

4989
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
But there's a free download

4990
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
On the video section

4991
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Of the PlayStation

4992
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
Network store

4993
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
It's a

4994
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
1980s enemy

4995
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Pilot

4996
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Called Zebra Rider

4997
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
I can do

4998
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Free?

4999
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
I don't know if that's going to cut you off

5000
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Oh no, I can do free

5001
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
I always like free things

5002
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
They probably put this up on there to get people to

5003
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Check it out because they're probably going to sell the series

5004
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Yeah, probably

5005
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
I haven't seen it yet

5006
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
But I did download it

5007
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
So I can't really give an opinion

5008
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
All right, well

5009
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Maybe in a future week

5010
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
But for now we're going to let you go

5011
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Thank you so much for your phone call

5012
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
And we're going to wrap up

5013
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Later, buddy

5014
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Casual sports gamer

5015
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
That would be me

5016
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
I can't do these harder to get into

5017
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
With the playbooks and all that stuff

5018
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
The most playbook I could get into was

5019
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Tecmo Bowl

5020
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Run, run 2, pass, and pass 2

5021
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
That's as playbook as I get

5022
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
All right, anyhow

5023
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

5024
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Let's get any last minute stories, Loki

5025
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Yes, this is interesting

5026
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Apparently Konami is relaunching

5027
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
The Drummania and Guitar Freak series

5028
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
With Guitar Freak's Drummania

5029
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
XG

5030
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
It's going to be in HD

5031
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
And it's also adding more fret buttons

5032
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
To the guitar controller

5033
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Now with five fret buttons with adding

5034
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Yellow and purple

5035
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
They're also going to have hold notes

5036
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Or longer notes just like you'd see in

5037
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Other rhythm music games

5038
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
And also

5039
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
The open

5040
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Open strums are actually going to be

5041
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Part of the normal guitar charts

5042
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
And vibration is added when you're wailing

5043
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Drummania

5044
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
They're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom

5045
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal

5046
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
And a second bass pedal

5047
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
As well

5048
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Apparently the new machines

5049
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Are going on testing very soon

5050
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Some of the new songs include

5051
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Hyperjetland

5052
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Kaiser Phoenix

5053
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Blue Planet and Piranha

5054
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
All those of course

5055
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Looks like in-house artists

5056
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
And some of the old songs

5057
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Returning Vampire Killer

5058
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Over the Limit

5059
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Highway Star

5060
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
And some others

5061
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Let's see here

5062
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
They're going to have a new interface

5063
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Also beginner mode

5064
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
And

5065
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
I guess

5066
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
There's also

5067
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Gameplay being shown in the background

5068
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I guess with your note link

5069
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Over the top

5070
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
The machine looks really cool

5071
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
I don't know, but a little too late

5072
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
I think

5073
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
That rumor that the

5074
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Xbox Pro system is going away has a little bit

5075
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
More to back

5076
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
It up, apparently the new

5077
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Arcade packaging that's making

5078
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
It's way out to stores right now

5079
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Seems to be missing the Pro system on

5080
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
There, so it's just the Pro and the

5081
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Arcade and the

5082
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Elite system

5083
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
The rumor is that they're going to be dropping

5084
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
The price of the Elite system to match

5085
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
The Pro system and just get rid of

5086
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
The Pro altogether

5087
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Hmm, probably going to happen soon

5088
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
If it's already on the packaging

5089
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Apparently some very

5090
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
I don't know

5091
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Special people have decided

5092
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
To modify a version

5093
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Of Pong that will

5094
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Kind of inject a little bit of

5095
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Fetish stuff in there

5096
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Including a controller that's made

5097
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Out of a boot that you would slide your hands

5098
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Up and down, and apparently

5099
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
If you miss

5100
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
The ball going across the screen

5101
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
You get whipped

5102
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
And that's

5103
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Thanks to some people in Britain there

5104
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Um

5105
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Let's see

5106
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Ben Heck, the

5107
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Creator of such wonderful

5108
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Portable systems, has a new project

5109
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Now he is blogging about

5110
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Including creating his very own

5111
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Custom pinball machine

5112
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Which he for some reason decided to

5113
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Choose Bill Paxton as the

5114
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Theme of the pinball machine

5115
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
But it is kind of neat if you want to

5116
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Check it out on how you can

5117
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Make your own very

5118
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Unique pinball machine

5119
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
From scratch, so that's kind of neat

5120
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
That is kind of cool

5121
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
There's a game on Commodore 64

5122
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
I used to play back in the day that I loved

5123
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Pinball construction set by ECA

5124
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Which back in the day was

5125
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
What EA turned into

5126
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
You know what I mean?

5127
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Modern Warfare

5128
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
They have their really ridiculous

5129
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Prestige collector's edition

5130
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Well, not to be outdone

5131
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
But Codemasters

5132
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
They're releasing Operation

5133
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Flashpoint Dragon Rising

5134
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
In the UK

5135
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
With a really ridiculous

5136
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Collector's edition as well

5137
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
It will feature a

5138
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Full

5139
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
I guess

5140
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Full size army helmet

5141
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
That's made from metal

5142
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Plus a dog tag

5143
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
And the box is huge

5144
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Apparently the size of a rock band

5145
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Bundle box

5146
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Which makes sense because the helmet is kind of big

5147
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
And then lastly

5148
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Something that kind of pissed people off

5149
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
We were talking about Activision raising prices

5150
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Well apparently

5151
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
And once again this goes to show you

5152
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
That CEOs should never speak

5153
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Ever when it comes to video games

5154
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Apparently CEO Bobby Kotex

5155
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Says that he's

5156
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
He hopes that the price of

5157
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Games will actually go higher

5158
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
It says

5159
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
And Tony, you know if it was left

5160
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
To me, I would raise the prices even further

5161
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Yes, thank you

5162
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Mr. Douchebag

5163
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
And then two last things here

5164
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone

5165
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
Actually, can we back it up a little bit

5166
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
And remind me, we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight

5167
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
We got to do that at some point

5168
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
What was this dude's name?

5169
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Bobby Kotek

5170
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
The FUs of the Week tonight are for you

5171
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
My FU

5172
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Really just goes to the suture in my hand

5173
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
It pretty freaking hurts

5174
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Yeah

5175
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
My FU goes to being sore

5176
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Like I feel like I'm getting so old

5177
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
But my legs are so sore

5178
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday

5179
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Which wasn't really that much

5180
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe

5181
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Logie

5182
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
As I mentioned in part A, most of the nurses that we had

5183
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
While we were in the hospital for a very

5184
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Traumatic and sad event were very nice

5185
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
However, the last nurse that we had

5186
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Was a total idiot

5187
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
And the reason I say this

5188
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
She apparently had her own

5189
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Stillborn baby

5190
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
At full term

5191
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
And so

5192
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
Dying babies were her thing

5193
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
As she puts it

5194
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
So she comes in, basically when they're doing all the pictures

5195
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
And doing the footprints

5196
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
And all the impressions and stuff

5197
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
The nurse beforehand

5198
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
They're treating them, even though the babies are dead

5199
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
They're treating them with respect

5200
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Like actual babies supporting their head

5201
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
And stuff like that

5202
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Well a woman decides she's gonna come in

5203
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
And she says, okay we're gonna start taking pictures

5204
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Oh this is the fun part

5205
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
I'm sorry, what part of dead babies

5206
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Is fun to you, stupid

5207
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
And then she treats them

5208
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
Like, you know, basically dolls

5209
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact

5210
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
You know, that their

5211
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Heads should be supported and all that stuff

5212
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
Because they can't feel pain anymore, she says

5213
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
So thank you

5214
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Nurse Douchebag

5215
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
For being totally insensitive

5216
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
And just an absolute

5217
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Horrible human being

5218
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
But you know what though

5219
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
You know, in the end we do laugh

5220
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
About it because she's

5221
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
It just, how do people like this actually exist

5222
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
They're so stupid

5223
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
See, only you and Nelly

5224
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Can find the humor in something like that, honestly

5225
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week

5226
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Sorry, last minute stories

5227
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
And the last one I have, which you'll probably like

5228
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Mark's obvious saying they are gonna raise

5229
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
The cap of your friends list

5230
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
I actually have a few open

5231
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Slots right now, I think I'm down to like 98

5232
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
And the reason why I, if somebody

5233
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Hasn't shown up on my friends list

5234
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
In like 30 days or more

5235
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I just delete them because I knew they cancelled their

5236
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Xbox, unless it's somebody I know

5237
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
In real life, that's pretty much

5238
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
That's what I've been doing too

5239
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it

5240
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
If you wanna add me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots

5241
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
You're not gonna see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey

5242
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
But there's always something

5243
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
There'll be something I'm playing after

5244
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
I'm sick of the games I'm playing now

5245
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
It's not the way it works

5246
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Alright

5247
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio

5248
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight

5249
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
And supporting independent podcasting

5250
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
You guys are awesome, especially

5251
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Downloading and listening to this entire show

5252
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
After a three week hiatus

5253
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
If you got all the way to the end

5254
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
You rock, thank you so much for listening to us

5255
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
I don't know what else to say

5256
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
We say tell two people you know about the show

5257
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
But honestly, by listening to the whole thing

5258
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
You've already made us feel good

5259
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
And live listeners

5260
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Where would we be without you guys?

5261
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Thank you so much for showing up

5262
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
And especially the fact that we just said at like noon today

5263
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
That we'd be back tonight, because I just didn't know

5264
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
I didn't want to announce anything premature

5265
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
But the fact that so many people showed up

5266
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
We actually had a really good listener count tonight

5267
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting

5268
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
From all games

5269
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
That some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff

5270
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
But just thank you

5271
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
So much

5272
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
DarkSakari, your final thought

5273
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
My final thought is

5274
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud

5275
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Smells sick

5276
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?

5277
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
I am, I just autographed it

5278
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
Awesome, I'll sign it too

5279
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too

5280
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Loki, your final thought

5281
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
My final thought is

5282
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
I don't know, I've

5283
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Hopefully there will be some new video coming up this week

5284
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Of the Grand Theft Auto plane

5285
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Good, because those two videos

5286
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
That are up there now, that's all we shot

5287
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
That one day, and now DarkSakari's

5288
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Afraid to do it again, especially if Victoria

5289
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Is the camera woman, because it'll be boob shots

5290
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
So we might have to fire Victoria

5291
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
And get a new camera lady

5292
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
It was really good that she did it

5293
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
No it is, you know

5294
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
You'll just get more, you'll get a different kalanto

5295
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
We'll figure it out, we're going to keep that

5296
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
YouTube channel alive this time

5297
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
My final thought is, I have a TurboGrafx

5298
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
In my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to

5299
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Steal this, so you may not

5300
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
Be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say

5301
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for this

5302
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Week here on Orange Lounge Radio

5303
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
You know, I pretty much said it all, thanks so much

5304
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
We'll be back here to do it all again

5305
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Next week, so

5306
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Myself, Rob Roberts, she's

5307
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
DarkSakra, he's Loki

5308
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
Thank you guys, we will see you

5309
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Next week

5310
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:54,000
