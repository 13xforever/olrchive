00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, August 9th, 2009, Sony pulls advertising from one of their games.

2
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Details are revealed on Final Fantasy XIV.

3
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:24,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you soon get a new game for the price of a used one?

4
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 9th of 2009.

5
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys.

6
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:46,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're a little broken tonight.

7
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here.

8
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:52,219
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

9
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:10,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

10
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:12,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice hair?

11
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:14,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very pretty.

12
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:15,330
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

13
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki.

14
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:18,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

15
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

16
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well, I guess.

17
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:26,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on.

18
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:30,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?

19
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:31,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

20
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:33,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I could explain everything that happened.

21
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

25
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:14,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so basically, um, last Friday, yeah, uh, last Friday, uh, well actually, let me start, the week before that, um, the week before Friday, um, or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago, uh

26
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:21,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains.

27
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:28,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, during labor you get, or I should say during pregnancy, you get false labor pains.

28
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,000
[SPEAKER_10]: They're called Braxton Hicks contractions.

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, kind of going through the whole contraction cycle.

30
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,102
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not supposed to hurt.

31
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:39,302
[SPEAKER_10]: They're basically, you feel a tightening and then that's it.

32
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:41,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And you get them all throughout the entire pregnancy.

33
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,183
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything was basically looked to be normal.

35
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So we went home.

36
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,220
[SPEAKER_10]: She was basically taking it easy, laying on the couch and stuff like that.

37
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:25,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday, she went into her normal doctor because she had an appointment and she actually had her looked over again.

38
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And once again, everything seemed fine.

39
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:37,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around and she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff, but she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday.

40
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,081
[SPEAKER_10]: So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again to have her...

41
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:45,683
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:11,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So she finally insisted, listen, give me an internal ultrasound, and I want you to make sure everything's correct, because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine.

43
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:18,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So sure enough, they give her an internal ultrasound, and they realize that now, within the time frame of Friday to...

44
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,707
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

45
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:45,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Wednesday, they call me down to the hospital, so I have to go down there.

46
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:52,592
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, she let me know what was going on, and we... They tried, basically, to reverse the process.

47
00:05:52,612 --> 00:06:02,717
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave her drugs to stop contractions, and they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head, to hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into...

48
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:05,998
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:33,539
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:01,662
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:28,255
[SPEAKER_10]: and Deliver the Baby.

52
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:59,945
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they checked her again at about 5 in the morning to see if she was dilated enough, and they saw feet hanging out of her.

53
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're like, well, looks like you're ready to go.

54
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:07,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So they went ahead, delivered the first baby.

55
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:12,929
[SPEAKER_10]: It came really quick, and my boy Michael was delivered first.

56
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,069
[SPEAKER_10]: He had...

57
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Died before he was delivered, basically, probably from all the trauma.

58
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:34,295
[SPEAKER_10]: His sack had been broken for 15 hours, and he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process because he's being contracted on, and he was breached.

59
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Just all that combined together.

60
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,139
[SPEAKER_10]: He died before he got...

61
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,424
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

62
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:09,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Her water basically broke and then Sarah was born right after that.

63
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,216
[SPEAKER_10]: She was born alive.

64
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:11,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything was okay with her.

65
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:17,639
[SPEAKER_10]: But because it's only 21 weeks, she doesn't have any lungs yet.

66
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:23,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, they're oxygenated really well in the womb in case the mother dies or something like that.

67
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,042
[SPEAKER_10]: The babies can survive a little bit.

68
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:29,643
[SPEAKER_10]: But because she has no lungs, she only lived for two hours.

69
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:30,524
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

70
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:33,134
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

71
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,693
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

72
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,047
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:27,862
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

74
00:10:51,704 --> 00:11:19,132
[SPEAKER_10]: but I don't know it's just it's sad and you know wish it hadn't happened but it's not really much you can do that's why I'm here this week because you know everything's kind of getting back to normal and I don't know just gotta go on you know so yeah that's basically everything that happened and we you know took care of all the funeral because they are actually considered you know

75
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:20,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

76
00:11:40,422 --> 00:12:07,867
[SPEAKER_10]: but you know we had them cremated sometime this week I think they're supposed to be doing but we went and took care of all that so we get their ashes back this coming week sometime and you know we got basically they took pictures and everything because I mean you don't have anything to take you know to remember them by basically so they take pictures to do footprints handprints

77
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Measurments, all that stuff.

78
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:18,996
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they were 10 inches long and under a pound each.

79
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,419
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 ounces I think was the largest one.

80
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,741
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

81
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:12:47,552 --> 00:13:06,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki, and kind of given everything, which might come as a surprise to folks who are ready to tune into a video game show, but I admire that you can be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now that you can talk about it very professionally.

83
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:07,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

84
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still kind of upsetting.

85
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm a little upset right now, but it's just like...

86
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,579
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as bad as the first day.

87
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

88
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,520
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just... It was tiring.

89
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,860
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole process was tiring.

90
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:24,201
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just got no sleep for like two days.

91
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And just the emotional rollercoaster.

92
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:32,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the first day you're like, okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know.

93
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:36,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy.

94
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,184
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, okay, well, that sucks.

95
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,745
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know.

96
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:41,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And then...

97
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,147
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's nothing we can do.

98
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:52,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And then one of the nurses comes in, hey, well maybe they can save one of the babies and deliver one and the other one will be saved.

99
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep the other one in or whatever.

100
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,908
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do that because, I mean...

101
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:12,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say, for example, the what-ifs, basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in, even for like three weeks, which would make it a viable pregnancy, even though it's a viable pregnancy, does not mean that they're going to come out normal.

102
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:20,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way, they're going to have developmental, mental issues.

103
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

104
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:29,260
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, this was the easiest way, and thankfully, you know, the whole birthing process took like five minutes.

105
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you gave birth to them, it was just done.

106
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Super quick.

107
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:40,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And everything came out because, you know, if the placentas didn't detach or whatever, they had to go and scrape that out, and just, it's just not fun.

108
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

109
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:49,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, and Brad PodCulture saying that I posted something on LiveJournal.

110
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did.

111
00:14:50,290 --> 00:15:04,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the whole process, especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff, I kept thinking of how I wanted to, I don't know, kind of get everything out.

112
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:06,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the way to do it.

113
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of wrote a letter to them.

114
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:09,342
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

115
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,163
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.

116
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything.

117
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

118
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:47,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the letter obviously was very touching and some folks are saying they got a little teary-eyed reading it.

119
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the next thing to ask, and I apologize for continuing to drag this out, but I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff.

120
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is, what next?

121
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,131
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do next now?

122
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:10,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now, the next... Obviously, we still won't have children.

123
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:18,898
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to try right afterwards because there's a higher risk of preterm labor.

124
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,719
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time.

125
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So, basically, now...

126
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is unfortunate.

127
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:35,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole medical thing is it's like they want you to fail once and then they'll take everything seriously.

128
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just they're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess, or whatever.

129
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:40,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

130
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:52,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment, or she goes in for a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay, just healing and everything.

131
00:16:52,991 --> 00:17:00,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Later on, we'll meet with somebody on the high-risk clinic to see what we need to do.

132
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:04,777
[SPEAKER_10]: She has her own theories of why it happened.

133
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:08,879
[SPEAKER_10]: She thinks that her progesterone level has dropped because she has PCOS.

134
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:15,667
[SPEAKER_10]: which basically her body interprets insulin as testosterone or something like that.

135
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:19,930
[SPEAKER_10]: It throws off her hormone levels and that can also cause preterm labor.

136
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:29,656
[SPEAKER_10]: And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever to keep an eye on that.

137
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:37,141
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing they can do is the cerclage, which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch.

138
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:38,962
[SPEAKER_10]: They couldn't do that this time.

139
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:41,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

140
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:12,871
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know pretty much we'll try again next year at some point but just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months before we can try again you know just to you know be extremely cautious and even then

141
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:18,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully this time what we're going to do is we're going to do one round of Clomid first.

142
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:22,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it, it overstimulates her ovaries.

143
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:23,824
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we got twins.

144
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:31,108
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to try one round of Clomid first and then not try an insemination at all.

145
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And then another round of Clomid so we get one baby and not two.

146
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two.

147
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:39,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

148
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:55,178
[SPEAKER_02]: This question might sound kind of weird, but this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you, and then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this, but I think a lot of people out there when they were reading about this on Twitter and even hearing about it now and seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth, they're kind of wondering, what can I do?

149
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something I can do to help?

150
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything I can do?

151
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any charity?

152
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something I can do to help?

153
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:05,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

154
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:06,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

155
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

156
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:18,545
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to do a charity, I guess March of Dimes is, you know, they research, you know, pregnancy loss or I don't know.

157
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:20,306
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that, I guess.

158
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:20,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

159
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:25,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Nellie talked about getting in a group together for when they do the next March of Dimes walk or whatever.

160
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

161
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:31,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually done that quite a few times and it's a really great charity and I think would be very perfect.

162
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:31,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

163
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:32,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely go in on that.

164
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:33,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

165
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't, I don't know.

166
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:34,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

167
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Do whatever you guys need to do.

168
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:38,936
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the thing too.

169
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,457
[SPEAKER_10]: When we got home, everyone wants to help out.

170
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally understand what's there to do.

171
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:45,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

172
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:46,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like people want to come over.

173
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:48,720
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to bring you food and stuff.

174
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine because at first we did not want to go out of the house.

175
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,402
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom would come over.

176
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:57,123
[SPEAKER_10]: She'd bring us groceries that we needed and stuff like that.

177
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have friends come over and they'd bring food and stuff.

178
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:00,945
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fine.

179
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,926
[SPEAKER_10]: But now we've got a fridge full of food and we're just like...

180
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:05,788
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, well, what do you want us to do?

181
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,369
[SPEAKER_10]: You need us to do something around the house?

182
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:08,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know.

183
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,233
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, I don't know.

184
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,657
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there's nothing really you can do, unfortunately.

185
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:19,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's nice to know that you guys care.

186
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:21,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

187
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:25,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, right now, I can't really think of anything.

188
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,550
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing really we can do, I guess.

189
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:38,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe, you know, if we decide to go the charity route later on, I know we've always been kind of toying with the idea of doing a marathon of some sort on some weekend, so that might be something we'll have to look into for the future.

190
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:39,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a lot of fun.

191
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll see.

192
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:41,492
[SPEAKER_02]: For a good cause.

193
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

194
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,676
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it right now.

195
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,598
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a lot of stuff taken care of, so...

196
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

197
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,113
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I feel so guilty right now.

198
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:56,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I really shouldn't be.

199
00:20:56,113 --> 00:21:00,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I should be glad that I'm kind of over everything.

200
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:05,077
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole week, I mean, I was perfectly fine.

201
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sitting at home.

202
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:15,521
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I wanted to sit at home because I wasn't ready to go back to work, but I was ready to go back to work probably Tuesday.

203
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:19,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Mainly just staying home to keep Nelly company because she's got to be...

204
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:21,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

205
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:44,001
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, I've been editing Grand Theft Auto for, like, the last few days, so I've been just doing the same- Getting back to normal.

206
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:51,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been, yeah, just pretty much getting back to normal, and it's just, you know, I feel so guilty because she's, you know, still upset about stuff, and I just-

207
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:54,147
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

208
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:36,253
[SPEAKER_10]: you're supposed to let it reabsorb back into your body and it's cramping after she gives birth and everything her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions and cramping based on that and you have to give yourself massages in your stomach to force it to cramp so that it will shrink back down and it's just all the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people don't know about but uh

209
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:38,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

210
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's like, I have pictures of them.

211
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:51,846
[SPEAKER_10]: They give you these little layouts, they're little outfits that they basically dress them up in and take pictures and stuff.

212
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,148
[SPEAKER_10]: As morbid as that sounds, but I mean, that's all you got, so...

213
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:09,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have pictures, but it's hard for people to look at, especially the boy, because their skin's still transparent a little bit, and he was really bruised coming out, and he's all red and stuff.

214
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read this from Kitsune, because I think this is really good advice, and we'll try to move on from here.

215
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitsune in chat says, it would probably be worse if you didn't get back to normal.

216
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:21,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you stay in a good spirit, it would help her.

217
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:22,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

218
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:23,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

219
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it is.

220
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:30,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we spent a lot of time talking about that, but it's important.

221
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Brad makes a good point in our chat room again, chat.orangelandryday.com.

222
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,826
[SPEAKER_02]: After listening to OLR for so long, we feel like you guys are kind of like family.

223
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody.

224
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:44,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this.

225
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,108
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because I don't want to go through this again.

226
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

227
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:16,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not very busy, just given that I can't hold the controllers for very long before my hand starts to hurt.

228
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:24,524
[SPEAKER_08]: We got in, we're borrowing a couple pinball tables that we actually got after we did the video.

229
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:31,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Attack from Mars, which I really love, and Medieval Madness, which I love, but I really like Attack from Mars better.

230
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:32,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you got an attack from Mars?

231
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:33,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

232
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a play after the show.

233
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the pinball.

234
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the holograms and all that stuff in it.

235
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:37,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Play after the show.

236
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

237
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:47,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I've been playing a little bit of that off and on, but like I said, my hand starts hurting me real bad, so I can't play for very long.

238
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:51,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm playing Sims 3 just off and on.

239
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:52,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the...

240
00:24:55,003 --> 00:25:05,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Newness has fallen for me, but I go back every so often and now I'm actually going to pick up one of my old families and play them some more now that better hair has come out.

241
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Peggle.

242
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat Peggle, so now I'm playing through it again.

243
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:13,373
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty fun.

244
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Cooking Mama last night on my iPhone.

245
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:20,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Played Light Cycles on my iPhone.

246
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:22,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Played Lost Solitaire on my iPhone.

247
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:24,392
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:56,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I've also, um, been playing some of the little games on Gaia Online, because my account is still there, including Booty Grab, just because I think it's funny.

249
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:03,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where you go into the aquariums, and if you manage to get one that's active, they'll throw gold everywhere, and you grab booty.

250
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I just laugh because I'm grabbing booty.

251
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:07,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

252
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:08,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you shake booty, too?

253
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm five years old that way.

254
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:11,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

255
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:15,292
[SPEAKER_08]: And we picked up a couple of games.

256
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually picked up some Tengen games that were in the regular Nintendo cartridges.

257
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:27,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Gauntlet and I don't think we picked up RBI Baseball because hello, it's RBI Baseball.

258
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:32,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And one other that I can't remember.

259
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And here comes the husband.

260
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:37,062
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the other game?

261
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:38,930
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't?

262
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought you bought the games.

263
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:42,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, we didn't get the games then.

264
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:43,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw them.

265
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: You just saw them.

266
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:45,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he got them.

267
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:48,075
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a daydream where you were going to buy them and leave.

268
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:50,156
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because I went back and I bought movies.

269
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:53,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the Doctor Who movie that just came out.

270
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:54,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it brand new for like $10.

271
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:55,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

272
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I got this movie, which I love, Saved.

273
00:26:58,941 --> 00:26:59,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny.

274
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,922
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie is cracked out.

275
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:01,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got Elf.

276
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:25,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, I normally, Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy the crap out of me until I saw that movie And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny Especially when you smell like beef and cheese But also, for other games, Dan got me this that I haven't opened yet, but I will be This is the game that we are in

277
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you got the 360 version.

278
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the arcade stuff.

279
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,727
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the PS3 version.

280
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:34,508
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the PS3 one.

281
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're in the PS3 one.

282
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The Namco Museum Essentials.

283
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for reminding me, though.

284
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners about this.

285
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a cameo in a video game.

286
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:47,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials.

287
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PlayStation Network title.

288
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:51,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a download title.

289
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get it on... It's a download title on PlayStation Network.

290
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get it online.

291
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,551
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that we're in is the one online.

292
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:58,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a PS3 game with that.

293
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:00,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get one.

294
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:00,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

295
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:02,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about that.

296
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,675
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you... Here's the thing.

297
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:10,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little cameo, but when you start the game, not the demo, but the retail version of the game, you're not going to see it in the demo.

298
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:16,860
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start the retail version of the game, there's a little splash screen that comes up, and it shows like, hey, now you can see this high scoreboard with your friends.

299
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually, on the high scoreboard, it says Sky...

300
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:28,644
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3, and then there's some initials thing on the side too, where OLR is some of the top initials on the high scoreboard.

301
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool and awesome.

302
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:32,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But it still has a lot of good games on it.

303
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I mean that's still a good collection.

304
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they've released.

305
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:43,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online, Galaxian, Pole Position.

306
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:44,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, um...

307
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,272
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as my hand, because my hand is actually still pretty crappy.

308
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:57,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually heard it yesterday holding my friend's son, and she is listening right now.

309
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And sorry, your son killed me.

310
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:09,055
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, I actually ended up hyperextending my middle finger way too far.

311
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:11,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

312
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:13,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it just sounds funny.

313
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:13,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

314
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:16,774
[SPEAKER_08]: The technical term is hyperextension.

315
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:19,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using my middle finger too much.

316
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey.

317
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I was showing you.

318
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:24,518
[SPEAKER_08]: See, look at my finger.

319
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,100
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and the suture is still in my palm.

320
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm actually going to call my doctor and tell him to get it the hell out of my hand.

321
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:36,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's really... I pretty much think that it's what's slowing up my healing.

322
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:37,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Because...

323
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

324
00:29:55,115 --> 00:30:23,309
[SPEAKER_08]: and that looks hot that is just oh my god and it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J and I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different but other than that hey I mean it actually I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up and I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try if I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo

325
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

326
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:25,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

327
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:30,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And I came this close, really tiny close, to playing Beatmania.

328
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:32,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was like, nah, let's just go home.

329
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not good for your hand, though.

330
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:34,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah, really not good for my hand.

331
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:37,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm a right-side scratcher, but nah.

332
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

333
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday.

334
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:41,883
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

335
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:42,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

336
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,044
[SPEAKER_02]: At Tahoe.

337
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:44,445
[SPEAKER_02]: South Lake Tahoe.

338
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:45,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either Harvey's or Harrah's.

339
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:46,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

340
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those two had it.

341
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:51,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I almost played it, but then I was like, dude, it's five key.

342
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:52,552
[SPEAKER_02]: This is old.

343
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:52,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

344
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:57,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and I released a ringtone pack for iPhone owners.

345
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I sent it to you.

346
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I saw it.

347
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:09,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a limited giveaway, just a random giveaway, to give away 10 video game ringtones that I made for iPhone.

348
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:11,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to do it again.

349
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,826
[SPEAKER_08]: This time, instead of doing it on...

350
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:20,704
[SPEAKER_08]: On Twitter, I'm going to do it on Facebook.

351
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:33,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first five people to send me a message to my inbox on Facebook with your email address... Actually, I'll be better than that.

352
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say ten will be able to download the pack.

353
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:40,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ten different ringtones.

354
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

355
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:42,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

356
00:31:43,797 --> 00:32:12,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell everybody what's in them later alright well let's move on with our gaming weeks and Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto yeah I was playing well not so much playing Grand Theft Auto as I was editing Grand Theft Auto still it's almost done actually I think it's probably done now I think I've edited pretty much everything I could possibly edit in it now and I am going to record some stuff for it I finally got my video capture thing for doing HD video and

357
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:18,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Assuming everything works on it, we should be able to record some stuff.

358
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:24,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been having issues with the program that came with it to get it to work.

359
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:26,354
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, it's just crashing randomly.

360
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:31,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, we'll be able to record everything and it will be awesome.

361
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can finally see what the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto.

362
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:36,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's insane now.

363
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the jets fly around at street level.

364
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just kind of crazy because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by.

365
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,297
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, what the hell is going on?

366
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:48,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I didn't really play a whole lot this week.

367
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:51,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought my DS with me to the hospital so I had something to do.

368
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:56,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So I played a little bit of LEGO Battles, which that game's kind of boring.

369
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:59,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's an okay RTS game, but...

370
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:08,356
[SPEAKER_10]: The AI is retarded, and like I would tell, you have these, you can harvest, you know, wood and stuff like that, or it gives you bricks or whatever.

371
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:13,698
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I'm telling them to go chop down these trees, and they just stand there.

372
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:14,578
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, huh?

373
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:15,519
[SPEAKER_10]: You want me to do what?

374
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Or like I say, chop down these trees, and they run the opposite direction.

375
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,780
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just...

376
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely Retarded, so that got really frustrating and boring.

377
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:34,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme, which was fun, and also some Planet Puzzle League, which was pretty fun.

378
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:36,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games are good standby puzzle games.

379
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:41,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me think...

380
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:45,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's pretty much it.

381
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, you know, not a good week for games.

382
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:53,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I was home all week, I was just pretty occupied with just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff.

383
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:58,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And then before that, you know, putting away boxes and cleaning up the house.

384
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have my giant HDTV now in my room to do video capture on, so it'll be awesome.

385
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:07,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

386
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:13,664
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my gaming week, I didn't play a lot of, you know, even the fact that we've been gone a little while, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

387
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:15,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I've still been playing Lost Odyssey.

388
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:20,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I made my way to disc 3 now, which is way past where I was before, so that's pretty cool, and I'm still enjoying that little RPG.

389
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:22,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I play Blackjack for real.

390
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:23,868
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

391
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:48,538
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

392
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I was down to about 20 at one point.

393
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:14,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ah, fuck my life.

394
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be losing all my money.

395
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did okay.

396
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very nerve-wracking.

397
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:21,215
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of pressure, but it was fun.

398
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:21,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I had fun.

399
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:24,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But please gamble responsibly if you're over 21.

400
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:27,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else did I do?

401
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play one new game, but I can't really review it because it's a beta, and it's actually one that I know somebody emailed us on before.

402
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game to check it out.

403
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:44,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Ion Online is the name of the game, and it's from NCSoft, and it's a new MMO that's coming out.

404
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, if I understand right, it's been out in Korea for some time.

405
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:52,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just finally getting its localization over here, so it's finally in beta, and so forth.

406
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:53,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...

407
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:58,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really play the game enough to get a real sense, you know, to review it fairly.

408
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say it's pretty.

409
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely had some things in common with WoW, but I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well.

410
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:11,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's just the way it looked or what have you, but as far as, like, you know, I'm just talking the way the game looks on a purely superficial level.

411
00:36:12,014 --> 00:36:17,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about, like, how the insides of the game work, because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into, such as...

412
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:19,840
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:39,980
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that is Final Fantasy XI.

414
00:36:55,813 --> 00:37:00,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to make you think it's like Final Fantasy XI because it definitely felt a lot more like a WoW or Warhammer did.

415
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's another beta weekend next weekend.

416
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:04,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check it out.

417
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to review a game based on a beta, but I will say the game kept me interested enough to want to play it again next weekend.

418
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I plan to do.

419
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like fun.

420
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:18,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll have to talk to my source, see if I can get you another code.

421
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:19,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be kind of fun.

422
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:21,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I like a good MMO, but you know which one I'm waiting for.

423
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV?

424
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:25,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck no!

425
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

426
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,468
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that line from Chasing Amy?

427
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:33,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, you almost made me laugh.

428
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf, The Bobby Blackwolf Show

429
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,892
[SPEAKER_02]: at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

430
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:02,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we were on, he was making fun of us tonight, calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth.

431
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:03,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Or half the Mark of the Beast.

432
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:04,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, 666.

433
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying it's our holy show.

434
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:07,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a holy show.

435
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy moly.

436
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:09,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

437
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we have a new YouTube up.

438
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out on the channel, www.youtube.com.

439
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are channel Orange Lounge Radio.

440
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just search for OLR.

441
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,251
[SPEAKER_02]: by EA at Comic-Con.

443
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole take a picture with our booth babes thing.

444
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:45,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dumb.

445
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard about this.

446
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:47,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

447
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,877
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually didn't.

448
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some lame brain in the marketing department.

449
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:53,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Their scheme gone way wrong.

450
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get too far into it because it's weeks old.

451
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:15,241
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe and you send it on your Twitter or something like that and you'll get entered in a drawing to win a date on the town with two women and basically the star treatment where you get paparazzi

452
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:18,272
[SPEAKER_10]: or basically a chaperone, a limo, and that kind of stuff.

453
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:24,876
[SPEAKER_10]: But the way that it was phrased, it made it sound like you get two prostitutes that you get to go have sex with on a tent.

454
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:29,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, because the whole thing was around, you know, the seven deadly sins, and what was this, lust?

455
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:30,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that probably the thing?

456
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the whole thing was built around lust, and it made it kind of sound like it was encouraged, like, you know, go harass booth babes and take pictures of them.

457
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:40,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes, from what I understood from their thing.

458
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:41,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think... Or was it supposed to be?

459
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

460
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:43,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have to be.

461
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:43,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

462
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,270
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why you need parameters set, you know?

463
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

464
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to get far into this.

465
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to mention it, but that's okay.

466
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:52,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

467
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:57,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world.

468
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,760
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought outside the box.

469
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,782
[SPEAKER_02]: They came up with a new competition.

470
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a very limiting competition?

471
00:40:02,743 --> 00:40:07,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they kind of close this off to a lot of people by only thinking of the horny straight male?

472
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:08,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did.

473
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:14,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody in marketing fuck this up big time by taking it from idea to fruition?

474
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:14,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

475
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

476
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:16,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where was the quality check on this?

477
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:17,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

478
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And seriously, you gotta think about this.

479
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:20,889
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't do that...

480
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,693
[SPEAKER_10]: At Comic-Con, you do that at Vegas.

481
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:29,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Where you can actually fulfill your contractual obligation to get those guys laid.

482
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:41,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like, the only thing I really didn't like about it is it just reinforces the stereotype that gamers are a bunch of desperate, horny male folks who can't get laid.

483
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

484
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that I think – see, but at the same time, I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write all these rules.

485
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you get on a date with two women.

486
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're women, you can get guys.

487
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:54,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're a gay guy, you can get pretty guys.

488
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:58,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're a lesbian – I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme.

489
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:02,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean just let me cash out the damn prize.

490
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:03,574
[SPEAKER_10]: How about that?

491
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,395
[SPEAKER_10]: You also won –

492
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, you won booty as well.

493
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,860
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, but that's funny.

494
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:11,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

495
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I think they should have done it in Vegas.

496
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And people just need to get over this shit.

497
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:18,732
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a contest.

498
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:20,014
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't like it, don't enter it.

499
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get offended by it, it's a contest.

500
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:23,539
[SPEAKER_10]: My god.

501
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we need to take it seriously?

502
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not offended, but I'm just like, stupid.

503
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:30,145
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stupid.

504
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:31,947
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so, so stupid.

505
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably not what people want us to be saying about their upcoming game, Dante's Inferno.

506
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:37,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid.

507
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:38,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

508
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:39,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about the game itself.

509
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news from the now.

510
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, please, start us off.

511
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:56,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so Sony decided it was an awesome idea to go ahead and add some ads to their game Wipeout HD.

512
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:02,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And these would be little commercials that would play before your races and whatnot.

513
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:13,591
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting though is the ads that they have actually increase the load time from basically like 8 seconds to 19 seconds.

514
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:27,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that doesn't seem like a whole lot, but that's still annoying that you have to wait 19 seconds to get into a race because they want you to watch an ad for a game that you paid for already.

515
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:29,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of annoying.

516
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:36,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, enough people bitched, and so they went ahead and got rid of those ads, or at least that one ad that was that long.

517
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,099
[SPEAKER_10]: But still though, I mean, come on.

518
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding ads after the fact because they want some more money?

519
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:50,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I can understand if you want to do that for like a free version of the game that maybe adds supported, but if I bought this game...

520
00:42:51,758 --> 00:43:03,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to have to wait extra seconds or whatever to play my levels just because you want to make a few extra bucks running a State Farm ad or something like that.

521
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:04,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing that gets me.

522
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The ad had nothing to do.

523
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

524
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:10,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually own Wipeout HD, but I haven't played it in so long.

525
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:11,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally missed this.

526
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But State Farm?

527
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:15,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

528
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:20,665
[SPEAKER_02]: What gamer is going to be sitting there playing Wipeout HD going, Damn, I was just thinking I need life insurance.

529
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:22,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really?

530
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:52,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

531
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:11,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that kind of crap on TV, although I don't like the fact that I pay for it.

532
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:17,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this, because this is very in-your-face, captive audience.

533
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:18,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

534
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you a captive audience to these commercials.

535
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like those ads in the bathroom stall.

536
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:28,510
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that they do it after the fact.

537
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,390
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of devalues your game.

538
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:37,832
[SPEAKER_10]: People might not purchase this game because it has a 20 second load time or you have to watch an ad for State Farm.

539
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:48,494
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, unlike you, I don't get mad at the ads in the bathroom because, again, unlike you, if I don't like the ad, I can always piss on it.

540
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:53,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom that I don't like.

541
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:59,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this thing that they do at my work with these little security posters that they put in the bathroom stall, which I'm glad I haven't had to look.

542
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,300
[SPEAKER_02]: The hell is that?

543
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Brother is watching you poo?

544
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:02,602
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

545
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:06,384
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, don't give out confidential information at work, blah, blah, blah.

546
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:07,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't talk about this, blah, blah.

547
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:10,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Security risk, blah, blah, blah.

548
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:13,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And they look like stupid motivational posters, but not really.

549
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:14,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate that more.

550
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:18,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick?

551
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:20,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, tangents!

552
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,315
[SPEAKER_02]: The dates back to high school.

553
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You love my tangents.

554
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:22,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Admit it.

555
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:23,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

556
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Admit it.

557
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:25,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room, you love my tangents.

558
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:32,030
[SPEAKER_02]: There was once this kid that ran for student government when I was in high school, and I think he was running for like, I don't know, like they...

559
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to, like, a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they called it.

560
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: He would basically be the host of all the pep rallies in the school.

561
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:37,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest loser.

562
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:39,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, biggest loser was what he was running for.

563
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:44,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And his campaign, you know, he put up a bunch of posters and stuff.

564
00:45:44,094 --> 00:45:49,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the men's bathroom, he actually put up posters in the urinals and what have you.

565
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually said, you hold the future in your hands.

566
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember to vote next Friday.

567
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually thought that was kind of creative.

568
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,266
[SPEAKER_08]: That's brilliant, actually.

569
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:03,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

570
00:46:04,168 --> 00:46:09,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And now he works for EA creating failed, you know, advertisements.

571
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:12,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't keep in touch with the assholes from high school except the ones I liked.

572
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what that asshole's doing, but, you know, I just thought that was funny.

573
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,506
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually is pretty funny.

574
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:19,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

575
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:38,464
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, like, you know, the movie Running Man or, you know... Fast and Furious on DVD and Blu-ray or something.

576
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:39,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even necessarily that.

577
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:42,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, okay, wipe out, you know, HD.

578
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:48,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make it... It can be a State Farm ad, but have them, like, insuring, like, these space vehicles or something like that.

579
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,647
[SPEAKER_10]: It still fits in, like, the universe.

580
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:54,588
[SPEAKER_10]: It fits in everything, but it's actually still an ad for State Farm.

581
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:56,049
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, you know...

582
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Demolition Man, Taco Bell,

583
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:20,556
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

584
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:38,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

585
00:47:58,194 --> 00:47:59,155
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is this?

586
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:00,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

587
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: What's to say they're not going to go back and patch other games to suddenly throw in advertising?

588
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

589
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just low.

590
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:17,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then when the game is reviewed and all the previews go out, this has to be breaking a law of some sort.

591
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:17,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how.

592
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:18,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be.

593
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just shady.

594
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You're raping my eyes!

595
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,113
[SPEAKER_02]: You are raping my eyes!

596
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am unwilling...

597
00:48:25,848 --> 00:48:26,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

598
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:27,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Unconsensual.

599
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is unconsensual eye-fucking.

600
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is.

601
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Sony.

602
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:35,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

603
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:36,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor State Farm.

604
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know they probably just buy out of some company.

605
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

606
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:42,760
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even State Farm's fault.

607
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't blame State Farm for this.

608
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, State Farm is there.

609
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:50,865
[SPEAKER_02]: State Farm is everywhere, apparently, even in Wipeout HD.

610
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:51,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

611
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, at least it's not another fucking Axe commercial or something like that.

612
00:48:59,159 --> 00:48:59,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

613
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, comments from chat, chat.orange.com.

614
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:07,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Gangru says, if ads are in my game, it needs to be either flavor or cheaper.

615
00:49:07,803 --> 00:49:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, TigerClaw says, I think the ads came after the Fury add-on pack for Wipeout HD and continues to say, maybe if you buy the regular Wipeout HD without the add-ons, it doesn't have the ads.

616
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:18,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I never noticed them.

617
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:23,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed the ads, but I didn't play it in the last three weeks.

618
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:26,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, and just to be clear, the ads are gone now, right?

619
00:49:26,892 --> 00:49:27,773
[SPEAKER_02]: They were patched out, right?

620
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:28,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they're,

621
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're not patched out, but they're working with the company now.

622
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:39,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that ad is gone, but they're working with them now so that basically the ads are shorter and they don't interfere with the load time or something like that is what they're saying.

623
00:49:40,282 --> 00:49:41,703
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not saying that the ads are going away.

624
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:47,707
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just saying, oh, we're working with this company because we fucked up or they fucked up by making the ad too long or something.

625
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:56,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically they're saying, hey, it's not that we're getting rid of the advertising, we're just trying to find a way to keep it into the 8 second window, basically.

626
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know, it's shady.

627
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:06,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I expect those types of ads on, let's say, a Pogo.com type of website.

628
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:09,605
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never visited this website, it's just a ton of casual games.

629
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all middle-aged crisis women games, and I love them.

630
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:16,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Boggle and Scrabble and all this stuff on there.

631
00:50:16,987 --> 00:50:19,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no problem with them doing a free version of this game.

632
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:26,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they're all free, and you expect that you're going to have to sit there and look at an ad for Metamucil in between games or what have you, but...

633
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:29,773
[SPEAKER_02]: or Special K. That's the big one.

634
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Special K is delicious.

635
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Special K is like food of the Lifetime Network.

636
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very pissed off that they really focused the demographic to chicks.

637
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck games for a minute.

638
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:48,028
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more important than any other revelation that's come out about ads and games.

639
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:49,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that whole thing for a minute.

640
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:51,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki loves...

641
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Total, I used to eat that when I was 5

642
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:22,600
[SPEAKER_10]: or like, I don't even know if you remember this, Product 19.

643
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I remember that.

644
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's almost like Special K. Because if you even say mini-wheats or old people food, I'm going to come over there and beat you.

645
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:31,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Mini-wheats are freaking amazing.

646
00:51:31,706 --> 00:51:32,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Crispix, too.

647
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:34,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Crispix is pretty damn good.

648
00:51:34,267 --> 00:51:38,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, I'm the person with all brands sitting up there in my cabinet.

649
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:39,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

650
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,621
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that could be hit or miss.

651
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:01,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I am amazed at the vast of knowledge some of our listeners have of the show.

652
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:05,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alpha Cananogram in chat says, to quote from guys on a show.

653
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:08,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge Radio when it was a station.

654
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:10,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like on Thursday nights or something.

655
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that with my old roommate, Xfer.

656
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been off the air for like four years.

657
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:19,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But says this quote, Sky thinks Special K's secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice.

658
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:21,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say that?

659
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:22,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You made that up.

660
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not say that.

661
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:24,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I really?

662
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:33,185
[SPEAKER_10]: From experience, I can tell you that I don't think Pussy Juice is in Special K. Well, how would that attract women, too?

663
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, lesbians, maybe.

664
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:37,627
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not bad.

665
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:47,752
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the thing is, the only thing I don't like about Special K, because first off, they don't have mazes and little stupid dumb puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles and, you know.

666
00:52:48,667 --> 00:53:16,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain Crunch does but they have like you know all this breast health awareness crap and like you can lose you know four you know inches off your waistline or something like that if you do the special K diet and crap I'm like I'm sorry I eat your cereal and I lose no weight whatsoever but then again they want you to like make nuggets don't help well yes but they also want you to like have it with skim milk that's like disgusting you know I like skim milk cardboard or something I don't know

667
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:26,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to get off topic, but we had to have the Special K chat on this show because I think we've never had it on the main show and it's been like seven years.

668
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:29,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long.

669
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,041
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.

670
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:32,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's...

671
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:33,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

672
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I go back to Captain Crunch every now and then, but Captain Crunch is sharp.

673
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:41,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's seriously like... For the record, I hate Special K. For the record, I hate Captain Crunch.

674
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disgusting.

675
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't stand Special K. I love Special K. I like fiber cereals.

676
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:49,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I grew up on Grape Nuts and Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran.

677
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate marshmallows.

678
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a smooth bowel movement every day.

679
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

680
00:53:54,865 --> 00:54:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: The only kid cereal that I ever liked was Frosted Mini Wheats, and I still to this day, it's my favorite cereal in the universe, and Rice Krispies.

681
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me.

682
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll eat that stuff dry, out of the box.

683
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, I hate Cheerios.

684
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:13,556
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else is good, too, that I can't stop eating once I get some?

685
00:54:14,037 --> 00:54:15,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Grahams.

686
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:16,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

687
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still get Golden Grahams.

688
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had some the other day.

689
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, they're awesome.

690
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

691
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:24,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny you say I can actually eat it dry.

692
00:54:24,623 --> 00:54:25,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I only eat cereal dry.

693
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:27,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate milk that much.

694
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:28,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat cereal with milk.

695
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:30,587
[SPEAKER_10]: See, Special K, that would taste awful dry.

696
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand Special K. It won't...

697
00:54:34,894 --> 00:54:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me.

698
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:39,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that disgusting.

699
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:40,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross.

700
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:40,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

701
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:41,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

702
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:45,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so the ads in games.

703
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:46,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That idea.

704
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you run an ad for Special K, then Loki won't mind anymore.

705
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:50,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

706
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:51,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

707
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some more news and talking about Netflix a little bit.

708
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:58,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And Netflix, of course, streaming has been huge on the Xbox 360.

709
00:54:58,144 --> 00:54:58,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

710
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumored once again, and it seems like this rumor comes up every few months or so ever since Netflix set the Xbox 360, but apparently an industry executive familiar with Netflix plans has talked to the website Multichannel that the company's streaming service is soon coming to the iPhone or iPod Touch as well as the Wii.

711
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:24,379
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that doesn't mean you're going to get to watch Netflix on 3G.

712
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:26,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be way too much of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth.

713
00:55:27,381 --> 00:55:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know...

714
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy oh boy, AT&T, I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T because they are just like, they're putting the clamp down on everything.

715
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other big news that came up, even though it's not game related, but the whole thing like Google Apps are getting shut down by assholes, twats, and turds.

716
00:55:49,943 --> 00:55:50,423
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

717
00:55:51,304 --> 00:56:03,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So asshole twat and turd isn't going to let you use their 3G network because it's way too much of their precious bandwidth so you'd only be able to use Netflix over the streaming over Wi-Fi.

718
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense.

719
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:08,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be a horrible quality over 3G anyway.

720
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, YouTube takes forever as it is.

721
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:15,136
[SPEAKER_02]: But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've been hinting at that for a long, long, long, long time.

722
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:16,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But

723
00:56:18,152 --> 00:56:19,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about Sony PlayStation 3.

724
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting because Apple, if I'm not mistaking, kind of has their own thing.

725
00:56:27,703 --> 00:56:37,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't see they don't have a Netflix type service per se, but they do have the movie rental that you can do on on the Apple and you can play that on your phone.

726
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:45,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would see something like this getting shot down just the same way the Google Latitude app got shot down.

727
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:51,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Voice, that was the big one that got shot down by Apple as well, by Asselsturch and Twatts.

728
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:56,265
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other phones out there that do, you know.

729
00:56:56,805 --> 00:57:02,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but realize whether you like it or not, the iPhone is the one everybody seems to have right now.

730
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the most popular phone.

731
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what's second behind it is the BlackBerry iPhone.

732
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:11,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, yeah, probably BlackBerry, which is also an AT&T name, too.

733
00:57:13,314 --> 00:57:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Or AT&T brand, too.

734
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:17,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to read some comments in the chat room.

735
00:57:17,636 --> 00:57:20,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Decipher says, Atrocious telephones and technology.

736
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says, All twats talking.

737
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:24,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

738
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And Misty says it's a fucking sheep phone.

739
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,282
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just calling... Hey, I love my iPhone.

740
00:57:30,302 --> 00:57:31,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, bad, bad, bad.

741
00:57:33,223 --> 00:57:36,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I'm just saying that it actually is...

742
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:38,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good.

743
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

744
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,713
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really good technology.

745
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:44,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever.

746
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:44,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah.

747
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Tiger Klaus says, let's not forget there is an All Games app on the iPhone and it lets you let OLR on it.

748
00:57:50,808 --> 00:57:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I downloaded it too.

749
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that come out in the past couple weeks?

750
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it did.

751
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't checked out the All Games app, search for that.

752
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:59,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it lets you, it's free, and you can tune in to All Games Radio anywhere.

753
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

754
00:58:00,152 --> 00:58:03,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And plug in your ears and plug in the headphones and go.

755
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I always plug in my ears.

756
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:06,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug it in a car transmitter and go.

757
00:58:06,055 --> 00:58:06,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, Mr. Potato Head.

758
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:07,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Shush.

759
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there you go, Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone.

760
00:58:13,508 --> 00:58:23,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's inevitable, it's probably going to come to, probably, if AT&T will let it, it'll come to the iPhone and Apple also.

761
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:25,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know about the Wii, I don't know.

762
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:28,139
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kind of like, I don't know.

763
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,441
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix.

764
00:58:31,462 --> 00:58:31,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do it.

765
00:58:32,504 --> 00:58:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you could do it.

766
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:37,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan.

767
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:37,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

768
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:39,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the Netflix channel.

769
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:40,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you really?

770
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, though, do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix?

771
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, there is some stuff I watch.

772
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:46,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly TV shows.

773
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:48,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually canceled ours.

774
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

775
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:08,189
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still behind on a few things.

776
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:36,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's move on.

777
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year, but nothing now.

778
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:41,540
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

779
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:52,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, something that's actually really good for people who have an Xbox in the United States is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support.

780
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:59,541
[SPEAKER_08]: The option is you can buy your Xbox points using PayPal.

781
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:06,026
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com.

782
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:10,309
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts.

783
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:17,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, but it really only works through the website, not through the console.

784
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's right now only in America.

785
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:23,199
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, any way you want to give us your money, we'll take it.

786
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's convenient.

787
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

788
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.

789
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking about Microsoft.

790
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:53,982
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to give out my information.

791
01:00:54,102 --> 01:00:57,303
[SPEAKER_02]: My bank protects me from any violation of information, so I'm fine.

792
01:00:57,864 --> 01:00:59,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not really worried about that.

793
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth, and I haven't been.

794
01:01:03,286 --> 01:01:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade, I was buying everything, and it was very tempting.

795
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:08,808
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've gotten a lot better at that.

796
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:11,835
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

797
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:35,986
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be able to use your credit card, but it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal.

798
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:38,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way.

799
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really just giving people another option.

800
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:43,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't see any harm in it.

801
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:47,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account.

802
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:51,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can use it to track your purchases that way too.

803
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:52,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So, why not?

804
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:58,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff.

805
01:01:58,234 --> 01:01:59,674
[SPEAKER_10]: They have ripped me off in the past.

806
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:02,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there was an error one time where I paid for something that was...

807
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:04,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

808
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, go to the store and go buy a card.

809
01:02:28,062 --> 01:02:36,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, if you want the points that badly, just go to the store, pay the tax on it, and just go buy a card.

810
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:38,770
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and just redeem it online.

811
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:42,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards, right?

812
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:49,459
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get a prepaid Visa card, but there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap because if you don't have a credit card...

813
01:02:50,836 --> 01:02:53,617
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna have to tie your bank account to PayPal.

814
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:57,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways.

815
01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:01,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's been a while since I did that.

816
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:08,383
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just easier if you're under 18, just go buy a card at the store.

817
01:03:08,463 --> 01:03:14,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, you can go to your favorite game store or whatever, trade in some games or trade in crap, and then get...

818
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:15,846
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

819
01:03:27,831 --> 01:03:28,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Good that they're supporting it.

820
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,112
[SPEAKER_10]: They give someone another option, but I don't think it's a good option.

821
01:03:31,453 --> 01:03:32,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.

822
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:34,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess the more ways the better.

823
01:03:34,194 --> 01:03:40,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever, but I don't know.

824
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:42,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something I really plan on using.

825
01:03:42,377 --> 01:03:48,500
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, even with that, though, I mean, yeah, you can build up money from PayPal, but it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account.

826
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,021
[SPEAKER_10]: One click of a button, it takes like two days.

827
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:50,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Done.

828
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:55,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, so that's kind of a lame excuse if that's, oh, I got all this money built up in PayPal.

829
01:03:56,617 --> 01:03:59,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too, you know?

830
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:08,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they would love it for you just to spend that PayPal money on stuff that their company is selling or transactions through them because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction.

831
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And are they going to be charging you tax?

832
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:11,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that would be something interesting too.

833
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:12,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

834
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it depends on what state you live in.

835
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:14,992
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

836
01:04:15,012 --> 01:04:18,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

837
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:18,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

838
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:27,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So other interesting stuff that Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got.

839
01:04:27,848 --> 01:04:30,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test.

840
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:32,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't imagine this working full-time.

841
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:35,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But their new thing is, why buy used when you can buy new?

842
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:42,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Best Buy will now match prices of new video games at used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy.

843
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, you go to GameStop, you say, okay...

844
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:49,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I see this used game for $5 cheaper.

845
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:58,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy, get a new game, tell them to call this GameStop to check the price, and done.

846
01:04:58,244 --> 01:04:59,945
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the new game for the price of the used game.

847
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:05,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome plan, but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off of this because they're going to be losing money left and right.

848
01:05:06,272 --> 01:05:13,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if somebody at a GameStop or something like that is a real dick and says, Oh yeah, we're charging $20 for that game.

849
01:05:14,742 --> 01:05:18,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Redeem, get a bunch of the game and go sell it back to GameStop for more than $20.

850
01:05:20,031 --> 01:05:20,331
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

851
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:45,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you kind of said it yourself, Loki.

852
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:49,986
[SPEAKER_02]: The price of a used game, a GameStop, is typically only $5 under that of a new game.

853
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:54,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off on all their new games.

854
01:05:54,172 --> 01:05:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that...

855
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,229
[SPEAKER_02]: is that really that bad of a loss?

856
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can create loyalty, because that's a big, big thing, is that I think a lot of people kind of build up loyalty to one certain place to buy their games, right?

857
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:08,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the other thing, too, about that.

858
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:25,255
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, retailers like this, basically, they can sell a game at cost, and it's still beneficial for them if they're able to sell enough units, because they get back-end rebates, meaning if they buy X amount of pieces or whatever, a company like, say, Activision or EA or whatever will give them

859
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:26,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

860
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:50,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically the same price.

861
01:06:50,352 --> 01:06:56,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the question is, are they going to also count the discounts that you get with your GameStop card?

862
01:06:56,757 --> 01:06:59,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be able to get the extra 10% off?

863
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

864
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say just assume no on that.

865
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:07,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And store credit, because Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now.

866
01:07:07,226 --> 01:07:09,068
[SPEAKER_10]: But isn't that something else they're testing?

867
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the kiosks are testing that.

868
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,130
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now they're not.

869
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, so...

870
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:15,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

871
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

872
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:49,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

873
01:08:10,364 --> 01:08:19,049
[SPEAKER_10]: If, on top of all that, if you're cautious, then yeah, I don't see why this would be a bad deal if you're just interested in getting a used game and you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off.

874
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta read this comment from chat because it's really funny.

875
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:29,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture says they play video games in Utah, to which Rama follows up with, Brad, yep, they play Super Mormon Brothers 2.

876
01:08:30,616 --> 01:08:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure our Utah listeners appreciate that one.

877
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:34,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

878
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:36,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like that idea for a game.

879
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mormon Brothers 2.

880
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:39,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely that's a ROM hack somewhere.

881
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:43,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely that is a ROM hack somewhere.

882
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:49,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, I like cheaper games no matter how it happens, but let's not count out what GameStop might be doing.

883
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:54,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily in retaliation, but certainly all the companies are trying to think of ways to one-up each other.

884
01:08:54,594 --> 01:08:58,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And GameStop is apparently looking for a new rewards program.

885
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:00,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, the way it is right now is that they have what?

886
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:04,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You get their little card, you get the 10% discount or whatever.

887
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:04,578
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% more on trades, 10%...

888
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: More off of Accessory.

889
01:09:07,639 --> 01:09:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You get some magazine I've never read in my life.

890
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:10,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Informer is actually not bad.

891
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:11,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Informer is a good magazine.

892
01:09:11,402 --> 01:09:15,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's not a bad magazine and the subscription price is cheaper than whatever.

893
01:09:16,425 --> 01:09:17,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I couldn't tell you.

894
01:09:17,546 --> 01:09:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine actually was a couple weeks ago.

895
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:24,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually picked up a Barnes & Noble.

896
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a magazine out of the UK.

897
01:09:26,492 --> 01:09:27,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Gamer, I think it's called.

898
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:28,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's good.

899
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:29,755
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an issue of Retro Gamer.

900
01:09:29,835 --> 01:09:30,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pretty good one.

901
01:09:30,996 --> 01:09:35,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I mean, thanks to the internet, I don't really read video game magazines.

902
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:35,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's...

903
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:52,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason I buy their card each year, one, because the magazine subscription gives me something to do, like to stare off in the space at work sometimes, and because the extra trade-in value that you get, it pays for the card within a few uses for me.

904
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only reason I do it.

905
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:56,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it's a cost advantage for myself.

906
01:09:58,096 --> 01:09:59,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I could probably...

907
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:02,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Sell my games on eBay or whatever.

908
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,945
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I don't want to go through the fucking hassle to do that.

909
01:10:05,186 --> 01:10:07,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's my own choice.

910
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

911
01:10:09,594 --> 01:10:11,495
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, apparently here's two versions.

912
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:14,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They're testing some different rewards versions.

913
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:15,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

914
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:15,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

915
01:10:15,898 --> 01:10:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did this come from?

916
01:10:16,559 --> 01:10:17,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a survey.

917
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:18,540
[SPEAKER_02]: A survey, I see.

918
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,322
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in.

919
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:26,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And here was one, take your game to the next level with GameStop Rewards.

920
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:32,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently if you sign up for this new free program, you would sign up with your email address and so forth.

921
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:39,334
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do one purchase or trade in a year, you would get a birthday surprise, meaning discounts on your birthday.

922
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:41,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas.

923
01:10:42,335 --> 01:10:46,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Level two would be make any combination of five purchases or trades per year.

924
01:10:47,137 --> 01:10:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: You would get 20% bonus trade-in credit because you're a power trader, I guess.

925
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get early access to purchase collector's editions of games.

926
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,041
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

927
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:59,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release.

928
01:11:00,463 --> 01:11:00,983
[SPEAKER_10]: That's retarded.

929
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:04,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know what the early access to collector's editions is?

930
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:05,985
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the pre-order before everybody else.

931
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:20,091
[SPEAKER_02]: and then level 3 is 10 purchases or trade-ins a year to get 25% bonus on trade-ins, guaranteed access to exclusive in-game accessories, and so forth.

932
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:34,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, and then there's another one that is just like a two-level thing, where if you do one purchase or trade-in a year, you get the birthday surprise, but if you do 20 purchases or trade-ins a year, you get the subscription to Game Informer, you get the power trades, you get...

933
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:37,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Guaranteed in-stock new games or free shipping.

934
01:11:38,055 --> 01:11:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting, too.

935
01:11:39,015 --> 01:11:41,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're out of your game, they'll ship to your house for free.

936
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:41,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.

937
01:11:42,116 --> 01:11:50,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Early access to purchase collector's editions of games, $5 shipping of new titles shipped on day of release, and guaranteed access to exclusive in-game accessories, etc., etc.

938
01:11:51,378 --> 01:11:54,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, more incentive programs, which I'm sure makes some people excited.

939
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:57,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's about building customer loyalty is huge.

940
01:11:58,179 --> 01:11:58,439
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

941
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:03,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of making 20 trades because...

942
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:18,913
[SPEAKER_10]: you know once again it's cheap enough to where $25 that will pay for itself especially with the extra 10% on top of all that probably in one use so why not why wouldn't you do that especially if you're buying games on a regular basis

943
01:12:19,349 --> 01:12:22,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why I've never signed up for their program and why I don't pre-order games?

944
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still stand by this.

945
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:40,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pre-order games because I find that when the games are released, because the companies are trying to one-up each other, if I pre-order the game at GameStop or whatever, put $5 down, it's going to come out and Best Buy is going to have a sale where you get a $10 gift card if you buy the game or something.

946
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:46,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't like to pre-order games because I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see what the competition is the day of release.

947
01:12:47,136 --> 01:13:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: and plus sometimes you see these really interesting things where GameStop gets one little incentive, GameCrazy gets another Best Buy gets another, you know like all the companies get their own little free weapon or whatever and I want to pick the one I like the best I don't know, that's my whole thing on pre-ordering and joining these incentive programs and stuff, I just really like to shop around I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order collector's editions and that's if I'm buying a collector's edition like Grand Theft Auto which we've got sitting right over there

948
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:18,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

949
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:20,912
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's it.

950
01:13:20,992 --> 01:13:22,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's all I really would pre-order.

951
01:13:22,914 --> 01:13:28,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I order most of my stuff through my work just because, you know, I tend to get them early.

952
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,643
[SPEAKER_02]: D5T1 in chat says, Rob must be a Pepsi fan.

953
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Need to stick to a brand.

954
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I am.

955
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Pepsi's way better than Coke.

956
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:36,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Pepsi is way better than Coke.

957
01:13:37,987 --> 01:13:42,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Only, and I've said this before, it's weird because Pepsi...

958
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:44,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

959
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I can agree with that.

960
01:14:00,852 --> 01:14:03,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I can agree with the tap changing.

961
01:14:03,415 --> 01:14:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: A&W out of the tap is so good, but out of the can cannot be duplicated.

962
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:09,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Can's alright if it's cold enough, but yeah.

963
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this, because Dark Tits of Year reminds me, before the Coke lovers start hating on me, I will say this, vanilla Coke was superior to vanilla Pepsi.

964
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:20,014
[SPEAKER_10]: They're both disgusting.

965
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:20,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

966
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:21,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

967
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:23,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap the other day.

968
01:14:24,277 --> 01:14:24,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Still.

969
01:14:24,858 --> 01:14:25,738
[SPEAKER_02]: In the year 2009.

970
01:14:25,858 --> 01:14:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: At Rubio's.

971
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:27,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

972
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I was floored.

973
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,142
[SPEAKER_08]: They were also one of the first places to have it in town.

974
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:33,084
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else is good with A&W Ruber?

975
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:34,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of the jug.

976
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:37,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they actually sell it in milk jugs.

977
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:38,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

978
01:14:39,269 --> 01:14:39,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

979
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:40,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of their stores.

980
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's best.

981
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

982
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:49,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and move on and DarkSakura with some more news and we'll get into release dates.

983
01:14:50,507 --> 01:15:02,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a channel in the UK called Bravo, which completely has nothing to do with our Bravo, that has a show out called Game Face that's for casual gamers.

984
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:15,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much, you just watch these guys play video games, and they'll have some girl come out and be stupid, and then

985
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:16,912
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

986
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:46,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It just really seems like it'd be really boring to watch because usually anything that's got some type of corporate design behind it tends to get the imagination sucked out of whatever it could have been.

987
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:53,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, Drew, there's people that'll sit there and watch other people play video games for a long time.

988
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:54,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I do when they're at my house.

989
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey, even though he doesn't really play the game himself.

990
01:15:57,906 --> 01:16:00,888
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves to just watch me kind of play through it and see all the cinematic scenes and stuff.

991
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:04,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting that they're kind of making that a TV show.

992
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:10,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that it sounds like they're doing RPGs and stuff, but, you know, that they'll just kind of show five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff.

993
01:16:10,735 --> 01:16:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you know this kind of tangent, sorry, but they have these interesting things on the Comcast On Demand.

994
01:16:16,099 --> 01:16:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

995
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:43,881
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can actually go in and they have these things called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something and it's actually I don't know if it's G4 one of the other networks puts them on there because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right but you can actually watch in HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay of certain games like that around release time so to help you decide if you want to buy it or not I guess you know really get to see what it looks like that's kind of interesting I actually think that's a good idea I think that's a really good idea to have that

996
01:16:44,195 --> 01:16:49,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my question is, you know, we kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows come out and they're stupid.

997
01:16:49,959 --> 01:16:53,741
[SPEAKER_02]: What video game TV show should they make, do you think?

998
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:57,064
[SPEAKER_02]: How could they make a video game TV show that's cool?

999
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:05,809
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to bring back the old school stuff like GamePro TV, you know, where you have the person talking about the new games that are coming up.

1000
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess we're already doing that, but, you know.

1001
01:17:09,419 --> 01:17:14,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really what I'd like to more see because it was really cool back in the day.

1002
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:23,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, like the video game related game shows, not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of ass, but like the ones where people had the Velcro vest and ran around.

1003
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:24,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Starcade and all that stuff.

1004
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:25,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Starcade, yeah.

1005
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:29,755
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would like to see something like the Screensavers used to be.

1006
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:35,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really cool show, but more about video games, which I know you might be thinking, well, isn't that Attack of the Show?

1007
01:17:35,538 --> 01:17:43,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, because that's kind of got that Maxim Magazine spin on it, basically, and that's not all-inclusive, really, of all the gamers.

1008
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:45,382
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also annoying.

1009
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1010
01:17:47,883 --> 01:17:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a much bigger fan of what that show used to be than what it is now.

1011
01:17:50,584 --> 01:17:51,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

1012
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:52,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

1013
01:17:53,045 --> 01:17:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like the idea of a gaming kind of TV show by gamers who somewhat know what they're doing.

1014
01:17:58,927 --> 01:18:01,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to see kind of more current things.

1015
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:05,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of a daily show that is kind of current.

1016
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:06,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1017
01:18:07,677 --> 01:18:25,049
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I feel, you know, and really, if you want to get reviews and everything, there's more amusing things to watch online, like the Angry Video Game Nerd, and the one that, oh god, I can't remember what it is, the one that my husband watches all the time that's kind of like that, only older.

1018
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched.

1019
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:29,432
[SPEAKER_07]: He was drinking Newcastle, it was pretty good.

1020
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody in chat says, Orange Lounge TV, maybe?

1021
01:18:33,194 --> 01:18:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1022
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:33,615
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1023
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:35,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1024
01:18:36,151 --> 01:18:37,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might be getting too old.

1025
01:18:38,034 --> 01:18:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sad thing.

1026
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:39,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too old.

1027
01:18:39,637 --> 01:18:40,759
[SPEAKER_10]: We just don't have enough time.

1028
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:41,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

1029
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Do a daily show?

1030
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:45,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to be getting paid for this.

1031
01:18:45,246 --> 01:18:46,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to all quit our jobs to do it.

1032
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would like to get paid.

1033
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:48,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1034
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:50,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1035
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:56,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin with that, so I'm not even going to think about it.

1036
01:18:57,098 --> 01:18:58,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some release dates.

1037
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, start us off.

1038
01:19:01,379 --> 01:19:03,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's not a whole lot coming out in the U.S., unfortunately.

1039
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,941
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit of a slow time, but there is some big stuff this week, including Madden NFL 10.

1040
01:19:08,021 --> 01:19:15,763
[SPEAKER_10]: We're coming out this Friday, so you pretty much can expect that on every single system out there, except for the DS.

1041
01:19:15,803 --> 01:19:16,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's on the DS this year.

1042
01:19:18,024 --> 01:19:19,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Fossil Fighter is on the DS actually today.

1043
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:22,751
[SPEAKER_10]: or Tomorrow.

1044
01:19:23,131 --> 01:19:23,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1045
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was supposed to be today.

1046
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:27,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, Tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo.

1047
01:19:28,218 --> 01:19:33,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine Soccer Captain, another crappy game from Ubisoft that's on the DS.

1048
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:36,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Active Life Extreme Challenge.

1049
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:37,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the game that has...

1050
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, like a two-player DDR mat, or I guess kind of like a power pad.

1051
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:47,232
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's for the Wii, and it's all the mini-games you could possibly want, and that's available.

1052
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not want, as the case may be.

1053
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Or not want, yes, that's on the Wii.

1054
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:55,494
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a budget Firefighter sim, Real Heroes Firefighter, that's on the Wii.

1055
01:19:56,654 --> 01:20:04,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Also this week, Core on the DS from Graffiti Entertainment, hopefully actually coming out this time because it's been delayed forever.

1056
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:07,774
[SPEAKER_10]: ATV Quad Kings on the Wii.

1057
01:20:07,794 --> 01:20:09,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game from Zoo Games.

1058
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can tell you this much, it's going to suck.

1059
01:20:12,402 --> 01:20:15,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's just like all those other Destiny games and they all suck.

1060
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:44,126
[SPEAKER_10]: uh let's see Still Life 2 coming out on PC I don't know if that's a re-release or not um Phantom Brave we meet again on the Wii that's actually pretty cool if you're a Japanese RPG fan and if you possibly want one even though you don't own Lips they are selling the Lips microphone separately now you can purchase that this week for the Xbox 360 and

1061
01:20:47,625 --> 01:21:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it it's like I said slow week it's also slow week over in Japan as we go take a look at the Japanese release dates really on the big systems there's only one new game coming out but it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game and some folks may get a kick out of that it's coming out on the Wii Hagane no Rekken Jutsushi Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsu I'm sorry

1062
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:11,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Akatsuki no Ouji

1063
01:21:29,126 --> 01:21:30,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll see you next time.

1064
01:21:46,938 --> 01:21:49,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like a wrestling game or sumo game.

1065
01:21:50,259 --> 01:21:50,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be.

1066
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's two different versions of it.

1067
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, on the PSP, there is a new game.

1068
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:57,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity Plus Portable comes out.

1069
01:21:57,822 --> 01:22:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, I think, a bunch of games.

1070
01:22:03,204 --> 01:22:08,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's produced by Cyberfront with different scenarios written by Utsukoshi Kotaro.

1071
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:11,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's done scripts for famous adventure games like Memory Off.

1072
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:15,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's part dating simulation and part adventure.

1073
01:22:16,323 --> 01:22:17,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it for this week in Japan.

1074
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:29,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for our friends in the UK, there's a few releases.

1075
01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:41,015
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 12th is Trials HD on Xbox 360, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands, both of those on the 13th.

1076
01:22:41,735 --> 01:22:47,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3 for PC and Madden 10, whatever.

1077
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:48,636
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1078
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And Madden...

1079
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:54,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Not your cup of tea, huh?

1080
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:55,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Bleh.

1081
01:22:55,787 --> 01:22:56,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Barf.

1082
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:00,937
[SPEAKER_10]: This is interesting.

1083
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:03,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony has trademarked a new...

1084
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:09,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess a new logo for something called PlayStation Thanks.

1085
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,152
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on what this is yet.

1086
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:17,318
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if you were to ask me, I would say that it's probably going to be some sort of incentive program.

1087
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:20,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Very similar to the Club Nintendo stuff.

1088
01:23:21,142 --> 01:23:22,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting tonight.

1089
01:23:22,243 --> 01:23:24,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of discount and reward stories.

1090
01:23:24,945 --> 01:23:26,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a sign of the times.

1091
01:23:26,186 --> 01:23:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1092
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:27,968
[SPEAKER_02]: To help in the economy.

1093
01:23:28,328 --> 01:23:29,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, let's go play Thanks.

1094
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Thanks Redemption

1095
01:24:18,207 --> 01:24:44,405
[SPEAKER_10]: S2100 Matt in chat says I approve of these discount stories yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories it's just kind of interesting it all seems to be hitting the same week and you know we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed this is all perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP you know they get you to buy stuff and you get codes and then you can like redeem points and get crap and maybe that's what they're doing that would make more sense to me PlayStation 3 since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3 um

1096
01:24:46,792 --> 01:24:47,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1097
01:24:47,473 --> 01:24:48,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be a nice bonus.

1098
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:48,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1099
01:24:48,654 --> 01:24:53,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing.

1100
01:25:05,788 --> 01:25:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1101
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:37,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the jobs from XI, and I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs is going to be somewhat similar, but the focus is going to be on the weapons.

1102
01:25:39,115 --> 01:25:44,617
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also interesting, they're not using any of the Final Fantasy very typical names for classes.

1103
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:50,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have Swordsman and Sorcerer, all these new types of jobs that you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before.

1104
01:25:51,058 --> 01:25:51,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1105
01:26:20,836 --> 01:26:22,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Daru Daru is now called a Lalafell

1106
01:26:49,969 --> 01:26:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: which I keep saying a falafel but their name is a lalafel or something like that.

1107
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:54,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That's retarded.

1108
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they changed all the names which is so weird.

1109
01:26:56,413 --> 01:26:57,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep them the same.

1110
01:26:57,454 --> 01:26:57,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1111
01:26:57,534 --> 01:26:58,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a new world.

1112
01:26:58,954 --> 01:26:59,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not a new world.

1113
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the exact same races.

1114
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:02,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1115
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: The characters do look slightly different but they're also saying that the difference between the races is not going to be that great but that the differences between the genders in some translation I read there'll be a lot of difference in genders.

1116
01:27:13,323 --> 01:27:20,465
[SPEAKER_02]: which some people are thinking might be a throwback to the old D&D where men were typically more strength, women were typically more mind intelligence.

1117
01:27:21,346 --> 01:27:22,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

1118
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,126
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true at all, but okay.

1119
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's funny to call them falafel.

1120
01:27:31,269 --> 01:27:33,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you also have hummus as another class?

1121
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:33,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1122
01:27:33,889 --> 01:27:34,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, yes.

1123
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a humaya or something like that is what they call human.

1124
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't they just use human?

1125
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:40,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously,

1126
01:27:42,512 --> 01:27:44,074
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Elven, okay?

1127
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Just call them Elves.

1128
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:51,383
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not, you know, Elfen or Elefenton or whatever the hell they're calling them.

1129
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:53,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my friend Shane was calling them Lola Fails.

1130
01:27:53,986 --> 01:27:54,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

1131
01:27:54,547 --> 01:27:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he says they don't look as cute as Taros do.

1132
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They look bigger now.

1133
01:27:58,412 --> 01:27:59,433
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look like Taros did.

1134
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:01,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they're more customizable, which would be fun.

1135
01:28:02,156 --> 01:28:07,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to have male Mithras and female Galkas or whatever the fuck they're calling them?

1136
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

1137
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Galkas are unisex, though.

1138
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

1139
01:28:11,021 --> 01:28:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen anything yet, but the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them, that they might come out later.

1140
01:28:15,544 --> 01:28:18,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see male Mithras later on or whatever they're calling them now.

1141
01:28:19,686 --> 01:28:20,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Cat people.

1142
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:24,369
[SPEAKER_08]: You say that, and I have thought this ever since.

1143
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:25,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I always think of Mithril.

1144
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:31,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this though, some screenshots have come out from the game, and it looks really nice.

1145
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:36,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, not really a lot from in-game, but just some of the scenery and things.

1146
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:41,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics to look a lot more like Oblivion, but very colorful.

1147
01:28:41,623 --> 01:28:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Oblivion kind of started to look very monotone after a while.

1148
01:28:45,065 --> 01:28:56,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics, but Final Fantasy XIV, they've shown some landscapes that are just very lush and colorful, and I'm very excited to see how the game looks when it comes out.

1149
01:28:56,690 --> 01:29:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year because the game's coming out 2010.

1150
01:29:02,154 --> 01:29:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they're going to do that when Final Fantasy XIII hasn't even been dated yet.

1151
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:07,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are getting their hopes up.

1152
01:29:07,357 --> 01:29:09,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this game's coming out until 2011.

1153
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:12,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize Squeenix is saying 2010, but come on.

1154
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:13,722
[SPEAKER_02]: How many games get delayed?

1155
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:14,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we trust them?

1156
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:16,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we really trust them?

1157
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

1158
01:29:17,184 --> 01:29:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So, best case scenario, like Christmas 2010 is when you'll see this game, I think.

1159
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1160
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of excited about this game because I'm really excited at the notion that they have fixed a lot of the problems that, you know, big problems that Final Fantasy XI had, especially in regards to, you know, how long of an investment you have to make with the game each time you play it.

1161
01:29:41,753 --> 01:29:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1162
01:30:02,288 --> 01:30:06,634
[SPEAKER_02]: and find a game that she thinks you all ought to be playing this week in DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1163
01:30:06,794 --> 01:30:08,637
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week?

1164
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: The game of the week is Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn.

1165
01:30:14,064 --> 01:30:17,849
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan it came out as a Zelda Panzer Dragoon RPG.

1166
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:32,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a role-play game that came out in 1988 for the Saturn, and it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series, not including Panzer Dragoon Mini that came out on Game Gear in Japan.

1167
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also the only one that's not a rail shooter.

1168
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:47,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It was done by Team Andromeda and this was their last game as Team Andromeda.

1169
01:30:48,939 --> 01:30:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're playing a boy named Edge who is looking...

1170
01:30:54,326 --> 01:30:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's actually trying to, you know, save the world and has his own dragon and everything.

1171
01:30:59,449 --> 01:31:06,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you play the game with real-time, with a sword, a real-time combat.

1172
01:31:09,316 --> 01:31:12,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And your different interactions with the characters.

1173
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:16,920
[SPEAKER_08]: The really, really cool thing about this, though, is that...

1174
01:31:18,732 --> 01:31:23,294
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually don't stay on the dragon all the time.

1175
01:31:23,414 --> 01:31:26,656
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go around and explore different areas on foot.

1176
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:30,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can fly around the world, you know, different places that you can get to.

1177
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:36,480
[SPEAKER_08]: You control your dragon pretty much completely.

1178
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:44,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of it being predetermined like it was in the other games, you actually tell the dragon where to go and can go anywhere you want to.

1179
01:31:45,044 --> 01:31:45,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1180
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:55,056
[SPEAKER_08]: You also have other commands for the dragon like breaking things and accessing doors and switches and things like that.

1181
01:31:55,597 --> 01:31:58,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And your dragon has different, you know, weapons.

1182
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you have lasers for your dragon.

1183
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:06,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon with lasers, that's pretty cool.

1184
01:32:06,423 --> 01:32:07,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragons with lasers?

1185
01:32:07,784 --> 01:32:08,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

1186
01:32:10,185 --> 01:32:12,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they just call the game Laser Dragons?

1187
01:32:12,087 --> 01:32:14,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would have checked it out when it was first out.

1188
01:32:15,086 --> 01:32:16,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it actually was really good.

1189
01:32:16,726 --> 01:32:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It used a lot of dramatic camera angles.

1190
01:32:19,207 --> 01:32:31,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It really had just... It was really, really a traditional RPG with some really unconventional aspects to it.

1191
01:32:33,311 --> 01:32:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example, your in-air combat, and it wasn't necessarily turn-based.

1192
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:40,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It was real-time based.

1193
01:32:41,213 --> 01:32:41,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1194
01:32:43,164 --> 01:32:48,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have your attack, you can use items, and then you have your berserks, which are like your spells.

1195
01:32:48,835 --> 01:32:56,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've also got your gauges that determine where you are for your initiative, sort of like that.

1196
01:32:57,114 --> 01:33:03,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the other, now this is what I really liked is that, um, you could get different, um, abilities.

1197
01:33:03,339 --> 01:33:04,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You could equip your dragon.

1198
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's technically, it's called morphing.

1199
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:12,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they also put this in, in Panzer Dragoons, Vi, and, uh, Orda, the witch came out on Dreamcast.

1200
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:13,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

1201
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:26,453
[SPEAKER_08]: You can change the dragon into all these different forms, which actually the specific thing about Saga is that you literally had hundreds of different forms that you could do.

1202
01:33:27,093 --> 01:33:37,338
[SPEAKER_08]: You would affect different attributes by sort of upgrading parts of your dragon, and it would take a different appearance, have different abilities, do different things.

1203
01:33:39,078 --> 01:33:44,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would actually change physical form as you did everything.

1204
01:33:45,321 --> 01:33:52,103
[SPEAKER_08]: There were really different extreme forms based off of agility, spirit, attack, or defense.

1205
01:33:52,983 --> 01:33:56,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it would change something within those four extremes.

1206
01:33:58,225 --> 01:34:03,347
[SPEAKER_08]: You would also be able to make some unique forms by getting D units.

1207
01:34:04,427 --> 01:34:04,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1208
01:34:06,445 --> 01:34:08,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there were hidden forms.

1209
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:15,536
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is called the Lightwing, where if you get all 12 of the D units in the game, you get the ultimate dragon pretty much.

1210
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:19,481
[SPEAKER_08]: The Lightwing has all of the special berserks and...

1211
01:34:22,728 --> 01:34:23,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturn RPGs are...

1212
01:34:48,254 --> 01:34:50,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1213
01:35:16,531 --> 01:35:17,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there it is.

1214
01:35:18,073 --> 01:35:19,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week.

1215
01:35:19,594 --> 01:35:22,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn.

1216
01:35:22,878 --> 01:35:27,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never really seen this game before, but especially for that era, I like the background.

1217
01:35:27,423 --> 01:35:28,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very pretty.

1218
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these dragons shooting their lasers in pretty sunsets and so forth.

1219
01:35:31,467 --> 01:35:36,733
[SPEAKER_08]: The only one I could find with really good music and not a lot of talking was one of the dragon battles.

1220
01:35:36,953 --> 01:35:37,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of fun.

1221
01:35:38,674 --> 01:35:45,580
[SPEAKER_08]: The game has some gorgeous music and also it's in Japanese with subtitles.

1222
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:49,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So the voice acting was actually pretty good in it too.

1223
01:35:49,563 --> 01:35:50,704
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few familiar voices.

1224
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:54,207
[SPEAKER_08]: For at least those who were anime nuts.

1225
01:35:55,987 --> 01:35:56,988
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1226
01:36:12,785 --> 01:36:14,686
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll work fine on your PC at home.

1227
01:36:14,726 --> 01:36:15,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.

1228
01:36:15,346 --> 01:36:19,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I have one because I just wanted to try it, and it actually works with my disc games.

1229
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a few Saturn games because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out.

1230
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:24,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It works great.

1231
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:24,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1232
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:28,511
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we're going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.

1233
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:29,611
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got plenty more to come.

1234
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:33,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our rapid-fire news when we come back with Part B tonight, as well as some more discussion.

1235
01:36:33,493 --> 01:36:35,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up, as well as...

1236
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:38,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSi.

1237
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:40,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And PAX 09 news.

1238
01:36:40,281 --> 01:36:44,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1239
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:45,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't go anywhere.

1240
01:36:45,449 --> 01:36:46,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.

1241
01:36:52,645 --> 01:36:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 9th of 2009.

1242
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we do tape live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.

1243
01:37:04,555 --> 01:37:06,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus.

1244
01:37:06,957 --> 01:37:17,826
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that in Part A, but you will just have to download the podcast at this point, which I know was very slow in updating during our podcast, but should be back on a more regular schedule this week.

1245
01:37:18,226 --> 01:37:20,188
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1246
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:43,706
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course their new album which I believe is called Backspacer which is kind of a weird name but okay.

1247
01:37:44,087 --> 01:37:49,631
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be available on the same day on both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.

1248
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:53,894
[SPEAKER_10]: September 20th is going to be the date for that.

1249
01:37:55,125 --> 01:38:03,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Championship Edition is now also being ported to the iPhone and it makes perfect sense that they would be putting that out there.

1250
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:06,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely worth checking out.

1251
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:09,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's actually coming out as Pac-Man Remix.

1252
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:13,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

1253
01:38:13,252 --> 01:38:14,632
[SPEAKER_10]: They had one called Pac-Man Remix.

1254
01:38:14,692 --> 01:38:15,152
[SPEAKER_10]: My mistake.

1255
01:38:15,253 --> 01:38:16,393
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Championship Edition.

1256
01:38:17,733 --> 01:38:18,333
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be kind of cool.

1257
01:38:19,114 --> 01:38:24,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to suck on the iPhone because the music was awesome in the Xbox One.

1258
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:29,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess iPhone is an MP3 player and they've got some kick-ass tunes.

1259
01:38:30,017 --> 01:38:34,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360 One being reproduced on the iPhone.

1260
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:35,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1261
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:36,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to get that out there.

1262
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:36,759
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1263
01:38:38,019 --> 01:38:43,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Champions Online is actually doing something interesting with their subscription service.

1264
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:58,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides the monthly subscription that you can do, which would be $15 a month, I guess, you can actually purchase a six-month plan at a slightly discounted rate for $59.99.

1265
01:39:00,926 --> 01:39:22,872
[SPEAKER_10]: or if you want to if you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game you can get a lifetime subscription for $199.99 so $200 $200 and I know for a lot of people that are like saying plain wow if you get a lifetime subscription for $200 that probably would have been well worth it you know when it launched so I don't know if you're really into champions online that might be the way to go

1266
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:27,734
[SPEAKER_02]: But aren't you getting also something about Star Trek Online with that too?

1267
01:39:27,914 --> 01:39:28,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1268
01:39:28,134 --> 01:39:29,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the part that caught my eye.

1269
01:39:29,275 --> 01:39:29,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1270
01:39:29,796 --> 01:39:40,286
[SPEAKER_10]: If you pre-order one of the subscription plans, you will also get access to the closed beta for Star Trek Online, which is coming out later this year.

1271
01:39:41,593 --> 01:39:51,339
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I really want to play Star Trek Online, but not $200 badly, especially when I don't really know anything about Champions Online except that the series has a cult following to it.

1272
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I play Champions Offline with books and paper and dice.

1273
01:39:55,641 --> 01:40:01,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the prospect of an online one, because that wasn't really my thing, does the prospect of an online version of that appeal to you?

1274
01:40:02,065 --> 01:40:02,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1275
01:40:02,885 --> 01:40:03,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I am positive of that.

1276
01:40:03,646 --> 01:40:05,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO.

1277
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:30,885
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1278
01:40:55,377 --> 01:41:13,318
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was a game that came out actually came back back out in like 2005 but it has extremely retro graphics it's kind of like Metroid-ish style kind of game and it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX if you've never seen this game before well if you've never seen the game before you will get to see it soon

1279
01:41:13,658 --> 01:41:17,643
[SPEAKER_02]: La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare, which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit surprised.

1280
01:41:18,624 --> 01:41:28,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades, it won't really look 8-bit, but it'll look kind of more 16-bit with a little bit more hand-drawn art is the look they're going for.

1281
01:41:28,114 --> 01:41:30,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be kind of fun.

1282
01:41:31,038 --> 01:41:33,160
[SPEAKER_02]: RockBand.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart.

1283
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1284
01:42:09,315 --> 01:42:26,896
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting they also put in their compatibility chart as well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth if you're curious just briefly well you can look at this at rockband.com slash compatibility you get the whole chart but it actually looks like most of the instruments are compatible with all the games at this point

1285
01:42:27,176 --> 01:42:34,538
[SPEAKER_02]: The only things you're going to run into is you're going to run into problems with some of the rock band paraphernalia in Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3 on the Xbox 360.

1286
01:42:35,058 --> 01:42:38,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And drums are all pretty cross compatible unless you own the Rock Revolution drums.

1287
01:42:38,879 --> 01:42:40,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't work with rock band games.

1288
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want the confidence that your instruments will work with the Beatles rock band, here's some good news for you.

1289
01:42:46,501 --> 01:42:47,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatles rock band...

1290
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:53,226
[SPEAKER_02]: will run on every single instrument will run with Beatles Rock Band as well as Rock Band 2.

1291
01:42:54,207 --> 01:42:57,890
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that doesn't work with Rock Band 2 Rock Revolution drums.

1292
01:42:58,570 --> 01:42:59,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Beatles Rock Band.

1293
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:02,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anyone bought Rock Revolution anyway.

1294
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:04,821
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cheap now, even with the drums.

1295
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:05,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's true.

1296
01:43:05,962 --> 01:43:07,243
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find an unloaded one.

1297
01:43:08,504 --> 01:43:09,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, one other one.

1298
01:43:09,965 --> 01:43:13,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick follow-up to a story previously talked about on Orange Lounge Radio.

1299
01:43:13,327 --> 01:43:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled, and the game will be released in October.

1300
01:43:18,972 --> 01:43:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game.

1301
01:43:22,074 --> 01:43:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal, but details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed.

1302
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game will be coming out in October.

1303
01:43:32,182 --> 01:43:36,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So get ready to rock, those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend.

1304
01:43:37,345 --> 01:43:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really messy situation because there was countersuits and all this other garbage.

1305
01:43:40,927 --> 01:43:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuck.

1306
01:43:42,628 --> 01:43:46,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news?

1307
01:43:48,031 --> 01:43:55,536
[SPEAKER_08]: What actually was going to be coming out is Revenge of Shinobi for Mega Drive for the Genesis over here.

1308
01:43:55,556 --> 01:43:56,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be coming out for...

1309
01:43:58,357 --> 01:43:59,378
[SPEAKER_08]: 800 Nintendo Points.

1310
01:43:59,478 --> 01:44:04,102
[SPEAKER_08]: And on WiiWare, there's Bonsai Barber, which is a tree sculpting and painting game.

1311
01:44:05,143 --> 01:44:08,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually running a business doing both of those.

1312
01:44:08,286 --> 01:44:10,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's 1,000 points.

1313
01:44:11,089 --> 01:44:17,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there will be a bunch of city maps for DS City Transport Map Volumes 1 and 2.

1314
01:44:17,995 --> 01:44:18,956
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be...

1315
01:44:22,178 --> 01:44:32,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon, and then there will be London, Amsterdam, um, Moscow, Berlin, and Prague, so that's pretty cool.

1316
01:44:32,264 --> 01:44:33,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will be for 500.

1317
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:41,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, in other news, and this makes me a happy fangirl, is we will have Gorillaz in Rock Band.

1318
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:42,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1319
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:44,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the yay?

1320
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:44,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1321
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1322
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:46,991
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1323
01:44:47,492 --> 01:44:51,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are, but I'll download them for sure.

1324
01:44:52,195 --> 01:44:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

1325
01:44:52,655 --> 01:44:53,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck yeah.

1326
01:44:53,516 --> 01:44:59,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's going to be Feel Good Inc., Clint Eastwood, and Rehash for Pack 1.

1327
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:03,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going to be pretty cool.

1328
01:45:03,182 --> 01:45:13,769
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be out on the Rock Band Music Store this week, I believe.

1329
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:16,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Tuesdays are usually the day those come out, right?

1330
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:17,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1331
01:45:17,752 --> 01:45:21,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also going to be some other download tracks.

1332
01:45:21,836 --> 01:45:23,297
[SPEAKER_08]: We get some Janis Joplin.

1333
01:45:23,337 --> 01:45:24,558
[SPEAKER_08]: We get Peace of My Heart.

1334
01:45:24,698 --> 01:45:25,199
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1335
01:45:25,219 --> 01:45:28,001
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be the best week ever for Rock Band.

1336
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:29,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We get White Rabbit.

1337
01:45:29,562 --> 01:45:30,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude!

1338
01:45:31,184 --> 01:45:32,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Jefferson fucking Airplane.

1339
01:45:32,645 --> 01:45:34,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the greatest week ever for Rock Band.

1340
01:45:34,947 --> 01:45:35,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We get Magic Bus.

1341
01:45:36,688 --> 01:45:37,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1342
01:45:38,513 --> 01:45:42,495
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, for the Wii, there will be a number of songs.

1343
01:45:42,555 --> 01:45:44,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Blink-182, Kiss.

1344
01:45:45,316 --> 01:45:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

1345
01:45:46,797 --> 01:45:49,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer, Thin Lizzy.

1346
01:45:50,038 --> 01:45:52,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas, Loki?

1347
01:45:53,019 --> 01:45:53,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no, my birthday?

1348
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1349
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't spent it.

1350
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week.

1351
01:45:58,262 --> 01:45:59,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get the Gorillaz stuff.

1352
01:45:59,442 --> 01:46:00,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get Jefferson Airplane.

1353
01:46:00,783 --> 01:46:01,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to.

1354
01:46:03,004 --> 01:46:05,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So, look forward to that at my next rock band party.

1355
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:14,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing is that Sega is teasing us with a new RPG.

1356
01:46:14,972 --> 01:46:18,534
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be able to see what it is on August 20th.

1357
01:46:20,314 --> 01:46:33,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are a few clues, though, saying that there is going to be... It's a wooden ship wheel and a silhouette of a woman in a weird pose.

1358
01:46:34,557 --> 01:46:41,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there's a few people who think that there's going to be a PSO.

1359
01:46:44,278 --> 01:46:45,919
[SPEAKER_08]: A new fantasy czar?

1360
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:46,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantasy czar.

1361
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:48,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantasy star roleplay game.

1362
01:46:49,042 --> 01:46:49,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy czar?

1363
01:46:50,063 --> 01:46:50,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantasy czar.

1364
01:46:51,064 --> 01:46:56,528
[SPEAKER_08]: That's set in the future Russia in outer space.

1365
01:46:56,728 --> 01:46:57,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1366
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,849
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1367
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:02,213
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is just speculation.

1368
01:47:02,233 --> 01:47:04,975
[SPEAKER_08]: They really pulled it out of some HTML code, a.k.a.

1369
01:47:05,055 --> 01:47:05,496
[SPEAKER_08]: their ass.

1370
01:47:07,065 --> 01:47:07,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.

1371
01:47:08,146 --> 01:47:10,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't it also be Valkyria Chronicles 2 or something?

1372
01:47:10,568 --> 01:47:11,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess we already know about that.

1373
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:17,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, I'm thinking if they've got a big captain's wheel, what about Eternal Arcadia?

1374
01:47:19,457 --> 01:47:23,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That was out on Dreamcast where you had the air pirate ships.

1375
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's obscure.

1376
01:47:25,748 --> 01:47:27,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not obscure, I have it.

1377
01:47:29,049 --> 01:47:30,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't mean anything.

1378
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks, go look at the video of the vault on YouTube and tell me she does not have some obscure shit.

1379
01:47:37,011 --> 01:47:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The lady pulls out a dish that came with a video game at some point, I kid you not.

1380
01:47:42,633 --> 01:47:44,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Or perhaps... That's obscure.

1381
01:47:44,174 --> 01:47:47,695
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new party game collection, Sonic vs. the Somalia Pirates.

1382
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:50,856
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1383
01:47:51,076 --> 01:47:52,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times, good times.

1384
01:47:53,697 --> 01:47:53,837
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1385
01:47:56,601 --> 01:47:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1386
01:47:57,801 --> 01:47:58,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1387
01:47:58,121 --> 01:48:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you, Spyware.

1388
01:48:00,622 --> 01:48:01,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.

1389
01:48:01,282 --> 01:48:04,083
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out as Skies of Arcadia over here or whatever.

1390
01:48:05,124 --> 01:48:06,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name.

1391
01:48:08,004 --> 01:48:09,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now Skies of Arcadia, I've heard of that.

1392
01:48:09,765 --> 01:48:10,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1393
01:48:10,365 --> 01:48:10,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1394
01:48:11,466 --> 01:48:11,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it now.

1395
01:48:13,046 --> 01:48:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Not obscure.

1396
01:48:14,967 --> 01:48:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get back to some more gaming news, Loki.

1397
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:18,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1398
01:48:18,748 --> 01:48:19,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well...

1399
01:48:21,144 --> 01:48:22,265
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1400
01:48:46,089 --> 01:48:47,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is interesting.

1401
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:56,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, also Guitar Hero Van Halen this week got its full track list.

1402
01:48:58,742 --> 01:49:01,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are less excited about it.

1403
01:49:06,169 --> 01:49:08,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, some of the tracks feature...

1404
01:49:12,308 --> 01:49:31,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Jump, Hot4Teacher, Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls, Panama, Pretty Woman, So This Is Love, Unchained, Other artists featured in the game as well, Billy Idol, White Wedding,

1405
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:53,355
[SPEAKER_10]: 3rd Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life, The Offspring, Pretty Fly for a White Guy Queen, I Want It All, Lenny Kravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead

1406
01:49:54,196 --> 01:50:01,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, just when I think a song list kind of blows and I'm not really interested, they have to go in and throw in a Queen track that suddenly takes it from suck to awesome.

1407
01:50:01,682 --> 01:50:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, SingStar Queen is apparently out now, and I'm surprised I don't already own it.

1408
01:50:06,946 --> 01:50:07,547
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not out yet.

1409
01:50:07,987 --> 01:50:08,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it came out this week.

1410
01:50:09,308 --> 01:50:11,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that's right, they changed the date, I forgot about that.

1411
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:12,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It got bumped up or something.

1412
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:13,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it did get bumped up.

1413
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin, though, because SingStar games usually end up in the discount bin in about a month.

1414
01:50:18,717 --> 01:50:20,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1415
01:50:21,461 --> 01:50:31,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, all those tracks and, you know, of course those two stories just happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games and not for any other reason at all.

1416
01:50:31,614 --> 01:50:32,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.

1417
01:50:32,135 --> 01:50:32,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course not.

1418
01:50:32,976 --> 01:50:34,298
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be purely hypothetical.

1419
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:34,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1420
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I was in South Lake Tahoe this weekend, and at the basement of one of their casinos there, Harvey's, they have a Cabo Wabo, and that was kind of a fun place to go, because good drinks and so forth.

1421
01:50:48,471 --> 01:50:49,251
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who started that?

1422
01:50:50,893 --> 01:50:52,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody that's missing from Guitar of Van Halen.

1423
01:50:52,694 --> 01:50:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

1424
01:50:53,515 --> 01:50:53,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1425
01:50:54,476 --> 01:51:00,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say, I saw some, well, I didn't see him there, but I saw someone this week that I'm not going to see in this game.

1426
01:51:01,302 --> 01:51:01,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Sammy Hagar.

1427
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:11,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to also say, though, that the game is scheduled to come out.

1428
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:14,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd.

1429
01:51:15,407 --> 01:51:16,308
[SPEAKER_02]: For most people.

1430
01:51:16,468 --> 01:51:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems way pushed back from what we were originally hearing.

1431
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:20,651
[SPEAKER_10]: It is way pushed back.

1432
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:21,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1433
01:51:22,652 --> 01:51:24,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It is interesting now, isn't it?

1434
01:51:24,613 --> 01:51:25,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Hypothetically speaking.

1435
01:51:26,374 --> 01:51:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

1436
01:51:28,717 --> 01:51:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Just before Christmas.

1437
01:51:30,358 --> 01:51:31,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Just before Christmas.

1438
01:51:31,338 --> 01:51:32,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But Christmas will come early for some.

1439
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:33,359
[SPEAKER_02]: For some.

1440
01:51:33,419 --> 01:51:34,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Faithful.

1441
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:34,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1442
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1443
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically.

1444
01:51:37,001 --> 01:51:38,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically.

1445
01:51:50,026 --> 01:51:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1446
01:52:05,836 --> 01:52:07,358
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing with your cell phone.

1447
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing, but with your DSi.

1448
01:52:32,882 --> 01:52:36,045
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically just, you know, instead of your cell phone, it's your DSi.

1449
01:52:36,366 --> 01:52:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But since the DSi has all the picture altering modes on it where you can draw and have the borders and all the, you know, weird distortion pictures, you can upload those pictures too, which I guess you can't really do yourself.

1450
01:52:49,919 --> 01:52:50,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1451
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, it's the same functionality you'd find in a cell phone, which, you know, whatever.

1452
01:52:56,604 --> 01:52:56,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1453
01:52:57,385 --> 01:53:00,507
[SPEAKER_02]: More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing on my Facebook, I guess.

1454
01:53:01,267 --> 01:53:04,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something that has me bouncing off the walls, but I can see where some people find this cool.

1455
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:07,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you don't have a decent camera on your cell phone.

1456
01:53:08,452 --> 01:53:09,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you like to edit pictures.

1457
01:53:10,293 --> 01:53:18,399
[SPEAKER_02]: As somebody on my Facebook loves to do, because all the pictures he's posted of himself are all, like, drawn on and mirrored imaged and all just distorted.

1458
01:53:18,419 --> 01:53:19,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1459
01:53:19,588 --> 01:53:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, have fun with it.

1460
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what DSI is about, having fun, right?

1461
01:53:24,191 --> 01:53:27,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else they could really do with Facebook integration and the DSI?

1462
01:53:27,653 --> 01:53:29,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm kind of glad it's just this.

1463
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying, so-and-so is now playing Pokemon.

1464
01:53:33,437 --> 01:53:35,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So-and-so just stopped playing Pokemon.

1465
01:53:35,799 --> 01:53:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would block those posts from Facebook so fast.

1466
01:53:38,481 --> 01:53:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is there a lot of other integration?

1467
01:53:40,442 --> 01:53:44,064
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other possibly cool thing I can think of is an interactive high score board.

1468
01:53:44,645 --> 01:53:46,966
[SPEAKER_02]: You see this with Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games.

1469
01:53:47,407 --> 01:53:49,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So and so just beat your high score.

1470
01:53:49,148 --> 01:53:50,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Click here to try and beat it.

1471
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I do like about Facebook is if you find that shit annoying, there's always a hide button.

1472
01:53:56,232 --> 01:53:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can block any application and all that stuff.

1473
01:53:59,094 --> 01:54:01,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook used to be a lot worse, but it got a lot better.

1474
01:54:04,678 --> 01:54:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious if anyone else thinks there might be something cool they can add to Facebook.

1475
01:54:10,157 --> 01:54:10,858
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1476
01:54:29,813 --> 01:54:30,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I blocked it.

1477
01:54:30,514 --> 01:54:31,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I blocked Farm Town.

1478
01:54:32,035 --> 01:54:40,223
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that I play on there are these retarded quizzes and the pet thing, Pet Society.

1479
01:54:41,013 --> 01:54:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I will admit, I play Bejeweled Blitz, I play Sorority Life, I'm level 47, thank you very much, and I play Farm Town now.

1480
01:54:47,855 --> 01:55:01,279
[SPEAKER_02]: My boyfriend got me addicted to Farm Town, which in reality, it really is kind of one of the dumbest fucking games, but you know what, it's something that Jeff really enjoys to do, so I play it to kind of have a friendly competition with him, although he's so much more addicted than I am.

1481
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:07,501
[SPEAKER_02]: But I told him if he likes Farm Town, he really needs to play Animal Crossing sometime, because I think that would be right up his alley.

1482
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:11,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, enough about casual Facebook games.

1483
01:55:11,533 --> 01:55:13,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about more video games, DarkSakura.

1484
01:55:14,934 --> 01:55:17,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we might have some other video game news.

1485
01:55:18,736 --> 01:55:19,376
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Braid?

1486
01:55:20,837 --> 01:55:24,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Braid is actually going to PlayStation Network, finally.

1487
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:31,781
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be... Actually looking for... No, they don't have a...

1488
01:55:33,146 --> 01:55:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: A date on it yet, but they are saying, though, that hopefully it will be out soon, I guess.

1489
01:55:43,192 --> 01:55:44,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a little late.

1490
01:55:44,653 --> 01:55:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, didn't this game come out like a year and a half ago or something?

1491
01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe it wasn't that long ago, but at least a year ago, right?

1492
01:55:50,776 --> 01:55:51,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1493
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:54,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network.

1494
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess, you know...

1495
01:55:57,168 --> 01:56:00,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever people want to play the game, let them.

1496
01:56:00,391 --> 01:56:03,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And let the designers make their money, however.

1497
01:56:03,193 --> 01:56:07,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just seems like this game's on Xbox, this game's on PC.

1498
01:56:07,796 --> 01:56:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN?

1499
01:56:10,779 --> 01:56:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no interest in rebuying the game, that's for sure.

1500
01:56:13,521 --> 01:56:16,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but there's people who have PS3s that don't have an Xbox 360.

1501
01:56:17,364 --> 01:56:19,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since.

1502
01:56:20,226 --> 01:56:49,754
[SPEAKER_02]: or have a PC that they could download the game on but I guess not everybody likes to game on PC I would be more interested in this if there was like more levels or something but I just to be honest I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid without kind of dumbing it up because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool is the storyline which is very finely contained to those episodes I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage or anything like that I think it is what it is and new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough that's for sure

1503
01:56:52,771 --> 01:56:53,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1504
01:57:11,377 --> 01:57:21,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they just integrated it into some games, you know how they have voice chat in certain games, like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that, you can do voice chat with the DS.

1505
01:57:21,550 --> 01:57:23,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what it came down to, because it was just a tech demo.

1506
01:57:25,295 --> 01:57:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1507
01:57:27,372 --> 01:57:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what some folks in chat are saying.

1508
01:57:31,214 --> 01:57:32,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Pokemon Voice Chat.

1509
01:57:32,715 --> 01:57:35,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably because the DS isn't that powerful.

1510
01:57:35,837 --> 01:57:39,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, shit, it can't really run a web browser that well without an expansion card in it.

1511
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:41,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It has no real RAM in it.

1512
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it has a few megs of RAM, but that's about it.

1513
01:57:44,582 --> 01:57:48,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think it would be very tough for it to process that kind of stuff, but...

1514
01:57:50,191 --> 01:57:50,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1515
01:57:51,352 --> 01:57:55,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very interested to see what Nintendo's next handheld is going to be like.

1516
01:57:55,895 --> 01:57:58,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet we see it in about three years.

1517
01:57:59,457 --> 01:58:00,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious to see.

1518
01:58:00,358 --> 01:58:00,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even two.

1519
01:58:01,218 --> 01:58:04,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit.

1520
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,561
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be GameCube graphics.

1521
01:58:06,441 --> 01:58:06,842
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1522
01:58:07,342 --> 01:58:08,042
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense.

1523
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:09,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the progression.

1524
01:58:09,363 --> 01:58:09,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1525
01:58:10,124 --> 01:58:10,524
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1526
01:58:11,785 --> 01:58:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind like a portable type F-Zero.

1527
01:58:13,826 --> 01:58:14,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

1528
01:58:14,567 --> 01:58:15,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be fun.

1529
01:58:16,667 --> 01:58:21,249
[SPEAKER_02]: StarCraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010 and that makes a lot of people sad and you won't be able to buy the trilogy

1530
01:58:42,278 --> 01:58:42,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Bioshock 2 Delayed 2010

1531
01:59:12,005 --> 01:59:13,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they want to announce a lot of games.

1532
01:59:13,306 --> 01:59:15,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not already.

1533
01:59:15,669 --> 01:59:22,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter, first off, they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines.

1534
01:59:22,135 --> 01:59:26,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And two, it just gets buried under everything that comes out.

1535
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:34,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2 because they don't want to release a game out around the same time because it'll just get ignored.

1536
01:59:35,749 --> 01:59:35,949
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1537
01:59:37,227 --> 01:59:37,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1538
01:59:37,507 --> 01:59:39,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out.

1539
01:59:39,809 --> 01:59:51,737
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff like Kane and Lynch 2 and stuff like that, I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year because I don't know.

1540
01:59:51,757 --> 01:59:53,017
[SPEAKER_10]: They just weren't ready yet.

1541
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:54,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1542
01:59:56,553 --> 01:59:56,873
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1543
01:59:57,253 --> 02:00:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009, you're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet, but only if you are one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omegathon.

1544
02:00:06,696 --> 02:00:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: The game Halo 3 ODST is going to show up in round three of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omegathon.

1545
02:00:12,897 --> 02:00:16,098
[SPEAKER_02]: The other games, Mario Kart Wii is round one's game.

1546
02:00:16,778 --> 02:00:18,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Round two is Bookworm Adventures.

1547
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:22,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game.

1548
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:28,502
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what game it is yet, but speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet, like Rock Band Beatles or DJ Hero.

1549
02:00:29,243 --> 02:00:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And round 5 will be Connect 4.

1550
02:00:31,544 --> 02:00:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The final round, as always, is a mystery game that will probably be either something new or something really old.

1551
02:00:38,286 --> 02:00:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Epic Pong type of thing.

1552
02:00:40,967 --> 02:00:41,768
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already done that.

1553
02:00:41,828 --> 02:00:43,189
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the games they did last year?

1554
02:00:43,209 --> 02:00:46,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember the Momagathon stuff from past.

1555
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Combat was one year.

1556
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:48,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that.

1557
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Combat was one year.

1558
02:00:49,732 --> 02:00:50,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Pong was one year.

1559
02:00:50,913 --> 02:00:52,494
[SPEAKER_10]: They did Halo 3 one year.

1560
02:00:56,296 --> 02:00:57,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what was last year.

1561
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:03,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we were broadcasting versus Excitebike was the last game last year.

1562
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:04,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1563
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:06,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember now.

1564
02:01:07,577 --> 02:01:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: so by the way speaking of Penny Arcade Expo sadly it looks like no one from OLR is going Loki obviously is not going to be able to go DarkSakura has not been planning on going I was kind of on the fence right now I'm a real heavy no on PAX if something comes up like a really great opportunity in the next few days then I'll change my mind but right now there's just so much other stuff going on I just think there's other stuff I can do besides Penny Arcade Expo which is kind of sad because I certainly would like to see the listeners up there and so forth but I'll just have to try again next year

1565
02:01:37,876 --> 02:01:39,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone wants to pay for me, I'll go.

1566
02:01:39,357 --> 02:01:41,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.

1567
02:01:41,539 --> 02:01:42,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm starting school.

1568
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other thing.

1569
02:01:44,182 --> 02:02:00,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I am still aiming for, and this should be clear, the one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year is because I am still definitely set on going unless something happens to PAX Boston next year, which I know is weird because I'm on the West Coast, but I do want to go visit the East Coast.

1570
02:02:00,657 --> 02:02:01,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to Boston.

1571
02:02:01,557 --> 02:02:01,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go.

1572
02:02:02,438 --> 02:02:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at that.

1573
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:03,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1574
02:02:20,884 --> 02:02:36,718
[SPEAKER_02]: uh yeah that's that's my plan you know again if something developed like if if there's this huge opportunity for OLR all games that I've heard but I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting again this year or anything I think Bobby was heading all that up last year and I think he's trying to do something for at least his show this year

1575
02:02:37,338 --> 02:02:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I am still hoping for PAX Boston.

1576
02:02:38,359 --> 02:02:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1577
02:02:57,568 --> 02:02:58,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1578
02:03:24,652 --> 02:03:25,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to go again.

1579
02:03:25,713 --> 02:03:36,142
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston, because then it won't only be like OMG PAX, but OMG I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before, and I have friends there, so cool.

1580
02:03:37,182 --> 02:03:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our e-mail bag, and I'm sure the mail bag is busting at the seams this week because we haven't been on in a little while.

1581
02:03:46,248 --> 02:03:46,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1582
02:03:46,608 --> 02:03:47,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just average size.

1583
02:03:48,089 --> 02:03:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?

1584
02:03:50,631 --> 02:03:52,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a dude standing in his underwear on The Sims.

1585
02:03:52,852 --> 02:03:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?

1586
02:03:53,573 --> 02:03:54,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bathing suit.

1587
02:03:54,513 --> 02:03:55,394
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in a Speedo.

1588
02:03:55,714 --> 02:03:56,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

1589
02:03:56,195 --> 02:03:56,615
[SPEAKER_08]: See, look.

1590
02:03:57,375 --> 02:03:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Tidy Whitey's from back here.

1591
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:04,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that they were based off the same model, but I see.

1592
02:04:05,142 --> 02:04:06,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, this doesn't answer the question, though.

1593
02:04:06,622 --> 02:04:07,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Another black.

1594
02:04:07,142 --> 02:04:09,663
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing designing a naked dude?

1595
02:04:10,363 --> 02:04:11,184
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not naked.

1596
02:04:12,204 --> 02:04:12,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Half naked.

1597
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:16,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in.

1598
02:04:17,486 --> 02:04:18,426
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have seen what I had him in.

1599
02:04:18,526 --> 02:04:19,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, here's what I had him in before.

1600
02:04:21,427 --> 02:04:22,447
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes for great radio.

1601
02:04:22,888 --> 02:04:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1602
02:04:23,148 --> 02:04:25,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I had him in these little short things before.

1603
02:04:27,729 --> 02:04:28,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what he was in before.

1604
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:29,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1605
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: He can stay in those fine.

1606
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:31,751
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't care.

1607
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:36,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's funny that I look over there and then suddenly, yes, it's Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock.

1608
02:04:39,473 --> 02:04:43,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem is, is that I changed out the default skin.

1609
02:04:43,254 --> 02:04:44,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's like extra buff now.

1610
02:04:45,995 --> 02:04:48,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and besides that, the underwear is better.

1611
02:04:48,573 --> 02:04:51,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1612
02:04:51,454 --> 02:04:54,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com if you want to send us some emails.

1613
02:04:56,137 --> 02:04:58,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the first email.

1614
02:04:59,799 --> 02:05:04,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to go in chronological order, but this comes from...

1615
02:05:08,143 --> 02:05:11,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm really not going to read the explanation of the guy's name.

1616
02:05:11,745 --> 02:05:14,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I apologize for fucking up your last show.

1617
02:05:14,526 --> 02:05:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I accidentally sent all my contacts that message.

1618
02:05:18,008 --> 02:05:18,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not hate me.

1619
02:05:18,848 --> 02:05:21,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate spam too and my email is filled with spam.

1620
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:26,031
[SPEAKER_08]: As for the Skype shit, I was using my PSP on a horrible connection.

1621
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the market for a computer.

1622
02:05:27,572 --> 02:05:28,613
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Juan, isn't it?

1623
02:05:28,793 --> 02:05:29,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1624
02:05:29,073 --> 02:05:29,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading this.

1625
02:05:30,033 --> 02:05:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's who it is.

1626
02:05:31,974 --> 02:05:32,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Windows Vista.

1627
02:05:34,042 --> 02:05:35,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know any good operating systems?

1628
02:05:36,005 --> 02:05:41,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Linux Mint, it's free Windows 7 is going to be better than Vista Linux Mint is better than it all

1629
02:05:45,557 --> 02:05:50,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, and he sent a couple by accident, so I am just going to read the one that looked like it made the most sense.

1630
02:05:51,963 --> 02:06:02,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR, I wanted to say that almost all the game purchases I've made, I've recently made, have either been talked about or recommended on your show, and I love them all.

1631
02:06:03,033 --> 02:06:06,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose, and it is this.

1632
02:06:06,957 --> 02:06:09,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well alive...

1633
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:17,843
[SPEAKER_08]: for the now old school gaming and I would like to expand my gaming horizon and start to include some old school stuff.

1634
02:06:18,223 --> 02:06:22,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just wondering if you guys had a good starter console for someone like me.

1635
02:06:22,564 --> 02:06:23,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks guys, Mike V.

1636
02:06:25,253 --> 02:06:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 years old?

1637
02:06:26,554 --> 02:06:25,834
13.

1638
02:06:26,734 --> 02:06:31,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I think we have a listener that claims to be our youngest listener at 14.

1639
02:06:31,176 --> 02:06:32,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he just got beat.

1640
02:06:32,357 --> 02:06:32,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, dude.

1641
02:06:33,137 --> 02:06:44,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Just pick up one of those used, I would say, you have the Famicom NES systems that are kind of third-party now that you can pick up.

1642
02:06:44,803 --> 02:06:45,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Pick up one of those.

1643
02:06:45,664 --> 02:06:48,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to one of your used game shops.

1644
02:06:48,545 --> 02:06:52,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even, I was reading, there's a lot of people that found pretty good deals at thrift stores and stuff.

1645
02:06:52,727 --> 02:06:54,188
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find some old consoles.

1646
02:06:54,648 --> 02:06:57,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually found discontinued games at thrift stores.

1647
02:06:57,249 --> 02:07:03,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I found, of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin for the Odyssey 2.

1648
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:04,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1649
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:05,650
[SPEAKER_08]: At a thrift store.

1650
02:07:06,071 --> 02:07:08,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, DarkTetsuyu makes a good point.

1651
02:07:08,771 --> 02:07:09,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the Wii.

1652
02:07:10,011 --> 02:07:11,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Virtual Console.

1653
02:07:12,952 --> 02:07:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty faithful recreation of the original stuff.

1654
02:07:15,693 --> 02:07:17,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13.

1655
02:07:17,893 --> 02:07:20,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel so old because that means I would have been 18 when he was born.

1656
02:07:21,034 --> 02:07:21,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1657
02:07:22,574 --> 02:07:39,743
[SPEAKER_02]: but Super Nintendo if you missed out honestly Super Nintendo I don't think has ever been beaten in terms of great consoles Super Nintendo was the best gaming console purely 100% game console Super Nintendo was the best gaming console they ever made if you're going to start anywhere I say start there

1658
02:07:40,323 --> 02:07:41,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew,

1659
02:07:56,118 --> 02:08:02,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Nintendo did have a few better versions like Super Street Fighter 2 I thought was better on Super Nintendo.

1660
02:08:03,021 --> 02:08:13,985
[SPEAKER_08]: The other, and this is of course just for sampling purposes, you know, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try GameTap or, you know, Zofar's domain.

1661
02:08:15,526 --> 02:08:18,307
[SPEAKER_08]: But I actually, the Wii's going to be your best bet.

1662
02:08:18,387 --> 02:08:24,890
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can sample the Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world, Neo Geo, you know, go that way.

1663
02:08:25,748 --> 02:08:25,868
[SPEAKER_02]: VALVe

1664
02:08:50,272 --> 02:08:51,393
[SPEAKER_08]: The Steam Clan.

1665
02:08:51,693 --> 02:08:54,915
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of old school stuff.

1666
02:08:54,935 --> 02:08:57,376
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have the old PC stuff that we played.

1667
02:08:57,976 --> 02:08:58,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it.

1668
02:08:58,817 --> 02:09:00,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the old LucasArts stuff.

1669
02:09:00,698 --> 02:09:01,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

1670
02:09:01,418 --> 02:09:02,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I just downloaded Loom for $5.

1671
02:09:03,539 --> 02:09:04,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

1672
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:08,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to go buy the TurboGrafx version that's $35 at a local store.

1673
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:09,783
[SPEAKER_08]: But, hey.

1674
02:09:11,627 --> 02:09:21,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want a list of actual games, go ahead and sample the different systems.

1675
02:09:21,372 --> 02:09:22,113
[SPEAKER_08]: See what you think.

1676
02:09:22,493 --> 02:09:24,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It would help to know what kind of games you're into.

1677
02:09:24,574 --> 02:09:26,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you liking the old school RPGs?

1678
02:09:26,355 --> 02:09:28,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you liking the very simple things?

1679
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:31,418
[SPEAKER_08]: The RPGs, you're going to want to go with the SNES.

1680
02:09:32,058 --> 02:09:34,940
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s arcade games were very much all about repetition.

1681
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:38,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at some of the greatest video games of all time that came out of the 80s.

1682
02:09:38,702 --> 02:09:39,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man.

1683
02:09:39,443 --> 02:09:42,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That board never freaking changed the whole time.

1684
02:09:42,665 --> 02:09:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Until it degraded.

1685
02:09:44,686 --> 02:09:45,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Donkey Kong.

1686
02:09:45,827 --> 02:09:49,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically a loop of the same, what, three screens, right?

1687
02:09:49,429 --> 02:09:51,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Three with the Pie Factory.

1688
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:53,812
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one.

1689
02:09:54,833 --> 02:09:57,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Play the one with the Pie Factory or you're not really playing Donkey Kong.

1690
02:09:57,514 --> 02:09:59,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Play to a kill screen.

1691
02:10:00,016 --> 02:10:00,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1692
02:10:01,902 --> 02:10:02,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Be what's-his-face.

1693
02:10:03,244 --> 02:10:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Billy what's-his-face.

1694
02:10:05,385 --> 02:10:05,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1695
02:10:05,966 --> 02:10:06,266
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1696
02:10:06,286 --> 02:10:10,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'd like to see our young 13-year-old listener accomplish.

1697
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a life goal to beat some of these scores on these 80s games.

1698
02:10:16,038 --> 02:10:16,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari 2600 Atari 2600 Atari 2600

1699
02:10:44,122 --> 02:10:46,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay?

1700
02:10:46,484 --> 02:10:50,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know anyone like that, do I?

1701
02:11:05,185 --> 02:11:05,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Tease, tease, tease.

1702
02:11:34,006 --> 02:11:36,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume this is an older neighbor then.

1703
02:11:37,308 --> 02:11:42,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I continually remind him that the Beatles are a band, not the second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it.

1704
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:52,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the decision of whether or not the game gets made lies with the band, the copyright owners of their music and EA, and really, he has zero say.

1705
02:11:52,875 --> 02:11:55,156
[SPEAKER_08]: All he can do is decide whether or not to buy the game.

1706
02:11:55,276 --> 02:11:57,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell him that even though the band may enjoy...

1707
02:11:59,298 --> 02:12:00,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy playing music.

1708
02:12:00,178 --> 02:12:03,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, they, as well as just about any band out there, have three goals.

1709
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Become famous, become rich, and get laid.

1710
02:12:05,981 --> 02:12:06,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1711
02:12:07,621 --> 02:12:09,122
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to remember this, too.

1712
02:12:09,742 --> 02:12:11,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something to tell your neighbor.

1713
02:12:11,343 --> 02:12:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that at E3, let's not forget, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, and George Harrison's wife.

1714
02:12:20,848 --> 02:12:21,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I forget her name.

1715
02:12:22,028 --> 02:12:24,950
[SPEAKER_02]: They all came out on stage in support of this game.

1716
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:25,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1717
02:12:26,846 --> 02:12:27,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the end.

1718
02:12:28,387 --> 02:12:28,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1719
02:12:28,828 --> 02:12:29,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, tell your neighbor that.

1720
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:37,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him that if he were in the Beatles, would he have turned down buttloads of money the EA was shelling out to make the game?

1721
02:12:37,575 --> 02:12:41,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time he tries to say he would have, I outright call on the bullshit answer.

1722
02:12:41,738 --> 02:12:55,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, there are people who actually are really talented musicians who are in bands for the purpose of

1723
02:12:56,834 --> 02:12:57,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1724
02:13:15,330 --> 02:13:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Great comments from Shaq, and I read these real quick, because Marissa Congusto has a great comment.

1725
02:13:19,855 --> 02:13:25,420
[SPEAKER_02]: My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent with their image or message, but if it creates new fans, cool.

1726
02:13:26,121 --> 02:13:32,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, especially when we talk about, you know, generation and, you know, this whole thing, you know, certainly the 13-year-old who emailed us before was...

1727
02:13:32,307 --> 02:13:34,189
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1728
02:13:52,579 --> 02:14:02,903
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, though, I don't think that... I think it's a generalization to say that people get in a band to be famous, rich, and get laid.

1729
02:14:03,604 --> 02:14:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1730
02:14:04,844 --> 02:14:09,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the first thing, and this is honestly...

1731
02:14:11,576 --> 02:14:13,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done things with groups before, like I was in a jazz band.

1732
02:14:14,518 --> 02:14:15,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I played in a jazz band.

1733
02:14:15,859 --> 02:14:17,540
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get paid for shit.

1734
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:22,443
[SPEAKER_08]: They maybe gave us some gas money, but we did it because it was something that we loved to do.

1735
02:14:23,864 --> 02:14:32,069
[SPEAKER_08]: You like getting the crowd into it, knowing that you're evoking that emotional response and the people that you're performing for.

1736
02:14:32,089 --> 02:14:33,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a big thing.

1737
02:14:33,069 --> 02:14:35,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a massive adrenaline rush.

1738
02:14:36,692 --> 02:14:43,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the people who I think have had staying power are the people that love what they do in the end.

1739
02:14:43,836 --> 02:14:44,756
[SPEAKER_08]: That's honestly what I think.

1740
02:14:46,297 --> 02:14:50,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, usually these bands that are created to get laid are the ones that break up after one album.

1741
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:51,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1742
02:14:54,652 --> 02:14:55,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Next area here.

1743
02:14:56,354 --> 02:15:04,102
[SPEAKER_08]: This may be old news to the three of you, but for the sake of other listeners, I thought I'd throw this out there, especially for those who own both the 360 as well as the PS3.

1744
02:15:04,542 --> 02:15:15,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, if you have an external HDD formatted in FAT32 with miscellaneous media on it, music photos, whatever, the HDD will work on both systems.

1745
02:15:15,894 --> 02:15:20,636
[SPEAKER_08]: This does not mean you can play system specific DLC or downloadable games on the other system.

1746
02:15:21,076 --> 02:15:23,617
[SPEAKER_08]: It just means that you can use the other media on both systems.

1747
02:15:23,757 --> 02:15:30,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I discovered that my external hard drive worked on my 360 last weekend shortly after the last show.

1748
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:32,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically, I use them on my PS3.

1749
02:15:33,809 --> 02:15:39,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, as per usual, every time I hear that as per usual, it makes me think of Eddie Izzard.

1750
02:15:39,675 --> 02:15:43,099
[SPEAKER_08]: We've left you a huge fuck-off horse, as per usual!

1751
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1752
02:15:45,421 --> 02:15:51,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I'd end this email with some of my visual recommendations from the video section of the PSN store.

1753
02:15:51,628 --> 02:15:53,470
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, I have three recommendations.

1754
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:55,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Season 1 of the original Transformers series from the 80s.

1755
02:15:55,832 --> 02:15:56,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

1756
02:15:56,733 --> 02:16:04,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan and centers around two warring clans of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

1757
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:05,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1758
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:07,182
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 4, 5, and 6.

1759
02:16:07,362 --> 02:16:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: In limbo.

1760
02:16:09,704 --> 02:16:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: With these selections, you can't go wrong.

1761
02:16:11,405 --> 02:16:12,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Zarkon ate them.

1762
02:16:13,507 --> 02:16:14,588
[SPEAKER_08]: As they are all pretty good.

1763
02:16:15,088 --> 02:16:17,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email.

1764
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:18,331
[SPEAKER_08]: It's appreciated.

1765
02:16:18,351 --> 02:16:21,313
[SPEAKER_08]: This email is brought to you by Florida, the limp wangus of America.

1766
02:16:22,454 --> 02:16:23,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's that from?

1767
02:16:23,095 --> 02:16:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Spazinator.

1768
02:16:27,441 --> 02:16:28,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it or we got more?

1769
02:16:29,702 --> 02:16:31,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me.

1770
02:16:33,282 --> 02:16:38,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The band that was formed mostly to get laid was Poison and they were very successful.

1771
02:16:41,104 --> 02:16:42,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's still getting laid.

1772
02:16:42,885 --> 02:16:43,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1773
02:16:44,485 --> 02:16:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1774
02:16:44,785 --> 02:16:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid.

1775
02:16:49,304 --> 02:16:51,585
[SPEAKER_08]: This comes, um, okay.

1776
02:16:52,246 --> 02:16:57,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I originally intended this message to be, um, a Rob, I miss you and wow type of thing.

1777
02:16:58,129 --> 02:17:02,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I came to the website to see the OLRs temporarily, I hope, on hiatus.

1778
02:17:02,071 --> 02:17:02,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Say it ain't so.

1779
02:17:03,511 --> 02:17:06,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things are well with everyone.

1780
02:17:07,593 --> 02:17:08,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess I'll have to wait and see.

1781
02:17:08,634 --> 02:17:10,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and Rob, I do miss seeing you and wow.

1782
02:17:10,655 --> 02:17:12,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can play together again sometime.

1783
02:17:12,416 --> 02:17:18,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Your old pally, ghoulie, nin, nin tinctus?

1784
02:17:19,419 --> 02:17:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: 99.

1785
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1786
02:17:20,562 --> 02:17:21,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us called her for short.

1787
02:17:22,046 --> 02:17:23,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

1788
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:24,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 99 cents without vowels.

1789
02:17:25,335 --> 02:17:25,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1790
02:17:25,936 --> 02:17:26,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1791
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:34,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you know, I have my reasons for leaving WoW, and I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO.

1792
02:17:34,513 --> 02:17:36,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be in Final Fantasy XIV for sure.

1793
02:17:36,914 --> 02:17:37,934
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, no doubt.

1794
02:17:38,374 --> 02:17:42,436
[SPEAKER_02]: At least when it first comes out, I'm gonna have to play it for the first month, just to see.

1795
02:17:43,296 --> 02:17:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it goes beyond that, I don't know.

1796
02:17:45,437 --> 02:17:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, WoW, I think I just finally, you know, you play something for so long, you just finally, like, I just don't have it in me anymore.

1797
02:17:51,859 --> 02:17:51,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1798
02:17:52,850 --> 02:18:00,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob with two B's, our dear friend who always links me to informative articles, linked a couple that were on game politics.

1799
02:18:01,837 --> 02:18:08,362
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them saying that video games are blamed for low vitamin D in children.

1800
02:18:08,382 --> 02:18:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not going out in the sun enough?

1801
02:18:12,225 --> 02:18:13,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I would suppose so.

1802
02:18:13,245 --> 02:18:13,686
[SPEAKER_02]: How funny.

1803
02:18:13,706 --> 02:18:16,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure.

1804
02:18:17,568 --> 02:18:23,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that really it's more, for the high blood pressure, I would really think that it's more of the

1805
02:18:24,506 --> 02:18:26,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Not getting out and getting enough exercise sort of thing.

1806
02:18:26,828 --> 02:18:30,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And also low vitamin D. It's exactly like you said, kids aren't getting enough sunlight.

1807
02:18:30,612 --> 02:18:33,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things.

1808
02:18:33,614 --> 02:18:37,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't watch Oprah, but it was on in the waiting room of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed.

1809
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:50,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that most people, especially in America and in big cities, are very vitamin D deficient because of sunblock.

1810
02:18:51,696 --> 02:18:56,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually am not allowed to use sunblock because I am very vitamin D deficient myself.

1811
02:18:56,739 --> 02:18:58,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to use sunblock.

1812
02:18:58,981 --> 02:19:01,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to take supplements or something if I'm lacking it.

1813
02:19:01,502 --> 02:19:07,906
[SPEAKER_08]: What they say is that everyone should have 15 minutes of unfiltered sunlight.

1814
02:19:10,008 --> 02:19:10,528
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 minutes a day.

1815
02:19:10,808 --> 02:19:12,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I can handle that if I wear a hat.

1816
02:19:12,708 --> 02:19:13,028
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1817
02:19:32,591 --> 02:19:36,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's only when I'm going to be out all day, like Disneyland or Great America.

1818
02:19:37,154 --> 02:19:38,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just dumb not to do that.

1819
02:19:38,535 --> 02:19:45,360
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies is the synthesis is made with vitamin A and UV radiation.

1820
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:46,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunlight.

1821
02:19:46,901 --> 02:19:48,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this is incredibly interesting.

1822
02:19:48,502 --> 02:19:48,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Not.

1823
02:19:49,843 --> 02:19:50,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1824
02:19:51,344 --> 02:19:52,024
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we talking about?

1825
02:19:52,064 --> 02:19:52,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1826
02:19:52,384 --> 02:19:53,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't paying attention.

1827
02:19:53,285 --> 02:19:53,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Vitamins.

1828
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:55,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Like breakfast cereal.

1829
02:19:55,426 --> 02:19:58,448
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you eat Special K because you get lots of vitamins in it, remember?

1830
02:19:58,608 --> 02:19:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Drink fortified milk.

1831
02:19:59,629 --> 02:20:00,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat your Wheaties.

1832
02:20:01,724 --> 02:20:03,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to drink the vitamin D milk.

1833
02:20:03,486 --> 02:20:05,868
[SPEAKER_08]: You can, by the way, supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish.

1834
02:20:06,889 --> 02:20:11,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what are the vitamins, since I'm going to ask totally tangentially, that you can get too much of?

1835
02:20:11,834 --> 02:20:16,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Like C, you can never get enough vitamin C. Like, you know, if you get too much, you go peep.

1836
02:20:16,138 --> 02:20:16,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You peep it out.

1837
02:20:16,798 --> 02:20:17,439
[SPEAKER_02]: You pee it out.

1838
02:20:17,959 --> 02:20:20,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones?

1839
02:20:20,402 --> 02:20:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there a limit?

1840
02:20:22,443 --> 02:20:24,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I know zinc has a dangerous limit.

1841
02:20:24,064 --> 02:20:26,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Your minerals will have a limit.

1842
02:20:26,505 --> 02:20:27,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Iron, zinc, and all that.

1843
02:20:27,305 --> 02:20:32,587
[SPEAKER_08]: With vitamins, actually, you can have an overdose of niacin, but it takes a long time to build up.

1844
02:20:33,428 --> 02:20:34,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Beta carotene turns your skin orange.

1845
02:20:35,268 --> 02:20:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that when I was two.

1846
02:20:36,729 --> 02:20:37,229
[SPEAKER_02]: True story.

1847
02:20:37,469 --> 02:20:39,810
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was two years old, my parents had me to the ER because I was orange.

1848
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:40,971
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your name in the Partridge family?

1849
02:20:41,011 --> 02:20:41,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan Day?

1850
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:45,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching a special about the Partridge family that...

1851
02:20:46,073 --> 02:20:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, get happy.

1852
02:20:47,915 --> 02:20:54,323
[SPEAKER_08]: She ate so many carrots because that's all she ate that she had a buildup of beta-carotene in her system.

1853
02:20:54,664 --> 02:21:01,412
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know the yellow rice that they pass out internationally is actually beta-carotene fortified because of deficiencies in those areas, so...

1854
02:21:01,892 --> 02:21:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, there's just certain, you know me, even though I may not always She's not a doctor, don't take her advice.

1855
02:21:10,136 --> 02:21:12,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a big nutrition nerd.

1856
02:21:12,356 --> 02:21:16,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if I don't even follow my own advice all the time, I still know it.

1857
02:21:16,578 --> 02:21:18,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked at GNC like freaking forever.

1858
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:19,761
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1859
02:21:41,519 --> 02:21:47,847
[SPEAKER_08]: To put it in perspective to a non-game player, the claims are also stating these two things are also caused by video games.

1860
02:21:48,187 --> 02:21:50,850
[SPEAKER_08]: One, playing video games reduces incidence of skin cancer.

1861
02:21:51,932 --> 02:21:53,073
[SPEAKER_08]: That's back to the sun.

1862
02:21:54,726 --> 02:21:58,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing video games reduces bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries.

1863
02:21:59,368 --> 02:22:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, duh.

1864
02:22:01,309 --> 02:22:04,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds even worse when you talk about the benefits of video games.

1865
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:05,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Benefits in quotes.

1866
02:22:05,890 --> 02:22:12,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It points out that the events, playing video games, and ailments vary independently of each other.

1867
02:22:12,653 --> 02:22:14,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Silly pseudoscientists.

1868
02:22:15,794 --> 02:22:17,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a bunch of ridiculousness.

1869
02:22:20,992 --> 02:22:24,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, playing video games gives you a rash.

1870
02:22:25,957 --> 02:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidding.

1871
02:22:26,618 --> 02:22:26,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Itchy.

1872
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:29,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Last email.

1873
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:30,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR crew.

1874
02:22:30,521 --> 02:22:30,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1875
02:22:30,882 --> 02:22:34,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just saying hey.

1876
02:22:34,485 --> 02:22:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1877
02:22:36,687 --> 02:22:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: AZHP here.

1878
02:22:37,929 --> 02:22:38,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a joke for you.

1879
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:40,551
[SPEAKER_08]: What does a cow eat?

1880
02:22:40,631 --> 02:22:41,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1881
02:22:41,312 --> 02:22:42,573
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what do gay horses eat?

1882
02:22:42,853 --> 02:22:43,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1883
02:22:48,777 --> 02:22:49,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, read the damn email.

1884
02:22:49,977 --> 02:22:51,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put the mic down, I promise.

1885
02:22:52,358 --> 02:22:52,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1886
02:22:52,978 --> 02:22:53,699
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you heard it.

1887
02:22:54,059 --> 02:22:55,539
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Rob putting down the mic.

1888
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:57,720
[SPEAKER_08]: ACHP here.

1889
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:59,680
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'm glad that... Where's the duct tape?

1890
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:00,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just tape his hands together.

1891
02:23:01,701 --> 02:23:04,922
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'm glad that my last email warranted a gold star.

1892
02:23:06,883 --> 02:23:16,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I doubt this one will earn similar acclaim, but I want to relate to you all briefly a synopsis of the way way off-Broadway DDR musical I came across on the internet.

1893
02:23:16,686 --> 02:23:16,926
[SPEAKER_08]: What?! !

1894
02:23:17,586 --> 02:23:20,108
[SPEAKER_08]: and hopefully it will distribute all as much as it did me.

1895
02:23:20,428 --> 02:23:21,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it got a let from me.

1896
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop me if you've heard this one.

1897
02:23:23,830 --> 02:23:35,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Long story short, there's a guy named Moonbeam Funk, which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first, who carries around a fetus in a jar on his belt and starts a dance revolution in a city where dancing is prohibited.

1898
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:47,966
[SPEAKER_08]: He is joined by a small child named Small Child and Small Child's prostitute sister Trampling Sally.

1899
02:23:49,086 --> 02:23:56,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Moonbeam is about to unleash a dance move called the Flaming Rooster, but it is stopped by policemen who wear kilts.

1900
02:23:57,532 --> 02:24:05,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The Revolution disbands, Moonbeam Funk leaves, and comes back later to have sex with Trampoline Sally after performing The Flaming Rooster.

1901
02:24:05,357 --> 02:24:09,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Kills her during sex, and ends up in a catastrophic level 9 dance-off.

1902
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:10,621
[SPEAKER_08]: See what they did there?

1903
02:24:11,581 --> 02:24:17,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Ordered by a judge where he faces off against Jacquees, who loved Trampoline Sally but had his legs broken by the police.

1904
02:24:18,226 --> 02:24:23,609
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Trampoline Sally's ghost gives Jacquees dancer juice, and he wins despite having broken legs.

1905
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:25,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I can't take it.

1906
02:24:25,611 --> 02:24:26,912
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one sentence left.

1907
02:24:27,732 --> 02:24:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Moonbeam Funk returns to his home planet using gravity shoes.

1908
02:24:31,895 --> 02:24:33,016
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't make this stuff up.

1909
02:24:33,516 --> 02:24:43,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This is somewhere between camp that they know is camp and the most pretentious goddamn modern art bullshit I've ever heard of in my life.

1910
02:24:43,223 --> 02:24:47,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember they made a DDR movie one time in Japan?

1911
02:24:48,386 --> 02:24:48,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1912
02:24:49,106 --> 02:24:50,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop trying to make a movie out of DDR.

1913
02:24:50,888 --> 02:24:51,848
[SPEAKER_02]: They are all stupid.

1914
02:24:51,868 --> 02:24:54,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan.

1915
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:55,591
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

1916
02:24:55,611 --> 02:24:56,732
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.

1917
02:24:57,752 --> 02:24:58,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that.

1918
02:24:58,613 --> 02:25:00,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I just remembered how hilarious that movie was.

1919
02:25:00,674 --> 02:25:13,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, while this may still sound like the best musical ever, bullshit, the one thing it could do to ruin itself more than it already had, it did.

1920
02:25:13,863 --> 02:25:16,264
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't use Taku.

1921
02:25:16,304 --> 02:25:17,285
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't use B4U.

1922
02:25:17,645 --> 02:25:19,586
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't use, oh, just name the Bumani artists.

1923
02:25:19,606 --> 02:25:20,207
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't use them.

1924
02:25:21,347 --> 02:25:23,909
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they used DDR Disney's rave music.

1925
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:26,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Zippity-Doo-Dah and Chim-Chim-Cherry and Night of Fire.

1926
02:25:27,884 --> 02:25:42,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I left out a lot of things, but you can check out the article at vjarmy.com I'm actually going to put it in the chat room, but it's vjarmy.com slash archives slash 2008 slash 12 slash bucketoftears.php

1927
02:25:45,644 --> 02:25:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all separated by an underscore.

1928
02:25:47,885 --> 02:25:48,926
[SPEAKER_02]: For details.

1929
02:25:49,086 --> 02:25:53,407
[SPEAKER_02]: The best word I can think of to describe this play, or at least what it sounds like, is gay-tarded.

1930
02:25:53,668 --> 02:25:55,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really what it sounds like.

1931
02:25:56,089 --> 02:25:58,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you don't want to say that's gay because that's offensive.

1932
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:01,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to say that's retarded because that's actually really offensive too.

1933
02:26:01,851 --> 02:26:06,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to make up a new word that, so when it's a new word, it wouldn't be offensive to either group.

1934
02:26:06,253 --> 02:26:06,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I still like my word.

1935
02:26:07,253 --> 02:26:07,433
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1936
02:26:07,473 --> 02:26:07,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Butt-tard.

1937
02:26:08,194 --> 02:26:08,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Butt-tard?

1938
02:26:08,774 --> 02:26:09,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Butt-tard.

1939
02:26:09,174 --> 02:26:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using that for years.

1940
02:26:09,995 --> 02:26:10,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say gay-tarded.

1941
02:26:11,175 --> 02:26:14,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So this play sounds completely gay-tarded is what it sounds like.

1942
02:26:14,537 --> 02:26:18,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I just – I can't fathom paying money.

1943
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:22,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much – like New York City Theater can sometimes be expensive.

1944
02:26:22,062 --> 02:26:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much money do they want for this?

1945
02:26:24,683 --> 02:26:25,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1946
02:26:25,483 --> 02:26:25,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1947
02:26:25,944 --> 02:26:27,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anybody can do theater.

1948
02:26:27,424 --> 02:26:31,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make.

1949
02:26:33,366 --> 02:26:34,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty nasty.

1950
02:26:35,166 --> 02:26:42,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully this email isn't too long to make it to the show because I think a lot of old fans of DDR will get a laugh or at least a facepalm out of this.

1951
02:26:43,209 --> 02:26:43,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I got both.

1952
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:46,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Long live DDR EZHP.

1953
02:26:46,850 --> 02:26:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ranma.

1954
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The tickets were $20, says Ranma.

1955
02:26:50,731 --> 02:26:51,271
[SPEAKER_02]: No thank you.

1956
02:26:51,532 --> 02:26:52,872
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $20 I could spend on like

1957
02:26:54,568 --> 02:26:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do drugs, kids.

1958
02:27:07,657 --> 02:27:08,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Winners don't use drugs, folks.

1959
02:27:10,118 --> 02:27:14,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're on steroids and are on the Chinese swim team.

1960
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:18,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to send us an email.

1961
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:23,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And the folks in chat are pointing out it's way off-Broadway, as in way, way, way off-Broadway.

1962
02:27:23,403 --> 02:27:24,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's in Staten Island.

1963
02:27:24,543 --> 02:27:26,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how far off-Broadway it is, okay?

1964
02:27:26,924 --> 02:27:28,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's true or not.

1965
02:27:28,645 --> 02:27:32,666
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, a couple more stories for you guys, and then your calls on the Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.

1966
02:27:32,706 --> 02:27:32,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1967
02:27:35,390 --> 02:27:35,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1968
02:27:37,452 --> 02:27:42,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion that's going to actually...

1969
02:27:43,777 --> 02:27:44,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Wrecking Crew Mode

1970
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,761
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1971
02:28:31,462 --> 02:28:37,624
[SPEAKER_10]: or deposits on the mini-map and support for upcoming download content as well.

1972
02:28:38,824 --> 02:28:51,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And then other fixes they've done, just some other glitches that they were running into, you know, drops in multiplayer and certain ties not being recorded in leaderboards and whatnot.

1973
02:28:52,168 --> 02:28:55,790
[SPEAKER_10]: So overall, just, you know, a pretty nice update.

1974
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:56,870
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um...

1975
02:28:58,035 --> 02:28:58,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1976
02:29:14,936 --> 02:29:16,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like blowing things up.

1977
02:29:16,337 --> 02:29:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of fun.

1978
02:29:17,777 --> 02:29:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row set on Mars.

1979
02:29:19,198 --> 02:29:20,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good way of describing it.

1980
02:29:20,918 --> 02:29:27,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row, but it's the same developer and it's that open world kind of feel to it.

1981
02:29:28,461 --> 02:29:32,223
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a little bit more linear, this game, but it looks fun.

1982
02:29:33,752 --> 02:29:34,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1983
02:29:34,493 --> 02:29:36,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of just blowing things up.

1984
02:29:36,715 --> 02:29:40,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I hear Wrecking Crew mode, I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew.

1985
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:40,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

1986
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:44,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crap.

1987
02:29:44,583 --> 02:29:46,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Woot Explosion, says Misty in chat.

1988
02:29:46,625 --> 02:29:47,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1989
02:29:48,387 --> 02:29:48,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's...

1990
02:29:50,249 --> 02:29:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on to one more story here tonight, and then we're going to open up our Skype lines at 877-GAME-OLR.

1991
02:29:56,091 --> 02:29:59,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And this story has to do with porn.

1992
02:29:59,833 --> 02:30:00,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1993
02:30:01,193 --> 02:30:03,834
[SPEAKER_02]: DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan.

1994
02:30:04,215 --> 02:30:09,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to be bringing on-demand, Blu-ray quality HD adult movies to the PlayStation 3.

1995
02:30:11,117 --> 02:30:11,838
Woo-hoo!

1996
02:30:13,558 --> 02:30:14,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Console war's over.

1997
02:30:16,499 --> 02:30:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, didn't I say that the system that gets porn first would win?

1998
02:30:20,761 --> 02:30:23,342
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was HD DVD and Blu-ray, wasn't it?

1999
02:30:23,902 --> 02:30:24,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

2000
02:30:25,382 --> 02:30:27,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show like two or three years ago.

2001
02:30:28,003 --> 02:30:29,024
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that is they adopted both.

2002
02:30:29,044 --> 02:30:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2003
02:30:31,075 --> 02:30:37,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you do have to have a broadband connection, an HDMI cable, of course, if you want the high def, and, of course, a PlayStation 3.

2004
02:30:38,162 --> 02:30:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You will download the movies for a fee.

2005
02:30:40,444 --> 02:30:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You go onto this DMM.TV Blu-ray website, and then you can search for titles by actress, keyword, what have you.

2006
02:30:48,631 --> 02:30:53,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've ever wanted to see Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators, there you go.

2007
02:30:53,215 --> 02:30:55,858
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch that on PlayStation 3 in full.

2008
02:30:56,158 --> 02:30:57,519
[SPEAKER_02]: High Definition, congratulations.

2009
02:30:57,839 --> 02:31:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's kind of interesting about that, it sounds like they kind of bypassed Sony somehow.

2010
02:31:01,682 --> 02:31:05,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you're logging into their website and downloading them to your PS3 or something.

2011
02:31:05,706 --> 02:31:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that what it sounds like to you?

2012
02:31:08,048 --> 02:31:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: This can't be sponsored by Sony.

2013
02:31:10,149 --> 02:31:13,152
[SPEAKER_02]: This must be using the web browser and some type of backdoor or something.

2014
02:31:14,192 --> 02:31:16,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Pun intended.

2015
02:31:16,554 --> 02:31:20,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be downloading video files to your PS3 or something like that.

2016
02:31:21,318 --> 02:31:23,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Or downloading them to your PC so you can watch them on your PS3.

2017
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:24,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2018
02:31:25,543 --> 02:31:28,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, I don't know, maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there, though.

2019
02:31:29,785 --> 02:31:30,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2020
02:31:32,007 --> 02:31:34,688
[SPEAKER_02]: VidPower calls this 1080p-ness.

2021
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:39,811
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love the listeners.

2022
02:31:40,151 --> 02:31:42,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?

2023
02:31:42,432 --> 02:31:44,293
[SPEAKER_02]: At least all the ones I've ever seen.

2024
02:31:44,653 --> 02:31:49,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I always saw the funny ones, like Final Fuck X and all that, where they did blur it out.

2025
02:31:49,836 --> 02:31:50,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're all blurred out.

2026
02:31:51,876 --> 02:32:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's softcore, it's just all the VagP and stuff gets blurred out SSJ100 Matt says, all we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples We got a bunch of comedians tonight Oh god, this is awful, I'm reading that article by the way D5T is calling dot fuck, apparently Instead of dot hack, there's a porn called dot fuck That's funny

2027
02:32:20,618 --> 02:32:21,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

2028
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2029
02:32:22,379 --> 02:32:22,860
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2030
02:32:24,121 --> 02:32:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

2031
02:32:27,043 --> 02:32:29,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I think... I don't know.

2032
02:32:29,765 --> 02:32:30,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to go on a tangent?

2033
02:32:30,625 --> 02:32:30,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

2034
02:32:30,946 --> 02:32:31,626
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plenty of time.

2035
02:32:31,646 --> 02:32:33,187
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be opening up the Skype line soon anyway.

2036
02:32:33,908 --> 02:32:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to remember...

2037
02:32:35,811 --> 02:32:37,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has sex.

2038
02:32:37,752 --> 02:32:39,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we get here, okay?

2039
02:32:39,713 --> 02:32:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I realize that some people define themselves as asexual, which means you don't really care for sex, but I'm still assuming that at one point or another, you've tried it.

2040
02:32:50,317 --> 02:32:53,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So, everybody has sex.

2041
02:32:54,038 --> 02:32:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's the big deal?

2042
02:32:55,298 --> 02:32:58,820
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, I mean, if you're the 13-year-old listening, you should not be having sex yet.

2043
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:03,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, according to Oprah, you probably already are.

2044
02:33:03,642 --> 02:33:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2045
02:33:04,762 --> 02:33:06,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And why am I watching Oprah?

2046
02:33:06,283 --> 02:33:10,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week for better health.

2047
02:33:10,944 --> 02:33:11,205
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2048
02:33:11,885 --> 02:33:13,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a problem admitting on the show I was 20.

2049
02:33:14,546 --> 02:33:17,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, by Oprah, I would be a late bloomer.

2050
02:33:17,407 --> 02:33:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's people that wait even longer than that.

2051
02:33:19,608 --> 02:33:20,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people 30, 35, 40.

2052
02:33:20,088 --> 02:33:20,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 32.

2053
02:33:23,309 --> 02:33:27,872
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine, but I'm saying at some point, this is not a spiel about virginity.

2054
02:33:27,932 --> 02:33:32,974
[SPEAKER_02]: My spiel is about everybody has sex or thinks about having sex.

2055
02:33:34,335 --> 02:33:37,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So, why is porn such a big taboo, big deal thing?

2056
02:33:38,016 --> 02:33:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, they should just get over it and put porn there.

2057
02:33:41,558 --> 02:33:43,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a country that was founded by Puritans.

2058
02:33:44,279 --> 02:33:47,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they have a hundred masturbators in that film.

2059
02:33:47,841 --> 02:33:51,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just way too much masturbating.

2060
02:33:52,811 --> 02:33:57,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And besides, you own a PS3 if you're interested in this.

2061
02:33:57,877 --> 02:34:00,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, you have access to the internet.

2062
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:06,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, you have access to YouPorn and many other porn alternatives that are free.

2063
02:34:06,786 --> 02:34:11,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you pay for porn when you can get it for free?

2064
02:34:13,207 --> 02:34:25,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Giovedea in chat says I was 21 my cousin is almost 25 and she's still a virgin nothing wrong with that but she probably thinks about it I mean she probably still thinks that doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn

2065
02:34:27,356 --> 02:34:29,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can tell you it was awful

2066
02:34:54,767 --> 02:34:58,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody at some point look at one of the girls and go, How you doing?

2067
02:34:59,131 --> 02:35:00,552
[SPEAKER_10]: No, unfortunately, no, they didn't.

2068
02:35:00,873 --> 02:35:03,735
[SPEAKER_10]: But the woman's name was Monica instead of Monica.

2069
02:35:03,755 --> 02:35:05,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, of course, they have to do that.

2070
02:35:06,098 --> 02:35:08,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I love porn parodies so much.

2071
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:08,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so funny.

2072
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:12,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I still like the one, the Ally McFeel one.

2073
02:35:12,984 --> 02:35:14,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked Beaver and Buttface.

2074
02:35:14,405 --> 02:35:14,726
[SPEAKER_10]: That was...

2075
02:35:15,066 --> 02:35:16,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen that one.

2076
02:35:16,987 --> 02:35:18,487
[SPEAKER_10]: They have Office.

2077
02:35:18,827 --> 02:35:20,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, all the TV shows now are parodies.

2078
02:35:20,568 --> 02:35:22,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek.

2079
02:35:22,968 --> 02:35:25,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Best line I've ever heard in a porno was in Beaver and Buttface.

2080
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to cum or something.

2081
02:35:30,631 --> 02:35:31,171
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awful.

2082
02:35:33,686 --> 02:35:34,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Lounge Radio

2083
02:35:59,656 --> 02:36:00,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2084
02:36:00,376 --> 02:36:01,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a few weeks.

2085
02:36:01,337 --> 02:36:02,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of pissed up energy.

2086
02:36:02,758 --> 02:36:03,418
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we say?

2087
02:36:03,959 --> 02:36:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind tonight?

2088
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:07,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can see that.

2089
02:36:07,801 --> 02:36:13,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I start, Loki, just because the porn is free doesn't mean it's that good.

2090
02:36:14,485 --> 02:36:15,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

2091
02:36:15,365 --> 02:36:16,506
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just not looking hard enough.

2092
02:36:17,767 --> 02:36:20,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I look more than my fair share, okay?

2093
02:36:20,369 --> 02:36:23,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I look more than anybody else in the chat room, okay?

2094
02:36:25,512 --> 02:36:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

2095
02:36:26,886 --> 02:36:34,671
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I called is to make a comment about the whole Best Buy price matching thingamabobber here.

2096
02:36:36,612 --> 02:36:40,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much deals don't make their money.

2097
02:36:42,755 --> 02:36:43,176
[SPEAKER_05]: How so?

2098
02:36:43,196 --> 02:36:49,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I used to work for Best Buy and the discounts at the time were great.

2099
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:51,961
[SPEAKER_05]: 5% above retail cost.

2100
02:36:51,981 --> 02:36:52,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They paid for it.

2101
02:36:53,602 --> 02:36:53,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought

2102
02:36:55,045 --> 02:37:00,667
[SPEAKER_05]: A cable for my PS2 that retailed for $9.99, I paid $1.72 for it.

2103
02:37:02,808 --> 02:37:03,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2104
02:37:04,769 --> 02:37:14,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even if they take a $5 loss off the games, they're still going to make the money back off of the accessories on the games, accessories for the consoles.

2105
02:37:14,924 --> 02:37:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Accessories for Home Theater, Electronics

2106
02:37:37,461 --> 02:37:41,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox 360 game is $48 their cost.

2107
02:37:41,503 --> 02:37:42,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And they may get it cheaper.

2108
02:37:42,904 --> 02:37:46,245
[SPEAKER_10]: It's roughly the high 40s, though, is what they're paying for.

2109
02:37:46,365 --> 02:37:47,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yes, there is a markup there.

2110
02:37:47,806 --> 02:37:51,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, if they drop it down $5, they're not really losing a lot of money.

2111
02:37:52,228 --> 02:37:53,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, they could do it.

2112
02:37:54,049 --> 02:37:55,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's definitely possible.

2113
02:37:55,709 --> 02:38:02,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And accessories also, yes, there's a higher margin on accessories, about 20% on average, if not more than that.

2114
02:38:03,053 --> 02:38:03,213
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2115
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:09,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I guess there is, they won't really be losing out a lot.

2116
02:38:09,881 --> 02:38:17,023
[SPEAKER_10]: But it could get ridiculous, especially if they're dropping the prices, you know, of used games at GameStop or whatever, and they continually do this.

2117
02:38:18,003 --> 02:38:18,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2118
02:38:18,643 --> 02:38:20,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see this program being very successful.

2119
02:38:20,443 --> 02:38:22,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's going to be successful, but not their benefit, I guess.

2120
02:38:24,824 --> 02:38:25,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends.

2121
02:38:25,964 --> 02:38:33,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they do this, they probably won't be having to do their fire sales that they have on games like every eight or nine months, give or take.

2122
02:38:37,878 --> 02:38:38,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see.

2123
02:38:38,658 --> 02:38:42,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really think, though, they're going to expand it past this Utah store?

2124
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:44,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking.

2125
02:38:45,562 --> 02:38:47,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't think so.

2126
02:38:47,443 --> 02:38:50,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they do, it probably won't hit New York City.

2127
02:38:50,705 --> 02:38:56,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, back in March, they had this massive blowout sale on anime.

2128
02:38:56,548 --> 02:38:56,748
[SPEAKER_05]: 50% off.

2129
02:38:57,049 --> 02:39:01,311
[SPEAKER_05]: First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City to see if I can find it.

2130
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:04,851
[SPEAKER_05]: None of the stores in the five boroughs were participating.

2131
02:39:04,871 --> 02:39:09,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth.

2132
02:39:10,074 --> 02:39:10,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2133
02:39:10,514 --> 02:39:16,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we sometimes forget is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions that they don't necessarily have to participate.

2134
02:39:18,497 --> 02:39:18,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

2135
02:39:19,878 --> 02:39:21,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Ranma?

2136
02:39:23,257 --> 02:39:25,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for the call, Ranma.

2137
02:39:25,059 --> 02:39:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2138
02:39:25,519 --> 02:39:26,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, fellas.

2139
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:27,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Love you, Jamie.

2140
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:27,541
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2141
02:39:27,561 --> 02:39:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

2142
02:39:52,995 --> 02:39:58,459
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2143
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:01,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

2144
02:40:01,841 --> 02:40:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2145
02:40:04,328 --> 02:40:05,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Deathwishing.

2146
02:40:05,329 --> 02:40:05,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Deathwishing.

2147
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:07,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear the speakers a little bit.

2148
02:40:07,231 --> 02:40:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Might want to turn them down.

2149
02:40:08,052 --> 02:40:08,532
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2150
02:40:08,592 --> 02:40:09,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

2151
02:40:09,673 --> 02:40:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

2152
02:40:10,494 --> 02:40:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll forgive you this once.

2153
02:40:11,394 --> 02:40:11,695
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

2154
02:40:12,575 --> 02:40:16,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, thanks for, like, making me not be able to sleep tonight with all the porn talk.

2155
02:40:17,139 --> 02:40:17,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're welcome.

2156
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:18,541
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we do here.

2157
02:40:19,361 --> 02:40:20,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Scarring listeners for life.

2158
02:40:21,843 --> 02:40:23,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look, we've got, like, three weeks to make up for it.

2159
02:40:24,386 --> 02:40:31,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but did you guys hear about how they're raising prices on, like, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and, like, Britain and stuff from what I heard?

2160
02:40:32,908 --> 02:40:34,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard about this.

2161
02:40:34,069 --> 02:40:36,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus.

2162
02:40:36,650 --> 02:40:39,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're doing it here also because I think they did.

2163
02:40:39,392 --> 02:40:42,854
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's still $60.

2164
02:40:43,034 --> 02:40:47,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I pre-ordered normally collector's editions for like $70 and this time it was like $80.

2165
02:40:49,418 --> 02:40:51,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Not all collector's editions are $70 either.

2166
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:55,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw they're raising the price way up and it's just like

2167
02:40:56,567 --> 02:40:57,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, kind of not right.

2168
02:40:57,708 --> 02:41:03,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And people care about this, but no one gave a crap about the Wii version of Guitar Hero being $10 more here.

2169
02:41:03,411 --> 02:41:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like $40 or $50 more than the regular?

2170
02:41:07,453 --> 02:41:08,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It was way up there.

2171
02:41:08,033 --> 02:41:08,893
[SPEAKER_02]: The legendary one.

2172
02:41:08,913 --> 02:41:10,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that came with the cat suit.

2173
02:41:10,294 --> 02:41:15,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but this is all... Look at the collector's edition for Modern Warfare.

2174
02:41:15,357 --> 02:41:15,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's like $200.

2175
02:41:16,037 --> 02:41:17,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is true.

2176
02:41:17,378 --> 02:41:19,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And also...

2177
02:41:22,924 --> 02:41:27,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I picked up Chromehounds.

2178
02:41:29,889 --> 02:41:35,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah yes, the old school mech game that dates back to when the 360 first came out and Loki was a big fan of this game.

2179
02:41:36,133 --> 02:41:37,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone should pick it up.

2180
02:41:38,655 --> 02:41:39,676
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like about Chromehounds?

2181
02:41:41,217 --> 02:41:46,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been seeing these ingenious designs people make of mechs.

2182
02:41:49,483 --> 02:41:52,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So far I made one where now I can't be hit directly.

2183
02:41:54,215 --> 02:41:54,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not crap.

2184
02:41:54,636 --> 02:41:54,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

2185
02:42:12,478 --> 02:42:19,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to get it because it was like, you know, Armored Core, and then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether, so I don't know.

2186
02:42:20,142 --> 02:42:22,243
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem with the game was it was too slow.

2187
02:42:22,323 --> 02:42:28,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just like, you know, Armored Core is very quick and it's a mech fighting game very similar to Chromehounds, but it's a lot faster.

2188
02:42:28,747 --> 02:42:29,827
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot more faster paced.

2189
02:42:30,048 --> 02:42:33,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Chromehounds is just slow, slow, slow.

2190
02:42:34,430 --> 02:42:36,131
[SPEAKER_09]: What type of person did you play, huh?

2191
02:42:37,672 --> 02:42:40,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I played a four-legged mech.

2192
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:41,281
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.

2193
02:42:41,861 --> 02:42:42,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Four legs are slow.

2194
02:42:44,223 --> 02:42:45,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I wanted a lot of weapons on there.

2195
02:42:46,765 --> 02:42:47,946
[SPEAKER_09]: You could have used chicken legs.

2196
02:42:48,607 --> 02:42:50,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing to Loki is firepower.

2197
02:42:51,690 --> 02:42:52,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly.

2198
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:55,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've never even watched him play Chromehounds, but I could just tell from knowing Loki.

2199
02:42:55,873 --> 02:42:56,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily.

2200
02:42:57,354 --> 02:43:00,097
[SPEAKER_10]: It was trying to be more all-around.

2201
02:43:00,137 --> 02:43:02,239
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was trying to do, but you can't be all-around.

2202
02:43:02,259 --> 02:43:04,801
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to specialize either close-up or far away.

2203
02:43:04,821 --> 02:43:06,883
[SPEAKER_10]: You've just got to kind of figure out your strategy before you build.

2204
02:43:08,304 --> 02:43:08,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2205
02:43:09,588 --> 02:43:11,750
[SPEAKER_02]: WellDeathWishing, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

2206
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:14,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2, please?

2207
02:43:15,272 --> 02:43:16,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no, we're broke.

2208
02:43:16,193 --> 02:43:17,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even own it myself.

2209
02:43:17,514 --> 02:43:19,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast.

2210
02:43:20,336 --> 02:43:21,436
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Xbox.

2211
02:43:21,656 --> 02:43:24,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast these days.

2212
02:43:24,839 --> 02:43:25,859
[SPEAKER_09]: But no online play.

2213
02:43:28,221 --> 02:43:29,962
[SPEAKER_07]: You kids and your online play!

2214
02:43:30,022 --> 02:43:35,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us redemption codes for the game, we will send you the first one we get.

2215
02:43:35,786 --> 02:43:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

2216
02:43:37,406 --> 02:43:37,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay?

2217
02:43:38,247 --> 02:43:38,687
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2218
02:43:38,787 --> 02:43:39,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, Deathwishing.

2219
02:43:40,228 --> 02:43:40,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

2220
02:43:42,789 --> 02:43:46,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom, if you're listening, you can send those to care of Rob Roberts.

2221
02:43:47,192 --> 02:43:48,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob.

2222
02:43:48,733 --> 02:43:49,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I haven't even reduced it.

2223
02:43:49,934 --> 02:43:50,735
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another call online.

2224
02:43:50,775 --> 02:43:51,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2225
02:43:51,715 --> 02:43:52,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2226
02:43:53,196 --> 02:43:53,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Zaku.

2227
02:43:54,337 --> 02:43:55,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Legend of Zaku.

2228
02:43:56,018 --> 02:43:57,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you checked out the DDR play yet?

2229
02:43:59,077 --> 02:43:59,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which one?

2230
02:43:59,978 --> 02:44:01,580
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that aired last winter?

2231
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,924
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the one with, what the hell is this?

2232
02:44:05,744 --> 02:44:09,168
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever that sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit.

2233
02:44:09,188 --> 02:44:10,369
[SPEAKER_06]: The one with Moonbeam Punk.

2234
02:44:10,389 --> 02:44:13,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Where DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly.

2235
02:44:13,192 --> 02:44:18,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the one I was referring to because that one was actually late last year.

2236
02:44:18,478 --> 02:44:19,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see it?

2237
02:44:20,572 --> 02:44:21,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no.

2238
02:44:21,733 --> 02:44:23,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets.

2239
02:44:23,834 --> 02:44:26,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected.

2240
02:44:28,398 --> 02:44:30,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was shocking to say the least.

2241
02:44:30,861 --> 02:44:36,986
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it sold out for the first few days, it was really hard to get even Will Call for that matter.

2242
02:44:37,847 --> 02:44:39,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Was Tom Cruise in it or something?

2243
02:44:39,789 --> 02:44:41,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did so many people want to see this?

2244
02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:42,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

2245
02:44:42,831 --> 02:44:44,433
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's because DDR.

2246
02:44:44,473 --> 02:44:44,673
[SPEAKER_00]: That's

2247
02:44:44,793 --> 02:44:45,153
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura,

2248
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:07,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5.

2249
02:45:09,634 --> 02:45:21,486
[SPEAKER_00]: From the looks of it, it looks like Activision is in a pissing match between Konami and seeing who can whore out their top franchises the farthest.

2250
02:45:23,008 --> 02:45:26,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?

2251
02:45:27,642 --> 02:45:38,378
[SPEAKER_00]: well, many people, I mean, I'm referring to the fact that there's a lot of hostility towards the fact that they're just doing it for the sake of just milking the franchise even further

2252
02:45:40,253 --> 02:45:44,836
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've gotten in terms of all the comments that I've read so far regarding this story.

2253
02:45:45,096 --> 02:45:50,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's not like there's a Guitar Hero Johnny Cash game coming out.

2254
02:45:50,900 --> 02:45:52,941
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5.

2255
02:45:53,161 --> 02:45:58,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since the third one, you would have just random band characters show up in the game.

2256
02:45:58,165 --> 02:46:01,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to say, it doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash.

2257
02:46:01,887 --> 02:46:05,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I think you hit it on the nail right there.

2258
02:46:05,550 --> 02:46:08,772
[SPEAKER_00]: After the third one, the series pretty much went downhill.

2259
02:46:10,433 --> 02:46:27,382
[SPEAKER_00]: by then Rock Band came out and the rest was history you could add as many guest appearances as many guest stars or any famous people in that game and it still wouldn't make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise Loki asked a good question did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?

2260
02:46:29,026 --> 02:46:33,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I heard of that game, is that the one coming out for the DS?

2261
02:46:33,488 --> 02:46:37,729
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's exactly Guitar Hero, it's just now it's with more family-friendly songs.

2262
02:46:38,029 --> 02:46:41,170
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, it's just another excuse to put out another fucking Guitar Hero game.

2263
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:42,671
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, there you go, Loki, see?

2264
02:46:42,871 --> 02:46:46,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but that's, Zaku, that's the milking of the franchise.

2265
02:46:47,393 --> 02:46:49,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero game.

2266
02:46:49,613 --> 02:46:52,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?

2267
02:46:53,035 --> 02:46:53,775
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have...

2268
02:46:54,315 --> 02:46:57,698
[SPEAKER_00]: When you basically have all your clothes strewn around in Hot Topic.

2269
02:46:58,058 --> 02:47:00,000
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're basically on cereal boxes.

2270
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:08,847
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have those little mini-games that you find right there inside the cereal boxes.

2271
02:47:08,947 --> 02:47:16,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR, the way Konami is hoarded out with the toys in both Subway, Burger King, and to an extent...

2272
02:47:18,856 --> 02:47:20,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Milk in the Franchise is not about merchandising.

2273
02:47:20,757 --> 02:47:24,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Milk in the Franchise is about having five releases for the damn series in one year.

2274
02:47:25,821 --> 02:47:28,303
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sorry, six releases for the franchise in one year.

2275
02:47:28,323 --> 02:47:37,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see what Zaku is saying, though, because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games that have the Guitar Hero name on it, such as little portable things you see in Hot Topic or whatever, I don't know.

2276
02:47:37,930 --> 02:47:38,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that sucks too.

2277
02:47:38,990 --> 02:47:40,711
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of devalues the franchise.

2278
02:47:40,731 --> 02:47:43,292
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets to the point of prevalence where it's just ad nauseum.

2279
02:47:43,352 --> 02:47:50,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Rock Band keeps the whole thing consistent on the fact that you hear a diverse set of music in Rock Band.

2280
02:47:50,534 --> 02:47:54,935
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just hear nothing but all number one hits.

2281
02:47:55,655 --> 02:48:04,078
[SPEAKER_00]: All you hear is just some schmuck band from nowhere getting into Rock Band versus a lot of A-listers on Guitar Hero.

2282
02:48:04,178 --> 02:48:05,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly A-listers.

2283
02:48:05,518 --> 02:48:13,643
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Zaku, it's not that I disagree with you that Activision's milking the shit out of their franchise.

2284
02:48:14,063 --> 02:48:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash in the game.

2285
02:48:16,605 --> 02:48:21,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the first thing in a long time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise where I'm like, that's kind of cool.

2286
02:48:21,388 --> 02:48:22,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the devil's advocate, alright?

2287
02:48:23,389 --> 02:48:27,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Johnny Cash's inclusion to Guitar Hero 5 would pretty much introduce...

2288
02:48:28,292 --> 02:48:28,652
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

2289
02:48:50,757 --> 02:48:56,922
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beatles, and it actually does a good chronology of the whole band's history.

2290
02:48:57,503 --> 02:48:58,544
[SPEAKER_00]: And through their music.

2291
02:48:59,284 --> 02:49:04,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5, packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists.

2292
02:49:04,369 --> 02:49:09,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't like this because you don't think it's respectful enough.

2293
02:49:10,294 --> 02:49:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of threw him in there.

2294
02:49:12,275 --> 02:49:14,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much the case.

2295
02:49:14,357 --> 02:49:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: They just threw him in there to make more cash.

2296
02:49:16,619 --> 02:49:20,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm following you a little better.

2297
02:49:20,643 --> 02:49:21,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

2298
02:49:21,123 --> 02:49:36,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think the milking is coming from the fact that you're just kind of like, hey, let's just reskin, let's just slap a face of a popular rock star on this and put it in our game when somebody like Johnny Cash deserves epic-style treatment.

2299
02:49:37,518 --> 02:49:54,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I mean, with Guitar Hero Metallica, they did it differently in that it came out to be a good game because it not only had Metallica's music, but it had a whole bunch of other metal bands that were probably personally picked by the band, for all we know.

2300
02:49:55,026 --> 02:50:08,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's almost the same as Beatles Rock Band in the sense that it wouldn't do any chronology to the band, but it put it to a level where it's respectful.

2301
02:50:08,777 --> 02:50:14,382
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its own game, it has the entire catalog right there of Metallica's music.

2302
02:50:15,202 --> 02:50:17,524
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the only exception to the fact that

2303
02:50:18,385 --> 02:50:20,267
[SPEAKER_00]: to Activision's milking of the franchise.

2304
02:50:20,767 --> 02:50:26,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it'll get worse once Van Halen gets their own game and then, you know, obviously with that whole Aerosmith thing.

2305
02:50:26,633 --> 02:50:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting to see what develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into 2010.

2306
02:50:30,657 --> 02:50:33,720
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Zaku, I understand where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time.

2307
02:50:33,740 --> 02:50:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to let you go.

2308
02:50:35,462 --> 02:50:36,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great one, okay, Zaku?

2309
02:50:37,003 --> 02:50:38,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, later dude Later

2310
02:51:01,504 --> 02:51:02,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.

2311
02:51:02,385 --> 02:51:09,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the email that I sent you was like a couple weeks old, and I just wanted to update a couple things.

2312
02:51:09,789 --> 02:51:10,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.

2313
02:51:11,330 --> 02:51:21,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, first and foremost, this is probably more directed to Loki, but I just wanted to say my condolences to you and your wife over what happened.

2314
02:51:22,297 --> 02:51:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2315
02:51:23,758 --> 02:51:26,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, believe it or not, I'm not going to go into details,

2316
02:51:27,492 --> 02:51:41,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as for the second topic, I'm kind of surprised you didn't mention it already, but I don't know if you guys are into sports games at all, or at least the arcade style ones.

2317
02:51:57,355 --> 02:52:09,719
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently there was an announcement that EA is going to be making... I'm sorry, did you start... Do we lose him?

2318
02:52:11,239 --> 02:52:12,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm still here.

2319
02:52:12,700 --> 02:52:16,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard there was some echoing, so... Oh, sorry.

2320
02:52:16,101 --> 02:52:17,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm not following you.

2321
02:52:17,681 --> 02:52:20,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of games were you asking if we were into?

2322
02:52:20,602 --> 02:52:20,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Sports.

2323
02:52:21,142 --> 02:52:22,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sports games.

2324
02:52:23,383 --> 02:52:24,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um...

2325
02:52:24,993 --> 02:52:43,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, EA announced that they're going to be making Madden Arcade, which is going to be kind of like a Maddenized version of 3-on-3 NHL Arcade, which came out earlier in the year.

2326
02:52:43,178 --> 02:52:51,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it'd be like arcade-style games, you know, or sports games, you know, they may be up and ailing.

2327
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:52,300
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then...

2328
02:52:53,039 --> 02:52:54,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to disregard that, so...

2329
02:52:57,560 --> 02:52:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me explain my thing with sports games.

2330
02:53:00,021 --> 02:53:03,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been wanting to try and define this on the show for a long time.

2331
02:53:04,404 --> 02:53:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing is that we're a show that we're not really big on sports games.

2332
02:53:07,866 --> 02:53:10,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really talk a lot about them, and that's our audience.

2333
02:53:10,167 --> 02:53:15,690
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do enjoy casual sports games, if that makes sense.

2334
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:17,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?

2335
02:53:18,332 --> 02:53:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I like casual sports games.

2336
02:53:20,013 --> 02:53:20,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind them at all.

2337
02:53:21,114 --> 02:53:22,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why I kind of...

2338
02:53:23,895 --> 02:53:28,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Desire, those old school sports games like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl, the Blades of Steel.

2339
02:53:28,898 --> 02:53:31,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into.

2340
02:53:31,479 --> 02:53:33,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one.

2341
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:37,603
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones today, I have a really hard time just kind of pick up and running with.

2342
02:53:37,843 --> 02:53:39,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them.

2343
02:53:39,924 --> 02:53:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and hey, for the hardcore sports fan, cool, you know, more for you.

2344
02:53:45,167 --> 02:53:47,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they don't play role-playing games that I play probably.

2345
02:53:48,169 --> 02:53:51,370
[SPEAKER_02]: They play their sports games and that's cool, you know, there's a lot for you.

2346
02:53:51,691 --> 02:53:52,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I

2347
02:53:52,691 --> 02:53:58,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think probably one good way to define the type of sports games I can get into is an arcade type of game.

2348
02:53:58,815 --> 02:54:00,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Insert, quarter, play game.

2349
02:54:00,776 --> 02:54:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just very, very easy.

2350
02:54:02,157 --> 02:54:05,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Like NBA Jam, that was one of my favorite video games years ago.

2351
02:54:05,999 --> 02:54:09,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show that I was ever into a sports game at some point.

2352
02:54:09,921 --> 02:54:11,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them I can get into.

2353
02:54:12,243 --> 02:54:15,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we haven't had a lot in a long, long time.

2354
02:54:15,665 --> 02:54:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So EA's trying to bring out more casual sports gaming is what you're saying?

2355
02:54:21,488 --> 02:54:22,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically.

2356
02:54:23,206 --> 02:54:45,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, well, I don't know if you ever tried their latest demo on either the 360 or the PlayStation 3, but last year they, you know, earlier this year they came out with an arcade-style hockey game, basically, I think, NBA Jam for Hockey.

2357
02:54:45,694 --> 02:54:46,535
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I never played that.

2358
02:54:46,655 --> 02:54:47,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the name of it?

2359
02:54:49,042 --> 02:54:53,244
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called NHL, or, you know, 3 on 3 NHL Arcade.

2360
02:54:53,924 --> 02:54:56,205
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically NBA Jam with Hockey.

2361
02:54:56,465 --> 02:54:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have to check that out.

2362
02:54:57,525 --> 02:54:58,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever played it.

2363
02:54:58,926 --> 02:55:03,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kind of like, eh, sports game, pass, sports game, pass.

2364
02:55:03,447 --> 02:55:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully, I check it out.

2365
02:55:06,268 --> 02:55:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort aren't these kind of casual sports games in a way, too?

2366
02:55:11,670 --> 02:55:16,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking video game of the past 10, 15 years.

2367
02:55:18,251 --> 02:55:18,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

2368
02:55:18,772 --> 02:55:27,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't say I really know much about the Wii games, because I really haven't been following them.

2369
02:55:27,460 --> 02:55:29,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even own a Wii, at least not yet.

2370
02:55:31,304 --> 02:55:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my knowledge about video games are about the Dota 2 system.

2371
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:41,273
[SPEAKER_01]: One last touch before I do hang up.

2372
02:55:41,293 --> 02:55:41,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2373
02:55:44,535 --> 02:55:55,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if it's something the three of you would be interested in, but there's a free download on the video section of the PlayStation Network Store.

2374
02:55:55,700 --> 02:56:03,783
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 1980s enemy pilots called Saber Rider.

2375
02:56:05,704 --> 02:56:06,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do free.

2376
02:56:06,304 --> 02:56:09,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you a minute to cut you off.

2377
02:56:10,461 --> 02:56:11,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I can do free.

2378
02:56:11,962 --> 02:56:12,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like free things.

2379
02:56:13,162 --> 02:56:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably put this up on there to get people to check it out because they're probably going to sell the series.

2380
02:56:18,745 --> 02:56:19,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.

2381
02:56:19,805 --> 02:56:28,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it yet, but I did download it, so I can't really give an opinion.

2382
02:56:28,509 --> 02:56:31,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in a future week than Spazinator, but for now we're going to let you go.

2383
02:56:31,571 --> 02:56:34,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your phone call, and we're going to wrap up.

2384
02:56:35,252 --> 02:56:36,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, have a good one.

2385
02:56:36,133 --> 02:56:36,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, buddy.

2386
02:56:37,830 --> 02:56:38,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2387
02:56:38,831 --> 02:56:40,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Casual Sports Gamer.

2388
02:56:40,312 --> 02:56:40,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be me.

2389
02:56:41,594 --> 02:56:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do these harder to get into.

2390
02:56:43,616 --> 02:56:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: With the playbooks and all that stuff.

2391
02:56:45,798 --> 02:56:48,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The most playbook I could get into was Tecmo Bowl.

2392
02:56:48,641 --> 02:56:51,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Run, Run 2, Pass, and Pass 2.

2393
02:56:51,703 --> 02:56:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

2394
02:56:53,035 --> 02:56:54,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as playbook as I get.

2395
02:56:55,257 --> 02:56:57,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, I think that's going to do it for the Skyblind tonight.

2396
02:56:57,478 --> 02:56:59,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get any last minute stories, Loki.

2397
02:56:59,659 --> 02:56:59,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2398
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:02,001
[SPEAKER_10]: This is interesting.

2399
02:57:02,081 --> 02:57:09,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Konami is relaunching the Drum Mania and Guitar Freak series with Guitar Freak's Drum Mania XG.

2400
02:57:09,726 --> 02:57:15,770
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be in HD and it's also adding more fret buttons to the guitar controller.

2401
02:57:15,850 --> 02:57:18,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Now with five fret buttons with adding yellow and purple.

2402
02:57:18,912 --> 02:57:22,675
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also going to have hold notes or longer notes just like you'd see in

2403
02:57:23,215 --> 02:57:24,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Other rhythm music games.

2404
02:57:25,577 --> 02:57:34,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the open strums are actually going to be part of the normal guitar charts as well.

2405
02:57:34,484 --> 02:57:36,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And vibration is added when you're wailing.

2406
02:57:37,127 --> 02:57:40,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Drumania, they're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom.

2407
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:45,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal and a second bass pedal as well.

2408
02:57:45,894 --> 02:57:46,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

2409
02:57:47,535 --> 02:57:50,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently the new machines are going on testing very soon.

2410
02:57:51,016 --> 02:57:58,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the new songs include Hyper Jetland, Kaiser Phoenix, Blue Planet, and Piranha.

2411
02:57:58,078 --> 02:58:01,299
[SPEAKER_10]: All those, of course, looks like in-house artists.

2412
02:58:02,459 --> 02:58:10,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the old songs, Returning, Vampire Killer, Over the Limit, Highway Star, and some others.

2413
02:58:10,842 --> 02:58:12,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see here.

2414
02:58:12,062 --> 02:58:15,103
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have a new interface, also a beginner mode.

2415
02:58:16,957 --> 02:58:27,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess there's also gameplay being shown in the background, I guess with your note link over the top.

2416
02:58:28,182 --> 02:58:29,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat looking.

2417
02:58:29,283 --> 02:58:31,463
[SPEAKER_10]: The machine looks really cool.

2418
02:58:31,483 --> 02:58:32,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2419
02:58:33,104 --> 02:58:34,305
[SPEAKER_10]: But a little too late, I think.

2420
02:58:34,325 --> 02:58:35,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2421
02:58:35,768 --> 02:58:37,229
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2422
02:59:04,059 --> 02:59:05,520
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2423
02:59:34,125 --> 02:59:37,713
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's thanks to some people in Britain there.

2424
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:41,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see...

2425
02:59:42,651 --> 02:59:59,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Ben Heck, the creator of such wonderful portable systems, has a new project now he is blogging about, including creating his very own custom pinball machine, which he, for some reason, decided to choose Bill Paxton as the theme of the pinball machine.

2426
03:00:00,218 --> 03:00:08,482
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is kind of neat if you want to check it out on how you can make your own very unique pinball machine from scratch.

2427
03:00:08,742 --> 03:00:09,542
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

2428
03:00:09,902 --> 03:00:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of cool.

2429
03:00:12,019 --> 03:00:15,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a game on Commodore 64 I used to play back in the day that I loved.

2430
03:00:15,764 --> 03:00:20,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Construction Set by ECA, which back in the day was what EA turned into.

2431
03:00:20,931 --> 03:00:23,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what, you know what I mean?

2432
03:00:23,094 --> 03:00:23,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2433
03:00:24,509 --> 03:00:29,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Modern Warfare, they have their really ridiculous Prestige Collector's Edition.

2434
03:00:29,874 --> 03:00:43,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not to be outdone, but Codemasters, they're releasing Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising in the UK with a really ridiculous Collector's Edition as well.

2435
03:00:44,107 --> 03:00:46,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It will feature a full...

2436
03:00:47,955 --> 03:00:49,257
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2437
03:01:06,727 --> 03:01:11,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And then lastly, something that kind of pissed people off, we were talking about Activision raising prices.

2438
03:01:11,769 --> 03:01:20,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently, and once again, this goes to show you that CEOs should never speak ever when it comes to video games.

2439
03:01:20,452 --> 03:01:27,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, CEO Bobby Kotick says that he hopes that the price of games will actually go higher.

2440
03:01:28,455 --> 03:01:28,715
[SPEAKER_10]: It says...

2441
03:01:29,955 --> 03:01:34,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And Tony, you know, if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further.

2442
03:01:34,899 --> 03:01:36,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Douchebag.

2443
03:01:38,102 --> 03:01:41,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And then two last things here.

2444
03:01:41,044 --> 03:01:42,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone.

2445
03:01:42,826 --> 03:01:44,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, can we back it up a little bit?

2446
03:01:44,507 --> 03:01:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you getting into that reminded me we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight.

2447
03:01:48,210 --> 03:01:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do that at some point.

2448
03:01:49,451 --> 03:01:51,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was this dude's name?

2449
03:01:51,633 --> 03:01:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotick.

2450
03:01:52,414 --> 03:01:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotick, the FUs of the Week tonight are for you.

2451
03:02:10,529 --> 03:02:11,830
[SPEAKER_06]: My F.U.

2452
03:02:11,890 --> 03:02:13,932
[SPEAKER_06]: really just goes to the suture in my hand.

2453
03:02:14,413 --> 03:02:15,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It pretty freaking hurts.

2454
03:02:16,675 --> 03:02:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2455
03:02:18,196 --> 03:02:18,716
[SPEAKER_02]: My F.U.

2456
03:02:18,757 --> 03:02:19,978
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to being sore.

2457
03:02:20,118 --> 03:02:23,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I feel like I'm getting so old, but my legs are so sore.

2458
03:02:23,641 --> 03:02:27,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday, which wasn't really that much.

2459
03:02:28,145 --> 03:02:30,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe.

2460
03:02:30,847 --> 03:02:31,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2461
03:02:31,128 --> 03:02:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2462
03:02:31,798 --> 03:02:32,679
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2463
03:02:51,755 --> 03:02:54,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Dying babies were her thing, as she puts it.

2464
03:02:55,137 --> 03:03:10,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So she comes in, you know, basically when they're doing all the pictures and doing the, you know, the footprints and all the impressions and stuff, you know, the nurse beforehand, they're treating them, you know, even though the babies are dead, they're treating them, you know, with respect, like actual babies, you know, supporting their head and stuff like that.

2465
03:03:11,704 --> 03:03:16,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the woman decides she's gonna come in and she says, okay, we're gonna start taking pictures.

2466
03:03:16,305 --> 03:03:17,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is the fun part!

2467
03:03:18,326 --> 03:03:21,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what part of Dead Babies is fun to you?

2468
03:03:21,707 --> 03:03:22,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid.

2469
03:03:23,148 --> 03:03:34,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she treats them like, you know, basically dolls, just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact, you know, that their heads should be supported and all that stuff, because they can't feel pain anymore, she says.

2470
03:03:34,971 --> 03:03:40,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you, Nurse Douchebag, for being totally insensitive and just

2471
03:03:41,328 --> 03:03:43,090
[SPEAKER_10]: An absolute horrible human being.

2472
03:03:44,411 --> 03:03:45,332
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what, though?

2473
03:03:46,974 --> 03:03:52,219
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in the end, we do laugh about it because she's... It just... How do people like this actually exist?

2474
03:03:52,259 --> 03:03:53,941
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so stupid.

2475
03:03:54,702 --> 03:03:58,166
[SPEAKER_02]: See, only you and Nelly can find the humor in something like that, honestly.

2476
03:04:00,310 --> 03:04:01,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

2477
03:04:02,251 --> 03:04:03,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, last minute stories.

2478
03:04:03,572 --> 03:04:10,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last one I have, and which you'll probably like, is Microsoft is saying they are going to raise the cap of your friends list.

2479
03:04:10,796 --> 03:04:12,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a few open slots right now.

2480
03:04:12,617 --> 03:04:22,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm down to like 98, and the reason why I... If somebody hasn't shown up on my friends list in like 30 days or more, I just delete them because I hear they cancelled their Xbox.

2481
03:04:22,883 --> 03:04:24,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's somebody I know in real life.

2482
03:04:24,864 --> 03:04:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's what I've been doing too.

2483
03:04:27,026 --> 03:04:28,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it.

2484
03:04:28,667 --> 03:04:31,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to have me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots.

2485
03:04:31,690 --> 03:04:36,013
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey, but there's always something.

2486
03:04:36,113 --> 03:04:39,576
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be something I'm playing after I'm sick of the games I'm playing now.

2487
03:04:39,656 --> 03:04:40,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the way it works.

2488
03:04:42,481 --> 03:04:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2489
03:04:44,162 --> 03:04:46,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2490
03:04:46,483 --> 03:04:49,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting independent podcasting.

2491
03:04:50,045 --> 03:04:56,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are awesome, especially downloading and listening to this entire show after a three-week hiatus if you got all the way to the end.

2492
03:04:57,249 --> 03:04:57,869
[SPEAKER_02]: You rock.

2493
03:04:57,909 --> 03:04:59,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for listening to us.

2494
03:05:00,230 --> 03:05:01,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to say.

2495
03:05:01,571 --> 03:05:07,654
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, we say tell two people you know about the show, but honestly, by listening to the whole thing, you've already made us feel good.

2496
03:05:09,335 --> 03:05:11,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And live listeners, where would we be without you guys?

2497
03:05:11,617 --> 03:05:12,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for showing up.

2498
03:05:13,078 --> 03:05:17,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially the fact that we just said at noon today that we'd be back tonight because I just didn't know.

2499
03:05:17,861 --> 03:05:19,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to announce anything premature.

2500
03:05:19,702 --> 03:05:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that so many people showed up, we actually had a really good listener count tonight.

2501
03:05:24,686 --> 03:05:30,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting from all games that some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff.

2502
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:32,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But just thank you so much.

2503
03:05:33,972 --> 03:05:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2504
03:05:36,346 --> 03:05:41,231
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is... Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud.

2505
03:05:41,611 --> 03:05:43,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?

2506
03:05:43,313 --> 03:05:43,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

2507
03:05:43,673 --> 03:05:44,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I just autographed it.

2508
03:05:45,054 --> 03:05:45,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2509
03:05:45,535 --> 03:05:47,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sign it too.

2510
03:05:47,477 --> 03:05:48,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too.

2511
03:05:49,258 --> 03:05:50,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

2512
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:55,124
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is... I don't know.

2513
03:05:55,184 --> 03:05:55,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I've

2514
03:05:56,118 --> 03:05:56,819
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

2515
03:06:14,919 --> 03:06:15,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really good that she did it.

2516
03:06:15,920 --> 03:06:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is.

2517
03:06:16,601 --> 03:06:19,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just get a different Klanto.

2518
03:06:20,986 --> 03:06:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out.

2519
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:23,249
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep that YouTube channel alive this time.

2520
03:06:23,950 --> 03:06:28,436
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I have a TurboGrafx in my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to steal this.

2521
03:06:29,017 --> 03:06:31,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may not be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say.

2522
03:06:32,541 --> 03:06:35,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for this week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2523
03:06:36,103 --> 03:06:37,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I pretty much said it all.

2524
03:06:37,264 --> 03:06:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.

2525
03:06:38,325 --> 03:06:40,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back here to do it all again next week.

2526
03:06:41,047 --> 03:06:45,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So myself, Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki.

2527
03:06:46,010 --> 03:06:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.

2528
03:06:46,810 --> 03:06:48,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see you next week.

2529
03:06:50,692 --> 03:06:51,332
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week!
