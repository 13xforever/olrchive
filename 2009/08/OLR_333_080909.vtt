Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the local volcano

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, August 9, 2009, Sony pulls advertising from one of their games

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Details are revealed on Final Fantasy 14

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Could you soon get a new game for the price of a used one?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening, August 9, 2009

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And we're a little broken tonight

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Let me introduce the cast first and I'll tell you what's going on

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining me as always

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Say hello to the one and only Sims-loving DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yo

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And I see you creating a character right now

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Actually, you know, I'm redoing an old one because I got some new hairs and clothes and stuff

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
And I'm going back to one of my older games that I've kind of neglected

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I see

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Isn't that nice hair?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
It's very pretty

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
There you go

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Hi

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm doing well, I guess

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
So, anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't know, I guess I could explain everything that happened

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I mean, I don't know

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, I should start because the first week we were gone was kind of my fault

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And, you know, it was something that was unanticipated

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And by the way, I apologize for my speech

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Speech is all screwed up tonight

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I have the hiccups really bad

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Like, we were just on Bobby's show doing our little tease over to this show and I was fine

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And right after we were done, we usually have a couple minutes

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Because Bobby always likes to read the chatters at the end of his show and wrap everything up

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
So I'm taking a little swig of water and, I don't know, like, water went down the wrong pipe or something

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Now I have the hiccups, like, terribly

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Which is the worst possible thing that can happen to you in radio

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And I've got it right now and they're not going away

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
At least you can go through and kind of, like, you know, see the gaps that you hiccup in and go in and amount

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
So, excuse me

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
So anyway, I'm going to try and hopefully get rid of the hiccups

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Anyway, we were gone the first week, my fault

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Because I was getting sick, like, I was really sick

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And most of it was exhaustion

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Because I've been really pushing myself between training at work

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Some other things I do outside of work besides just the show

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And, you know, the show, I pretty much almost collapsed and died Sunday

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Not really, but, you know, just collapsed

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And was feeling really, really horrible

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So I called it off for Sunday and was like, let's all take a night off

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
But then we announced that we were going to go on hiatus

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
We're actually back kind of quicker than I think some people thought we'd be back

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But I'll let Loki take over

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, so basically last Friday

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, last Friday

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, actually, let me start

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
The week before that, the week before Friday

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So two Fridays ago

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Basically, you know, during labor you get

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Or I should say during pregnancy you get false labor pains

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
They're called Braxton Hicks contractions

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Basically kind of going through the whole, you know, contraction cycle

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
They're not supposed to hurt

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
They're basically, you know, you feel a tightening and then that's it

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And you get them all throughout the entire duration of being in labor

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Well, she was getting some that were painful

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And now they can be painful, but usually they're not

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
So anyways, long story short, we went into the hospital that day

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
To have her checked out

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And they looked at her, they did an ultrasound

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
They did, you know, an exam

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
You know, and her cervix was closed

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And, you know, it was five centimeters long

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Which is, you know, long for, you know, the birth canal

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But usually it's like three centimeters

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
So everything was basically looked to be normal

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So we went home

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You know, she was basically taking it easy

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Laying on the couch and stuff like that

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Monday she went into her normal doctor

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Because she had an appointment

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And she actually had her looked over again

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And once again everything seemed fine

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
But she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
To have her, you know, have them check her out

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Because now she was getting some sort of, like, fluid leaking out of her

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And she didn't know what that was

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Normally that's not normal

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
So they took her into labor and delivery

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Looked at her, and they did, you know, an exam

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And they said, okay, well it doesn't look like anything's wrong

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So she finally insisted, listen, you know, give me an internal ultrasound

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And I want you to make sure everything's correct

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So sure enough they give her an internal ultrasound

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
And they realize that now within the time frame of Friday to Wednesday morning

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
She's now completely, her cervix is completely effaced

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Meaning that it's shortened up

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Which is what happens before you go into labor

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And she's actually three centimeters dilated now

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And the sack of one of the babies is actually hanging out into the birth canal

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Which means that any moment her water could break

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
So Wednesday they call me down to the hospital

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So I have to go down there

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And basically she let me know what was going on

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
And we, they tried basically to reverse the process

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
They gave her drugs to stop contractions

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
To hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into her uterus

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And, you know, basically the contractions would, you know, were stopped

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And they were going to see if maybe the dilation would go away

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Well, 24 hours later they examined her again

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It wasn't getting any better

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The contractions were already stopped

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But she's continuing dilated

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
So at that point there was no way that they could stop anything

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Basically, you know, they were giving us the option of

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, we can break your water now and induce labor

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Or you can go home, wait for your water to break, and then come back in

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And, you know, it's basically, okay, when do you want to kill your children

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Is basically what they were giving us the option for

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
So, because, you know, as far as we could tell the, you know, babies were fine

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
They were moving still

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Which makes it the hardest

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because everything was okay

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
But we had to deliver them now

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
So they induced labor

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Actually, before that, you know, they were, you know, trying to figure out

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
We were trying to make the decision

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So she got up to use the restroom and then her water broke on her own

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
So it was pretty much, you know, the decision was made for us

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And, you know, they induced labor

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Which normally, you know, fewer full term

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Takes about five hours before, you know, you go into labor

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
And deliver the baby

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, because she wasn't full term, it took 15 hours, you know, to do that

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
So Friday morning at 5 AM

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
They examined her again

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
To see, you know, how it's going

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Because actually during the night and everything, like around 1 in the morning

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
She got an epidural because the, you know, contractions were getting stronger and more painful

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
And then, you know, they checked her again at about 5 in the morning

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And, you know, to see if she was dilated enough

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And they saw feet hanging out of her

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
So they were like, well, looks like you're ready to go

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
So they went ahead, delivered the first baby

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
It came really quick

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And my boy Michael was delivered first

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
He had died before he was delivered

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Basically, probably from all the trauma

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
You know, his water or his sack had been broken for, you know, 15 hours

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
And he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And, you know, because he's being contracted on

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And he was breached, you know, just all that combined together

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
You know, he died before he got born

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And then, luckily right after that

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Because, you know, one of the scenarios they gave us was

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That, you know, the boy would be born

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And then the girl, you know, might not, the sack might not come down and descend

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And you might have to go through the whole labor process again

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Which we were just at that point, like, let's just get this over with

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Luckily, though, right after he was born

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Her water basically broke

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And then Sarah was born right after that

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And, you know, she was born alive

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Everything was okay with her

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
But because it's only 21 weeks, you know, she doesn't have any lungs yet

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
So, luckily, you know, they're oxygenated really well in the womb

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
In case, you know, the mother dies or something like that

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
The babies can survive a little bit

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
But because she has no lungs, she, you know, only lived for two hours

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
So, you know, basically, you know, we got to hold them

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And, you know, say our goodbyes and stuff like that

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
And, you know, it was really, really, really tough

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
You know, very sad

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
At least our family got to see them and everything before, you know, we sent them away

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
But, yeah, so that was my week last week

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
But, you know, it's just unfortunate

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
They don't know what happened

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
They don't know why, you know, this happens

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
They think maybe incompetent cervix, which is a possibility

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Usually, though, this might not be the case

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Because incompetent cervix is a scenario where your cervix gets smaller during the duration of the pregnancy

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It slowly happens

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
This happened, like, three days

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Which, you know, that doesn't happen

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So, you know, free term labor

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
They don't really know what happened

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And we probably won't know what happens

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I mean, it could be an infection, you know

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Who knows

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So they sent off the placentas to pathology

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So maybe we'll learn something from that

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But I doubt it

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
So, basically, the whole thing was just, you know, very sad

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Luckily, we got taken care of really good

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Except for one nurse was completely retarded

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And I'll get into that later

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
But, I don't know

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
It's just, it's sad

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And, you know, wish it hadn't happened

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
But there's not really much you can do

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
That's why I'm here this week

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Because, you know, everything's kind of getting back to normal

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And, I don't know, just got to go on

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You know

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So, yeah

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
That's basically everything that happened

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And we, you know, took care of all the female

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Because they are actually considered, you know

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
20 weeks

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Like, if they were born at 20 weeks

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Basically, the hospital would dispose of them

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
They wouldn't, you know, really be named or anything like that

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
But 21 weeks are considered, like, a live birth

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Or, I don't really know what they consider them

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
But, basically, they get death certificates

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And the girl actually gets a birth certificate

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Because she was born alive

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
But, you know, we had them cremated

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Sometime this week

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I think they're, those we do

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
But we went and took care of all that

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So we get their ashes back

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
This coming week

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Sometime

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And, you know, we got, basically

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
They took pictures and everything

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Because, I mean, you don't have anything

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
To take, you know, to remember them by, basically

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So, they take pictures

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
To do footprints, handprints

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Measurements

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
All that stuff

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But, yeah, they were

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
10 inches long

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And under a pound each

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
14 ounces, I think, was the largest one

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But, yeah

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So I think the reasons why we weren't here last week

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Are then pretty obvious

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I mean, Dark Soccer and I just didn't feel right

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Kind of doing it in that, you know, type of situation

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
So, you know, we called it off last week

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And we said, Loki, take whatever time you need

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
We'll come back when we're all ready to come back

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And Loki, as he mentioned before

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
He's ready to kind of just get back to normal, so to speak

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And so here we are

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And kind of given, you know, everything

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Which might come as a surprise

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
To folks who are ready to tune into a video game show

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
But I admire that you can

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
Be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
That you can talk about it very professionally, you know

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't know, it's still kind of upsetting

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I mean, I'm a little upset right now

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
But it's just like

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It's not as bad as the first day

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh my god

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It was just, it was tiring

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
The whole process was tiring

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
You know, just got no sleep for like two days

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And just

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
The emotional rollercoaster

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I mean, the first day we're like

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
We're like, okay, well that sucks

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And then

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
No, there's nothing we can do

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And then one of the nurses comes in

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Hey, well maybe they can save, you know, one of the babies

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And, you know, deliver one

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And, you know, the other one will be saved

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You know, just keep the other one in or whatever

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And you can't do that

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Because, I mean, let's say

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
For example, you know, the what ifs

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Even for like three weeks

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Which would make it a viable pregnancy

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Even though it's a viable pregnancy

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Does not mean that they're gonna come out normal

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
They're gonna have, you know

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Developmental, you know, mental issues

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You never know

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It's just, this was the easiest way

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And thankfully, you know

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
The whole birthing process took like five minutes

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Once you gave birth to them, it was just done

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Super quick

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And everything came out because, you know

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
If the placentas didn't detach or whatever

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
They had to go and scrape that out

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It's just not fun

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
So, uh

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, I mean

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
You know, Brad Pod Culture is saying that I posted something on Live Journal

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, I did

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Like the whole process, you know

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I kept thinking of how I wanted to

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't know, kind of

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Get everything out

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And that was the way to do it

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I just kind of wrote a letter to them

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So, it helped

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Obviously, there's a lot of outpouring from our chat right now, you know, about the situation

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And, you know, everything

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And I found that to be very true, you know

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
With your updates on Twitter and so forth, you know

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I think Dark Soccer and I didn't really want to

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
We didn't want to say anything about what was going on

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Because we didn't know what, you know

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
What was cool to say and what was not cool to say

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So we just kind of said, shut up, it's private

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You know, but then you came out and said something about it

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And, you know

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Exactly, exactly

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And, you know, I thought the letter obviously was very, very touching

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
And some folks were saying they got, you know, a little teary-eyed reading it

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But, you know, I

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I guess the next thing to ask

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And I apologize for continuing to kind of drag this out, you know

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
But I think, I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
And I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
What next? What do you do next now?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Well, now, the next

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
You know, obviously we still don't have children

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Nellie's not

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I mean

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
We can't, you're not supposed to try right afterwards

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Because there's a higher risk of, you know, preterm labor

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
So, basically now

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
This is unfortunate

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
The way they kind of, the whole medical thing is

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's like they want you to fail once

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And then they'll take everything seriously

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
It's just, you know, they don't

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
They're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Or whatever, I don't know

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Or she goes in with a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You know, just healing and everything

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Later on, we'll meet with somebody

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
In the high-risk clinic

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
To see what we need to do

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
She thinks, I mean, she has her own theories of why it happened

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
She thinks that her progesterone levels dropped

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Because she has PCOS

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Which, basically, her body interprets insulin as testosterone

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Or something like that

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And it throws off her hormone levels

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And that can also cause preterm labor

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
To keep, you know, an eye on that

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
The other thing they can do is a cerclage

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
They couldn't do that this time

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
That was one of the options that they gave us

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But the problem was that the birth

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
You know, the sack of the first baby was distended so much

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
That there was more of a chance that they were going to pop it

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Than them actually successfully doing it

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
So it just wasn't an option

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
And, you know, pretty much we'll try again next year at some point

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
But just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Before we can try again

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
You know, just to be extremely cautious

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And even then

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Hopefully this time what we're going to do

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Is we're going to do one round of Clomid first

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It overstimulates her ovaries

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That's why we got twins

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But we're going to try

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
One round of Clomid first

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And then not try an insemination at all

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And then another round of Clomid

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So we get one baby and not two

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Okay

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
And this question might sound kind of weird

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
But I think a lot of people out there

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
When they were reading about this on Twitter

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And even hearing about it now

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They were kind of wondering like, what can I do?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Is there something I can do to help?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Is there anything I can do?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Is there any charity?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Is there something I can do to help?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Not really

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I mean

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I don't know

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
If you want to do a charity

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I guess March of Dimes

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
They research

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Pregnancy loss

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I don't know

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
There's that I guess

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
We talked about getting in a group together

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
For when they do the next March of Dimes walk

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I don't know

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I've actually done that quite a few times

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And it's a really great charity

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And I think it would be very perfect

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I'd definitely go in on that

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I don't know

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Do whatever you guys need to do

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
See that's the thing too when we got home

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Everyone wants to help out

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I totally understand

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
What's there to do?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I don't know

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It's fine because at first

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
We did not want to go out of the house

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
My mom would come over

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
She'd bring us groceries that we needed

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I'd have friends come over and they'd bring

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Food and stuff

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
That was fine

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But now we've got a fridge full of food

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
What do you want us to do?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
You want us to do something around the house?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't know

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't know

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
There's nothing really you can do unfortunately

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It's nice to know that you guys

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Care

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I don't know

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Right now

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I can't really think of anything

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
There's nothing really we can do

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Well maybe if we decide

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
To go the charity route later on

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I know we've always been

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Toying with the idea of doing a marathon

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Of some sort on some weekend

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
So that might be something we have to look into

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Might be a lot of fun

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
For a good cause

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's pretty much it

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Right now we've got a lot of stuff

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Taken care of

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I don't know

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
See

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I feel so guilty right now

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I really shouldn't be

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I should be glad that I'm kind of

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Over everything

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
This whole week

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I was perfectly fine

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I was

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Sitting at home

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
At first I wanted to stay home

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Because I wasn't ready to go back to work

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Probably like Tuesday

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Mainly just staying home

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
To keep Nellie company

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Because she's got

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Well she can't go to work

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
For four weeks

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Doctors orders not to go back to work

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
For four weeks

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Rest up

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Make sure that you're okay

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And healed and all that stuff

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
But

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I've been editing Grand Theft Auto

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
For the last few days

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
So I've been just

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Getting back to normal

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah it's pretty much getting back to normal

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I feel so guilty

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Because she's still upset

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And I just

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Can't

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
The most I get upset is now

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Where I'm just talking about it

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
But even then

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's not

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I don't know

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It's probably just naturally going to take her a little longer

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah definitely

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
So she's been having to

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Deal with the pain of that

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Because

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You're supposed to let it reabsorb back into

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Your body and

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Cramping after

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
She gives birth and everything

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And cramping based on that

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And you have to give yourself massages in your stomach

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
To force it to cramp

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
So that it will shrink back down

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
All the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Don't know about

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't know

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I mean

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It's like

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I have pictures of them

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
They give you these little

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Layets, they're little

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Outfits that they basically dress them up in

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
And take pictures and stuff

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
As morbid as that sounds

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
But that's all you got

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I actually have pictures but

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
It's hard for people to look at

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Especially the boy

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Their skin is still transparent

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And he was really bruised

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Coming out and he's all red

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
And stuff

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Let me read this from Kitsune

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Because I think this is really good advice

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And we'll try to move on from here

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Kitsune in chat says it would probably be worse

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
If you didn't get back to normal

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I mean if you stay in a good spirit it would help her

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah exactly

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I think that's what it is

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I know we spent a lot of time talking about that

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
But it's important

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And I think Brad

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
If you want to join me in our chatroom again

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Chat.orangelandraday.com

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
After listening to OLR for so long

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
We feel like you guys are kind of like family

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You know because

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Don't want to go through this again

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Fair enough

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Alright well let's move on

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Let's get back to gaming

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Let's talk about video games

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
And the stuff that distracts us from the real world sometimes

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And gets us

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Makes us happy

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Video games

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
DarkSakura I'll go to you

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
How was your gaming week we always start off the show?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Well not very

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Busy just given that I can't

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Hold the controllers for very long

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Before my hand starts to hurt

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
We got in

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
We're borrowing a couple pinball tables

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
That we actually got

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
After we did the video

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Attack from Mars

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Which I really love

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Which I love but I really like Attack from Mars better

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Dude you got an Attack from Mars?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
That's awesome

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's the pinball I have the holograms and all that stuff in it

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Play after the show

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And so

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I've been playing a little bit of that off and on

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
But like I said my hand starts hurting me real bad

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
So I can't play for very long

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Playing Sims 3

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Off and on

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Some of the

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Newness has fallen for me

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
But um

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I go back every so often and now I'm actually

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Going to pick up one of my old families and play them

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Somewhere now that you know better hair has come out

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Um

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I've been playing Peggle

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I beat Peggle so now I'm playing through it again

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
It's

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Pretty fun

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Some Cooking Mama last night

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
On my iPhone

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Played Light Cycles on my iPhone

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Played La Solitaire on my iPhone

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You've been getting into iPhone gaming

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Quite a bit huh

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
You know my roommate downloaded something

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
For the iPhone and you know he's not a huge huge

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Gamer but he got really into some role playing

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Game that was on that phone I apologize I didn't catch the

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Name I'll try to check it out for next week

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The puzzle RPG game

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Oh I have a

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Vi that was a Sega CD

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Title and I have it on my iPhone

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Um

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I've also um

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Been playing some of the little games on

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Gaia online cause my account

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Is still there

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Including Booty Grab just cause I think it's funny

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It's where you go into the

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Aquariums and if you

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Manage to get one that's active they'll throw gold everywhere

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And you grab Booty

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I just laugh because I'm grabbing Booty

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Nice

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Cause I'm five years old that way

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Um

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
And uh we picked up a couple of games

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
We actually picked up some Tengen

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Games that were in the

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Regular Nintendo cartridges

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
We got Gauntlet

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And um I don't think we

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Picked up RBI Baseball cause hello

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
It's RBI Baseball

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And uh one other

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
That I can't remember

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And uh here comes the husband

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
What was the other game?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
We didn't?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Oh I thought you bought the games

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Okay well we didn't get the games then we saw them

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
You just saw them

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I thought he got them You had a daydream where you were gonna

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Buy them and leave No because I went back

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And I bought movies I bought the

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Doctor Who movie

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
That just came out I found it brand new for like ten bucks

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Oh nice And then I got this movie

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Which I love Saved

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh that's funny That movie is cracked out

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And I got um Elf

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Cause you know I normally

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
The crap out of me until I saw that movie

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Especially when you smell

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You smell like beef and cheese

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
But um

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
But also uh

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
For other games Dan got me

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
This that I haven't opened yet

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
But I will be

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
This is the game that we are in

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
But you're actually

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
You got the 360 version

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
That's the arcade stuff

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
We're in the PS3 version We're in the PS3 one

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Yes we're in the PS3 one The Namco Museum Essentials

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Which I thank you for reminding me

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
About this um we actually

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Have a cameo in a video game

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
In the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
We're in the PS3 one

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It's a PlayStation Network title

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah it's a download title

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's a download title on PlayStation Network

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
You have to get it online

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
The one that we're in is the one online

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So anyway

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Now they're talking about that

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
But yeah if you, here's the thing

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It's just a little cameo

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
But when you start the game, not the demo

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
But the retail version of the game, you're not gonna see it in the demo

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
When you start the retail version of the game

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Then it comes up and it shows like

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Hey now you can use High Scoreboard with your friends

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And it actually on the High Scoreboard

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
It says Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And then there's some initials thing on the side too

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Where OLR is some of the top initials

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
On the High Scoreboard

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
So it's really cool and awesome

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
But it still has a lot of good games on it

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh yeah I mean that's still a good collection

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they released

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Galaxian Pole Position

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So yeah

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
As soon as my hand

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Cause my hand is actually still pretty crappy

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I actually heard it yesterday

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Holding my friend's son

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And she is listening right now

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And sorry your son killed me

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
But no

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
I actually ended up hyper extending my middle finger way too far

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And that's

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Oh come on

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I know it just sounds funny sorry

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
The technical term is hyper extension

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
I was using my middle finger too much

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Hey hey

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I was showing you see look at my finger

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
No and the suture is still in my palm

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
So I'm actually going to call my doctor

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And tell him to get it the hell out of my hand

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Because it's really

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I pretty much think it's what's slowing up my healing

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Cause I

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's taking longer than it's supposed to

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It really is taking longer than it's supposed to

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Other than that

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I really haven't played a whole lot of other things

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh I did watch Dan play the Arkham Asylum demo

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
And that looks hot

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
That is just oh my god

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
And it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
And I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
But other than that hey I mean

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
It actually

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
And I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I'm going to

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
If I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Oh

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Oh oh oh

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And I came this close

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Really tiny close to playing BeatMania

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And I was like nah let's just go home

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Probably not good for your hand though

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Nah really not good for my hand

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I'm a right side scratcher but nah

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You know what's funny I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
What? Where?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Tahoe

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I was in South Lake Tahoe

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
It was either Harvey's or Harrah's I can't remember one of those two had it

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
And yeah I almost played it but then I was like

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Dude it's 5 key this is old

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Oh and I released a ringtone pack

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
For iPhone owners

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Did I send it to you?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't think I saw it

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I did a limited giveaway just a random giveaway

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
To give away 10 video game ringtones

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
That I made for iPhone

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And I'm going to do it again

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
This time instead of doing it on

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Twitter

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm going to do it on Facebook

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So the first 5 people to send me a message to my inbox

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
On

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Facebook

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
So the first 5 people to send me

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
A message to my inbox

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
On

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Facebook with

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Your email address

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Actually I'll be better than that I'll say 10

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Will be able to

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Download the pack

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It's just 10 different ringtones

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Nice

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And I can tell everybody

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
What's in them later

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Alright

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Well let's move on with our gaming weeks

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah I was playing

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I got so much playing Grand Theft Auto

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
As I was editing Grand Theft Auto

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Still

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
It's almost done actually I think it's probably done now

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I think I've edited pretty much everything

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I could possibly edit in it now

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And I am going to record some stuff for it

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I finally got my video capture thing

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
For doing HD video

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Assuming everything works on it

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
We should be able to record some stuff

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I've been having issues with the

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Program that came with it

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
To get it to work

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
For some reason it's just crashing randomly

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Hopefully we'll be able to record everything

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And it will be awesome

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
So you can finally see

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
What the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
It's insane now

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Now the jets fly around at street level

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And it's just kind of crazy

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Just like what the hell is going on

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Other than that

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I didn't really play a whole lot this week

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I brought my DS with me to the hospital

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
It was something to do

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So I played a little bit of Lego Battles

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Which that game is kind of boring

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I mean it's an okay RTS game

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
But the AIs are retarded

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
And like I would tell

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
You have these

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
You can harvest wood and stuff like that

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Or it gives you bricks or whatever

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
So I'm telling them to go chop down these trees

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And they just stand there

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
They're like, huh?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
You want me to do what?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Or like I say, chop down these trees and they run the opposite direction

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Absolutely retarded

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
So that got really frustrating and boring

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Which was fun

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
And also some Planet Puzzle League

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Which was pretty fun

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Those games are good standby puzzle games

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
And

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Let me think

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I think that's pretty much it

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Really not a good week for games

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Even though I was home all week

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I was just preoccupied

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
With just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And then before that

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Putting away boxes

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And cleaning up the house

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
But I have my giant HDTV

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Now in my room

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
To do video capture on

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
So it'll be awesome

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Alright

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
As far as my gaming week

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Even the fact that we've been gone a little while

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I didn't play a lot of new stuff

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I made my way to disc 3 now

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Which is way past where I was before

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
So that's pretty cool and I'm still enjoying that

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I play Blackjack for real

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
When I went up to Tahoe yesterday

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I took a day trip to South Lake Tahoe

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
It's so funny up there because

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
They have these huge casinos

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Literally adjacent to the state line

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Like you're walking down the street

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
There's some California little built up things

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
You literally walk across the street

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And you're walking across the state line

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And there's these huge casinos right on the other side

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's not like Reno where you still have to drive in

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Like 5 miles at least to get there

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
But yeah I had a good time

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And I played Blackjack for real for the first time

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
And it's kind of freaky because

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It was $10 minimum bet and all that stuff

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
And I put in $60 and I left with $52

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
So I lost a little bit

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
But considering I was entertained for about an hour

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And came out basically even

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm not too upset

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
So that was kind of a thrill

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It sounds like you did pretty good for yourself otherwise

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I mean you didn't come out broke

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And I was down to about $20 at one point

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
And I was like ah fuck my life

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I'm going to be losing all my money

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
But I did okay

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
It was very nerve wracking

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It was a lot of pressure but it was fun

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
But please gamble responsibly if you're over $21

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's see what else did I do

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I did play one new game

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
But I can't really review it because it's a beta

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
And it's actually one that I know somebody emailed

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Us on before

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
To check it out

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And it's from NCSoft

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And it's a new MMO that's coming out

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's actually

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
If I understand right

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
It's been out in Korea for some time

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
It's just finally getting its localization over here

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So it's finally in beta and so forth

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
And I didn't really play the game enough

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
To get a real sense

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
To review it fairly

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I will say it's pretty

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
It definitely had some things in common with WoW

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
But I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I don't know if this is the way it looked or what have you

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
But as far as like

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm just talking about the way the game looks on a purely

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Superficial level

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I'm not talking about how the insides of the game work

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Such as

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
When you get to level 10

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You can actually evolve your class

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I guess your characters get wings and whatever

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
And you can evolve your class

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
It's an interesting little game

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But it was hard to tell a lot about it

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Because in the beta

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
You just get thrown right into the game

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
There's no tutorial

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
There's nothing

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
You just got to figure it out

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
The first few quests kind of help you a little bit

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
But it doesn't hold your hand as much as Warcraft did

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Or even Warhammer

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Which is another one I played recently

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
It's more that Final Fantasy 11

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Like WTF do I do now

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Type of thing

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
But I don't want to make you think

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
It's Final Fantasy 11

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Because it definitely felt a lot more like

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
WoW or Warhammer did

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm going to check it out

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I don't want to review a game based on a beta

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
But I will say the game kept me interested enough

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
To want to play it again next weekend

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And that's what I plan to do

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
It sounds like fun

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Yeah I'll have to talk to my source

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
See if I can get you another code

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It'll be kind of fun

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I like a good MMO but you know which one I'm waiting for

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Final Fantasy 14?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Heck no!

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
What was that line from

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Chasing Amy

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Bitch you almost made me laugh

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Let's move on

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Into some housekeeping real quick

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And of course we are back

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Here after a little bit of a hiatus

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
And for the foreseeable future

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Tonight is episode 333

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Believe it or not

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
We were on Bobby's show before we were live tonight

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Who hosts the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
At 5 o'clock Pacific 8 o'clock Eastern

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Before we were on

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He was making fun of us tonight

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Or half the Mark of the Beast

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I was saying it's a holy show

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Holy moly

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And of course we have a new YouTube up

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
So check that out on the channel

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
www.youtube.com

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
And we are Channel Orange Lounge Radio

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Or you just search for OLR

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And you get all our videos, they come right up

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Let's get into some gaming news

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
We're not going to cover anything that happened

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
In the past few weeks

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I heard a lot of interesting stuff happen

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I have to be honest, while we were away from the show

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I kind of didn't pay attention to the gaming blogs

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I did read a few interesting stories

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Such as that promotion that went really

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Really wrong by EA

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
At Comic Con

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
The whole take a picture with our booth babes

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Thing

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
It was dumb

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I don't know if you heard about this

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I actually didn't

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
It was some lame brain in the marketing department

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Their scheme went way wrong

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
At least it wasn't a goat head

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And you

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Send it on your Twitter

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Or something like that

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And you'll get entered in a drawing to win a

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Date on the town with two women

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And basically

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
The star treatment where you get

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
A paparazzi

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Or basically a chaperone

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
A limo and that kind of stuff

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
But the way that it was phrased

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It made it sound like you get two prostitutes

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
That you get to go have sex with

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Right because the whole thing was around

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
The seven deadly sins and what was this

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Lust was probably the thing

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
So the whole thing was built around lust

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And it made it kind of sound like

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
It was encouraged like go harass booth babes

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And take pictures of them

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
From what I understood from their thing

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Or was it supposed to be I don't know

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
This is why you need parameters set

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Here's the thing

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I'm sorry to get far into this

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Here's the thing

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Is that I actually

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
They thought outside the box

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
They came up with a new competition

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Was it a very limiting competition?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Did they kind of close this off

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
To a lot of people by only thinking

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Of the horny straight male? Yes they did

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Did somebody in marketing fuck this up

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Big time by taking it from idea

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
To fruition? Oh yeah

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Oh yeah like where was the quality check on this?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Come on. And seriously you got to think about this

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
You don't do that

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
At Comic Con you do that at Vegas

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Where you can actually

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Fulfill your contractual

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Obligation to get those guys

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Laid. And I just don't

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Like the only thing I really

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Didn't like about it is it just reinforces

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
The stereotype that

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Gamers are a bunch of desperate horny male

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
You know folks who can't get laid

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You know what I mean?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
And not that I think you see but at the same time

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
All these rules

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Well you get on a date with two women

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
But if you're a woman you can get guys

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Or if you're a gay guy you can get pretty guys

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Or if you're a lesbian

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Well I mean

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Just let me cash out the damn prize

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
How about that?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
You also won

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Oh yeah you won booty as well

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
But that's funny

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I don't know

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Like I said I think they should've done it in Vegas

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
People just need to get over this shit

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
It's a contest you don't like it

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Don't enter it

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Don't get offended by it it's a contest

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
My god

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Do we need to take it seriously?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I'm not offended but I'm just like

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Stupid. This is stupid

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
This is so so stupid

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And that's probably not what people want

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You know us to be saying about their upcoming game

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Dante's Inferno. Stupid.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I don't know about the game itself

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Anyhow let's get into some gaming news

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
From the now. Loki please start us off

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Yes so

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Sony decided it was an awesome idea

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
To go ahead and add

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Some

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Ads to their

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Game Wipeout HD

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And these would be you know little commercials

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
That would play before your races

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And what not

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
What's interesting though is

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
The ads that they have

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Actually increase the load time

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
From

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Basically like

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
8 seconds to 19 seconds

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Now

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
That doesn't seem like a whole lot but

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
That's still annoying that you have

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
To wait 19 seconds to get into

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
A race because they want you to watch an ad

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
For a game that you paid for

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Already

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Thankfully enough people bitched

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
And so they went ahead

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
And got rid of those ads

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Or at least that one ad that was that long

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But still though

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I mean come on

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Adding ads after the fact because

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
They want some more money

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I'm sorry I can understand if you want to do that for like

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
A free version of the game that may be ad supported

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But if I bought this game

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I don't want to have to

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Pay extra

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I don't want to have to wait extra

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Seconds or whatever to play my levels

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Just because you want to make a few extra bucks

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Running a State Farm ad

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Or something like that

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
The ad had nothing to do

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
You know what's funny

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I actually own Wipeout HD but I haven't played it in so long

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I totally missed this

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
State Farm? Really?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Like what gamer is going to be sitting there

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Playing Wipeout HD going

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Damn I was just thinking I need life insurance

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I mean really?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Well the races are pretty dangerous and if you die

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
As much as I do in that game

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It's fake!

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Exactly but still I have to wait real time

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I don't know

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think it's fucked up though that they can go ahead

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And inject ads into a game

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
That you've already bought that didn't have ads

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
You know the billboards

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
In certain games you know like

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Burnout and stuff that's fine

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Whatever you know I'm not going to get bent out of shape

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
By that because it doesn't really affect my game

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I drive past it so fast I don't give a crap

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
You know um

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Same with like Crackdown they have the same thing

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
You know how like some games will have like

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Especially like the sports games will have the

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You know such and such sponsored

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Like you know Wheaties sponsored

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Car garage or something you know or

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
You know something like that where like a logo is inserted

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Suddenly in the game

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I see that kind of crap on TV although you know

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I don't like the fact that I pay for it

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Because this is very in your face

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Captive audience that's the problem

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It makes you a captive audience to these commercials

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
It's like those ads in the bathroom stall

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It's just

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
It's just that they do

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Do it after the fact you know

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
It kind of devalues your game

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
You know people might not purchase this game

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Because it has a 20 second load time

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Or you know you have to watch it

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Ad for State Farm

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
DarkSakura I don't

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
You know unlike you I don't get mad at the

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Ads in the bathroom because

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You know again unlike you

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
If I don't like the ad I can always piss on it

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Well no it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
That I don't like it's this thing that they do at my work

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
With these little security posters

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
That they put in the bathroom stall

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Which I'm glad I haven't had a look

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
The hell is that big brother is watching you poo?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
What is that?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
It's like give out confidential information at work blah blah blah

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Don't talk about this blah blah

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Security risk blah blah blah

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
And they look like stupid motivational posters

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
But not really

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And I hate that more

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Yay tangents

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
The dates back to high school you love my tangents

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Admit it

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
There was once this kid

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
That ran for student government

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
When I was in high school and I think he was running for

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Like I don't know like they used to

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Like a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Called it he would basically be the host of all the pep rallies

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Biggest loser

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Okay biggest loser was what he was running for

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
And his campaign

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You know he put up a bunch of posters and stuff

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
But in the men's bathroom he actually put up posters

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
In the urinals

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And what have you and it actually said

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You hold the future in your hands

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
And vote next Friday

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I actually thought that was kind of creative

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
That's brilliant actually

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Oh my god

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And now he works for EA creating failed

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
You know advertisement

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Oh I don't keep in touch with the assholes

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
From high school except the ones I liked

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Who knows what that asshole's doing

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
But you know I just thought that was funny

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
That actually is pretty funny

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Here's what I think they should do with these ads

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And I think it's fine

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
If you want to place the ads in here

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
But I think that they should have to spend

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
The time to make the ads

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Seem like it fits in this universe

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
For example like

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
You know the movie Running Man or you know

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Fast and Furious

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
On DVD and Blu-ray or something

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Not even necessarily that like

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Okay wipe out HD

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Let's make it, it can be a state farm ad

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
But have them like ensuring like these space

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Vehicles or something like that

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
It fits in like the universe

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It fits in everything but it's actually

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Still an ad for state farm

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
It's just like you know

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
What was it? Demolition Man

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
The other Sylvester Stallone movie

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
That sucked was Sandra Bullock

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
No the one with Sandra Bullock was Demolition Man

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Oh it was Demolition Man

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It's like Demolition Man with like Taco Bell

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
You know where it's like a restaurant

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
But it still fits in their universe

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You know you could do something like that

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
But just make it fit in the game

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
It's something ridiculous like you know

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
The 2009 Honda Civic

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Or something like that in a futuristic

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Racing game that takes place in the year 3000

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
No one fucking cares about your thousand year old car

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
But what about the point that you're sitting there

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Making me wait, you're increasing my

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Low times in this game

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
To be a captive audience to watch this

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Ad on a game I paid for

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I mean granted what, Wipeout HD

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Is only about 10, 15 bucks

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I can't even remember how much I paid for it

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It's not an expensive game but the fact is I did still pay

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
For it and also I just don't like

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
The fact that they snuck all this shit in after the fact

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
After the reviewers got to

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Copy it and after I mean this

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Is where the fact that you can patch games

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
After the fact is kind of dangerous

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Like what the hell is this

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Really I mean

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
What's to say they're not going to go back and patch

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Other games to suddenly throw in advertising

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
You know surprise

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's just low

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because then

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
You know when the game is reviewed and all the

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Previews go out

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
This has to be breaking a law of some sort

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I don't know how, it has to be

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Like it's just shady, you're raping my eyes

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You are raping my eyes

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
And I am unwilling

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
It's just weird

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Unconsensual eye porn

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Yes this is unconsensual eye fucking

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
That's what this is, thank you Sony

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Here's the thing though

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Poor State Farm because you know

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
They probably just buy out of some company

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
It's not even State Farm

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
It's not even State Farm

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Don't blame State Farm for this

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Just remember State Farm is there

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
State Farm is everywhere

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Apparently even in Wipeout HD

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
So there you go

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Hey at least it's not another

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Fucking Axe commercial or something

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Like that

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Yeah, comments from chat

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
GameGuru says if ads are in my game

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
It needs to be either flavor or cheaper

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Tigerclaw says

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I think the ads came after the Fury

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Add-on pack for Wipeout HD

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
And continues to say maybe if you buy the regular

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Wipeout HD without the add-ons it doesn't have the

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Ads. I never noticed them

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
The ads but I didn't play it in the last three weeks

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
And just to be

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Clear the ads are gone now right?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
They were patched out right?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Well they're not patched out but they're working with the company

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Now I think that ad is gone

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
But they're working with them now so that

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Basically the ads are shorter and they don't

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Interfere with the load time or something like that

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Is what they're saying. They're not seeing that the

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Ads are going away they're just saying oh we're working with

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
This company because we fucked up

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Or they fucked up by making the ad

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Too long or something

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
So basically they're saying hey

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
It's not that we're getting rid of the advertising

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
We're just trying to find a way to keep it into

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
The eight second window basically

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
It's just I don't know it's shady

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I mean I expect those types of ads

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
On like let's say like a pogo.com

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Type of website which are like if you've

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Never visited this website it's just a ton of casual

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Games it's all middle aged

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Crisis women games and I love

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Them like you've got like Boggle

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And Scrabble and like all this stuff on there

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I have no problem with them doing like a free version

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Of this game or something. Yeah but they're all free and you

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Expect that you're gonna have to sit there and look at an ad

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
For you know Metamucil in between

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
You know games or what have you but

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Or Special K

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
That's the big one. I love Special K

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
It's delicious

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Special K is like

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Food of the lifetime network

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I'm very pissed off that they

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Really focus the demographic

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
To chicks okay

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Fuck games for a minute this is more important

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Than any other revelation that's come out

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
About ads and games. Fuck that whole thing for a minute

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Loki

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Loves

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Chick cereal. True story. No I love

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Special K. The fact that they're like saying

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
It's like oh chick cereal

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
That's unfair. That is really unfair

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
That's just like Captain Crunch and they're saying

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
That it's like pirate cereal or kid's cereal

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I'm sorry I still like it

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's good. It's alright

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I mean if you're gonna eat like healthy cereal

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
At least it's not like Total or something like that

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
You know which is like old people's cereal

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I like Total. I used to eat that

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
When I was five. Or like

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I don't even know if you remember this

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Product 19. Yes

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I remember that. Yeah that's almost like

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Special K. Because if you even say mini wheats

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Or old people food I'm gonna come over there and beat you

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Mini wheats are freaking amazing

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I like Crispix too

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Crispix is pretty damn good

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm the person with all brands

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Sitting up there in my cabinet

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
No but it's alright

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Instead of eating you know like

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Or Captain Crunch I'm eating

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Special K because you know what at least

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
That's not too bad for me and

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It tastes alright. I don't have to put sugar on it

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It's not like corn flakes which

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That could be hit or miss

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I am amazed

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
At the vast of knowledge some of our listeners

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Have of the show. AlphaKananagram

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
In chat says to quote from guys on a show

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Radio when it was a station

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Like it was like on Thursday nights or something

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I did that with my old roommate Xfer. It's been off the air

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
For like four years. But says this quote

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Sky thinks Special K's

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Did I say that?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
You made that up. I did not say that

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Did I really?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
From experience I can tell you

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
That I don't think pussy juice is in

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Special K

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Well how would that attract women too?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Well lesbians maybe

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
But you know

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
It's not bad. It's just the thing is

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
The only thing I don't like about Special K

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Because first off they don't have

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Mazes and little stupid dumb

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And you know

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Captain Crunch does. But they have like you know

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
All this breast health

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Awareness crap and like

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You can lose you know

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Inches off your waistline

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Or something like that if you do the Special K

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Diet and crap

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'm like I'm sorry. I eat your cereal and I lose

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
No weight whatsoever

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
But then again they want you like

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
McNuggets don't help

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
But they also want you to have it with skim milk

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Because that's like disgusting

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Might as well eat cardboard or something

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I don't know

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to get off topic

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
But I just we had to have the Special K

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Chat on this show because I think we've never had

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
It on the main show and it's been like seven years

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's good

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I mean it's

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I don't know I go back to Captain

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Crunch every now and then but Captain Crunch is sharp

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I mean it's seriously like for the record

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I hate Special K

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
For the record I hate Captain Crunch

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I love Special K

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I like fiber cereals. Okay I grew up on Grape Nuts

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I hate marshmallows

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
And you have a smooth bowel movement every day

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Shut up

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
The only kids cereal that I ever

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Liked was Frosted Mini Wheats

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And I still to this day it's my favorite cereal

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
In the universe and Rice Krispies

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Oh I'll eat that stuff dry

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Out of the box

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I hate Cheerios

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
You know what else is good too that I can't stop eating

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Once I get some?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Golden Grahams

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
You can still get Golden Grahams I just had some the other day

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I know they're awesome

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Here's the thing though it's funny you say

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I can actually eat it dry

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I only eat cereal dry like I hate milk that much

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I don't eat cereal with milk

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
See Special K that would taste awful dry

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I can't stand Special K

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
It is that disgusting

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It's gross

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Alright anyhow

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Oh yeah so the ads and games

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
That idea

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Unless you run an ad for Special K then Loki won't mind anymore

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Alright

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Let's see let's move on with some more news

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And talking about Netflix a little bit

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And Netflix of course streaming has been

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Huge on the Xbox 360

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
It's rumored once again

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
And it seems like this rumor comes up

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Every few months or so ever since Netflix

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
At the Xbox 360

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But apparently an industry executive

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Familiar with Netflix plans

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Has talked to the website Multichannel

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
That the company's streaming service

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Is soon coming

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
To the iPhone or iPod touch

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
As well as the Wii

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
By the way that doesn't mean you're gonna get to watch

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Netflix on 3G that would be way too much

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And you know

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Boy oh boy

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
AT&T the

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Because they are just like

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
They're putting the clamp down on everything

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
That was other big news that came up even though it's not game related

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
The whole thing like Google Apps

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Maybe the T stands for twat

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Getting shut down by

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Assholes, twats, and turds

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
There you go

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
So asshole, twat, and turd

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Isn't gonna let you use their 3G network

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Because it's way too much

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Of their precious bandwidth

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
So you'd only be able to use Netflix over the

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Streaming

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Over Wi-Fi

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Which makes sense

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I mean it would be horrible quality over 3G anyway

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It takes forever as it is

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Been hinting at that for a long long long long time

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
But

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Nothing about

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Sony Playstation 3

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Because Apple

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
If I'm not mistaking kind of has

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Their own thing I mean you can't see

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
They don't have a Netflix type service per se

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But they do have the movie rental

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
That you can do on

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
The Apple and you can play that

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
On your phone

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So I would see something like this getting shot down

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Just the same way the Google

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
What was the Google Latitude app got shot down

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Google Voice that was the big one

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
That got shot down by Apple as well

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
By Assholes, turds, and twats

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
There's other phones out there

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
That do

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Yes but realize whether you like it or not

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
The iPhone is the one everybody

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Seems to have right now

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It is the most popular phone

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
What's second behind it is the Blackberry

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Probably

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Which is also an AT&T

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Name too

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Or AT&T brand too

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I'm trying to read some comments

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
In the chat room let's see Decipher says

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Atrocious telephones and technology

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Frisbee says all twats talking

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
So there you go

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
And Misty says

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
It's a fucking cheap phone

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Hey I love my iPhone

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Bad bad bad

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Well I mean I'm just saying

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
That it actually is

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Really good

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I mean seriously

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It's a really good technology

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
So whatever

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Yes and Tigerclass says

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Let's not forget there is an all games app on the iPhone

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And it lets you let OLR on it

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Yeah I downloaded it too

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Did that come out in the past couple weeks? I guess it did

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
If you haven't checked out the all games app search for that

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Cause it lets you, it's free

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
And you can tune into all games radio anywhere

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Plug in your ears, plug in the headphones and go

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I always plug in my ears

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Plug it in a car transmitter and go

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Like Mr. Potato Head

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Alright

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
So there you go Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I think it's inevitable

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
It's probably gonna come to

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
If AT&T will let it

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
It'll come to the iPhone

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And Apple also

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
But I don't know about the Wii

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I don't know

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kinda like

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
They could do it

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I think you could do it

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I mean especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Why not

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
You could get the Netflix channel

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I mean honestly though do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I mean granted there is some stuff I watch

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It's mostly TV shows

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
We actually cancelled ours

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I have Netflix and I find that the most stuff I watch

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Is TV shows

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Like NBC has a lot of stuff on there

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
But we were doing that

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
But TV shows is the thing I'll stream the most

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And oddly enough

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And I'm surprised you cancelled because of this dark saga

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
BBC everything is on there

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
That I know but there's still behind on

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
There's still behind on a few things

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
It's old BBC stuff

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
You want BBC stuff from the 70s and 80s it's all there

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I don't know if Monty Python was there but like tons and tons of stuff

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
They don't have any old tomorrow people though

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I mean not the old stuff but like the series I was wanting to watch

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But a lot of it is real shit

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I'm gonna tell you there's a lot of real shit

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I mean some cool indie films but a lot of crap

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Diversity is your friend

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You can stream Hulu

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You have G4 on there

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
YouTube stuff

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Or in my case pirated videos

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Alright well let's move on

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Obviously Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year but nothing now

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Dark Sakura

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Well something that's actually really good for

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
For people who have an Xbox in the United States

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
Is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
The option is

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
You can buy your Xbox points using PayPal

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Find

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And then

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But it really only works

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Through the website not through the console

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And it's right now only in America

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
In other words any way you want to give us your money we'll take it

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Hey it's convenient

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Especially if you sit with your laptop by you when you play Guitar Hero and want the song

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I don't know

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Not Guitar Hero

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Never Guitar Hero

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Maybe it's just me but I don't understand how this is like super beneficial and provides more accessibility

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But maybe that's because I have my Xbox tied to my debit card

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
So when I go on there and buy the

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Virtual Bucks

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't mind

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I mean we're talking about Microsoft

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They're not going to give out my information

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
My bank protects me from any violation of information

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So I'm fine

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But I'm not real worried about that

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I was buying everything and it was very tempting

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But I've gotten a lot better at that

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
But I don't see how PayPal

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Helps that

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You're going to run everything through PayPal

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I mean isn't giving your credit card to PayPal just as bad as giving it to Microsoft?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I guess that's what I don't get

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's really just as though I think for having another option

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It's like when you buy stuff on eBay

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You might be able to use your credit card

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
But I mean it's really just giving people another option

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And I don't see any harm in it

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And you can use it to track your purchases that way too

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So why not?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They have ripped me off in the past

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Like there was an error one time

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Where I paid for something that was $50

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And they charged me for $500

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And got a bunch of overdraft fees and stuff like that

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Because they're super awesome

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And thankfully though the guy that received the $500

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Refunded me my money

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But they take a portion off of each thing

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But if the whole reason why you want to use PayPal is because you're under 18

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And you don't have a credit card

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Dude go to the store and go buy a card

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I mean seriously if you want the points that badly

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Just go to the store, pay the tax on it

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And just go buy a card

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And just redeem it online

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards right?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You can get a prepaid Visa card

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Because if you don't have a credit card

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You're going to have to tie your bank account to PayPal

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I mean it's been a while since I did that

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But it's just easier if you're under 18

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Just go buy a card at the store

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Hell you can go to your favorite game store or whatever

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Trade in some games or trade in crap

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And then get store credit and trade it in for a card

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I've done that too because then that way it's a little easier

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
A little cheaper

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
But I don't know

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It seems like good that they're supporting it

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
They give someone another option but I don't think it's a good option

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Good for them

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I guess the more ways the better

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But I don't know

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Not something I really plan on using

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But see even with that though

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Yeah you can build up money from PayPal

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
One click of a button and it takes like two days

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Done

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So that's kind of a lame excuse if that's

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Oh I got all this money built up in PayPal

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah they would love it free just to spend that PayPal money

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
On stuff that their company is selling

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Or transactions through them

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And are they going to be charging you tax?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Because that would be something interesting too

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I don't know

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I guess it depends on what state you live in

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
True

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So other interesting stuff

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I can't imagine this working full time

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
But their new thing is

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Why buy used when you can buy new?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Best Buy will now match prices of new video games

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
At used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So basically you go to GameStop

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
You say okay

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I see this used game for five bucks cheaper

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Get a new game

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Call this GameStop to see

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Check the price and done

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You get the new game for the price of the used game

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Awesome plan but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off this

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because they're going to be losing money left and right

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Especially if

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Somebody at the GameStop or something like that

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Is a real dick

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh yeah we're charging $20 for that game

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Get a bunch of the game

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Go sell it back to GameStop

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
For more than $20

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Now something that should be stressed though

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Is that this is only available

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
In one certain market right now

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
This is not something

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You can't run into Best Buy after hearing this

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And expect them to do it

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
West Jordan Utah

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So they picked a really small freaking market to do it

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So to our listeners in West Jordan Utah

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
All one of you

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If we even have that many

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You can go check this out

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
But at the same time

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
You kind of said it yourself Loki

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The price of a used game

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
At GameStop is typically only $5 under that of a new game

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
On all their new games

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Is that really that bad of a loss?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
If they can create loyalty

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Because that's a big big thing

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I think a lot of people build up loyalty

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
To one certain place to buy their games

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And here's the other thing too

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
About that

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
You see retailers like this

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Basically they can sell a game at cost

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And it's still beneficial for them

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
If they're able to sell enough units

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Because they get back end rebates

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
To buy X amount of pieces

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Or whatever

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Like a company like Activision or EA

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Or whatever will give them money

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Whether that be ad dollars

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Or just incentives

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Or whatever

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
To get them to buy more

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So what they could do with this

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Is if they are able to launch this full scale

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Really there would be no reason

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
For you to go to a GameStop

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Or GameCrazy

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
To buy a used game

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Or basically the same price

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Now the question is

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Are they going to also count the discounts

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
That you get with your GameStop card

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Are you going to be able to

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Get the extra 10% off

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Probably not

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I would say just assume no on that

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And store credit

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
But isn't that something else they're testing?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Yeah the kiosks are testing that

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But right now they're not

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So they're not really doing

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Any trades yet

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
But it still

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Helps and then they got to do

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
More of the gift with purchase stuff

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Because people seem to eat that crap up

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Even though a lot of the incentives

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Suck

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But at the same time

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And this goes for both Best Buy and GameStop

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
They got to fucking watch

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The prices of their goddamn accessories

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That they're selling because a lot of stuff

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
If you don't watch it they're actually selling it over retail

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Like $5 over retail

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
For example

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Wii Motion Plus at GameStops

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
$5 more than what it should actually cost

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I was an idiot and bought it

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Because I have store credit

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
So I didn't give a crap

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But if I was more cautious

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Then yes you could go buy it for $20 instead of $25

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Same with some of the accessories

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I know on the 360

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Like their video cables

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Or $10 over retail or $5 over retail

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
So you got to watch that shit

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And they got to stop doing that

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
On top of all that if you're cautious

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Then yeah I don't see why this would be a bad deal

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
If you're just interested in getting a used game

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I got to read this comment from chat

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Because it's really funny

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Brad from Pod Culture says

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
They play video games in Utah

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
To which Rama follows up with

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Brad yep they play Super Mormon Brothers 2

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh I'm sure Utah listeners appreciate that one

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Alright

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I just like that idea for a game

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Super Mormon Brothers 2

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
There's a ROM hack somewhere

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Surely there's a ROM hack somewhere

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Well hey I like cheaper games

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
No matter how it happens

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But let's not count out what GameStop might be doing

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Not necessarily in retaliation

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But certainly all the companies are trying to think

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Of ways to one up each other

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And GameStop is apparently looking for a new

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Rewards program

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Because you know the way it is right now

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Is that they have what you get their little card

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You get the 10% discount or whatever

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
10% more on trades

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
You get some magazine I've never read in my life

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Game Informer is actually not bad

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Yeah it's not a bad magazine

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And the subscription price is cheaper than

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Whatever

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Honestly I couldn't tell you

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Actually it was a couple weeks ago

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I actually picked up a Barnes and Noble

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It's a magazine out of the UK

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Retro Gamer I think it's called

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Oh that's good we have an issue with Retro Gamer

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
That was a pretty good one

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But other than that I mean thanks to the internet

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
For the magazines

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
The reason I buy their card each year

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
One because the magazine subscription gives me something to do

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Like to stare off in the space

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
At work sometimes

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And because the extra

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Trade in value that you get

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
It pays for the card

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Within a few uses for me

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That's the only reason I do it

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's basically a cost advantage for myself

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Granted I could probably

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Sell my games on eBay

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Or whatever

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I don't want to go through the fucking hassle

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
So that's my own choice

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Whatever

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Alright well apparently here's two versions

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
They're testing some different

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Rewards versions

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I'm not sure let's see where did this come from

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It was a survey I see

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And here was one

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Take your game to the next level

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
With GameStop Rewards

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So apparently if you sign up for this new

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Free program

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Sign up with your email address and so forth

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
If you do one purchase or trade in a year

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
You would get a birthday surprise

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Meaning discounts on your birthday

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Level two would be

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Make any combination of five purchases

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Or trades per year

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You would get 20% bonus

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Trade in credit because you're a power trader

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I guess and you get early access

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
To purchase collector's editions of games

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That's kind of interesting

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
That's retarded

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Because you know what the early access

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Collector's editions is?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
You get the pre-order before everybody else

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And then level three is

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
10 purchases or trade-ins a year

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
To get you know 25%

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Bonus on trade-ins

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Guaranteed access to exclusive in-game

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Accessories and so forth

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Let's see

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And then there's another one that is just like a two

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Level thing where if you do one purchase

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Or trade in a year you get the birthday

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Surprise but if you do 20 purchases

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Or trade-ins a year you get the

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Subscription to Game Informer you get the power

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Trades you get guaranteed

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
In stock new games or free

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Shipping that's kind of interesting too

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So if they're out of your game they'll ship to your house for free

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That's interesting early access to purchase

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Collector's editions of games $5

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Shipping of new titles shipped on day of release

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And guaranteed access to

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Exclusive in-game accessories etc.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So you know more incentive programs which I'm

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Sure make some people excited but again it's

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
About building customer loyalty

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Is huge you know

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Making 20 trades because

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You know

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Once again it's cheap enough to where

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
$25 that will pay for

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Itself especially with the extra 10%

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
On top of all that probably in

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
One use so

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Why not why wouldn't you do that

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Especially if you're buying games on a regular basis

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You know why I've never signed up for their

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Program and why I don't pre-order games

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And I still stand by this I don't

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Pre-order games because

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I find that when the

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Games are released because the companies

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Are trying to one up each other if I pre-order

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
The game at GameStop or whatever put $5

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Down it's going to come out and Best Buy is

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Going to have a sale where you get a

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
$10 gift card if you buy the game or something

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That's why I don't like to pre-order games because

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
What the competition is the day of release

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And plus sometimes you see these really interesting things

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Where GameStop gets

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
One little incentive game crazy gets

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Another Best Buy gets another you know

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Like all the companies get their own little

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Free weapon or whatever

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And I want to pick the one I like the best

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I don't know I just that's my whole thing

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I'm pre-ordering and joining these

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Incentive programs and stuff I just really like to shop around

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Collector's editions and that's if I'm buying

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
A collector's edition

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Like Grand Theft Auto

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Which we've got sitting right over there

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Yeah

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But that's it

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I mean that's all I really would pre-order

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I order most of my stuff through my work

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Just because you know

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I tend to get them early

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
D5T1 in chat says

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Rob must be a Pepsi fan need to stick to a brand

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Actually I am Pepsi is way better than Coke

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Pepsi is way better than Coke

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Only

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And I've said this before

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It's weird because Pepsi

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It's better out of like

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The can is good

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And the bottle is okay

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
The tap is alright

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Coke on the other hand tastes like shit

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Out of a can

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Tastes alright out of the bottle

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Actually pretty good out of the tap

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It's so weird

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I can agree with that

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I can agree with the tap changing

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Like A&W out of the tap is so good

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Yes

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Can's alright if it's cold enough

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But I will say this because

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Before the Coke lovers start hating on me

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Vanilla Coke was superior to

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Vanilla Pepsi

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
They're both disgusting I'm sorry

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Whatever I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The other day still

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
In the year 2009 at Rubio's

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Yes I was floored

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
They were also one of the first places to have it in town

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
You know what else is good with A&W

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Out of the jug

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Like they actually sell it in milk

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Jugs

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Yes out of their stores

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
That's best

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Let's go ahead and move on

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And Dark Sakura

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
With some more news and we'll get into release dates

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Well there's

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
A channel in the UK called Bravo

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Which is completely has nothing to do

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
With our Bravo

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
That has a show out

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Called Game Face

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
For casual gamers

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Pretty much

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
You just watch

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
These guys play TV

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Play video games

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And they'll have some

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Girl come out and be stupid

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And then you get to see

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Some game footage and then you hear

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
The people reviewing the games

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Over the footage basically

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
What we've already had

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Better people doing on

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
YouTube for free

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You know

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It just really seems like

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It would be really boring to watch

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Because

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Usually anything that's got

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Some type of corporate design behind it

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Tends to get the imagination

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Sucked out of whatever it could have been

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Yeah I mean

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
True there's people that'll sit there

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And watch other people play video games for a long time

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I do when they're at my house

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Even though he doesn't really play the game himself

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
He loves to just watch me kind of play through it

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And see all the cinematic scenes and stuff

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So it's kind of interesting that they're

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Kind of making that a TV show

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
You know that they'll just kind of show

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Also you know this kind of tangent

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Sorry but they have these interesting things on the

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Comcast on demand

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Where you can actually go in and they have these things

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And it's actually I don't know if it's G4

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
One of the other networks puts them on there

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
But you can actually watch

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
In HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Of certain games

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Around release time

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
To help you decide if you want to buy it

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Or not I guess

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Really get to see what it looks like

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
That's kind of interesting

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I actually think that's a good idea

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I think that's a really good idea to have that

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Well my question is you know

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Come out and they're stupid

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
What video game TV show should they make

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Do you think

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
How could they make a video game TV show

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
That's cool

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
They need to bring back the old school stuff

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Where you have the person talking about the new games

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
That are coming out well I guess we're already

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Doing that but you know

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I think that

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
That's really what I'd like to

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
More see because it was really cool back in the day

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Or you know like the

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Video game related game shows

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
But like the ones where the people had the Velcro best

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And ran around that was kind of cool

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
StarCade and all that stuff

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And I would like to see something like the

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Screen Savers used to be

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But more about video games

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Which I know you might be thinking well isn't that Attack of the Show

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I'm not really because that's kind of got that

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Maxim Magazine spin on it basically

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And you know that's not

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
All inclusive really of all the gamers

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's also annoying

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I don't know I'm just

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I'm a much bigger fan of what that

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Show used to be than what it is now that's for sure

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So I don't know

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I kind of like the idea of a

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Gaming kind of TV show by gamers

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Who somewhat know what they're doing

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I also would like to see kind of current

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
More current things I like the idea of

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
A daily show that you know

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Is kind of current

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And really if you want to

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Get reviews and everything

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
There's more amusing things to watch online

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Like the Angry Video Game Nerd

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And the one that

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Oh god I can't remember what it is

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
The one that my husband watches all the time

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
That's kind of like that only older

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
He was drinking New Castle

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It was pretty good

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And somebody in chat says Orange Lounge TV maybe?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
No

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I don't know I think we might be

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Getting too old it's a sad thing

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Not too old he doesn't have enough time

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Yeah it's true

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I'd have to be getting paid for this

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Exactly we'd have to all quit our jobs to do it

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah I would like to get paid

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
So I don't know

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I honestly

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Wouldn't even know where to begin with that

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I'm not even going to think about it

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Let's move on with some release dates

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Low key

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Well there's not a whole lot coming out in the US

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Unfortunately it's a little bit of a slow time

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But there is some big stuff this week

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Including Madden NFL 10

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Coming out this Friday

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Pretty much can't expect that on

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Every single system out there

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Except for the DS I don't think it's on the DS this year

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Fossil Fighter is on the DS

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Actually today

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Or tomorrow

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I don't know I thought it was supposed to be today

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Anyways tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Imagine Soccer Captain

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Another crappy game from Ubisoft

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
That's on the DS

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Active Life Extreme Challenge

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It's the game that has

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I don't know

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Like a two player DDR mat or I guess

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Kind of like a power pad

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But it's for the Wii and it's

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
All the mini games you could possibly want

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And that's available

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Or not want is the case

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
We have a budget Fire Fighter sim

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Real Heroes Fire Fighter

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
That's on the Wii

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Also this week Core on the DS

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
From Graffiti Entertainment

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Hopefully actually coming out this time

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Because it's been delayed forever

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
ATV Quad Kings

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
On the Wii

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
It's a game from Zoo Games

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And I can tell you this much it's gonna suck

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Because it's just like all those other Destiny games

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And they all suck

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Let's see

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Five Two coming out on PC

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I don't know if that's a re-release or not

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Phantom Brave Wii Meet Again on the Wii

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That's actually pretty cool

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
If you're a Japanese RPG fan

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And if you possibly want one

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Even though you don't own Lips

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
They are selling the Lips Microphone

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Separately now

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You can purchase that this week

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
For the Xbox 360

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And that's it

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
It's like I said

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Slow week

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It's also a slow week over in Japan

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
As we go take a look at the Japanese release dates

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Really on the big systems

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
There's only one new game coming out

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
But it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And some folks may get a kick out of that

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It's coming out on the Wii

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Hagane no Reckon Jutsuji

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsuki no Oji

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Comes out

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
It's a game based off

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Clearly the series Fullmetal Alchemist

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Not sure what type of game it is

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
It looks to be like kind of an adventure-y

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Not quite a role playing game

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But a little more adventure-y with some little mini games

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Built in like I see one where you're like shooting guys

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
With the buttons and stuff

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So fans of that series may be into that

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Otherwise that's really it on the big systems

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
If you go to the handhelds

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
You have a little bit coming out on the Nintendo DS

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
The localized version of Bolt comes out

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
From Disney Interactive

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
So Obuncha Derojun

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Rikishi DS and Rika DS

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Both come out this week

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Sounds like a wrestling game

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Or sumo game

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Could be

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But there's two different versions of it

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And then lastly on the PSP there is a new game

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Infinity Plus Portable comes out

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And this is

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I think a bunch of games

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's produced by Cyber Front

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
With different scenarios written by

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Utsukoshi Kotaro

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's done scripts for famous adventure games

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Like Memory Off

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And it's part Danish simulation and part adventure

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
You have to rack your brains

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
To work your way out of pressing situations

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Time leaps and messed up dimensions

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Are just a few of your troubles

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
There on the PSP

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That's really it for this week in Japan

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Well for our friends in the UK

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
There's a few releases

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
On the 12th is Trials HD

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
On Xbox 360

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Marvel vs Capcom 2

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Both of those on the 13th

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
For PC and

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Madden 10, whatever

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
That's it

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Madden BLEH

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Not your cup of tea, huh?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
BLEH, barf

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Um

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So this is interesting

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Sony has trademarked a new

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Um

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I guess a new logo

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
For something called PlayStation Thanks

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Um, no word on what this is yet

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
However, if you were to ask me

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I would say that it's probably gonna be some sort of

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Um, incentive program

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Very similar like, you know, the

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Club Nintendo stuff

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Very interesting tonight, we have a lot of

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Discount and reward stories

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I guess a sign of the times, I don't know

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
To help in the economy

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yeah, I mean, maybe

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I mean, that's the only thing I can think of

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Unless they're gonna come out with a new system named

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Thanks, which would be retarded

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I mean, I'm sorry, that would be absolutely retarded

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Thanks for giving me your money

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
But then again, you know, hey, we said the same thing about the Wii

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
When that was named, but uh

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I hope not

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Um, yeah

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
No word on what that is, but I'm sure we'll find out about it

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Soon enough

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Dude, let's go play Thanks

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Nice

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I don't know, that would be awful

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
PlayStation Thanks

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Uh, any type of speculation what it is?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Do you think it's just to compete with Club Nintendo

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Or do you think this is just gonna unlock shit and home?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I think it's just a redemption program

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Just basically to incentivize people to buy stuff

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
S2100Matt in chat says

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I approve of these discount stories

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It's just kinda interesting, it all seems to be hitting the same week

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And you know, we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
This is all for work this week

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You know, they get you to buy stuff

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And you get codes and then you can like redeem points

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And get crap

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Maybe that's what they're doing

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
That would make more sense to me

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
PlayStation 3, since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Um

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I don't know

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
It'd be a nice bonus

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Tigerclaw says perhaps this thanks thing could be a reward system

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Where they offer you discounts on any games purchased in PlayStation Network

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Who knows, $5 off or something

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I don't know

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I don't know

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Well I say thanks to Square Enix

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Because this week we got some more details on Final Fantasy 14

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
A more full website has opened up for the game by the way

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
If you want to check that out

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And I guess some more information was released on an 8 minute video

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
That came out from Famitsu Wave

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I guess which is available on YouTube

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But boy oh boy

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
If you want to check that out

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It didn't really end there

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
A lot of new information came out

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
On Final Fantasy 14

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What's kind of interesting is that

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Some of the jobs from 11

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Is going to be somewhat similar

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
But the focus is going to be on the weapons

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And they're saying that okay

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
What's also interesting

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
They're not using any of the Final Fantasy

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Very typical names for classes

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Like you have swordsman and sorcerer

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Like all these new type of jobs

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
That you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
But apparently the way it works is that like let's say you have a sword

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Okay well that makes you a swordsman

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
But then let's say you're going to go off on an adventure

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Where you need to go heal

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Well you switch from your sword to your staff

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And now you're a healer

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And that's why you see in the Final Fantasy 14 logo

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Out of the trailer that there was a lot of weapons poking out of it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Because the weapon system is kind of the central part of that game

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And they say

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
That experience points and leveling

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Doesn't even work like a normal game

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Like there are no experience points in leveling

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It's all based on the weapons

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So it sounds kind of interesting

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But more importantly they've also talked about

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
They are building this game so you can play it

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
If you have only an hour of time to spare

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Or if you have all day to spare

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
They are looking at certain features that are only

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
15-30 minutes in length

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Also some other things released about the game this week

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Is that the classes have been revealed

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And what's really interesting is that

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
They call them completely different names

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
They're not all even the

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Same names that you might be used to

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Like Taru Taru

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Is now called a Lalafel

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Which I keep saying a falafel

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
But their name is a Lalafel

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Or something like that

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I know they changed all the names

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Because it's a new world

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Oh it's not a new world, they're the exact same races

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Come on

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
The characters do look slightly different

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
But they're also saying that the difference between the races

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Is not going to be that great

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But that the differences between the genders

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
There's some translation I read

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Which some people are thinking might be a throwback

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
To the old D&D

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Where men were typically more strength

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Women were typically more mind intelligence

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Kind of interesting

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That's not true at all

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I don't think it's funny to call them falafels

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Do you also have Hummus as another class?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Probably

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
There's a Humaya or something like that

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Is what they call a human

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Why can't they just use Hummus?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Seriously

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
They're elven

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Just call them elves

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
They're not elven

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Or elephanten

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Or whatever the hell they're calling them

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I think my friend Shane was calling them Lalafels

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
They don't look as cute as Taros do

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
They look bigger now

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
They don't look like Taros did

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Apparently they're more customizable

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Are they going to have male Mithras

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And female Galkas

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Or whatever the fuck they're calling them

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
These guys are unisex though

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Not yet, we haven't seen anything yet

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
But the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
That they might come out later

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
That we'll see male Mithras later on

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Or whatever they're calling them now

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Cat people

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
You say that and I have thought this ever since

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I always think of Mithril

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I will say this though

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Some screenshots have come out from the game

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It looks really nice

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Not really a lot from in-game

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
But just of some of the scenery and things

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
To look a lot more like Oblivion

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But very colorful

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Oblivion started to look very monotone after a while

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But Final Fantasy 14

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
They've shown some landscapes

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
That are just very lush and colorful

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And I'm very excited to see

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
How the game looks when it comes out

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Because the game's coming out in 2010

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I don't know how they're going to do that

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
When Final Fantasy 13 hasn't even dated yet

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I think people are getting their hopes up

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I don't think this game's coming out until 2011

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I realize Squeenix is saying 2010

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
But come on, how many games get delayed?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Do we trust them?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Do we really trust them?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So best case scenario

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Like Christmas 2010

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Is when you'll see this game, I think

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But hey, don't get me wrong

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I'm kind of excited about this game

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Because I'm really excited at the notion that they have

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Fixed a lot of the problems

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Big problems that Final Fantasy 11 had

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Especially in regards to

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
How long of an investment you have to make

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
With the game each time you play it

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I mean like a month at a time

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Right?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So anyway

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
We're going to go into now another segment

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
We like to do here

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And recap a

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Favorite game that we love

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
In a segment called the classic game of the week

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And find the game

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That she thinks you all ought to be playing this week

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
In Dark Soccer's classic game of the week

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
The game of the week is

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
In Japan it came out

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
As a Zell Panzer Dragoon RPG

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It is

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Like I said, a role play game

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Came out in 1988

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
For the Saturn

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Not including

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Panzer Dragoon Mini

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
That came out on Game Gear in Japan

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And also it's also the only one

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
That's not a rail shooter

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
It's

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It was done by

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Team Andromeda

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And this was

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Their last game as

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Team Andromeda

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
So you're playing a boy named Edge

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Who is looking

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Who's actually trying

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
To save the world

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And has his own dragon and everything

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And so you play through the game

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
With real time

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Well sort of real time

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Combat

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Your different interactions

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
With the characters

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
The really really cool thing about this

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Is that

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You actually

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Don't

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Stay on the dragon all the time

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You can go around

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And explore different areas on foot

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And then you can fly around the world

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
You know different places that you can get to

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
You

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Control your dragon

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Pretty much completely

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Instead of it being predetermined

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Like it was in the other games

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
You actually tell the dragon where to go

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And can go anywhere you want to

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
You also have other commands for the dragon

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Like breaking things and accessing

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Lovers and switches and things like that

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And your dragon has different

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
You know weapons

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
It's

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Like you have lasers for your dragon

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Dragon with lasers that's pretty cool

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Dragons with lasers awesome

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Why didn't they just call the game

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Laser Dragons? I probably would have checked it out

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
When it was first out

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Well it actually was really good

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It used a lot of dramatic camera angles

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
It really

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Had just

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It was really really a

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Traditional RPG with some

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Really unconventional aspects to it

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Like for example you're in air combat

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And it wasn't necessarily

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Turn based it was

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Real time based

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And you know you have your attack

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You can use items and then you have your berserks

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Which are like your spells

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And then you know you've also got

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Your gauges that determine

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
You know where you are for your initiative

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
You know sort of like that

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The other

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Now this is what I really liked is that

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
You can get different abilities

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
You can equip your dragon

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Well it's technically called

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Morphing they also put this in

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
In Panzer Dragons VI and

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Orda which came out on Dreamcast

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You can change

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
The dragon into all these different forms

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Which actually the specific

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Thing about Saga is that

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
You literally had hundreds

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Of different forms that you could do

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
You would affect different attributes

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
By sort of upgrading

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Parts of your dragon and it would

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Take a different appearance

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Have different abilities, do different things

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And it would actually

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Change physical form

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
As you did everything

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
There were

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Really different extreme forms

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Based off of agility, spirit, attack

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Or defense

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And then it would change something within

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Those four extremes

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You would

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Also be able to make some

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Unique forms by getting D units

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And then

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
There were hidden forms one of them is called

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
The light wing where if you get all 12

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Of the D units in the game

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
You get the ultimate dragon

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Pretty much the light wing has

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
All of the special berserks

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
And

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
When you charge all of your action gauges

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Then all of your status

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Your health points and your berserk points

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
All go to normal

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Then there's another one called the solo wing

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Which really didn't do crap for you

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
But it was harder to get so

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
It bothered

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
But it is considered one of the

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Pinnacles of

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
The Saturn RPGs

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And Saturn RPGs are

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Barely

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
You know, at least for the ones

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That we got out over here

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Few and far between

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And we actually have

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
An American copy of this game

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And we paid

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Quite a bit for it

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Good luck finding it

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It's really really difficult

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
But it is considered

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
One of the best RPGs

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
On the Saturn

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Especially the few that came out in the US

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
There it is

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Your classic game of the week

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And I've never really seen this game before

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
But especially for that era

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I like the backgrounds, they're very pretty

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
It's all these dragons shooting their lasers

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And pretty sunsets and so forth

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Really good music and not a lot of talking

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Was one of the dragon battles

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Yeah, it's kind of fun

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
The game has some

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Gorgeous music and also it's in

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Japanese

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
With subtitles

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So the voice acting was actually

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Pretty good in it too

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
There's a few familiar voices

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
For at least those who were onomie

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Nuts

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Well if you actually have a Sega Saturn

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Still around the house and kicking and working

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
You can kind of copy that and check it out

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Or I guess you can always try to emulate it somehow

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
But do they have Saturn?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
They have Saturn emulators, you usually have to have a good working BIOS

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But other than that

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah, they work

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
They work fine on your PC at home

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I have one because

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I just wanted to try it and it actually works on my

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Disc games that I have a few Saturn games

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It works great

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Alright, well we're going to take a break here on

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
We've got plenty more to come

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
We've got our rapid fire news when we come back with Part B tonight

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
As well as some more discussion

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
We're going to talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSI

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And Pax 09 news

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So don't go anywhere, stay tuned

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Music

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
On this lovely Sunday evening

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Of 2009, of course we do tape live

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
On all games radio every Sunday night

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
9 o'clock Eastern Time

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
In Part A, but you will just have to download

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
The podcast at this point, which I know

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Is very slow in updating during our podcast

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But should be back on a more regular schedule

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
This week

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
So anyhow, let's jump right back into some more gaming news

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
We have some rapid fire news

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
News that we're probably not going to talk a lot about

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But we wanted to get it out there anyway

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yes, Pearl Jam's next album is actually

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Becoming simultaneously to

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Rock Band as well as retail

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
And of course

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Their new album, which

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I believe is called Backspacer

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Which is kind of a weird name, but okay

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It'll be available

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
The same day

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
On both Playstation Network and Xbox Live

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Marketplace, September 20th

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Is going to be the

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Date for that

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition is now

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Also being ported to

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
The iPhone

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And it makes perfect sense that they would be

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Putting that out there

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Definitely worth checking out

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I believe it's actually coming out as

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Pac-Man Remix

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Oh no

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
They had one called Pac-Man Remix

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
My mistake, it is Championship Edition

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
That'd be kind of cool

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And then a new

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It's going to suck on the iPhone because the music

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Was awesome in the Xbox one

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I don't know if they're, well I guess you know

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
iPhone is an MP3 player, but

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And they've got some kickass tunes, but I don't know

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
One being reproduced on the iPhone

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Sorry, had to get that out there

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
We'll see

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Champions Online is actually doing something

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Interesting with their subscription service

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
They're actually, besides the monthly

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
subscription that you could do

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Which would be

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
$15 a month

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I guess

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
You can actually purchase

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
A six month plan

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
At a slightly discounted rate for

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
$59.99

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Or if you want to

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
If you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
You can get a lifetime subscription

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
For $199.99

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
$200

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And I know for a lot of people that are

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Playing WoW, if you get a lifetime

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Subscription for $200, that probably would've been

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Worth it when it launched

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I don't know, if you're really into

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Champions Online, that might be the way to go

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
But aren't you

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Getting also something about Star Trek Online

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
With that too? That was the part that caught my eye

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Yes, if you pre-order

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
One of the subscription plans

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You will also get

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Access to the closed beta for

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Star Trek Online

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Which is coming out later this year

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
See, I really want to play

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Star Trek Online, but not $200

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Sadly, especially when I don't really know anything

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
About Champions Online, except that

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
The series has a cult following to it

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I play Champions offline

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
With books and paper and dice

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Does the prospect of an online one

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Because, you know, that wasn't really my thing

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Is the prospect of an online version of that

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Appeal to you?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Maybe? Could be hit and miss, I guess

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
But, dude, Star Trek Online

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Early, that's cool

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
But, man, that's a mean thing to do

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I mean, you gotta pay, what

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
$200, or what's the other subscription plan

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Like $50 or something? $60 for six months

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
You gotta pay upfront

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Just to get into a beta, it's not worth it for that

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I bet you, though, there's some people

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
That'll pay that $60 just to get in that beta

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I am positive of that

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
You're gonna pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
To play a beta for another MMO

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
That you're possibly gonna go to

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Kind of a waste of money if you ask me

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Well, you know what? People can spend their money

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
However they want, right?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Alright, sorry, I didn't mean to go off and talk about that

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
But I just thought that was too interesting

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Anyhow, let's- I think it's funny

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Let me dive into some more news, we'll start off with

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
This actually is a little bit of old news

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It did come out a couple weeks ago, but

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
We have some staffers at Orange Launch Radio that love

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Love, love a little indie game called La Mulana

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And that was a game that came out

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It actually came out in like 2005

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
But it has extremely retro graphics

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
It's kind of like

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Metroid-ish style kind of game

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
If you've never seen this game before

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Well, if you've never seen the game before

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You will get to see it soon

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit, surprise

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It won't really look 8-bit

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But it'll look kind of more 16-bit

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
With a little bit more hand-drawn art

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Is what the look they're going for

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Should be kind of fun

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
The WiiWare version will also have downloadable content

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
New stages and game modes

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Such as Boss Rush

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
The game is very, very difficult

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
So I'm not sure if the level of difficulty will still be there

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Or what they plan to do

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
But that is all part of it

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Moving on to talking about Rockband

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I thought this was interesting

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Rockband.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
This is interesting because

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
You've seen some blogs and some websites

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Do instrument compatibility charts of their own

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
But this is coming right from the source

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Harmonics meaning

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And includes games such as Beatles Rockband

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
What I think is interesting about this

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
They make no shame about listing

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Guitar Hero games on here as well

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
They also put in their compatibility chart

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
As well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
If you're curious, just briefly

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
You can look at this at Rockband.com slash compatibility

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
You get the whole chart

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
But it actually looks like most of the instruments

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Are compatible with all the games at this point

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
The only things you're going to run into is

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
You're going to run into problems with some of the Rockband paraphernalia

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
In Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
On the Xbox 360

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And drums are all pretty cross compatible

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Unless you own the Rock Revolution drums

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
They just don't work with Rockband games

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
But if you want the confidence that your instruments

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Will work with the Beatles Rockband

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Here's some good news for you

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Beatles Rockband will run on

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Every single instrument will run with

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Beatles Rockband as well as

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Rockband 2

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The only thing that doesn't work with Rockband 2

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Rock Revolution drums

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Same thing with Beatles Rockband

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
No one bought Rock Revolution anyway

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
They might, it's cheap now even with the drums

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I guess it's true

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Find an unloaded one

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Anyhow, one other one

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Quick follow up to a story previously talked about on Orange Launch Radio

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And the game will be released in October

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
But the game will be coming out in October

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So get ready to rock those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
That was a really messy situation

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Because there was counter suits and all this other garbage

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Yuck

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
What actually was going to be coming out is

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Revenge of Shinobi

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
For Mega Drive for the Genesis

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Over here will be coming out for

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
800 Nintendo points

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And on WiiWare there's Bonsai Barber

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Which is a tree sculpting and painting game

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's actually running a business

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Doing both of those

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
And that's a thousand points

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And then there will be a bunch of city maps

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
For DS city transport

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
For DS city transport map volumes 1 and 2

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
There will be

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Parasite

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And then there will be

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And then there will be

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And then there will be

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
London, Amsterdam

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Moscow, Berlin, and Prague

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So that's pretty cool

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And that will be for 500

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Also in other news

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And this makes me a happy fangirl

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Is we will have gorillas in rock band

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Yay

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Where's the yay?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Yay

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
That's right

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But I'll download them for sure

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Definitely

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Heck yeah

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Well there's going to be Feel Good Inc, Clint Eastwood

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And Rehash

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
For pack 1

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And that's going to be pretty cool

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It's supposed to be out

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
For

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Excuse me

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
On the rock band music store

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
This week

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I believe

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Tuesdays are usually the day those come out right?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Exactly

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
There's also going to be some other

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Download tracks

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
We get some Janis Joplin

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
We get Piece of My Heart

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
That's awesome

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
This is going to be the best week ever for rock band

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
We get White Rabbit

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Dude! Jefferson fucking airplane

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
This is the greatest week ever for rock band

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
We get Magic Bus

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Nice

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
But also for the Wii

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
There will be a number of songs

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Yeah

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Thin Lizzy

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Or no, my birthday?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I still haven't spent it

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I have to get the gorilla stuff

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I have to get Jefferson airplane

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Look forward to that at my next rock band party

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
The other thing

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Sega is teasing us

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
With the new RPG

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
We will be able to see

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
What it is on August 20th

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
But

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
There are a few clues though

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Saying that there's going to be

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It's a wooden ship wheel

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And a silhouette of a woman

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
In a weird pose

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
So

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
There's a few people who think

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
That there's going to be

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
A

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
PSO

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
But

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
PSO

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Like

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
A new fantasy czar

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Fantasy star roleplay game

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Fantasy czar

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
That's set in the

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Future Russia

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
In outer space

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
No

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
This to speculation they really pulled it out

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Of some HTML code

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
AKA their ass

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
So that's it

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Now Kyria Chronicles 2 or something

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But I guess we already know about that

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Or I'm thinking if they've got

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
A big captains wheel

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
What about Eternal Arcadia

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
That was out on Dreamcast

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Where you had the air pirate ships

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Wow that's obscure

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
That's not obscure I haven't

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I never

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Doesn't mean anything

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Look folks go look at the

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Video of the vault on YouTube

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
And tell me she does not have some obscure shit

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
The lady pulls out a dish

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
That came with a video game at some point I kid you not

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Or perhaps

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
That's obscure

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
It's a new party game collection

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Sonic vs the Somalia pirates

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
No

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Good times

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
No

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Very cool

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Alright

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I hate you Spyler

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Oh yeah that's right it came out as Skies of Arcadia

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Over here or whatever

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Oh now Skies of Arcadia

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
I've heard of that okay

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I get it now

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Not obscure

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Alright let's get back to some more gaming news Loki

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Alright

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Well

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
There's some interesting stuff that they were

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Showing off this week for Guitar Hero 5

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Including

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
That much like the Wii version

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Where you can throw in your own Miis

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Although that version kinda

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Eh the Miis thing's kinda lame

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
The Xbox

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Avatars will now be able to be featured

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
In your Xbox 360 version

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Of Guitar Hero 5

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
To rock out I guess on stage

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Which is

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Interesting

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And on top of that

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Also Guitar Hero

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Van Halen this week got its full

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Track list

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Some people

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Are less excited about it

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Um

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Eh

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Anyways

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Some of the tracks feature

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Are featured

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
In the game I guess

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Jump, Hot for Teacher

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Let's see

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Panama

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
That's gonna be awesome

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Pretty Woman

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
So This is Love

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Unchained and You Really Got Me

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Of course those are all Van Halen tracks

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Other artists featured in the game

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
As well

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Billy Idol, White Wedding

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Um

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Foreigner with Devil Vision

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Third Eye Blind, Semi Charmed Life

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
The Offspring, Pretty Fly

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
For A White Guy

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Do do do do do do do do

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Queen, I Want It All

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Lain Cravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Man just when I think

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Like a song list kinda blows

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I'm not really interested. They have to go in and throw in a Queen track

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
That suddenly takes it from Suck to

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Awesome. Which by the way

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Sing Star Queen is apparently out now

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
And I'm surprised I don't already own it

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
It's not out yet. I thought it came out this week

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Oh yeah that's right they changed the date I forgot about that

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It like got bumped up or something

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin though

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Cause Sing Star games usually end up in the discount bin

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
In about a month

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Yeah

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
So yeah

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
All those tracks and you know

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Of course those two stories just

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And not for any other reason at all

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Of course not

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Cause that would be purely hypothetical

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Now I was

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
In South Lake Tahoe this weekend

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
And at the basement of one of their

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Casinos there, Harvey's

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
They have a Cabo Wabo

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And that was kind of a fun place to go

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Cause you get good drinks and so forth

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
You know who started that?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Somebody that's missing from Guitar Hero

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Exactly

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
So I was gonna say I saw some

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Well I didn't see him there but I saw someone this week

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
That I'm not gonna see in this game

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Sammy Hagar

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
I was gonna

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I was gonna also say though

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
That

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The game is scheduled

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
To come out

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
For most people

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
That seems way pushed back from what we were originally

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
It is way pushed back

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Interesting

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It is interesting now isn't it

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Hypothetically speaking

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Very interesting

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Just before Christmas

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Just before Christmas

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
The Christmas will come early for some

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Guitar Hero faithful

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Hypothetically

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Anyhow hey one thing that's not hypothetical

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
This is fact ladies and gentlemen

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Facebook is now integrated with the DSI

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
The whole switch happened on

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I think it was the 3rd of August

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
When this all went down

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
But I know I've been seeing it show up on my

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Friend feed on Facebook

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
None of my real life friends

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Have it but some of the OLR listeners

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Have me friended on Facebook and some of them are using it

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
So you know here's the thing

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
The DSI Facebook functionality

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Is pretty much the same thing with your cell phone

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Because when I was on my Tahoe trip

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
This weekend for anybody that has me friended on Facebook

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I was uploading pics for my cell phone

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
The whole way like I uploaded

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Some things and we were stopped in this

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
This town I can't even remember what it was called

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It had a hilarious name it was like

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
It wasn't pond scum but like pond spring

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
It was something really silly

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
We uploaded pictures from there and you know just as we were

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
On the way there and actually there's some pictures from

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Cabo Wabo in there

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
It's the same thing but with your DSI

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
You basically just you know instead of your cell phone

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
It's your DSI but since

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
The DSI has all the picture

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Altering modes on it where you can draw

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And have the borders and all the

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
You know weird distortion pictures

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
You can upload those

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Pictures too which I guess you can't really

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Yeah I know

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Honestly it's the same functionality

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
You'd find in a cell phone which

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
You know whatever okay

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
On my Facebook I guess

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Not something that has me bouncing off the walls

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
But I can see where some people find this cool

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Especially if you don't have a decent camera

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
On your cell phone or you like to

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Edit pictures as somebody

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
On my Facebook loves to do because all the pictures

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
He's posted of himself are all like

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Drawn on and mirrored imaged

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And all just distorted

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
But hey

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Have fun with it that's what DSI is about

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Having fun right? Is there anything else

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
They could really do with Facebook integration and the

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
DSI I mean I'm kind of glad it's just this

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
So and so is now playing Pokemon

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
So and so just stop playing

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Pokemon because I would block

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Those posts from Facebook so fast I mean is there

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
A lot of other integration the only other

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Possibly cool thing I can think of is like an

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Interactive high score board like you see this

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
With like Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games like

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So and so just beat your high score

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Click here to try and beat it

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
You know one thing I do like about

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Facebook is if you find that shit annoying

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
There's always a hide button and you can block

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Any application and all that stuff

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
You know Facebook used to be a lot worse but it got a lot

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Better so

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Anyhow

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Just curious if anyone else thinks

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
That there might be something cool they can add to Facebook

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Nope, nope, alright

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
How about fewer

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Invites to

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Sorority girl or whatever the

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Fuck that is I love sorority life

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I quit that so fast

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Did you block it? Yes I did

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I was going to say because I try not to send like

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I try not to let those things go out but sometimes they do

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And I only send gifts to people that I know play regularly

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I blocked it, I blocked

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Farm town, the only thing that I

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Play on there are the retarded quizzes

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
And

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
The

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Pet thing, pet society

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I will admit I play Bejeweled Blitz

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I play sorority life, I'm level 47

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Thank you very much and I play

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Farm town now, my boyfriend got me addicted to

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Farm town which in reality is

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
It really is kind of one of the

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Dumbest fucking games but

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
You know what it's something that Jeff really enjoys

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
To do so I play it to kind of have a friendly

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Competition with him although he's so much more addicted than

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I am so

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
But I told him if he likes farm town he really needs to play

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Animal Crossing sometime because I think that would be right up his alley

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Anyhow

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Enough about casual Facebook games

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Let's talk more about more video games

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Dark Sakura

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Well we might have some other

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Video game news

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
How about Braid?

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Braid is actually going to

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
PlayStation Network finally

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
It's supposed to be

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Actually looking for

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
No they don't have a

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Date on it yet

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
But

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
They are saying though that

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Hopefully

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
It will be out soon I guess

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
It seems like a little late

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I mean didn't this game come out

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Like a year and a half ago or something

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Maybe it wasn't that long ago but at least a year ago

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Right?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I mean I guess

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You know

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Wherever people want to play the game

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Let them

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
The designers make their money however

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
But it just seems like this game's on

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Xbox

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
This game's on PC

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I have no interest in rebuying the game that's for sure

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Yeah but there's people who have PS3s

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
That don't have an Xbox 360

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Or have a PC

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
That they could download the game on

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
But I guess not everybody likes to game on PC

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I would be more interested in this if there was like

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
More levels or something

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
But I just, to be honest

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Without kind of dumbing it up

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Is the storyline

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Which is very finely contained to those episodes

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Or anything like that

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I think it is what it is

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
That's for sure

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Frisbee brings up an interesting point

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Talking about Facebook in our chatroom

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
chat.orangestory.com

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I'm sorry, not Facebook, but the DSi

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Remember when the DS was going to have

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
VoIP at hotspots?

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Whatever happened to that?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
That's a good question. Remember they demoed that at E3 one year?

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
The Skype type thing on the DS?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Why did that suddenly go away?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Anyone know?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I think they just integrated it into some games

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
To know how they have voice chat

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And like certain games

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
You can do voice chat with the DS

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I think that's what it came down to

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Hmm

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That's what some folks in chat are saying

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
EasyHP in chat says it's called

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Pokemon voice chat

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Probably because the DS isn't that powerful

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Shit, it can't really run a web browser

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
That well without an expansion card

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
It has no real RAM in it

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
It has a few megs of RAM

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But that's about it

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I would think it would be very tough for it to

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Process that kind of stuff

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I don't know

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I'm very interested to see

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
What Nintendo's next handheld

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Is going to be like

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And I bet we see it in about three years

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I'm very curious to see

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Maybe even two

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
It'll be GameCube graphics

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We'll see

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
It makes sense, it's the progression

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
That's true

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I wouldn't mind a portable type F0 though

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
That's for sure

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And yeah, I agree with Frisbee in chat

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I'll just use Skype

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Alright, a few more stories

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And we're going to get to the mailbag tonight

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Loki

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Yes, well unfortunately

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
For Starcraft fans

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
You're going to have to wait a bit longer

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Yes, Starcraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
And that makes a lot of people sad

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And you won't be able to buy the trilogy

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Or at least the first entry in the trilogy

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
That's still annoying

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
The fact that they got rid of LAN

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
And it's still being sold as a trilogy

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Instead of all three things being part of one game

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Huh, that sounds like an Activision move to me

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I'll get you to buy the game three times

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Well what's also kind of sucky about this

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Is the fact that everything is fucking getting delayed to 2010

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
There's tons of games

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Bioshock 2 got delayed to 2010, right?

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
There's been other games

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It seems like what's left this year?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Well they want to announce a lot of games

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
It's just not already

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Well they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000
First off they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines in 2

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
It just gets buried under everything that comes out

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Because they don't want to release a game out around the same time

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Because they'll just get ignored

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I don't know, I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
But at the same time

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Like Kane & Lynch 2

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Stuff like that

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Because

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I don't know, they just weren't ready yet

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Hmm

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Alright

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Well hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
You're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
But only if you were one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omega-Thon

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
The game Halo 3 ODST

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Is going to show up in round 3

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omega-Thon

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
The other games

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Mario Kart Wii is round 1's game

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Round 2 is Bookworm Adventures

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
They don't know what game it is yet

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
But speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Like Rock Band Beatles

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Or DJ Hero

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
And round 5 will be Connect 4

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
The final round, as always, is a mystery game

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That will probably be either something new

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Or something really old

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
So

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Like Epic Pong type of thing

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
They've already done that

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
What were the games they did last year?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I don't even remember

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
The Omega-Thon stuff from past

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I think Combat was one year, I remember that

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Combat was one year, Pong was one year

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
They did Halo 3 one year

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Um

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I don't remember what was last year

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I think we were broadcasting

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Versus Excitebike was the last game last year

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
That's right

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I remember now

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
So by the way

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Speaking of Penny Arcade Expo

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Sadly, it looks like no one from OLR is going

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Loki, obviously, is not going to be able to go

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Dark Sakura

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Has not been planning on going

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I was kind of on the fence

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Right now, I'm a real heavy no on PAX

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
If something comes up

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Like a really great opportunity in the next few days

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Um

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Then I'll change my mind

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
But right now, there's just so much other stuff going on

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I just think there's other stuff I can do

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Besides Penny Arcade Expo

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
There's others up there and so forth

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But I'll just have to try again next year

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Someone must pay for me, I'll go

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
And here's the other thing

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
I am still aiming for

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And this should be clear

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
The one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Is because I am still definitely

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Set on going with that

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Unless something happens to PAX Boston next year

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Which I know is weird

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Because I'm on the West Coast

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
But I do want to go visit the East Coast

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
With all the appointments and time off

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I've been taking during the pregnancy

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And last week and stuff

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I've just run out of

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Oh, and this week, I've taken the whole week off

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I've run out of my paid time off

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Sure, sure

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
New trips for a few years

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Yeah, that's my plan

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Again, if there's this huge opportunity

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
For OLR, all games that I've heard

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Again this year or anything

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I think Bobby was heading all that up last year

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And I think he's trying to do something

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
For at least his show this year

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
But I don't know if it's going to be as big as last year

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
And you have to remember guys

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
As I think some of us thought might happen

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
E3 did pull some of us away

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
And our money and time

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
That we were able to spend on PAX last year

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
There it is

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Alright, but I am still hoping for PAX Boston

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
We'll see

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
But if you're going to PAX online, don't get me wrong

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
PAX is a fun con

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Just because we're not going

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I don't want people to get the wrong impression

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
It's just economy and so forth

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
The reasons why we're not going

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But PAX is a fun con

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
If you just want to sit around and geek out

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That's the best way I could describe PAX

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Just geek out all weekend long

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
It's like an anime convention with a whole lot of games

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Yeah, it's cool

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I do want to go again

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Because then it won't only be like

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
OMG PAX, but OMG

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And I have friends there, so

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Cool

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
What we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Email bag, and I'm sure the mail bag

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Is busting at the seams this week

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Because we haven't been on in a little while

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I don't know, I think it's just average size

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
What are you doing over there?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
You got a dude standing in his underwear

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
On The Sims, what are you doing?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It's a bathing suit, he's in a Speedo

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Look, just the one problem

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It looks like tighty whities from back here

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Well, I think that they were based off

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
The same model, but

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Wait, this doesn't answer the question

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
What are you doing

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Designing a naked dude?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
He's not naked

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Half naked

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
You should have seen what I had him in

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Here, here's what I had him in before

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Yes

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
This makes for great radio, it's alright

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I've seen these little short things before

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
That's what he was in before

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
He can stay in those, fine

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
No, I don't care, I just think it's funny

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
That I look over there and then suddenly

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Yes, this is Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
But the problem is that I

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Changed out the default skin

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
So he's like extra buff now

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
And besides that, the underwear is better

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Alright, let's

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Go to the mail bag

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
You can go to orangeonsradio.com if you want to send us some emails

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
So, the first email

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Duh duh duh

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I'm trying to go in chronological order

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
But, um, this comes from

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Okay, I'm really not gonna read the explanation

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Of the guy's name

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
So, um, I apologize for fucking up your last show

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I accidentally sent all my

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Contacts that message

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Do not hate me, I hate spam too

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
My email is filled with spam

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
As for the Skype shit, I was

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Using my PSP on a horrible connection

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I am in the market for a computer

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
This is one, isn't it? I remember reading this

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Okay, that's who it is

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Fuck Windows Vista

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Do you know any good operating systems?

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Yes, Linux Mint, it's free

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Windows 7 is gonna be better than Vista

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Linux Mint is better than it all

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Um, next

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And he sent a couple by accident

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So I am just going to read the one

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
That looked like it made the most sense

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Um, hey, O.L.R.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
All I wanted to say

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
That almost all the game purchases I've made

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I've recently made have either been

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Talked about or recommended on your show

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And I love them all

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
And it is this

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Alive for the

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Now old school gaming

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And I would like to expand my gaming horizon

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
To include some old school stuff

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
So I was just wondering if you guys had

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
A good starter console for someone like me

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Thanks guys, Mike V

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
13 years old?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
13 Dude, I think

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
We had a listener that claims to be our youngest

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Listener at 14, I think he just got beat

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Sorry dude

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Just pick up one of those, um

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
You know, used

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
I would say, like, if I have the Famicom

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Um, NES

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Systems that are kind of third party now

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
You can pick up, pick up one of those

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Go to, like, one of your youth game shops

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Or even, I was reading

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
There's a lot of people that found pretty good deals

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
At thrift stores and stuff, you can find some old consoles

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I actually found

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Discontinued games at thrift stores, like I found

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
And Casey Munchkin

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
For the, uh, Odyssey 2

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Wow

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Or, you know, Dark Tetsuya makes a good point

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Get the Wii

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Or the Virtual Console

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
It's a pretty faithful recreation

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Of the original stuff

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I feel so old because that means I would have been

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
18 when he was born, oh my god

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
But, uh, Super Nintendo

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
If you missed out, I mean

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Honestly, Super Nintendo, I don't think has ever

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Been beaten in terms of great consoles

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Super Nintendo was the best

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Gaming console, purely 100%

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Game console, Super Nintendo

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Was the best gaming console they ever made

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
If you're gonna start anywhere, I say start there

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Actually...

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
If you wanna start where we started, go to Atari 2600

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
But if you wanna just jump to the good shit

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
The Genesis, though, did have better versions

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Of some games, like the copy of Mortal Combat

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Well, Mortal Combat 2

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
And, um, Samurai Shodown

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
That was on Genesis for better

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Super Nintendo did have a few better

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Versions, like, um, Super Street Fighter 2

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I thought was better on Super Nintendo

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Um, the other, and this is

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Of course, just for sampling purposes

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
You know, disclaimer, disclaimer

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Um, GameTap, or

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
You know, Zofar's Domain

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
But, I actually

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
The Wii's gonna be your best bet

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
You know, you can sample the

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Neo Geo, you know

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Go that way

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
That's actually not a bad recommendation

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
If you do wanna go all the way back to some of the

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
2600 games that we grew up on

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Things like Adventure, Kaboom, uh

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Keystone Kingdom, Kangaroo

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Popeye, you know, you wanna go back to the

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Really old school stuff, um, GameTap

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Does actually have a lot of Atari 2600 in their

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Library, I was actually playing, believe it or not

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
A couple weeks ago, I was playing Sword Quest

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Cool, well, another thing too

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Valve

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
The Steam Clan, you know, if you're

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
They don't have a lot of old

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
School stuff, but they have the old PC

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Stuff that we played

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Some of it, some of the old LucasArt stuff

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Oh, yeah, I'll give you that, like, I just downloaded

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Loom for five bucks, I'll give you that

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I still wanna go buy

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
The TurboGrafx version that's 35

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
At a local store, but, hey

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
But, um

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
You know, and if you want a

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
List of actual games

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Um

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Go ahead and, go ahead and

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Sample the different systems, see what you think

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
It would help to know what kind of games you're into

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Like, are you liking the old school RPGs?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Are you liking the very simple things

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
On the Atari, cause you have the older

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
RPGs, you're gonna wanna go with the SNES

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
These arcade games were very much

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
All about repetition

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Look at some of the greatest video games of all time

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
They came out of the 80s, Pac-Man

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
That board never frickin' changed

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
The whole time

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Until it degraded

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Donkey Kong, basically a loop of the same

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
What, three screens, right?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Three with the, um, the Pie Factory

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
The Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Yeah, play the one with the Pie Factory

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
You're not really playing Donkey Kong

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Play the Kill Screen

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Yeah

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Beat What's-His-Face, Billy What's-His-Face

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Yeah

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
You know what, that's what I'd like to see

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Our young 13 year old listener accomplish

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Make it a life goal to

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Beat some of these scores on these 80s games

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
But if you're into repetition games, go for the

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Old games from the Atari 2600

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I know repetition often sounds like a bad thing

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
But it's not, I mean, Bejeweled is kind of

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
A repetitive game, you know, you realize

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
A game like Bejeweled could've been made on the Atari

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
2600, there's no reason that

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Game could not have been made on the Atari 2600

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Um, seriously, it wouldn't be as pretty, but hey

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
No, it wouldn't be as nice looking, it probably wouldn't have

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Caught on back then, but

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
That's totally a game that I could've seen back in the day

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Okay

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Um,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Hi all, as per usual, I thought

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That I'd write in with a few topics

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
First off, I'd like to get some opinions

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
On an ongoing debate that I've been having

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
With a neighbor. You see, my neighbor

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Is a rabid, no, not in the literal sense

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
If not fanatical Beatles fan

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I don't know anyone like that, do I?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Tease, tease, tease

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I mean, it's to the point that I'm

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Surprised he hasn't already built an

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Altar enshrined to them and started a Beatles

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Cult. The debate specifically

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Centers around whether or not the Beatles

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Right band game should be made or not

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
My neighbor's attitude or position, if you

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Will, is that it shouldn't be made at all

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
To do so would essentially

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Be sacrilege. He believes that the band

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Is something special and not a game

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And he further continually states

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That you had to be there

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I, I

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I assume this is an older neighbor

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Then, um, I continually remind

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Him that the Beatles are a band, not the

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
The game gets made

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Lies with the band, the copyright

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Owners of their music and

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
EA, and really, he has

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
A very rare say. All he can do is decide

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Whether or not to buy the game. I tell him that

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Even though the band may enjoy

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Uh, enjoy playing music

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Ultimately, they, as well as

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Just about any band out there, have three goals

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Become famous, become rich, and get laid

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I don't think so

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
You need to remember this, too, is that

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
And this is something to tell your neighbor, is that

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
At E3, let's not forget

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Paul McCartney

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Ringo Starr

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Yoko Ono

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
To Harrison's wife, sorry, I forget her name

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
They all came out on stage

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
In support of this game

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Yeah, so

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
The end, sorry

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Yeah, tell your neighbor that

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Um, I ask him that if he were in the Beatles

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Would he have turned down buttloads of money

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
That EA was shelling out to make the game

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Every time he tries to say he would have

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I outright call on the bullshit answer

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Well, you know

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
There are people who

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Um

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Who actually

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Are really talented

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Musicians who are

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
In bands for the purpose

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Of enjoying their music

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
That they play

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
These are, now maybe they don't all become

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Famous, maybe they have a small

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Following, but the first reason

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
That I think anyone

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
If anyone has any integrity

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And wants to get into music

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Is because they love it

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
You know

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Can I read these real quick?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Marissa Cungusto has a great comment

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
With their image or message

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
But if it creates new fans, cool

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
And yeah, especially when we talk about generation

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
And this whole thing, you know

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Certainly the 13 year old who emailed us before

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Wasn't around when the Beatles

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Were big, but you know

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I wasn't around when the Beatles were big

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
But I can appreciate their music through things like this

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
But I like this too

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Geekboy2424 says

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Yoko the neighbor will go crazy

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Good point, leave Yoko out of that story

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Don't say Yoko came out on stage

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
At any rate though

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
I don't think that

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I think it's a generalization to say

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
That people

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Get in a band to be famous

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Rich and get laid

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Seriously, I think that

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
The first thing

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
And this is honestly

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Because I've done things

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
With groups before, like I was in a jazz band

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
And I played in a jazz band

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
We didn't get paid for shit

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I mean, they maybe gave us some gas money

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
But we did it because it was something that we loved to do

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
That you know

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
You like getting the crowd into it

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Knowing that you're sort of evoking

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
That emotional response

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
And you know, the people that you're performing for

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I think that's a big thing

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
It's a massive adrenaline rush

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
You know, I think that the

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
The people who I think

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
They've had staying power

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
The people that love what they do

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
In the end, that's honestly what I think

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Yeah, usually these bands

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
That are created to get laid

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Are the ones that break up after one album

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Yeah

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Next area here

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
This may be old news to the three of you

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
But for the sake of other listeners

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I thought I'd throw this out there especially

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
For those who own both the 360

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
As well as the PS3

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Apparently if you have an external

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
32 with miscellaneous media on it

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Music Fodios, whatever

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
The HDD will work

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
On both systems

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
This does not mean you can play system specific

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
DLC or downloadable games

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
On the other system, it just means that you can

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Use the other media on both systems

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I discovered that my external hard drive

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Worked on my 360 last week

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Last weekend, shortly after the last show

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Typically I use them on my PS3

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Finally

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
As per usual

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I hear that as per usual

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
It makes me think of Eddie Izzard

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
We've left you a huge fuck off horse

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
As per usual

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Sorry

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I thought I'd end this email with some of my

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Visual recommendations from the video section

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Of the PSN store

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
This week I have three recommendations

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Season 1 of the original Transformer series from the 80s

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Woohoo!

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And centers around two warring clans

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Okay

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
The rest 4, 5, and 6

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
In limbo

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
With these selections, you can't go wrong

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Zarkon ate them

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
As they are all pretty good

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
It's appreciated, this email is brought to you by Florida

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
The Lemp Wengus of America

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Who's that from?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
MrSpazzinator

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Is that it, or we got more?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Huh

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
The band that was formed mostly to get laid

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Was poisoned

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
And they were very successful

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
That guy's still getting laid

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Seriously

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Good point

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
This comes

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Okay

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I originally intended this message to be

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
A Rob I miss you

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And wow type of thing

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And then I came to the website to see the

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
OLR's template

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I hope on hiatus

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Say I think so

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Are well with everyone

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Guess I'll have to wait and see

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Oh and Rob, I do miss seeing you and well

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Maybe we can play together again sometime

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Your old pally

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Ghoulie

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Nintinctus

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
99

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Oh I see

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
It's 99 cents without vowels

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Yep

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
You know I have my reasons

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
For leaving wow and

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I'll be in Final Fantasy 14 for sure

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
For sure, no doubt

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
At least when it first comes out

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I'm gonna have to play it for the first month

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Just to see

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Whether it goes beyond that I don't know

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Just you know wow I think I just finally

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
You know you play something for so long

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
You just finally like I just don't have it in me anymore

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Rob with two B's

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Our dear friend who always links me to informative

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Articles

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Linked a couple that were on

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Game politics

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
One of them saying that video games

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Are blamed for low vitamin D

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
In children

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Because they're not going out in the sun enough

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I would suppose so

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Think that really it's more

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
For the high blood pressure I would really think that it's

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
More of the

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Not getting out and getting enough exercise

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Sort of thing

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And also low vitamin D

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Exactly you said kids aren't getting enough sunlight

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And I don't watch Oprah but it was on in the waiting room

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Is that

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Most people

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Especially in America

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
And in big cities

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Are very vitamin D deficient

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Because of sunblock

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I actually

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I'm not allowed to use sunblock because I

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Am very vitamin D deficient myself

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I have to use sunblock

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Or I'll have to take supplements or something

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
If I'm lacking it

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
What they say is that everyone should have

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
15 minutes of

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Unfiltered sunlight

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
15 minutes a day

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I can handle that if I wear a hat

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Well you can put it on your face

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I still use my makeup past sunblock

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
In and on my face

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
But I um

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I can be outside for like

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Intense periods of time

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
And even then I only really wear an SPF 15

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Because I'm that

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I was pretty on the dangerous side of low

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
I always wear like an SPF 70

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
But that's only when I'm going to be out all day

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Disneyland

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Or Great America

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
It's just dumb not to do that

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Well the way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Is the synthesis is made with vitamin A

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And UV radiation

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Sunlight

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Not

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I'm kidding

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
What are we talking about I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Like breakfast cereal

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
That's why you eat special K because you get lots of vitamins in it remember

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Drink fortified milk

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Eat your Wheaties

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I would love to drink the vitamin D milk

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
You can't by the way supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
What are the vitamins

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Since I'm going to ask

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Totally tangent that you can get too much of

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Like C you can never get enough vitamin C

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Like you know if you get too much you go

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
You peep it out

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Or is there a limit

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I know zinc has a danger

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Your minerals will have a limit

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Iron, zinc and all that

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
With vitamins actually you can have an overdose

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Of niacin but it takes a long time

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
To build up

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Beta carotene turns your skin orange

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I did that when I was 2 true story

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
When I was 2 years old I had my parents I dated in the ER

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
What was your name on the Partridge Family

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Susan Day

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
The Partridge Family

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Come on get happy

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
She ate so many carrots

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Because that's all she ate

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
That she had a build up of beta carotene in her system

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
But you know the yellow rice

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
That they passed out internationally

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Is actually beta carotene fortified

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Because of deficiencies in those areas

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I'm just saying

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
There's just certain

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
You know me

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
She's not a doctor

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I'm a big nutrition nerd

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
You know even if I don't even follow my own advice

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
All the time I still know it

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Because I worked at GNC like freaking forever

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
So I had to be able to warn people

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
You know because I'm not one of those idiots

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Who just says oh you can take it you're fine

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Have some ephedra with your hypertension

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
No you won't have a heart attack

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Anyway

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
So to go ahead and back to the rest of the email

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Two back to back articles on game politics

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Link two different studies blaming

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
The health of defects of children on video games

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
We all know how ridiculous that is

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
To put it in perspective

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
To a non-game player

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
The claims are also stating

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
These two things are also caused by video games

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
One playing video games reduces

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Incidence of skin cancer

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
That's back to the sun

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Two playing video games reduces

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Well duh

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
It sounds even worse

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
When you talk about the benefits

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Of video games benefits in quotes

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It points out that the events

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Playing video games and ailments

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Very independently of each other

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Silly pseudo-scientists

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
It's just a bunch of ridiculousness

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Also

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Playing video games gives you

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
A rash

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Kidding. Itchy

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Last email

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Hey O.L.R. Crew

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Hey

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Hey

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
A.C.H.P here

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I got a joke for you

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Was it Kelly? Hey

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
No what do gay horses eat?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Hey

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
We are the Supreme Court

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Alright read the damn email

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I'll put the mic down I promise

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Okay

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
See you heard it. That was Rob putting down the mic

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
A.C.H.P here

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
First of all I'm glad that

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Where's the duct tape? Let's just tape his hands together

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
First of all I'm glad that my last email

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Was a gold star

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Now I doubt this one

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Will earn similar acclaim

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
But I want to relate to you all briefly

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
A synopsis of the way

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Way off broadway DDR musical I came across

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
On the internet. What?

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And hopefully it will distribute you all as much as it did me

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Well it got a let from me

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Stop me if you've heard this one

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Long story short there's a guy named

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Moonbeam Funk which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Who carries around

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
A fetus in a jar on his belt

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And starts a dance revolution in the city

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Where dancing is prohibited

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Wasn't that Footloose?

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Anyway

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
He is joined by a small child named

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Small Child

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
And Small Child's

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Prostitute Sister Trampoline Sally

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Moonbeam is about to

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Unleash a dance move called

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
The Flaming Rooster

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
But it is stopped by a policeman who

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Wears kilts

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
The revolution disbands Moonbeam Funk

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Leaves and comes back later to have

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Sex with Trampoline Sally after performing

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
The Flaming Rooster

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Kills her during sex and ends up in a

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Catastrophic level 9 dance off

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
See what they did there?

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Ordered by a judge where he faces off against

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Jacquece who loved Trampoline Sally

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
That had his legs broken by the police

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
However Trampoline Sally's ghost gives

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Jacquece dancer juice

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And he wins despite having broken legs

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Okay I can't take it

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
I picked the mic up

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Moonbeam Funk returns to his home

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Planet using gravity shoes

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
You can't make this stuff up

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
This is somewhere between

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Camp that they know as

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Camp and the most pretentious

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Goddamn modern art bullshit

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I've ever heard of in my life

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Remember they made a DDR movie

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
One time in Japan

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Whatever, stop trying to make a movie

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Out of DDR, they are all stupid

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
No it wasn't

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
There's more

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I remember that, sorry I just remembered how hilarious

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
That movie was

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Now while this may still seem

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Still sound like the best musical ever

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Bullshit

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
The one thing

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
It could do to ruin itself

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
More than it already had it did

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
They didn't use Tack

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
They didn't use B4U

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
They didn't use Oh just name of the money artists

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
They didn't use them

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
No they used DDR, Disney's rave music

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Yes, Zippity Doo Da and Chim Chim Cheree

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
And Night of Fire

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
I left out a lot of things but you can check out the article

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
At vjarmy.com

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I'll go ahead and read it

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I'm actually going to put it in the chatroom

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
But it's vjarmy.com

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Slash archive slash 2008

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Slash 12 slash bucket of

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Tears dot PHP

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
And that's all

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Separated by an underscore

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
For details

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
The best word I can think of to describe this play

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Sounds like is gay-tarded

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
I mean that's really what it sounds like

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Like you know you don't want to say that's gay

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Because that's offensive, you don't want to say that's retarded

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Because that's actually really offensive too

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
So I'm going to make up a new word

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So when it's a new word it wouldn't be offensive to either group

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I still like my word, but-tard

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
But-tard?

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I've been using that for years

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
So this play sounds completely gay-tarded

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Is what it sounds like

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I can't fathom

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Paying money

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
New York City theater can sometimes be expensive

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Like how much money do they want for this?

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
I don't know

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Wow, I mean anybody can do theater

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
That's pretty nasty

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Hopefully this email isn't too long

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
To make it to the show

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Because I think a lot of old fans of DDR

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Will get a laugh

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Or at least a facepalm out of this

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
I got both

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Long live DDR EZHP

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
That's for $20 says Rama

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
No thank you

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
That's $20 I could spend on like

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Cocaine or something

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
You know, like

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And I could probably see the same things

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
We did get a couple more emails

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Don't do drugs kids

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
We also did get a couple more emails

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
But one's for Loki and one of them we just got

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
So I'll read it next week

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Winners don't use drugs folks

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Unless you're on steroids

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
And are on the Chinese swim team

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
If you would like to send us an email

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
And the folks in chat are pointing out

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
It's way off Broadway

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
As in way way way off Broadway

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Like it's in Staten Island

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
That's how far off Broadway it is

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I don't know if that's true or not

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
A couple more stories for you guys

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
And then your calls on the skype line

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
At 877-GAME-OLR

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Loki

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
That's gonna actually

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Build upon

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Some new modes here

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Wrecking Crew mode

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Which features different challenges

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Including

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I guess different combinations of

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Weapons

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Backpack settings

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
And sub modes

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Basically you just destroy as much crap as possible

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
And then you get put on leaderboards and whatnot

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
They've added some more levels

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
For that

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I guess the 4 pre-order bonus levels

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
That everybody got

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
That are pre-ordered in game

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Now are unlocked for everybody

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Including 10 more levels as well

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And they've added

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Weapon and backpack disabling in multiplayer

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
If you feel like doing that

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
XP multiplayer for matchmaking

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Playlists

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Double XP playlists are now possible

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Or deposits

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
On the mini-map

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
And support for upcoming

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Download content as well

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
And then other fixes

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
They've done

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Just some other glitches

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
That they were running into

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Drops in multiplayer

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Certain ties not being recorded

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
In leaderboards and whatnot

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So overall

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
A pretty nice update

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
But

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I still haven't played this game yet

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
And that makes me really sad

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Is this a game that's very popular?

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Are there a lot of people playing this?

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
This isn't usually the type of game that's up my alley

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
It's kind of popular

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
It's like Saints Row set on Mars

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
But you can blow up everything

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Sounds good to me

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
I always like blowing things up

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Saints Row set on Mars

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
That's a really good way of describing it

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Well I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But it's the same developer

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And it's that open world kind of feel to it

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I think it's a little bit more linear

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
This game

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
But it looks fun

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Interesting

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
And of course when I hear Wrecking Crew mode

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Remember that?

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
It was crap

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Woot explosion says Missy in chat

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Absolutely

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Alright let's go on to one more story here tonight

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.000
And then we're going to open up our skypelines at 877-GAME-OLR

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And this story has to do with porn

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
That's right

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
They are going to be bringing on demand

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Blu-ray quality

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
HD adult movies to the Playstation 3

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Woohoo

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Console wars over

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
That's right

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Didn't I say that

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
The system that gets porn first would win?

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
No that was HD DVD

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
And Blu-ray wasn't it?

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I don't remember

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
The problem with that is they adopted both

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Anyway

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
You do have to have a broadband connection

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
An HDMI cable of course if you want the high def

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And of course a Playstation 3

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
You will download the movies for a fee

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
You go onto this dmm.tv Blu-ray website

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
And then you can search for titles by

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Actress, keyword, what have you

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
So if you've ever wanted to see

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
There you go, you can watch that on

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Playstation 3 in full

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
High definition, congratulations

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Now what's kind of interesting about that

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
It's kind of bypassed Sony somehow

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
It sounds like you're logging into their website

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And downloading them to your PS3 or something

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Isn't that what it sounds like to you?

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
This can't be sponsored by Sony

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
This must be using the web browser

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
And some type of backdoor or something

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Pun intended

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
It might be downloading

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Video files to your PS3 or something like that

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Or downloading them to your PC

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
So you can watch them on your PS3

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
I don't know

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Who knows

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Vidpower calls this 1080p-ness

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Ba-dum-bum

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
God I love the listeners

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
At least all the ones I've ever seen

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Of course I always saw the funny ones

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Like Final Fuck X and all that

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Where they did blur it out

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Yeah they're all blurred out

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Unless it's softcore

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
It's just all the Vash P and stuff gets blurred out

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
SSJ100Matt says

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000
All we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
We got a bunch of comedians

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Tonight

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Oh god this is awful I'm reading that article by the way

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
D5T is calling

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Dot fuck apparently

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Instead of dot hack there's a

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Porn called dot fuck

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
That's funny

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Oh my gosh

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
You know what?

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Whatever

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Something I think

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I don't know do I want to go on a tangent?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Why not? We have plenty of time

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
We're going to be opening up the skype line soon anyway

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Something to remember

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Everybody has sex

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
That's how we get here

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Granted I realize that some people define themselves

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
As asexual

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Which means you don't really

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Care for sex

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
But I'm still assuming that at one point or another

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
You've tried it

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Everybody has sex

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
So what's the big deal at some point

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
I mean if you're the 13 year old listening

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
You should not be having sex yet

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
According to Oprah

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
You probably already are

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
You know what?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I don't have

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
That same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
For better health

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I don't have a problem admitting

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I was 20 so you know

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
By Oprah I would be a late bloomer

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
And I know there's people that wait even longer than that

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I was 30, 35, 40

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
That's fine

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
But I'm saying at some point

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
This is not a spiel about virginity

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
My spiel is about everybody

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Has sex

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Or thinks about having sex

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
So why is porn

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Such a big taboo, big deal thing

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I mean you know

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
They should just get over it and put porn there

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
We're in a country that was founded by Puritans

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Because they have 100 masturbators

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
In that film

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
That's just way too much

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Masturbating

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
And besides

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
You own a PS3

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
If you're interested in this

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Therefore you have access to the internet

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Therefore you have access to U-Porn

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
And many other porn alternatives

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
That are free

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Why would you pay for porn

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
When you can get it for free

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Do you have a day on chat that says

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I was 21

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
My cousin is almost 25

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
And she's still a virgin

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Nothing wrong with that, but she probably thinks about it

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I mean she probably still thinks

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
That doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
In fact

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
The other day we were

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
For the hell of it, just for fun

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Shits and giggles I guess

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
We decided to watch the triple x parody of

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Friends

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
And I can tell you it was awful

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
What was it called, fucks?

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
No, frenzy triple x parody

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
It's ridiculous, none of the characters look like

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
The other characters from the show

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And they're really exaggerated

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
As far as how they act

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It's just so ridiculous, but it was funny

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Did somebody at some point

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Look at one of the girls and go

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
How you doin?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
No, unfortunately no they didn't

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
But the woman's name was Monika instead of Monica

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Cause of course they have to do that

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I love porn parodies so much

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
They're so funny

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I still like the Ali McFeel one

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I liked Beaver and Buttface

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I haven't seen that one

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
They have Office

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Seriously, all the TV shows now

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Are parodies, Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
The best line I've ever heard

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
In a porno was in Beaver and Buttface

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Laughing

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
That's awful

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Laughing

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And on that note, let's open up the phone lines

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
1877-GAME-OLR

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Our username on skype

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
There we go, we're off the Do Not Disturb mode now

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Laughing

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
1877-GAME-OLR

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Our username on skype

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
We will take calls here tonight

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
And look, we're already ringing

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
This is Ronman, I wanna know

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
When did this become Porn Lounge Radio?

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
You know what, it's been a few weeks

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
We have a lot of pent up energy

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
What can we say, what's on your mind tonight?

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Yeah, I can see that

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Before I start

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Loki, just because the porn is free

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Doesn't mean it's that good

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Just so you know

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
You're just not looking hard enough

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I look more to my fair share

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Okay, I look more than anybody else

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
In the chat room, okay?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Laughing

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
But um, the reason why I called

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Is to make a comment about the whole

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Best Buy price matching

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Thingamabobber here

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Yeah, pretty

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
It pretty much did still make their money

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
How so?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Alright, I used to work for Best Buy

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
And the discounts at the time were great

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
5% above retail core

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
They paid for it

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I bought a cable for my PS2

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
That retailed for $9.99

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I paid $1.72 for it

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Interesting

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I mean

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Even if they take a $5 loss off the games

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
They're still going to make the money back

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Off of the accessories on the games

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Accessories for the consoles

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Accessories for home theater

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
The electronics, everything

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
That's absolutely not true

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I mean, yes, it's true in the long run

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
They're going to cost average that stuff

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Across all the different lines

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
That they carry

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
That's why they can take a loss on games

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
And still be fine because they mark up everything else

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
And it just averages out

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
But if you're looking at strictly games

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
I mean, okay, let's say

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
The average Xbox 360 game

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Is $48

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Their cost

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
And they may get it cheaper

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
It's roughly the high 40's though

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Is what they're paying for

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
And yes, there is a markup there

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
And yeah, if they drop it down $5

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
They're not really losing a lot of money

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
So, I mean, they could do it

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
And it's definitely possible

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
That the margin on accessories is about 20%

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
On average, if not more than that

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
But, um

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess there is

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
They won't really be losing

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Out a lot

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
But it could get ridiculous

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Especially if they're dropping the prices

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Of used games at GameStop or whatever

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
And they continually do this

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I don't know, I don't see this program being very successful

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I mean, it's going to be successful

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
But not their benefit, I guess

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Well, it depends

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I mean, if they do this

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
They probably won't be having to do their

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Fire sales that they have on games

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Like every 8 or 9 months, give or take

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Hmm

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
I guess we'll see

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Do you really think, though

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
They're going to expand it past this Utah store

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Honestly

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
I don't think so

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
And if they do

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
It probably won't hit New York City

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Case in point, like back in March

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
The blowout sale on anime

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
50% off

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
To see if I can find it

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
None of the stores in the five boroughs

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Were participating

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
That's right, something we sometimes forget

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
That they don't necessarily have to participate

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Mmhmm

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Very interesting

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Alright, well any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Rama

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Um

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
The Screensavers rocked

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
The Off-Broadway DDR musical

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Was way, way off-Broadway

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
It was around the corner from where you saw the Rocky Horror

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Picture show when you came to New York that time

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
And according to Japanese porn laws

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
They're not allowed to show that type of stuff

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
But you can still find uncensored

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Stuff

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Interesting, huh? Yep

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Alright, well thank you very much for the call, Rama

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
No problem, take care fellas

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Love you, Jamie

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Bye-bye

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
1877 game OLR

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Who's this?

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Hello?

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Uh, Deathwishing

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Hi, Deathwishing, we can hear the speakers a little bit

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Matt, I want to turn them down, what's on your mind?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Yeah, sorry

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
It's okay, we'll forgive you this once, what's up?

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Well, thanks for making me not be able to sleep tonight

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
With all the porn talk

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
That's what we do here

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Scarring listeners for life

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Hey, look, we've got like three weeks to make up for it

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I don't know, but did you guys hear about

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
How they're raising prices on like

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
And like Britain and stuff, from what I heard

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
I haven't heard about this

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I heard about it

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Are they doing it here also? Because I think they did

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
No, it's still 60 bucks

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Because I felt like with the

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I pre-ordered normally collector's editions

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Like 70 bucks and this time it was like 80

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Well, not all collector's editions

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Are 70 dollars either

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Yeah, because I saw like they're raising the price

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Way up and it's just like

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I don't know, kind of not right

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
People care about this, but no one gave a crap about

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
The Wii version of Guitar Hero

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Being 10 dollars more here

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like 40 or 50 dollars

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
More than the regular?

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
The legendary one, the one that came with the cat suit

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Well yeah, but this is all

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Look at the collector's editions

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
For Modern Warfare, I mean that's like 200 bucks

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Yeah, this is true

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
And also

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
I also

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I picked up

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
ChromeHounds

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Ah yes

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
The old school met game that dates back to

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
When the 360 first came out

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
And Loki was a big fan of this game

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Everyone should pick it up

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
What do you like about ChromeHounds?

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
It's like

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I've been seeing like

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
There's these ingenious designs people make

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Like of mechs

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Like so far

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I made one where now I can't like be hit

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Like directly

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Kind of cheap I guess

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Remember when we always talked about how we were gonna have this big blowout

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
ChromeHounds tournament between us and the Bobby Black Wolf show

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
And we were never able to do it

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Because we couldn't get enough people

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Here we are 3 years later, we could have recruited Deathwishing

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
For our team and now just

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
A distant memory

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Before I

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
It's not crap, shut up

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I wanted to get it because it was like

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Armored Core

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
The problem with the game was

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
It was too slow

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Armored Core is very quick

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
And it's a mech fighting game very similar to

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
ChromeHounds, but it's a lot faster

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
It's a lot more faster paced

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
ChromeHounds is just slow

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Slow, slow

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
What type of person did you play?

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I played a four legged mech

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
That's why

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Four legs are slow

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Well I wanted a lot of weapons on there

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
You could have used chicken legs

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
The most important thing to Loki

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Is firepower

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Clearly, I mean I've never even watched him play

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
ChromeHounds, but I could just tell

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Not necessarily

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
It was trying to be more all around

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
That's what I was trying to do

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
You can't be all around, you gotta specialize either

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Close up or far away

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
That's the strategy before you build

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Well, Deathwishing

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Please?

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
No, we're broke, I don't even own it myself

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
No, Xbox

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
These days

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
But no online play

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
You kids and your online play

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Redemption codes for the game

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
We will send you the first one we get

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
How's that sound?

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
There you go, have a good one Deathwishing

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Bye bye

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Capcom, if you're listening

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
You can send those to

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Rob Roberts

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Hey, I haven't even reduced those into the calm line

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Legend of Zaku

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Hey, Legend of Zaku

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Have you checked out the DDR play yet?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Which one?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
The one that aired last winter?

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
No, the one with...

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
What the hell is this?

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
That sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
The one with Moonbeam Punk

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Yeah, that's the one I was referring to

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Because that one was actually late last year

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Did you see it?

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Unfortunately, no

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
So

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
I mean, it was shocking

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
To say the least, the fact that it sold out

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
You know, for the first few days

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
It was really hard to get

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Even will call for that matter

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Was Tom Cruise in it or something?

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Like, why did so many people want to see this?

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
I don't understand

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I guess it's because of DDR

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
That's the only thing I could pretty much boil down

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
From the fact that it's DDR

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Or people thought it was DDR

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
In a musical

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Which is far-fetched

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
To say the least

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Anyways

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Where was I about to get to?

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
I think I mentioned this earlier

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
But yeah

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
From the looks of it

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
It looks like the

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Activation is in a pissing match

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Between Konami and seeing

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Who can whore out the franchise

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Who can whore out their top franchises

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
The farthest

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Well, many people

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I mean, I'm referring to the fact that

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
There's a lot of hostility towards the fact that

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
They're just doing it

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
For the sake of just milking

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
The franchise even further

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
That's what I've gotten

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
In terms of all the comments that I've read

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
So far regarding this story

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Yeah, but you know

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
It's not like there's a Guitar Hero

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Johnny Cash game coming out

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
And I mean, ever since the third one

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
You would have just random

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Band characters show up in the game

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
And I've got to say, you know

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
It doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
I think you hit it on the nail right there

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
After the third one

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
The series pretty much went downhill

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Because by then

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Rock Band came out

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And the rest was history

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
The fact that you could add as many

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Guest appearances

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Many guest stars

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Famous people in that game

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
And make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Loki asked a good question

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Um, I heard

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
I heard of that game

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Is that the one coming out for the DS?

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
No, it's exactly Guitar Hero

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Now it's with more family friendly songs

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
In other words, it's just another excuse to put out

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Another fucking Guitar Hero game

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
There you go, there you go, Loki, see

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Exactly, that's the milking

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Of the franchise

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero main game

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
When you have

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
When you basically have all your clothes

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Strewing around in Hot Topic

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
When you're basically on cereal boxes

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
When it has nothing, you know

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
When you have those little minigames

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
That you find right there

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
You know, inside the cereal boxes

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Right there

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
The way Konami has hoarded out with the toys

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
In both Subway, Burger King

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And to an extent

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
No, milking the franchise is not about merchandising

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Milking the franchise is about having

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Five releases for the damn series in one year

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
That is milking

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
No, I'm sorry, six releases

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
I can see what Zaku is saying though

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
That have the Guitar Hero name on it

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Such as little portable things

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
You see in Hot Topic or whatever

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Well yeah, that sucks too

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
It gets to the point of prevalence

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Where it's just ad nauseam

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Rock band keeps the whole thing

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Consistent on the fact that

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
You hear a diverse set of music

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
In rock band, you don't just hear like

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Nothing but, you don't hear

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
All number one hits

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
All you hear is just like some schmuck band

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
From nowhere getting into rock band

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Versus a lot of

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
A lot of A listers on Guitar Hero

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Mostly A listers

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
You know, it's just, Zaku

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
It's not that I disagree with you

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
That Activision is milking the shit out of their franchise

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I just

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
In the game, that's actually the first thing in a long

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Where I'm like, that's kinda cool

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I'm the devil's advocate, alright

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Johnny Cash's inclusion into Guitar Hero 5

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Would pretty much introduce

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Him to a new generation

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Of fans, that's one way

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
That's one argument

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
That could be made to defend

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
The milking of the franchise

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
But then again, with the Beatles

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
At least it has its own game

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
And it's done within the

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
It's done in a way that actually

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Brings out the

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Culture and the history of the

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Beatles

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
And it actually does a good

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Chronology of the whole

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Band's history

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Through their music

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
So you don't

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Like this because you don't

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Think it's respectful enough

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
They just kinda threw him in there

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Yeah, that's pretty much

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
The case, they just threw him in there to make more

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Cash, no pun intended

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Now I'm following you

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
A little better, I get it

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
You think the milking is coming from the fact

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
That you're just kinda like, let's just

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Reskin, let's just slap

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
A face of a popular rock star

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
On this and put it in our game

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
When somebody like Johnny Cash

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Deserves epic

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Style treatment

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
With Guitar Hero

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Metallica

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
They did it differently

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
It came out to be a good game

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Not only had Metallica's music

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
But it had a whole bunch of other

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Metal bands that were probably

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Personally picked by the band

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
For all we know

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
It's almost the same as

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Beatles Rock Band

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
It wouldn't

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Do any

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Chronology to the band

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
It put it to a level where it's

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Respectful, it has its own game

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
It has the

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Entire catalog right there of Metallica's

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Music, that would be the only

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Exception to the

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
To Activision's milking of the franchise

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
I guess it'll get worse

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Once Van Halen gets their own game

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Obviously with the whole Aerosmith thing

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
It's gonna be very interesting to see

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
What develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
2010, but Zaku, I understand

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
I'll let you go

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Have a great one, okay Zaku?

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Alright, later dude

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
1877 Game OLR, we can probably squeeze in one more phone call

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Oransons Radio is our username on

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Skype, we'll go ahead and take one more

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Call if you want to give us a call

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Do we have any last minute stories tonight?

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I think I forgot to put it on the show roll

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
We have a call coming in

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Hi, you're on Oransons Radio, who's this?

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Hi, this is Fazinator

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Hi Fazinator, what's on your mind tonight?

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Two things

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Unfortunately that email

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
That I sent you

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Was a couple of weeks old

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
And I just wanted to update a couple of things

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Yeah, first and foremost

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
It's probably

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
More directed to Loki

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
But I just wanted to

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Send my condolences

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
To you and your wife over what happened

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Thank you

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Yeah, believe it or not

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
I'm not gonna go into too many

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Details

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Because they're running late right now

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
But I definitely know exactly

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Where you're coming from

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
So I can't totally relate

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
So

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Now

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
As for the second topic

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
I'm kind of

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Surprised you didn't mention it already

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
But

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
I don't know if you guys are into

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Sports games at all

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Or at least the arcade style ones

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
But

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Recently there was an announcement

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
That EA's

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Could be making

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
I'm sorry, did you start

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Something?

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Did we lose him?

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Oh, I'm still

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Here

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Echoing

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Oh, sorry, I'm not following you

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
So what type of games were you asking

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
If we were into? Sports

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Sports games?

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Yeah, recently

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
We announced that they're gonna be making

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
A

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Madden arcade

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Which is

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Could be kind of like

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
A Maddenized

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Version of 3 on 3

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
NHL arcade which came out

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Earlier in the year

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
So, you know, if you like

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Arcade style games

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
You know, sports games

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
They may be up really

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
If not, then

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
But

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Let me explain

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
My kind of thing with sports games

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
I've kind of been wanting to try and define

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
This on the show for a long time because

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
The interesting thing is that

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
We're a show that we're not really big on sports games

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
We don't really talk a lot about them and that's kind of our audience

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
But I do enjoy

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Casual sports

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Games, if that makes sense

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
I like casual sports games

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
I don't mind them at all

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
I kind of

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Desire those old school sports games

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
The Blades of Steel

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
The ones today, I have a really hard time

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Just kind of pick up and running with

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Like, you know, and hey

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
For the hardcore sports fan

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Cool, you know, more for you

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
They don't play role playing games that I play, probably

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
They play their sports games and that's cool

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
You know, there's a lot for you

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
But like, I actually think

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Probably one good way to define the type of sports game

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
That I can get into is an arcade

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Type of game, insert, quarter, play game

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
You know, it's just very, very easy

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Like NBA Jam, that was one of my

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
Like, favorite video games like years ago

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
That I was ever into a sports game at some point

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
But some of them, I can get into

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
But we, yeah, we haven't had

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
A lot in a long, long time

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
So EA's trying to

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Bring out more casual sports gaming, is what you're saying?

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Yeah, basically

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Yeah, it's

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Well, I

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
I don't know if you've ever

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Tried to release a demo on

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Either the 360 or

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
The PlayStation 3

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
But last year they, you know, earlier this year

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
They came out with

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
An arcade style

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Hockey game

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Basically, you think NBA Jam

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
To hockey

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Have you ever played that? Do you know the name of it?

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
It's called

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
NHL, or, you know, 3-on-3

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
NHL Arcade

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
It's basically NBA Jam with hockey

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
I will have to check that out

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
I don't think I ever played it

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kinda like

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Ah, sports game pass, sports game pass

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
I check it out, I mean, Wii Sports

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
And Wii Sports Resort, aren't these kind of

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Casual sports games in a way, too?

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Video game of the past

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
10-15 years

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Oh yeah, yeah

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
I can't say I really know much

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
About the Wii games

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Because I really haven't been following them

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
I don't even

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Know what it's like

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Most of my knowledge

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
About video games are about dollar

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Two systems

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
One less

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Touch

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Before I do, you know, hang up

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Yeah

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I know if it's something

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
The 3 of you would be interested in

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
But there's a free download

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
On the video section

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Of the PlayStation

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Network store

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
It's a

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
1980s enemy

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Pilot

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Called Zebra Rider

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
I can do

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Free?

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
I don't know if that's going to cut you off

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Oh no, I can do free

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
I always like free things

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
They probably put this up on there to get people to

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Check it out because they're probably going to sell the series

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Yeah, probably

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
I haven't seen it yet

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
But I did download it

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
So I can't really give an opinion

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
All right, well

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Maybe in a future week

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
But for now we're going to let you go

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Thank you so much for your phone call

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
And we're going to wrap up

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Later, buddy

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Casual sports gamer

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
That would be me

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
I can't do these harder to get into

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
With the playbooks and all that stuff

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
The most playbook I could get into was

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Tecmo Bowl

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Run, run 2, pass, and pass 2

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
That's as playbook as I get

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
All right, anyhow

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Let's get any last minute stories, Loki

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Yes, this is interesting

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Apparently Konami is relaunching

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
The Drummania and Guitar Freak series

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
With Guitar Freak's Drummania

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
XG

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
It's going to be in HD

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
And it's also adding more fret buttons

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
To the guitar controller

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Now with five fret buttons with adding

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Yellow and purple

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
They're also going to have hold notes

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Or longer notes just like you'd see in

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Other rhythm music games

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
And also

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
The open

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Open strums are actually going to be

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Part of the normal guitar charts

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
And vibration is added when you're wailing

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Drummania

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
They're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
And a second bass pedal

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
As well

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Apparently the new machines

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Are going on testing very soon

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Some of the new songs include

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Hyperjetland

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Kaiser Phoenix

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Blue Planet and Piranha

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
All those of course

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Looks like in-house artists

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
And some of the old songs

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Returning Vampire Killer

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Over the Limit

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Highway Star

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
And some others

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Let's see here

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
They're going to have a new interface

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Also beginner mode

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
And

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
I guess

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
There's also

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Gameplay being shown in the background

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
I guess with your note link

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Over the top

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
The machine looks really cool

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
I don't know, but a little too late

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
I think

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
That rumor that the

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Xbox Pro system is going away has a little bit

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
More to back

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
It up, apparently the new

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Arcade packaging that's making

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
It's way out to stores right now

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Seems to be missing the Pro system on

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
There, so it's just the Pro and the

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Arcade and the

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Elite system

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
The rumor is that they're going to be dropping

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
The price of the Elite system to match

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
The Pro system and just get rid of

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
The Pro altogether

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Hmm, probably going to happen soon

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
If it's already on the packaging

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Apparently some very

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
I don't know

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
Special people have decided

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
To modify a version

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Of Pong that will

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Kind of inject a little bit of

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Fetish stuff in there

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Including a controller that's made

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Out of a boot that you would slide your hands

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Up and down, and apparently

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
If you miss

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
The ball going across the screen

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
You get whipped

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
And that's

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
Thanks to some people in Britain there

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Um

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Let's see

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Ben Heck, the

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Creator of such wonderful

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Portable systems, has a new project

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Now he is blogging about

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Including creating his very own

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Custom pinball machine

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Which he for some reason decided to

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Choose Bill Paxton as the

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Theme of the pinball machine

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
But it is kind of neat if you want to

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Check it out on how you can

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Make your own very

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
Unique pinball machine

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
From scratch, so that's kind of neat

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
That is kind of cool

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
There's a game on Commodore 64

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
I used to play back in the day that I loved

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Pinball construction set by ECA

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Which back in the day was

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
What EA turned into

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
You know what I mean?

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Modern Warfare

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
They have their really ridiculous

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Prestige collector's edition

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Well, not to be outdone

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
But Codemasters

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
They're releasing Operation

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Flashpoint Dragon Rising

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
In the UK

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
With a really ridiculous

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Collector's edition as well

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
It will feature a

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Full

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
I guess

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Full size army helmet

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
That's made from metal

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Plus a dog tag

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
And the box is huge

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Apparently the size of a rock band

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Bundle box

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Which makes sense because the helmet is kind of big

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
And then lastly

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Something that kind of pissed people off

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
We were talking about Activision raising prices

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Well apparently

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
And once again this goes to show you

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
That CEOs should never speak

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Ever when it comes to video games

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Apparently CEO Bobby Kotex

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Says that he's

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
He hopes that the price of

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Games will actually go higher

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
It says

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
And Tony, you know if it was left

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
To me, I would raise the prices even further

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Yes, thank you

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Mr. Douchebag

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
And then two last things here

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
Actually, can we back it up a little bit

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
And remind me, we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
We got to do that at some point

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
What was this dude's name?

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Bobby Kotek

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
The FUs of the Week tonight are for you

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
My FU

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Really just goes to the suture in my hand

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
It pretty freaking hurts

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Yeah

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
My FU goes to being sore

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Like I feel like I'm getting so old

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
But my legs are so sore

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Which wasn't really that much

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Logie

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
As I mentioned in part A, most of the nurses that we had

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
While we were in the hospital for a very

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
Traumatic and sad event were very nice

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
However, the last nurse that we had

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Was a total idiot

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
And the reason I say this

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
She apparently had her own

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Stillborn baby

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
At full term

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
And so

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Dying babies were her thing

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
As she puts it

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
So she comes in, basically when they're doing all the pictures

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
And doing the footprints

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
And all the impressions and stuff

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
The nurse beforehand

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
They're treating them, even though the babies are dead

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
They're treating them with respect

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Like actual babies supporting their head

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
And stuff like that

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Well a woman decides she's gonna come in

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
And she says, okay we're gonna start taking pictures

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
Oh this is the fun part

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
I'm sorry, what part of dead babies

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Is fun to you, stupid

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
And then she treats them

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
Like, you know, basically dolls

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
Just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
You know, that their

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Heads should be supported and all that stuff

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
Because they can't feel pain anymore, she says

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
So thank you

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Nurse Douchebag

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
For being totally insensitive

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
And just an absolute

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Horrible human being

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
But you know what though

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
You know, in the end we do laugh

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
About it because she's

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
It just, how do people like this actually exist

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
They're so stupid

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
See, only you and Nelly

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
Can find the humor in something like that, honestly

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Sorry, last minute stories

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
And the last one I have, which you'll probably like

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Mark's obvious saying they are gonna raise

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
The cap of your friends list

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
I actually have a few open

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
Slots right now, I think I'm down to like 98

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
And the reason why I, if somebody

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Hasn't shown up on my friends list

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
In like 30 days or more

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
I just delete them because I knew they cancelled their

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Xbox, unless it's somebody I know

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
In real life, that's pretty much

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
That's what I've been doing too

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
If you wanna add me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
You're not gonna see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
But there's always something

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
There'll be something I'm playing after

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
I'm sick of the games I'm playing now

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
It's not the way it works

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Alright

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
And supporting independent podcasting

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
You guys are awesome, especially

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
Downloading and listening to this entire show

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
After a three week hiatus

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
If you got all the way to the end

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
You rock, thank you so much for listening to us

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
I don't know what else to say

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
We say tell two people you know about the show

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
But honestly, by listening to the whole thing

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
You've already made us feel good

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
And live listeners

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
Where would we be without you guys?

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Thank you so much for showing up

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
And especially the fact that we just said at like noon today

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
That we'd be back tonight, because I just didn't know

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
I didn't want to announce anything premature

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
But the fact that so many people showed up

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
We actually had a really good listener count tonight

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
From all games

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
That some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
But just thank you

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
So much

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
DarkSakari, your final thought

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
My final thought is

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Smells sick

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
I am, I just autographed it

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
Awesome, I'll sign it too

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Loki, your final thought

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
My final thought is

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
I don't know, I've

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Hopefully there will be some new video coming up this week

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Of the Grand Theft Auto plane

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
Good, because those two videos

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
That are up there now, that's all we shot

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
That one day, and now DarkSakari's

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Afraid to do it again, especially if Victoria

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Is the camera woman, because it'll be boob shots

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
So we might have to fire Victoria

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
And get a new camera lady

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
It was really good that she did it

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
No it is, you know

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
You'll just get more, you'll get a different kalanto

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
We'll figure it out, we're going to keep that

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
YouTube channel alive this time

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
My final thought is, I have a TurboGrafx

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
In my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
Steal this, so you may not

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
Be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for this

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Week here on Orange Lounge Radio

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
You know, I pretty much said it all, thanks so much

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
We'll be back here to do it all again

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Next week, so

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Myself, Rob Roberts, she's

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
DarkSakra, he's Loki

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
Thank you guys, we will see you

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Next week

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:54.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
