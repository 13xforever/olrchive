Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio
Here on this lovely Sunday evening, August 9, 2009
We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys
And we're a little broken tonight
I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here
Let me introduce the cast first and I'll tell you what's going on
My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining me as always
Say hello to the one and only Sims-loving DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Yo
And I see you creating a character right now
Actually, you know, I'm redoing an old one because I got some new hairs and clothes and stuff
And I'm going back to one of my older games that I've kind of neglected
I see
Isn't that nice hair?
It's very pretty
There you go
And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki
Hi
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing well, I guess
I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on
So, anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?
I don't know, I guess I could explain everything that happened
I mean, I don't know
Well, I should start because the first week we were gone was kind of my fault
And, you know, it was something that was unanticipated
And by the way, I apologize for my speech
Speech is all screwed up tonight
I have the hiccups really bad
Like, we were just on Bobby's show doing our little tease over to this show and I was fine
And right after we were done, we usually have a couple minutes
Because Bobby always likes to read the chatters at the end of his show and wrap everything up
So I'm taking a little swig of water and, I don't know, like, water went down the wrong pipe or something
Now I have the hiccups, like, terribly
Which is the worst possible thing that can happen to you in radio
And I've got it right now and they're not going away
At least you can go through and kind of, like, you know, see the gaps that you hiccup in and go in and amount
So, excuse me
So anyway, I'm going to try and hopefully get rid of the hiccups
Anyway, we were gone the first week, my fault
Because I was getting sick, like, I was really sick
And most of it was exhaustion
Because I've been really pushing myself between training at work
Some other things I do outside of work besides just the show
And, you know, the show, I pretty much almost collapsed and died Sunday
Not really, but, you know, just collapsed
And was feeling really, really horrible
So I called it off for Sunday and was like, let's all take a night off
But then we announced that we were going to go on hiatus
We're actually back kind of quicker than I think some people thought we'd be back
But I'll let Loki take over
Yeah, so basically last Friday
Yeah, last Friday
Well, actually, let me start
The week before that, the week before Friday
Or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago
So two Fridays ago
Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains
Basically, you know, during labor you get
Or I should say during pregnancy you get false labor pains
They're called Braxton Hicks contractions
Basically kind of going through the whole, you know, contraction cycle
They're not supposed to hurt
They're basically, you know, you feel a tightening and then that's it
And you get them all throughout the entire duration of being in labor
Well, she was getting some that were painful
And now they can be painful, but usually they're not
So anyways, long story short, we went into the hospital that day
To have her checked out
And they looked at her, they did an ultrasound
They did, you know, an exam
You know, and her cervix was closed
And, you know, it was five centimeters long
Which is, you know, long for, you know, the birth canal
But usually it's like three centimeters
So everything was basically looked to be normal
So we went home
You know, she was basically taking it easy
Laying on the couch and stuff like that
Monday she went into her normal doctor
Because she had an appointment
And she actually had her looked over again
And once again everything seemed fine
So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around
And she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff
But she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday
So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again
To have her, you know, have them check her out
Because now she was getting some sort of, like, fluid leaking out of her
And she didn't know what that was
Normally that's not normal
So they took her into labor and delivery
Looked at her, and they did, you know, an exam
And they said, okay, well it doesn't look like anything's wrong
So she finally insisted, listen, you know, give me an internal ultrasound
And I want you to make sure everything's correct
Because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine
So sure enough they give her an internal ultrasound
And they realize that now within the time frame of Friday to Wednesday morning
She's now completely, her cervix is completely effaced
Meaning that it's shortened up
Which is what happens before you go into labor
And she's actually three centimeters dilated now
And the sack of one of the babies is actually hanging out into the birth canal
Which means that any moment her water could break
So Wednesday they call me down to the hospital
So I have to go down there
And basically she let me know what was going on
And we, they tried basically to reverse the process
They gave her drugs to stop contractions
And they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head
To hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into her uterus
And, you know, basically the contractions would, you know, were stopped
And they were going to see if maybe the dilation would go away
Well, 24 hours later they examined her again
It wasn't getting any better
The contractions were already stopped
But she's continuing dilated
So at that point there was no way that they could stop anything
Basically, you know, they were giving us the option of
Well, we can break your water now and induce labor
Or you can go home, wait for your water to break, and then come back in
And, you know, it's basically, okay, when do you want to kill your children
Is basically what they were giving us the option for
So, because, you know, as far as we could tell the, you know, babies were fine
They were moving still
Which makes it the hardest
Because everything was okay
But we had to deliver them now
So they induced labor
Actually, before that, you know, they were, you know, trying to figure out
We were trying to make the decision
So she got up to use the restroom and then her water broke on her own
So it was pretty much, you know, the decision was made for us
And, you know, they induced labor
Which normally, you know, fewer full term
Takes about five hours before, you know, you go into labor
And deliver the baby
Well, because she wasn't full term, it took 15 hours, you know, to do that
So Friday morning at 5 AM
They examined her again
To see, you know, how it's going
Because actually during the night and everything, like around 1 in the morning
She got an epidural because the, you know, contractions were getting stronger and more painful
And then, you know, they checked her again at about 5 in the morning
And, you know, to see if she was dilated enough
And they saw feet hanging out of her
So they were like, well, looks like you're ready to go
So they went ahead, delivered the first baby
It came really quick
And my boy Michael was delivered first
He had died before he was delivered
Basically, probably from all the trauma
You know, his water or his sack had been broken for, you know, 15 hours
And he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process
And, you know, because he's being contracted on
And he was breached, you know, just all that combined together
You know, he died before he got born
And then, luckily right after that
Because, you know, one of the scenarios they gave us was
That, you know, the boy would be born
And then the girl, you know, might not, the sack might not come down and descend
And you might have to go through the whole labor process again
Which we were just at that point, like, let's just get this over with
Luckily, though, right after he was born
Her water basically broke
And then Sarah was born right after that
And, you know, she was born alive
Everything was okay with her
But because it's only 21 weeks, you know, she doesn't have any lungs yet
So, luckily, you know, they're oxygenated really well in the womb
In case, you know, the mother dies or something like that
The babies can survive a little bit
But because she has no lungs, she, you know, only lived for two hours
So, you know, basically, you know, we got to hold them
And, you know, say our goodbyes and stuff like that
And, you know, it was really, really, really tough
You know, very sad
At least our family got to see them and everything before, you know, we sent them away
But, yeah, so that was my week last week
But, you know, it's just unfortunate
They don't know what happened
They don't know why, you know, this happens
They think maybe incompetent cervix, which is a possibility
Usually, though, this might not be the case
Because incompetent cervix is a scenario where your cervix gets smaller during the duration of the pregnancy
It slowly happens
This happened, like, three days
Which, you know, that doesn't happen
So, you know, free term labor
They don't really know what happened
And we probably won't know what happens
I mean, it could be an infection, you know
Who knows
So they sent off the placentas to pathology
So maybe we'll learn something from that
But I doubt it
So, basically, the whole thing was just, you know, very sad
Luckily, we got taken care of really good
Except for one nurse was completely retarded
And I'll get into that later
But, I don't know
It's just, it's sad
And, you know, wish it hadn't happened
But there's not really much you can do
That's why I'm here this week
Because, you know, everything's kind of getting back to normal
And, I don't know, just got to go on
You know
So, yeah
That's basically everything that happened
And we, you know, took care of all the female
Because they are actually considered, you know
20 weeks
Like, if they were born at 20 weeks
Basically, the hospital would dispose of them
They wouldn't, you know, really be named or anything like that
But 21 weeks are considered, like, a live birth
Or, I don't really know what they consider them
But, basically, they get death certificates
And the girl actually gets a birth certificate
Because she was born alive
But, you know, we had them cremated
Sometime this week
I think they're, those we do
But we went and took care of all that
So we get their ashes back
This coming week
Sometime
And, you know, we got, basically
They took pictures and everything
Because, I mean, you don't have anything
To take, you know, to remember them by, basically
So, they take pictures
To do footprints, handprints
Measurements
All that stuff
But, yeah, they were
10 inches long
And under a pound each
14 ounces, I think, was the largest one
But, yeah
So I think the reasons why we weren't here last week
Are then pretty obvious
I mean, Dark Soccer and I just didn't feel right
Kind of doing it in that, you know, type of situation
So, you know, we called it off last week
And we said, Loki, take whatever time you need
We'll come back when we're all ready to come back
And Loki, as he mentioned before
He's ready to kind of just get back to normal, so to speak
And so here we are
And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki
And kind of given, you know, everything
Which might come as a surprise
To folks who are ready to tune into a video game show
But I admire that you can
Be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now
That you can talk about it very professionally, you know
I don't know, it's still kind of upsetting
I mean, I'm a little upset right now
But it's just like
It's not as bad as the first day
Oh my god
It was just, it was tiring
The whole process was tiring
You know, just got no sleep for like two days
And just
The emotional rollercoaster
I mean, the first day we're like
Okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know
And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy
We're like, okay, well that sucks
But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know
And then
No, there's nothing we can do
And then one of the nurses comes in
Hey, well maybe they can save, you know, one of the babies
And, you know, deliver one
And, you know, the other one will be saved
You know, just keep the other one in or whatever
And you can't do that
Because, I mean, let's say
For example, you know, the what ifs
Basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in
Even for like three weeks
Which would make it a viable pregnancy
Even though it's a viable pregnancy
Does not mean that they're gonna come out normal
I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way
They're gonna have, you know
Developmental, you know, mental issues
You never know
It's just, this was the easiest way
And thankfully, you know
The whole birthing process took like five minutes
Once you gave birth to them, it was just done
Super quick
And everything came out because, you know
If the placentas didn't detach or whatever
They had to go and scrape that out
It's just not fun
So, uh
Yeah, I mean
You know, Brad Pod Culture is saying that I posted something on Live Journal
Yeah, I did
Like the whole process, you know
Especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff
I kept thinking of how I wanted to
I don't know, kind of
Get everything out
And that was the way to do it
I just kind of wrote a letter to them
So, it helped
Obviously, there's a lot of outpouring from our chat right now, you know, about the situation
And, you know, everything
And I found that to be very true, you know
With your updates on Twitter and so forth, you know
I think Dark Soccer and I didn't really want to
We didn't want to say anything about what was going on
Because we didn't know what, you know
What was cool to say and what was not cool to say
So we just kind of said, shut up, it's private
You know, but then you came out and said something about it
And, you know
It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything
Exactly, exactly
And, you know, I thought the letter obviously was very, very touching
And some folks were saying they got, you know, a little teary-eyed reading it
But, you know, I
I guess the next thing to ask
And I apologize for continuing to kind of drag this out, you know
But I think, I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff
And I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is
What next? What do you do next now?
Well, now, the next
You know, obviously we still don't have children
Nellie's not
I mean
We can't, you're not supposed to try right afterwards
Because there's a higher risk of, you know, preterm labor
In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time
So, basically now
This is unfortunate
The way they kind of, the whole medical thing is
It's like they want you to fail once
And then they'll take everything seriously
It's just, you know, they don't
They're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess
Or whatever, I don't know
So
Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment
Or she goes in with a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay
You know, just healing and everything
Later on, we'll meet with somebody
In the high-risk clinic
To see what we need to do
She thinks, I mean, she has her own theories of why it happened
She thinks that her progesterone levels dropped
Because she has PCOS
Which, basically, her body interprets insulin as testosterone
Or something like that
And it throws off her hormone levels
And that can also cause preterm labor
And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever
To keep, you know, an eye on that
The other thing they can do is a cerclage
Which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch
They couldn't do that this time
That was one of the options that they gave us
But the problem was that the birth
You know, the sack of the first baby was distended so much
That there was more of a chance that they were going to pop it
Than them actually successfully doing it
So it just wasn't an option
And, you know, pretty much we'll try again next year at some point
But just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months
Before we can try again
You know, just to be extremely cautious
And even then
Hopefully this time what we're going to do
Is we're going to do one round of Clomid first
Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it
It overstimulates her ovaries
That's why we got twins
But we're going to try
One round of Clomid first
And then not try an insemination at all
And then another round of Clomid
So we get one baby and not two
Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two
Okay
And this question might sound kind of weird
But this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you
And then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this
But I think a lot of people out there
When they were reading about this on Twitter
And even hearing about it now
And seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth
They were kind of wondering like, what can I do?
Is there something I can do to help?
Is there anything I can do?
Is there any charity?
Is there something I can do to help?
Not really
I mean
I don't know
If you want to do a charity
I guess March of Dimes
They research
Pregnancy loss
I don't know
There's that I guess
We talked about getting in a group together
For when they do the next March of Dimes walk
I don't know
I've actually done that quite a few times
And it's a really great charity
And I think it would be very perfect
I'd definitely go in on that
I don't know
Do whatever you guys need to do
See that's the thing too when we got home
Everyone wants to help out
I totally understand
What's there to do?
I don't know
It's fine because at first
We did not want to go out of the house
My mom would come over
She'd bring us groceries that we needed
I'd have friends come over and they'd bring
Food and stuff
That was fine
But now we've got a fridge full of food
What do you want us to do?
You want us to do something around the house?
I don't know
I don't know
There's nothing really you can do unfortunately
It's nice to know that you guys
Care
I don't know
Right now
I can't really think of anything
There's nothing really we can do
Well maybe if we decide
To go the charity route later on
I know we've always been
Toying with the idea of doing a marathon
Of some sort on some weekend
So that might be something we have to look into
Might be a lot of fun
For a good cause
That's pretty much it
Right now we've got a lot of stuff
Taken care of
I don't know
See
I feel so guilty right now
I really shouldn't be
I should be glad that I'm kind of
Over everything
This whole week
I was perfectly fine
I was
Sitting at home
At first I wanted to stay home
Because I wasn't ready to go back to work
Probably like Tuesday
Mainly just staying home
To keep Nellie company
Because she's got
Well she can't go to work
For four weeks
Doctors orders not to go back to work
For four weeks
Rest up
Make sure that you're okay
And healed and all that stuff
But
I've been editing Grand Theft Auto
For the last few days
So I've been just
Getting back to normal
Yeah it's pretty much getting back to normal
I feel so guilty
Because she's still upset
And I just
Can't
The most I get upset is now
Where I'm just talking about it
But even then
It's not
I don't know
It's probably just naturally going to take her a little longer
Yeah definitely
So she's been having to
Deal with the pain of that
Because
You're supposed to let it reabsorb back into
Your body and
Cramping after
She gives birth and everything
Her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions
And cramping based on that
And you have to give yourself massages in your stomach
To force it to cramp
So that it will shrink back down
All the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people
Don't know about
I don't know
I mean
It's like
I have pictures of them
They give you these little
Layets, they're little
Outfits that they basically dress them up in
And take pictures and stuff
As morbid as that sounds
But that's all you got
I actually have pictures but
It's hard for people to look at
Especially the boy
Their skin is still transparent
And he was really bruised
Coming out and he's all red
And stuff
Let me read this from Kitsune
Because I think this is really good advice
And we'll try to move on from here
Kitsune in chat says it would probably be worse
If you didn't get back to normal
I mean if you stay in a good spirit it would help her
Yeah exactly
I think that's what it is
I know we spent a lot of time talking about that
But it's important
And I think Brad
If you want to join me in our chatroom again
Chat.orangelandraday.com
After listening to OLR for so long
We feel like you guys are kind of like family
So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody
We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this
You know because
Don't want to go through this again
Fair enough
Alright well let's move on
Let's get back to gaming
Let's talk about video games
And the stuff that distracts us from the real world sometimes
And gets us
Makes us happy
Video games
DarkSakura I'll go to you
How was your gaming week we always start off the show?
Well not very
Busy just given that I can't
Hold the controllers for very long
Before my hand starts to hurt
We got in
We're borrowing a couple pinball tables
That we actually got
After we did the video
Attack from Mars
Which I really love
Which I love but I really like Attack from Mars better
Dude you got an Attack from Mars?
That's awesome
That's the pinball I have the holograms and all that stuff in it
Play after the show
And so
I've been playing a little bit of that off and on
But like I said my hand starts hurting me real bad
So I can't play for very long
And
Playing Sims 3
Off and on
Some of the
Newness has fallen for me
But um
I go back every so often and now I'm actually
Going to pick up one of my old families and play them
Somewhere now that you know better hair has come out
Um
I've been playing Peggle
I beat Peggle so now I'm playing through it again
It's
Pretty fun
Some Cooking Mama last night
On my iPhone
Played Light Cycles on my iPhone
Played La Solitaire on my iPhone
You've been getting into iPhone gaming
Quite a bit huh
You know my roommate downloaded something
For the iPhone and you know he's not a huge huge
Gamer but he got really into some role playing
Game that was on that phone I apologize I didn't catch the
Name I'll try to check it out for next week
The puzzle RPG game
Oh I have a
Vi that was a Sega CD
Title and I have it on my iPhone
Um
I've also um
Been playing some of the little games on
Gaia online cause my account
Is still there
Including Booty Grab just cause I think it's funny
It's where you go into the
Aquariums and if you
Manage to get one that's active they'll throw gold everywhere
And you grab Booty
I just laugh because I'm grabbing Booty
Nice
Cause I'm five years old that way
Um
And uh we picked up a couple of games
We actually picked up some Tengen
Games that were in the
Regular Nintendo cartridges
We got Gauntlet
And um I don't think we
Picked up RBI Baseball cause hello
It's RBI Baseball
And uh one other
That I can't remember
And uh here comes the husband
What was the other game?
We didn't?
Oh I thought you bought the games
Okay well we didn't get the games then we saw them
You just saw them
I thought he got them You had a daydream where you were gonna
Buy them and leave No because I went back
And I bought movies I bought the
Doctor Who movie
That just came out I found it brand new for like ten bucks
Oh nice And then I got this movie
Which I love Saved
Oh that's funny That movie is cracked out
And I got um Elf
Cause you know I normally
Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy
The crap out of me until I saw that movie
And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny
Especially when you smell
You smell like beef and cheese
But um
But also uh
For other games Dan got me
This that I haven't opened yet
But I will be
This is the game that we are in
But you're actually
You got the 360 version
That's the arcade stuff
We're in the PS3 version We're in the PS3 one
Yes we're in the PS3 one The Namco Museum Essentials
Which I thank you for reminding me
We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners
About this um we actually
Have a cameo in a video game
In the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials
We're in the PS3 one
It's a PlayStation Network title
Yeah it's a download title
It's a download title on PlayStation Network
You have to get it online
The one that we're in is the one online
So anyway
Now they're talking about that
But yeah if you, here's the thing
It's just a little cameo
But when you start the game, not the demo
But the retail version of the game, you're not gonna see it in the demo
When you start the retail version of the game
Then it comes up and it shows like
Hey now you can use High Scoreboard with your friends
And it actually on the High Scoreboard
It says Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3
And then there's some initials thing on the side too
Where OLR is some of the top initials
On the High Scoreboard
So it's really cool and awesome
But it still has a lot of good games on it
Oh yeah I mean that's still a good collection
That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they released
Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online
Galaxian Pole Position
So yeah
As soon as my hand
Cause my hand is actually still pretty crappy
I actually heard it yesterday
Holding my friend's son
And she is listening right now
And sorry your son killed me
But no
I actually ended up hyper extending my middle finger way too far
And that's
Oh come on
I know it just sounds funny sorry
The technical term is hyper extension
I was using my middle finger too much
Hey hey
I was showing you see look at my finger
No and the suture is still in my palm
So I'm actually going to call my doctor
And tell him to get it the hell out of my hand
Because it's really
I pretty much think it's what's slowing up my healing
Cause I
It's taking longer than it's supposed to
It really is taking longer than it's supposed to
Other than that
I really haven't played a whole lot of other things
Oh I did watch Dan play the Arkham Asylum demo
And that looks hot
That is just oh my god
And it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J
And I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast
Except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different
But other than that hey I mean
It actually
I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up
And I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try
I'm going to
If I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo
Oh
Oh oh oh
And I came this close
Really tiny close to playing BeatMania
And I was like nah let's just go home
Probably not good for your hand though
Nah really not good for my hand
I'm a right side scratcher but nah
You know what's funny I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania
Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday
What? Where?
Tahoe
I was in South Lake Tahoe
It was either Harvey's or Harrah's I can't remember one of those two had it
And yeah I almost played it but then I was like
Dude it's 5 key this is old
Oh and I released a ringtone pack
For iPhone owners
Did I send it to you?
I don't think I saw it
I did a limited giveaway just a random giveaway
To give away 10 video game ringtones
That I made for iPhone
And I'm going to do it again
This time instead of doing it on
Twitter
I'm going to do it on Facebook
So the first 5 people to send me a message to my inbox
On
Facebook
So the first 5 people to send me
A message to my inbox
On
Facebook with
Your email address
Actually I'll be better than that I'll say 10
Will be able to
Download the pack
It's just 10 different ringtones
Nice
And I can tell everybody
What's in them later
Alright
Well let's move on with our gaming weeks
And Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto
Yeah I was playing
I got so much playing Grand Theft Auto
As I was editing Grand Theft Auto
Still
It's almost done actually I think it's probably done now
I think I've edited pretty much everything
I could possibly edit in it now
And I am going to record some stuff for it
I finally got my video capture thing
For doing HD video
And
Assuming everything works on it
We should be able to record some stuff
I've been having issues with the
Program that came with it
To get it to work
For some reason it's just crashing randomly
Hopefully we'll be able to record everything
And it will be awesome
So you can finally see
What the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto
It's insane now
Now the jets fly around at street level
And it's just kind of crazy
Because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by
Just like what the hell is going on
Other than that
I didn't really play a whole lot this week
I brought my DS with me to the hospital
It was something to do
So I played a little bit of Lego Battles
Which that game is kind of boring
I mean it's an okay RTS game
But the AIs are retarded
And like I would tell
You have these
You can harvest wood and stuff like that
Or it gives you bricks or whatever
So I'm telling them to go chop down these trees
And they just stand there
They're like, huh?
You want me to do what?
Or like I say, chop down these trees and they run the opposite direction
Absolutely retarded
So that got really frustrating and boring
Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme
Which was fun
And also some Planet Puzzle League
Which was pretty fun
Those games are good standby puzzle games
And
Let me think
I think that's pretty much it
Really not a good week for games
Even though I was home all week
I was just preoccupied
With just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff
And then before that
Putting away boxes
And cleaning up the house
But I have my giant HDTV
Now in my room
To do video capture on
So it'll be awesome
Alright
As far as my gaming week
Even the fact that we've been gone a little while
I didn't play a lot of new stuff
I made my way to disc 3 now
Which is way past where I was before
So that's pretty cool and I'm still enjoying that
I play Blackjack for real
When I went up to Tahoe yesterday
I took a day trip to South Lake Tahoe
It's so funny up there because
They have these huge casinos
Literally adjacent to the state line
Like you're walking down the street
There's some California little built up things
You literally walk across the street
And you're walking across the state line
And there's these huge casinos right on the other side
It's not like Reno where you still have to drive in
Like 5 miles at least to get there
But yeah I had a good time
And I played Blackjack for real for the first time
And it's kind of freaky because
It was $10 minimum bet and all that stuff
And I put in $60 and I left with $52
So I lost a little bit
But considering I was entertained for about an hour
And came out basically even
I'm not too upset
So that was kind of a thrill
It sounds like you did pretty good for yourself otherwise
I mean you didn't come out broke
And I was down to about $20 at one point
And I was like ah fuck my life
I'm going to be losing all my money
But I did okay
It was very nerve wracking
It was a lot of pressure but it was fun
But please gamble responsibly if you're over $21
Let's see what else did I do
I did play one new game
But I can't really review it because it's a beta
And it's actually one that I know somebody emailed
Us on before
And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game
To check it out
And it's from NCSoft
And it's a new MMO that's coming out
It's actually
If I understand right
It's been out in Korea for some time
It's just finally getting its localization over here
So it's finally in beta and so forth
And I didn't really play the game enough
To get a real sense
To review it fairly
I will say it's pretty
It definitely had some things in common with WoW
But I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well
I don't know if this is the way it looked or what have you
But as far as like
I'm just talking about the way the game looks on a purely
Superficial level
I'm not talking about how the insides of the game work
Because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into
Such as
When you get to level 10
You can actually evolve your class
I guess your characters get wings and whatever
And you can evolve your class
It's an interesting little game
But it was hard to tell a lot about it
Because in the beta
You just get thrown right into the game
There's no tutorial
There's nothing
You just got to figure it out
The first few quests kind of help you a little bit
But it doesn't hold your hand as much as Warcraft did
Or even Warhammer
Which is another one I played recently
It's more that Final Fantasy 11
Like WTF do I do now
Type of thing
But I don't want to make you think
It's Final Fantasy 11
Because it definitely felt a lot more like
WoW or Warhammer did
I'm going to check it out
I don't want to review a game based on a beta
But I will say the game kept me interested enough
To want to play it again next weekend
And that's what I plan to do
It sounds like fun
Yeah I'll have to talk to my source
See if I can get you another code
It'll be kind of fun
I like a good MMO but you know which one I'm waiting for
Final Fantasy 14?
Heck no!
What was that line from
Chasing Amy
Bitch you almost made me laugh
Let's move on
Into some housekeeping real quick
And of course we are back
Here after a little bit of a hiatus
And for the foreseeable future
Tonight is episode 333
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Believe it or not
We were on Bobby's show before we were live tonight
Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf
Who hosts the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio
At 5 o'clock Pacific 8 o'clock Eastern
Before we were on
He was making fun of us tonight
Calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth
Or half the Mark of the Beast
I was saying it's a holy show
Holy moly
And of course we have a new YouTube up
So check that out on the channel
www.youtube.com
And we are Channel Orange Lounge Radio
Or you just search for OLR
And you get all our videos, they come right up
Let's get into some gaming news
We're not going to cover anything that happened
In the past few weeks
I heard a lot of interesting stuff happen
I have to be honest, while we were away from the show
I kind of didn't pay attention to the gaming blogs
I did read a few interesting stories
Such as that promotion that went really
Really wrong by EA
At Comic Con
The whole take a picture with our booth babes
Thing
It was dumb
I don't know if you heard about this
I actually didn't
It was some lame brain in the marketing department
Their scheme went way wrong
At least it wasn't a goat head
It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe
And you
Send it on your Twitter
Or something like that
And you'll get entered in a drawing to win a
Date on the town with two women
And basically
The star treatment where you get
A paparazzi
Or basically a chaperone
A limo and that kind of stuff
But the way that it was phrased
It made it sound like you get two prostitutes
That you get to go have sex with
Right because the whole thing was around
The seven deadly sins and what was this
Lust was probably the thing
So the whole thing was built around lust
And it made it kind of sound like
It was encouraged like go harass booth babes
And take pictures of them
It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes
From what I understood from their thing
Or was it supposed to be I don't know
This is why you need parameters set
Here's the thing
I'm sorry to get far into this
Here's the thing
Is that I actually
Don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world
They thought outside the box
They came up with a new competition
Was it a very limiting competition?
Did they kind of close this off
To a lot of people by only thinking
Of the horny straight male? Yes they did
Did somebody in marketing fuck this up
Big time by taking it from idea
To fruition? Oh yeah
Oh yeah like where was the quality check on this?
Come on. And seriously you got to think about this
You don't do that
At Comic Con you do that at Vegas
Where you can actually
Fulfill your contractual
Obligation to get those guys
Laid. And I just don't
Like the only thing I really
Didn't like about it is it just reinforces
The stereotype that
Gamers are a bunch of desperate horny male
You know folks who can't get laid
You know what I mean?
And not that I think you see but at the same time
I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write
All these rules
Well you get on a date with two women
But if you're a woman you can get guys
Or if you're a gay guy you can get pretty guys
Or if you're a lesbian
I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme
Well I mean
Just let me cash out the damn prize
How about that?
You also won
Oh yeah you won booty as well
But that's funny
I don't know
Like I said I think they should've done it in Vegas
People just need to get over this shit
It's a contest you don't like it
Don't enter it
Don't get offended by it it's a contest
My god
Do we need to take it seriously?
I'm not offended but I'm just like
Stupid. This is stupid
This is so so stupid
And that's probably not what people want
You know us to be saying about their upcoming game
Dante's Inferno. Stupid.
I don't know about the game itself
Anyhow let's get into some gaming news
From the now. Loki please start us off
Yes so
Sony decided it was an awesome idea
To go ahead and add
Some
Ads to their
Game Wipeout HD
And these would be you know little commercials
That would play before your races
And what not
What's interesting though is
The ads that they have
Actually increase the load time
From
Basically like
8 seconds to 19 seconds
Now
That doesn't seem like a whole lot but
That's still annoying that you have
To wait 19 seconds to get into
A race because they want you to watch an ad
For a game that you paid for
Already
Thankfully enough people bitched
And so they went ahead
And got rid of those ads
Or at least that one ad that was that long
But still though
I mean come on
Adding ads after the fact because
They want some more money
I'm sorry I can understand if you want to do that for like
A free version of the game that may be ad supported
But if I bought this game
I don't want to have to
Pay extra
I don't want to have to wait extra
Seconds or whatever to play my levels
Just because you want to make a few extra bucks
Running a State Farm ad
Or something like that
The ad had nothing to do
You know what's funny
I actually own Wipeout HD but I haven't played it in so long
I totally missed this
State Farm? Really?
Like what gamer is going to be sitting there
Playing Wipeout HD going
Damn I was just thinking I need life insurance
I mean really?
Well the races are pretty dangerous and if you die
As much as I do in that game
It's fake!
Exactly but still I have to wait real time
I don't know
I think it's fucked up though that they can go ahead
And inject ads into a game
That you've already bought that didn't have ads
You know the billboards
In certain games you know like
Burnout and stuff that's fine
Whatever you know I'm not going to get bent out of shape
By that because it doesn't really affect my game
I drive past it so fast I don't give a crap
You know um
Same with like Crackdown they have the same thing
You know how like some games will have like
Especially like the sports games will have the
You know such and such sponsored
Like you know Wheaties sponsored
Car garage or something you know or
You know something like that where like a logo is inserted
Suddenly in the game
I see that kind of crap on TV although you know
I don't like the fact that I pay for it
I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this
Because this is very in your face
Captive audience that's the problem
It makes you a captive audience to these commercials
It's like those ads in the bathroom stall
It's just
It's just that they do
Do it after the fact you know
It kind of devalues your game
You know people might not purchase this game
Because it has a 20 second load time
Or you know you have to watch it
Ad for State Farm
DarkSakura I don't
You know unlike you I don't get mad at the
Ads in the bathroom because
You know again unlike you
If I don't like the ad I can always piss on it
Well no it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom
That I don't like it's this thing that they do at my work
With these little security posters
That they put in the bathroom stall
Which I'm glad I haven't had a look
The hell is that big brother is watching you poo?
What is that?
It's like give out confidential information at work blah blah blah
Don't talk about this blah blah
Security risk blah blah blah
And they look like stupid motivational posters
But not really
And I hate that more
Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick
Yay tangents
The dates back to high school you love my tangents
Admit it
There was once this kid
That ran for student government
When I was in high school and I think he was running for
Like I don't know like they used to
Like a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they
Called it he would basically be the host of all the pep rallies
Biggest loser
Okay biggest loser was what he was running for
And his campaign
You know he put up a bunch of posters and stuff
But in the men's bathroom he actually put up posters
In the urinals
And what have you and it actually said
You hold the future in your hands
And vote next Friday
I actually thought that was kind of creative
That's brilliant actually
Oh my god
And now he works for EA creating failed
You know advertisement
Oh I don't keep in touch with the assholes
From high school except the ones I liked
Who knows what that asshole's doing
But you know I just thought that was funny
That actually is pretty funny
Here's what I think they should do with these ads
And I think it's fine
If you want to place the ads in here
But I think that they should have to spend
The time to make the ads
Seem like it fits in this universe
For example like
You know the movie Running Man or you know
Fast and Furious
On DVD and Blu-ray or something
Not even necessarily that like
Okay wipe out HD
Let's make it, it can be a state farm ad
But have them like ensuring like these space
Vehicles or something like that
It fits in like the universe
It fits in everything but it's actually
Still an ad for state farm
It's just like you know
What was it? Demolition Man
The other Sylvester Stallone movie
That sucked was Sandra Bullock
No the one with Sandra Bullock was Demolition Man
Oh it was Demolition Man
It's like Demolition Man with like Taco Bell
You know where it's like a restaurant
But it still fits in their universe
You know you could do something like that
But just make it fit in the game
It's something ridiculous like you know
The 2009 Honda Civic
Or something like that in a futuristic
Racing game that takes place in the year 3000
No one fucking cares about your thousand year old car
But what about the point that you're sitting there
Making me wait, you're increasing my
Low times in this game
To be a captive audience to watch this
Ad on a game I paid for
I mean granted what, Wipeout HD
Is only about 10, 15 bucks
I can't even remember how much I paid for it
It's not an expensive game but the fact is I did still pay
For it and also I just don't like
The fact that they snuck all this shit in after the fact
After the reviewers got to
Copy it and after I mean this
Is where the fact that you can patch games
After the fact is kind of dangerous
Like what the hell is this
Really I mean
What's to say they're not going to go back and patch
Other games to suddenly throw in advertising
You know surprise
It's just low
Because then
You know when the game is reviewed and all the
Previews go out
This has to be breaking a law of some sort
I don't know how, it has to be
Like it's just shady, you're raping my eyes
You are raping my eyes
And I am unwilling
It's just weird
Unconsensual eye porn
Yes this is unconsensual eye fucking
That's what this is, thank you Sony
Here's the thing though
Poor State Farm because you know
They probably just buy out of some company
It's not even State Farm
It's not even State Farm
Don't blame State Farm for this
Just remember State Farm is there
State Farm is everywhere
Apparently even in Wipeout HD
So there you go
Hey at least it's not another
Fucking Axe commercial or something
Like that
Yeah, comments from chat
Chat.orangelandtrader.com
GameGuru says if ads are in my game
It needs to be either flavor or cheaper
Tigerclaw says
I think the ads came after the Fury
Add-on pack for Wipeout HD
And continues to say maybe if you buy the regular
Wipeout HD without the add-ons it doesn't have the
Ads. I never noticed them
I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed
The ads but I didn't play it in the last three weeks
And just to be
Clear the ads are gone now right?
They were patched out right?
Well they're not patched out but they're working with the company
Now I think that ad is gone
But they're working with them now so that
Basically the ads are shorter and they don't
Interfere with the load time or something like that
Is what they're saying. They're not seeing that the
Ads are going away they're just saying oh we're working with
This company because we fucked up
Or they fucked up by making the ad
Too long or something
So basically they're saying hey
It's not that we're getting rid of the advertising
We're just trying to find a way to keep it into
The eight second window basically
It's just I don't know it's shady
Yeah
I mean I expect those types of ads
On like let's say like a pogo.com
Type of website which are like if you've
Never visited this website it's just a ton of casual
Games it's all middle aged
Crisis women games and I love
Them like you've got like Boggle
And Scrabble and like all this stuff on there
I have no problem with them doing like a free version
Of this game or something. Yeah but they're all free and you
Expect that you're gonna have to sit there and look at an ad
For you know Metamucil in between
You know games or what have you but
Or Special K
That's the big one. I love Special K
It's delicious
Special K is like
Food of the lifetime network
I'm very pissed off that they
Really focus the demographic
To chicks okay
Fuck games for a minute this is more important
Than any other revelation that's come out
About ads and games. Fuck that whole thing for a minute
Loki
Loves
Chick cereal. True story. No I love
Special K. The fact that they're like saying
It's like oh chick cereal
That's unfair. That is really unfair
That's just like Captain Crunch and they're saying
That it's like pirate cereal or kid's cereal
I'm sorry I still like it
It's good. It's alright
I mean if you're gonna eat like healthy cereal
At least it's not like Total or something like that
You know which is like old people's cereal
I like Total. I used to eat that
When I was five. Or like
I don't even know if you remember this
Product 19. Yes
I remember that. Yeah that's almost like
Special K. Because if you even say mini wheats
Or old people food I'm gonna come over there and beat you
Mini wheats are freaking amazing
I like Crispix too
Crispix is pretty damn good
I'm the person with all brands
Sitting up there in my cabinet
No but it's alright
Instead of eating you know like
Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles
Or Captain Crunch I'm eating
Special K because you know what at least
That's not too bad for me and
It tastes alright. I don't have to put sugar on it
It's not like corn flakes which
That could be hit or miss
I am amazed
At the vast of knowledge some of our listeners
Have of the show. AlphaKananagram
In chat says to quote from guys on a show
Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge
Radio when it was a station
Like it was like on Thursday nights or something
I did that with my old roommate Xfer. It's been off the air
For like four years. But says this quote
Sky thinks Special K's
Secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice
Did I say that?
You made that up. I did not say that
Did I really?
From experience I can tell you
That I don't think pussy juice is in
Special K
Well how would that attract women too?
Well lesbians maybe
But you know
It's not bad. It's just the thing is
The only thing I don't like about Special K
Because first off they don't have
Mazes and little stupid dumb
Puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles
And you know
Captain Crunch does. But they have like you know
All this breast health
Awareness crap and like
You can lose you know
Inches off your waistline
Or something like that if you do the Special K
Diet and crap
I'm like I'm sorry. I eat your cereal and I lose
No weight whatsoever
But then again they want you like
McNuggets don't help
But they also want you to have it with skim milk
Because that's like disgusting
Might as well eat cardboard or something
I don't know
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to get off topic
But I just we had to have the Special K
Chat on this show because I think we've never had
It on the main show and it's been like seven years
And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long
It's good
I mean it's
I don't know I go back to Captain
Crunch every now and then but Captain Crunch is sharp
I mean it's seriously like for the record
I hate Special K
For the record I hate Captain Crunch
I love Special K
I like fiber cereals. Okay I grew up on Grape Nuts
And Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran
I hate marshmallows
And you have a smooth bowel movement every day
Shut up
The only kids cereal that I ever
Liked was Frosted Mini Wheats
And I still to this day it's my favorite cereal
In the universe and Rice Krispies
Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me
Oh I'll eat that stuff dry
Out of the box
I hate Cheerios
You know what else is good too that I can't stop eating
Once I get some?
Golden Grahams
You can still get Golden Grahams I just had some the other day
I know they're awesome
Here's the thing though it's funny you say
I can actually eat it dry
I only eat cereal dry like I hate milk that much
I don't eat cereal with milk
See Special K that would taste awful dry
I can't stand Special K
Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me
It is that disgusting
It's gross
Alright anyhow
Oh yeah so the ads and games
That idea
Unless you run an ad for Special K then Loki won't mind anymore
Alright
Let's see let's move on with some more news
And talking about Netflix a little bit
And Netflix of course streaming has been
Huge on the Xbox 360
It's rumored once again
And it seems like this rumor comes up
Every few months or so ever since Netflix
At the Xbox 360
But apparently an industry executive
Familiar with Netflix plans
Has talked to the website Multichannel
That the company's streaming service
Is soon coming
To the iPhone or iPod touch
As well as the Wii
By the way that doesn't mean you're gonna get to watch
Netflix on 3G that would be way too much
Of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth
And you know
Boy oh boy
AT&T the
I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T
Because they are just like
They're putting the clamp down on everything
That was other big news that came up even though it's not game related
The whole thing like Google Apps
Maybe the T stands for twat
Getting shut down by
Assholes, twats, and turds
There you go
So asshole, twat, and turd
Isn't gonna let you use their 3G network
Because it's way too much
Of their precious bandwidth
So you'd only be able to use Netflix over the
Streaming
Over Wi-Fi
Which makes sense
I mean it would be horrible quality over 3G anyway
It takes forever as it is
But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've
Been hinting at that for a long long long long time
But
Nothing about
Sony Playstation 3
And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting
Because Apple
If I'm not mistaking kind of has
Their own thing I mean you can't see
They don't have a Netflix type service per se
But they do have the movie rental
That you can do on
The Apple and you can play that
On your phone
So I would see something like this getting shot down
Just the same way the Google
What was the Google Latitude app got shot down
Google Voice that was the big one
That got shot down by Apple as well
By Assholes, turds, and twats
There's other phones out there
That do
Yes but realize whether you like it or not
The iPhone is the one everybody
Seems to have right now
It is the most popular phone
What's second behind it is the Blackberry
Probably
Which is also an AT&T
Name too
Or AT&T brand too
I'm trying to read some comments
In the chat room let's see Decipher says
Atrocious telephones and technology
Frisbee says all twats talking
So there you go
And Misty says
It's a fucking cheap phone
Hey I love my iPhone
Bad bad bad
Well I mean I'm just saying
That it actually is
Really good
I mean seriously
It's a really good technology
So whatever
Yes and Tigerclass says
Let's not forget there is an all games app on the iPhone
And it lets you let OLR on it
Yeah I downloaded it too
Did that come out in the past couple weeks? I guess it did
If you haven't checked out the all games app search for that
Cause it lets you, it's free
And you can tune into all games radio anywhere
Plug in your ears, plug in the headphones and go
I always plug in my ears
Plug it in a car transmitter and go
Like Mr. Potato Head
Alright
So there you go Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone
I think it's inevitable
It's probably gonna come to
If AT&T will let it
It'll come to the iPhone
And Apple also
But I don't know about the Wii
I don't know
For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kinda like
It doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix
They could do it
I think you could do it
I mean especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan
Why not
You could get the Netflix channel
I mean honestly though do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix
I mean granted there is some stuff I watch
It's mostly TV shows
We actually cancelled ours
I have Netflix and I find that the most stuff I watch
Is TV shows
Like NBC has a lot of stuff on there
But we were doing that
But TV shows is the thing I'll stream the most
And oddly enough
And I'm surprised you cancelled because of this dark saga
BBC everything is on there
That I know but there's still behind on
There's still behind on a few things
It's old BBC stuff
You want BBC stuff from the 70s and 80s it's all there
I don't know if Monty Python was there but like tons and tons of stuff
They don't have any old tomorrow people though
I mean not the old stuff but like the series I was wanting to watch
But a lot of it is real shit
I'm gonna tell you there's a lot of real shit
I mean some cool indie films but a lot of crap
Diversity is your friend
You can stream Hulu
You have G4 on there
YouTube stuff
Or in my case pirated videos
Alright well let's move on
Obviously Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year but nothing now
Dark Sakura
Well something that's actually really good for
For people who have an Xbox in the United States
Is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support
The option is
You can buy your Xbox points using PayPal
You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com
Find
There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts
And then
But it really only works
Through the website not through the console
And it's right now only in America
In other words any way you want to give us your money we'll take it
Hey it's convenient
Especially if you sit with your laptop by you when you play Guitar Hero and want the song
I don't know
Not Guitar Hero
Never Guitar Hero
Maybe it's just me but I don't understand how this is like super beneficial and provides more accessibility
But maybe that's because I have my Xbox tied to my debit card
So when I go on there and buy the
Virtual Bucks
I don't mind
I mean we're talking about Microsoft
They're not going to give out my information
My bank protects me from any violation of information
So I'm fine
But I'm not real worried about that
I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth
Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade
I was buying everything and it was very tempting
But I've gotten a lot better at that
But I don't see how PayPal
Helps that
You're going to run everything through PayPal
I mean isn't giving your credit card to PayPal just as bad as giving it to Microsoft?
I guess that's what I don't get
It's really just as though I think for having another option
It's like when you buy stuff on eBay
You might be able to use your credit card
But it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal
Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way
But I mean it's really just giving people another option
And I don't see any harm in it
Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account
And you can use it to track your purchases that way too
So why not?
I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online
Just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff
They have ripped me off in the past
Like there was an error one time
Where I paid for something that was $50
And they charged me for $500
And got a bunch of overdraft fees and stuff like that
Because they're super awesome
And thankfully though the guy that received the $500
Refunded me my money
But they take a portion off of each thing
But if the whole reason why you want to use PayPal is because you're under 18
And you don't have a credit card
Dude go to the store and go buy a card
I mean seriously if you want the points that badly
Just go to the store, pay the tax on it
And just go buy a card
And just redeem it online
You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards right?
You can get a prepaid Visa card
But there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap
Because if you don't have a credit card
You're going to have to tie your bank account to PayPal
And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways
I mean it's been a while since I did that
But it's just easier if you're under 18
Just go buy a card at the store
Hell you can go to your favorite game store or whatever
Trade in some games or trade in crap
And then get store credit and trade it in for a card
I've done that too because then that way it's a little easier
A little cheaper
But I don't know
It seems like good that they're supporting it
They give someone another option but I don't think it's a good option
Good for them
I guess the more ways the better
I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal
Or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever
But I don't know
Not something I really plan on using
But see even with that though
Yeah you can build up money from PayPal
But it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account
One click of a button and it takes like two days
Done
So that's kind of a lame excuse if that's
Oh I got all this money built up in PayPal
Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too
Yeah they would love it free just to spend that PayPal money
On stuff that their company is selling
Or transactions through them
Because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction
And are they going to be charging you tax?
Because that would be something interesting too
I don't know
I guess it depends on what state you live in
True
So other interesting stuff
That Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got
I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test
I can't imagine this working full time
But their new thing is
Why buy used when you can buy new?
Best Buy will now match prices of new video games
At used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy
So basically you go to GameStop
You say okay
I see this used game for five bucks cheaper
Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy
Get a new game
Call this GameStop to see
Check the price and done
You get the new game for the price of the used game
Awesome plan but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off this
Because they're going to be losing money left and right
Especially if
Somebody at the GameStop or something like that
Is a real dick
Oh yeah we're charging $20 for that game
Get a bunch of the game
Go sell it back to GameStop
For more than $20
Now something that should be stressed though
Is that this is only available
In one certain market right now
This is not something
You can't run into Best Buy after hearing this
And expect them to do it
West Jordan Utah
So they picked a really small freaking market to do it
So to our listeners in West Jordan Utah
All one of you
If we even have that many
You can go check this out
But at the same time
You kind of said it yourself Loki
The price of a used game
At GameStop is typically only $5 under that of a new game
And Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off
On all their new games
Is that really that bad of a loss?
If they can create loyalty
Because that's a big big thing
I think a lot of people build up loyalty
To one certain place to buy their games
And here's the other thing too
About that
You see retailers like this
Basically they can sell a game at cost
And it's still beneficial for them
If they're able to sell enough units
Because they get back end rebates
To buy X amount of pieces
Or whatever
Like a company like Activision or EA
Or whatever will give them money
Whether that be ad dollars
Or just incentives
Or whatever
To get them to buy more
So what they could do with this
Is if they are able to launch this full scale
Really there would be no reason
For you to go to a GameStop
Or GameCrazy
To buy a used game
Or basically the same price
Now the question is
Are they going to also count the discounts
That you get with your GameStop card
Are you going to be able to
Get the extra 10% off
Probably not
I would say just assume no on that
And store credit
Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now
But isn't that something else they're testing?
Yeah the kiosks are testing that
But right now they're not
So they're not really doing
Any trades yet
But it still
Helps and then they got to do
More of the gift with purchase stuff
Because people seem to eat that crap up
Even though a lot of the incentives
Suck
But at the same time
And this goes for both Best Buy and GameStop
They got to fucking watch
The prices of their goddamn accessories
That they're selling because a lot of stuff
If you don't watch it they're actually selling it over retail
Like $5 over retail
For example
Wii Motion Plus at GameStops
$5 more than what it should actually cost
I was an idiot and bought it
Because I have store credit
So I didn't give a crap
But if I was more cautious
Then yes you could go buy it for $20 instead of $25
Same with some of the accessories
I know on the 360
Like their video cables
Or $10 over retail or $5 over retail
So you got to watch that shit
And they got to stop doing that
On top of all that if you're cautious
Then yeah I don't see why this would be a bad deal
If you're just interested in getting a used game
And you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off
I got to read this comment from chat
Because it's really funny
Brad from Pod Culture says
They play video games in Utah
To which Rama follows up with
Brad yep they play Super Mormon Brothers 2
Oh I'm sure Utah listeners appreciate that one
Alright
I just like that idea for a game
Super Mormon Brothers 2
There's a ROM hack somewhere
Surely there's a ROM hack somewhere
Well hey I like cheaper games
No matter how it happens
But let's not count out what GameStop might be doing
Not necessarily in retaliation
But certainly all the companies are trying to think
Of ways to one up each other
And GameStop is apparently looking for a new
Rewards program
Because you know the way it is right now
Is that they have what you get their little card
You get the 10% discount or whatever
10% more on trades
You get some magazine I've never read in my life
Game Informer is actually not bad
Yeah it's not a bad magazine
And the subscription price is cheaper than
Whatever
Honestly I couldn't tell you
I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine
Actually it was a couple weeks ago
I actually picked up a Barnes and Noble
It's a magazine out of the UK
Retro Gamer I think it's called
Oh that's good we have an issue with Retro Gamer
That was a pretty good one
But other than that I mean thanks to the internet
For the magazines
The reason I buy their card each year
One because the magazine subscription gives me something to do
Like to stare off in the space
At work sometimes
And because the extra
Trade in value that you get
It pays for the card
Within a few uses for me
That's the only reason I do it
It's basically a cost advantage for myself
Granted I could probably
Sell my games on eBay
Or whatever
I don't want to go through the fucking hassle
So that's my own choice
Whatever
Alright well apparently here's two versions
They're testing some different
Rewards versions
I'm not sure let's see where did this come from
It was a survey I see
They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in
And here was one
Take your game to the next level
With GameStop Rewards
So apparently if you sign up for this new
Free program
Sign up with your email address and so forth
If you do one purchase or trade in a year
You would get a birthday surprise
Meaning discounts on your birthday
Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas
Level two would be
Make any combination of five purchases
Or trades per year
You would get 20% bonus
Trade in credit because you're a power trader
I guess and you get early access
To purchase collector's editions of games
That's kind of interesting
And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release
That's retarded
Because you know what the early access
Collector's editions is?
You get the pre-order before everybody else
And then level three is
10 purchases or trade-ins a year
To get you know 25%
Bonus on trade-ins
Guaranteed access to exclusive in-game
Accessories and so forth
Let's see
And then there's another one that is just like a two
Level thing where if you do one purchase
Or trade in a year you get the birthday
Surprise but if you do 20 purchases
Or trade-ins a year you get the
Subscription to Game Informer you get the power
Trades you get guaranteed
In stock new games or free
Shipping that's kind of interesting too
So if they're out of your game they'll ship to your house for free
That's interesting early access to purchase
Collector's editions of games $5
Shipping of new titles shipped on day of release
And guaranteed access to
Exclusive in-game accessories etc.
So you know more incentive programs which I'm
Sure make some people excited but again it's
About building customer loyalty
Is huge you know
And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of
Making 20 trades because
You know
Once again it's cheap enough to where
$25 that will pay for
Itself especially with the extra 10%
On top of all that probably in
One use so
Why not why wouldn't you do that
Especially if you're buying games on a regular basis
You know why I've never signed up for their
Program and why I don't pre-order games
And I still stand by this I don't
Pre-order games because
I find that when the
Games are released because the companies
Are trying to one up each other if I pre-order
The game at GameStop or whatever put $5
Down it's going to come out and Best Buy is
Going to have a sale where you get a
$10 gift card if you buy the game or something
That's why I don't like to pre-order games because
I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see
What the competition is the day of release
And plus sometimes you see these really interesting things
Where GameStop gets
One little incentive game crazy gets
Another Best Buy gets another you know
Like all the companies get their own little
Free weapon or whatever
And I want to pick the one I like the best
I don't know I just that's my whole thing
I'm pre-ordering and joining these
Incentive programs and stuff I just really like to shop around
I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order
Collector's editions and that's if I'm buying
A collector's edition
Like Grand Theft Auto
Which we've got sitting right over there
Yeah
But that's it
I mean that's all I really would pre-order
I order most of my stuff through my work
Just because you know
I tend to get them early
D5T1 in chat says
Rob must be a Pepsi fan need to stick to a brand
Actually I am Pepsi is way better than Coke
Pepsi is way better than Coke
Only
And I've said this before
It's weird because Pepsi
It's better out of like
The can is good
And the bottle is okay
The tap is alright
Coke on the other hand tastes like shit
Out of a can
Tastes alright out of the bottle
Actually pretty good out of the tap
It's so weird
I can agree with that
I can agree with the tap changing
Like A&W out of the tap is so good
Yes
Can's alright if it's cold enough
But I will say this because
Before the Coke lovers start hating on me
Vanilla Coke was superior to
Vanilla Pepsi
They're both disgusting I'm sorry
Whatever I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap
The other day still
In the year 2009 at Rubio's
Yes I was floored
They were also one of the first places to have it in town
You know what else is good with A&W
Out of the jug
Like they actually sell it in milk
Jugs
Yes out of their stores
That's best
Let's go ahead and move on
And Dark Sakura
With some more news and we'll get into release dates
Well there's
A channel in the UK called Bravo
Which is completely has nothing to do
With our Bravo
That has a show out
Called Game Face
For casual gamers
Pretty much
You just watch
These guys play TV
Play video games
And they'll have some
Girl come out and be stupid
And then you get to see
Some game footage and then you hear
The people reviewing the games
Over the footage basically
What we've already had
Better people doing on
YouTube for free
You know
And
It just really seems like
It would be really boring to watch
Because
Usually anything that's got
Some type of corporate design behind it
Tends to get the imagination
Sucked out of whatever it could have been
Yeah I mean
True there's people that'll sit there
And watch other people play video games for a long time
I do when they're at my house
My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey
Even though he doesn't really play the game himself
He loves to just watch me kind of play through it
And see all the cinematic scenes and stuff
So it's kind of interesting that they're
Kind of making that a TV show
You know that they'll just kind of show
Five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff
Also you know this kind of tangent
Sorry but they have these interesting things on the
Comcast on demand
Where you can actually go in and they have these things
Called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something
And it's actually I don't know if it's G4
One of the other networks puts them on there
Because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right
But you can actually watch
In HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay
Of certain games
Around release time
To help you decide if you want to buy it
Or not I guess
Really get to see what it looks like
That's kind of interesting
I actually think that's a good idea
I think that's a really good idea to have that
Well my question is you know
We kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows
Come out and they're stupid
What video game TV show should they make
Do you think
How could they make a video game TV show
That's cool
They need to bring back the old school stuff
Where you have the person talking about the new games
That are coming out well I guess we're already
Doing that but you know
I think that
That's really what I'd like to
More see because it was really cool back in the day
Or you know like the
Video game related game shows
Not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of
But like the ones where the people had the Velcro best
And ran around that was kind of cool
StarCade and all that stuff
And I would like to see something like the
Screen Savers used to be
But more about video games
Which I know you might be thinking well isn't that Attack of the Show
I'm not really because that's kind of got that
Maxim Magazine spin on it basically
And you know that's not
All inclusive really of all the gamers
It's also annoying
I don't know I'm just
I'm a much bigger fan of what that
Show used to be than what it is now that's for sure
So I don't know
I kind of like the idea of a
Gaming kind of TV show by gamers
Who somewhat know what they're doing
I also would like to see kind of current
More current things I like the idea of
A daily show that you know
Is kind of current
Yeah
And really if you want to
Get reviews and everything
There's more amusing things to watch online
Like the Angry Video Game Nerd
And the one that
Oh god I can't remember what it is
The one that my husband watches all the time
That's kind of like that only older
And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched
He was drinking New Castle
It was pretty good
And somebody in chat says Orange Lounge TV maybe?
No
I don't know I think we might be
Getting too old it's a sad thing
Not too old he doesn't have enough time
Yeah it's true
I'd have to be getting paid for this
Exactly we'd have to all quit our jobs to do it
Yeah I would like to get paid
So I don't know
I honestly
Wouldn't even know where to begin with that
I'm not even going to think about it
Let's move on with some release dates
Low key
Well there's not a whole lot coming out in the US
Unfortunately it's a little bit of a slow time
But there is some big stuff this week
Including Madden NFL 10
Coming out this Friday
Pretty much can't expect that on
Every single system out there
Except for the DS I don't think it's on the DS this year
Fossil Fighter is on the DS
Actually today
Or tomorrow
I don't know I thought it was supposed to be today
Anyways tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo
Imagine Soccer Captain
Another crappy game from Ubisoft
That's on the DS
Active Life Extreme Challenge
It's the game that has
I don't know
Like a two player DDR mat or I guess
Kind of like a power pad
But it's for the Wii and it's
All the mini games you could possibly want
And that's available
Or not want is the case
We have a budget Fire Fighter sim
Real Heroes Fire Fighter
That's on the Wii
Also this week Core on the DS
From Graffiti Entertainment
Hopefully actually coming out this time
Because it's been delayed forever
ATV Quad Kings
On the Wii
It's a game from Zoo Games
And I can tell you this much it's gonna suck
Because it's just like all those other Destiny games
And they all suck
Let's see
Five Two coming out on PC
I don't know if that's a re-release or not
Phantom Brave Wii Meet Again on the Wii
That's actually pretty cool
If you're a Japanese RPG fan
And if you possibly want one
Even though you don't own Lips
They are selling the Lips Microphone
Separately now
You can purchase that this week
For the Xbox 360
And that's it
It's like I said
Slow week
It's also a slow week over in Japan
As we go take a look at the Japanese release dates
Really on the big systems
There's only one new game coming out
But it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game
And some folks may get a kick out of that
It's coming out on the Wii
Hagane no Reckon Jutsuji
Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsuki no Oji
Comes out
It's a game based off
Clearly the series Fullmetal Alchemist
Not sure what type of game it is
It looks to be like kind of an adventure-y
Not quite a role playing game
But a little more adventure-y with some little mini games
Built in like I see one where you're like shooting guys
With the buttons and stuff
So fans of that series may be into that
Otherwise that's really it on the big systems
If you go to the handhelds
You have a little bit coming out on the Nintendo DS
The localized version of Bolt comes out
From Disney Interactive
So Obuncha Derojun
Rikishi DS and Rika DS
Both come out this week
Sounds like a wrestling game
Or sumo game
Could be
But there's two different versions of it
And then lastly on the PSP there is a new game
Infinity Plus Portable comes out
And this is
I think a bunch of games
It's produced by Cyber Front
With different scenarios written by
Utsukoshi Kotaro
It's done scripts for famous adventure games
Like Memory Off
And it's part Danish simulation and part adventure
You have to rack your brains
To work your way out of pressing situations
Time leaps and messed up dimensions
Are just a few of your troubles
There on the PSP
That's really it for this week in Japan
Well for our friends in the UK
There's a few releases
On the 12th is Trials HD
On Xbox 360
Marvel vs Capcom 2
Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands
Both of those on the 13th
And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3
For PC and
Madden 10, whatever
That's it
And
Madden BLEH
Not your cup of tea, huh?
BLEH, barf
Um
So this is interesting
Sony has trademarked a new
Um
I guess a new logo
For something called PlayStation Thanks
Um, no word on what this is yet
However, if you were to ask me
I would say that it's probably gonna be some sort of
Um, incentive program
Very similar like, you know, the
Club Nintendo stuff
Very interesting tonight, we have a lot of
Discount and reward stories
I guess a sign of the times, I don't know
To help in the economy
Yeah, I mean, maybe
I mean, that's the only thing I can think of
Unless they're gonna come out with a new system named
Thanks, which would be retarded
I mean, I'm sorry, that would be absolutely retarded
Thanks for giving me your money
But then again, you know, hey, we said the same thing about the Wii
When that was named, but uh
I hope not
Um, yeah
So
No word on what that is, but I'm sure we'll find out about it
Soon enough
Dude, let's go play Thanks
Nice
I don't know, that would be awful
PlayStation Thanks
Uh, any type of speculation what it is?
Do you think it's just to compete with Club Nintendo
Or do you think this is just gonna unlock shit and home?
I think it's just a redemption program
Just basically to incentivize people to buy stuff
S2100Matt in chat says
I approve of these discount stories
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories
It's just kinda interesting, it all seems to be hitting the same week
And you know, we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed
This is all for work this week
Perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP
You know, they get you to buy stuff
And you get codes and then you can like redeem points
And get crap
Maybe that's what they're doing
That would make more sense to me
PlayStation 3, since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3
Um
I don't know
It'd be a nice bonus
Tigerclaw says perhaps this thanks thing could be a reward system
Where they offer you discounts on any games purchased in PlayStation Network
Who knows, $5 off or something
I don't know
I don't know
But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this
Just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing
Well I say thanks to Square Enix
Because this week we got some more details on Final Fantasy 14
A more full website has opened up for the game by the way
If you want to check that out
And I guess some more information was released on an 8 minute video
That came out from Famitsu Wave
I guess which is available on YouTube
But boy oh boy
If you want to check that out
It didn't really end there
A lot of new information came out
On Final Fantasy 14
What's kind of interesting is that
Some of the jobs from 11
And I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs
Is going to be somewhat similar
But the focus is going to be on the weapons
And they're saying that okay
What's also interesting
They're not using any of the Final Fantasy
Very typical names for classes
Like you have swordsman and sorcerer
Like all these new type of jobs
That you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before
But apparently the way it works is that like let's say you have a sword
Okay well that makes you a swordsman
But then let's say you're going to go off on an adventure
Where you need to go heal
Well you switch from your sword to your staff
And now you're a healer
And that's why you see in the Final Fantasy 14 logo
Out of the trailer that there was a lot of weapons poking out of it
Because the weapon system is kind of the central part of that game
And they say
That experience points and leveling
Doesn't even work like a normal game
Like there are no experience points in leveling
It's all based on the weapons
So it sounds kind of interesting
But more importantly they've also talked about
They are building this game so you can play it
If you have only an hour of time to spare
Or if you have all day to spare
They are looking at certain features that are only
15-30 minutes in length
Also some other things released about the game this week
Is that the classes have been revealed
And what's really interesting is that
They call them completely different names
They're not all even the
Same names that you might be used to
Like Taru Taru
Is now called a Lalafel
Which I keep saying a falafel
But their name is a Lalafel
Or something like that
I know they changed all the names
Because it's a new world
Oh it's not a new world, they're the exact same races
Come on
The characters do look slightly different
But they're also saying that the difference between the races
Is not going to be that great
But that the differences between the genders
There's some translation I read
Which some people are thinking might be a throwback
To the old D&D
Where men were typically more strength
Women were typically more mind intelligence
Kind of interesting
That's not true at all
I don't think it's funny to call them falafels
Do you also have Hummus as another class?
Probably
There's a Humaya or something like that
Is what they call a human
Why can't they just use Hummus?
Seriously
They're elven
Just call them elves
They're not elven
Or elephanten
Or whatever the hell they're calling them
I think my friend Shane was calling them Lalafels
They don't look as cute as Taros do
They look bigger now
They don't look like Taros did
Apparently they're more customizable
Are they going to have male Mithras
And female Galkas
Or whatever the fuck they're calling them
These guys are unisex though
Not yet, we haven't seen anything yet
But the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them
That they might come out later
That we'll see male Mithras later on
Or whatever they're calling them now
Cat people
You say that and I have thought this ever since
I always think of Mithril
I will say this though
Some screenshots have come out from the game
It looks really nice
Not really a lot from in-game
But just of some of the scenery and things
I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics
To look a lot more like Oblivion
But very colorful
Oblivion started to look very monotone after a while
Don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics
But Final Fantasy 14
They've shown some landscapes
That are just very lush and colorful
And I'm very excited to see
How the game looks when it comes out
Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year
Because the game's coming out in 2010
I don't know how they're going to do that
When Final Fantasy 13 hasn't even dated yet
I think people are getting their hopes up
I don't think this game's coming out until 2011
I realize Squeenix is saying 2010
But come on, how many games get delayed?
Do we trust them?
Do we really trust them?
So best case scenario
Like Christmas 2010
Is when you'll see this game, I think
But hey, don't get me wrong
I'm kind of excited about this game
Because I'm really excited at the notion that they have
Fixed a lot of the problems
Big problems that Final Fantasy 11 had
Especially in regards to
How long of an investment you have to make
With the game each time you play it
I mean like a month at a time
Right?
So anyway
We're going to go into now another segment
We like to do here
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane
And recap a
Favorite game that we love
In a segment called the classic game of the week
So Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault
And find the game
That she thinks you all ought to be playing this week
In Dark Soccer's classic game of the week
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?
The game of the week is
Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn
In Japan it came out
As a Zell Panzer Dragoon RPG
It is
Like I said, a role play game
Came out in 1988
For the Saturn
And it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series
Not including
Panzer Dragoon Mini
That came out on Game Gear in Japan
And also it's also the only one
That's not a rail shooter
It's
It was done by
Team Andromeda
And this was
Their last game as
Team Andromeda
So you're playing a boy named Edge
Who is looking
Who's actually trying
To save the world
And has his own dragon and everything
And so you play through the game
With real time
Well sort of real time
Combat
And
Your different interactions
With the characters
The really really cool thing about this
Is that
You actually
Don't
Stay on the dragon all the time
You can go around
And explore different areas on foot
And then you can fly around the world
You know different places that you can get to
You
Control your dragon
Pretty much completely
Instead of it being predetermined
Like it was in the other games
You actually tell the dragon where to go
And can go anywhere you want to
You also have other commands for the dragon
Like breaking things and accessing
Lovers and switches and things like that
And your dragon has different
You know weapons
It's
Like you have lasers for your dragon
Dragon with lasers that's pretty cool
Dragons with lasers awesome
Why didn't they just call the game
Laser Dragons? I probably would have checked it out
When it was first out
Well it actually was really good
It used a lot of dramatic camera angles
It really
Had just
It was really really a
Traditional RPG with some
Really unconventional aspects to it
Like for example you're in air combat
And it wasn't necessarily
Turn based it was
Real time based
And you know you have your attack
You can use items and then you have your berserks
Which are like your spells
And then you know you've also got
Your gauges that determine
You know where you are for your initiative
You know sort of like that
The other
Now this is what I really liked is that
You can get different abilities
You can equip your dragon
Well it's technically called
Morphing they also put this in
In Panzer Dragons VI and
Orda which came out on Dreamcast
You can change
The dragon into all these different forms
Which actually the specific
Thing about Saga is that
You literally had hundreds
Of different forms that you could do
You would affect different attributes
By sort of upgrading
Parts of your dragon and it would
Take a different appearance
Have different abilities, do different things
And it would actually
Change physical form
As you did everything
There were
Really different extreme forms
Based off of agility, spirit, attack
Or defense
And then it would change something within
Those four extremes
You would
Also be able to make some
Unique forms by getting D units
And then
There were hidden forms one of them is called
The light wing where if you get all 12
Of the D units in the game
You get the ultimate dragon
Pretty much the light wing has
All of the special berserks
And
When you charge all of your action gauges
Then all of your status
Your health points and your berserk points
All go to normal
Then there's another one called the solo wing
Which really didn't do crap for you
But it was harder to get so
It bothered
But it is considered one of the
Pinnacles of
The Saturn RPGs
And Saturn RPGs are
Barely
You know, at least for the ones
That we got out over here
Few and far between
And we actually have
An American copy of this game
And we paid
Quite a bit for it
Good luck finding it
It's really really difficult
But it is considered
One of the best RPGs
On the Saturn
Especially the few that came out in the US
So
There it is
Your classic game of the week
Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn
And I've never really seen this game before
But especially for that era
I like the backgrounds, they're very pretty
It's all these dragons shooting their lasers
And pretty sunsets and so forth
Really good music and not a lot of talking
Was one of the dragon battles
Yeah, it's kind of fun
The game has some
Gorgeous music and also it's in
Japanese
With subtitles
So the voice acting was actually
Pretty good in it too
There's a few familiar voices
For at least those who were onomie
Nuts
Well if you actually have a Sega Saturn
Still around the house and kicking and working
You can kind of copy that and check it out
Or I guess you can always try to emulate it somehow
But do they have Saturn?
They have Saturn emulators, you usually have to have a good working BIOS
But other than that
Yeah, they work
They work fine on your PC at home
I have one because
I just wanted to try it and it actually works on my
Disc games that I have a few Saturn games
Because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out
It works great
Alright, well we're going to take a break here on
Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet
We've got plenty more to come
We've got our rapid fire news when we come back with Part B tonight
As well as some more discussion
We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up
We're going to talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSI
And Pax 09 news
We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break
Here on Orange Lounge Radio
So don't go anywhere, stay tuned
Music
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio
On this lovely Sunday evening
Of 2009, of course we do tape live
On all games radio every Sunday night
At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
9 o'clock Eastern Time
Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus
If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that
In Part A, but you will just have to download
The podcast at this point, which I know
Is very slow in updating during our podcast
But should be back on a more regular schedule
This week
So anyhow, let's jump right back into some more gaming news
We have some rapid fire news
News that we're probably not going to talk a lot about
But we wanted to get it out there anyway
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight
Yes, Pearl Jam's next album is actually
Becoming simultaneously to
Rock Band as well as retail
And of course
Their new album, which
I believe is called Backspacer
Which is kind of a weird name, but okay
It'll be available
The same day
On both Playstation Network and Xbox Live
Marketplace, September 20th
Is going to be the
Date for that
Pac-Man Championship Edition is now
Also being ported to
The iPhone
And it makes perfect sense that they would be
Putting that out there
Definitely worth checking out
I believe it's actually coming out as
Pac-Man Remix
Oh no
They had one called Pac-Man Remix
My mistake, it is Championship Edition
That'd be kind of cool
And then a new
It's going to suck on the iPhone because the music
Was awesome in the Xbox one
I don't know if they're, well I guess you know
iPhone is an MP3 player, but
And they've got some kickass tunes, but I don't know
I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360
One being reproduced on the iPhone
Sorry, had to get that out there
We'll see
Champions Online is actually doing something
Interesting with their subscription service
They're actually, besides the monthly
subscription that you could do
Which would be
$15 a month
I guess
You can actually purchase
A six month plan
At a slightly discounted rate for
$59.99
Or if you want to
If you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game
You can get a lifetime subscription
For $199.99
$200
And I know for a lot of people that are
Playing WoW, if you get a lifetime
Subscription for $200, that probably would've been
Worth it when it launched
I don't know, if you're really into
Champions Online, that might be the way to go
But aren't you
Getting also something about Star Trek Online
With that too? That was the part that caught my eye
Yes, if you pre-order
One of the subscription plans
You will also get
Access to the closed beta for
Star Trek Online
Which is coming out later this year
See, I really want to play
Star Trek Online, but not $200
Sadly, especially when I don't really know anything
About Champions Online, except that
The series has a cult following to it
I play Champions offline
With books and paper and dice
Does the prospect of an online one
Because, you know, that wasn't really my thing
Is the prospect of an online version of that
Appeal to you?
Maybe? Could be hit and miss, I guess
But, dude, Star Trek Online
Early, that's cool
But, man, that's a mean thing to do
I mean, you gotta pay, what
$200, or what's the other subscription plan
Like $50 or something? $60 for six months
You gotta pay upfront
Just to get into a beta, it's not worth it for that
I bet you, though, there's some people
That'll pay that $60 just to get in that beta
I am positive of that
You're gonna pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO
To play a beta for another MMO
That you're possibly gonna go to
Kind of a waste of money if you ask me
Well, you know what? People can spend their money
However they want, right?
Alright, sorry, I didn't mean to go off and talk about that
But I just thought that was too interesting
Anyhow, let's- I think it's funny
Let me dive into some more news, we'll start off with
This actually is a little bit of old news
It did come out a couple weeks ago, but
We have some staffers at Orange Launch Radio that love
Love, love a little indie game called La Mulana
And that was a game that came out
It actually came out in like 2005
But it has extremely retro graphics
It's kind of like
Metroid-ish style kind of game
And it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game
I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX
If you've never seen this game before
Well, if you've never seen the game before
You will get to see it soon
La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare
Which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit, surprise
Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades
It won't really look 8-bit
But it'll look kind of more 16-bit
With a little bit more hand-drawn art
Is what the look they're going for
Should be kind of fun
The WiiWare version will also have downloadable content
New stages and game modes
Such as Boss Rush
The game is very, very difficult
So I'm not sure if the level of difficulty will still be there
Or what they plan to do
But that is all part of it
Moving on to talking about Rockband
I thought this was interesting
Rockband.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart
This is interesting because
You've seen some blogs and some websites
Do instrument compatibility charts of their own
But this is coming right from the source
Harmonics meaning
And includes games such as Beatles Rockband
What I think is interesting about this
They make no shame about listing
Guitar Hero games on here as well
And Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting
They also put in their compatibility chart
As well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth
If you're curious, just briefly
You can look at this at Rockband.com slash compatibility
You get the whole chart
But it actually looks like most of the instruments
Are compatible with all the games at this point
The only things you're going to run into is
You're going to run into problems with some of the Rockband paraphernalia
In Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3
On the Xbox 360
And drums are all pretty cross compatible
Unless you own the Rock Revolution drums
They just don't work with Rockband games
But if you want the confidence that your instruments
Will work with the Beatles Rockband
Here's some good news for you
Beatles Rockband will run on
Every single instrument will run with
Beatles Rockband as well as
Rockband 2
The only thing that doesn't work with Rockband 2
Rock Revolution drums
Same thing with Beatles Rockband
No one bought Rock Revolution anyway
They might, it's cheap now even with the drums
I guess it's true
Find an unloaded one
Anyhow, one other one
Quick follow up to a story previously talked about on Orange Launch Radio
Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled
And the game will be released in October
Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game
Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal
But details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed
But the game will be coming out in October
So get ready to rock those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend
That was a really messy situation
Because there was counter suits and all this other garbage
Yuck
Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news
What actually was going to be coming out is
Revenge of Shinobi
For Mega Drive for the Genesis
Over here will be coming out for
800 Nintendo points
And on WiiWare there's Bonsai Barber
Which is a tree sculpting and painting game
It's actually running a business
Doing both of those
And that's a thousand points
And then there will be a bunch of city maps
For DS city transport
For DS city transport map volumes 1 and 2
There will be
Parasite
And then there will be
And then there will be
Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon
And then there will be
London, Amsterdam
Moscow, Berlin, and Prague
So that's pretty cool
And that will be for 500
Also in other news
And this makes me a happy fangirl
Is we will have gorillas in rock band
Yay
Where's the yay?
Yay
That's right
Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are
But I'll download them for sure
Definitely
Heck yeah
Well there's going to be Feel Good Inc, Clint Eastwood
And Rehash
For pack 1
And that's going to be pretty cool
It's supposed to be out
For
Excuse me
On the rock band music store
This week
I believe
Tuesdays are usually the day those come out right?
Exactly
There's also going to be some other
Download tracks
We get some Janis Joplin
We get Piece of My Heart
That's awesome
This is going to be the best week ever for rock band
We get White Rabbit
Dude! Jefferson fucking airplane
This is the greatest week ever for rock band
We get Magic Bus
Nice
But also for the Wii
There will be a number of songs
Yeah
Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer
Thin Lizzy
You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas
Or no, my birthday?
I still haven't spent it
I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week
I have to get the gorilla stuff
I have to get Jefferson airplane
So
Look forward to that at my next rock band party
The other thing
Sega is teasing us
With the new RPG
We will be able to see
What it is on August 20th
But
There are a few clues though
Saying that there's going to be
It's a wooden ship wheel
And a silhouette of a woman
In a weird pose
So
There's a few people who think
That there's going to be
A
PSO
But
PSO
Like
A new fantasy czar
Fantasy star roleplay game
Fantasy czar
That's set in the
Future Russia
In outer space
No
But
This to speculation they really pulled it out
Of some HTML code
AKA their ass
So that's it
Now Kyria Chronicles 2 or something
But I guess we already know about that
Or I'm thinking if they've got
A big captains wheel
What about Eternal Arcadia
That was out on Dreamcast
Where you had the air pirate ships
Wow that's obscure
That's not obscure I haven't
I never
Doesn't mean anything
Look folks go look at the
Video of the vault on YouTube
And tell me she does not have some obscure shit
The lady pulls out a dish
That came with a video game at some point I kid you not
Or perhaps
That's obscure
It's a new party game collection
Sonic vs the Somalia pirates
No
Good times
No
Very cool
Alright
I hate you Spyler
Oh yeah that's right it came out as Skies of Arcadia
Over here or whatever
I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name
Oh now Skies of Arcadia
I've heard of that okay
I get it now
Not obscure
Alright let's get back to some more gaming news Loki
Alright
Well
There's some interesting stuff that they were
Showing off this week for Guitar Hero 5
Including
That much like the Wii version
Where you can throw in your own Miis
Although that version kinda
Eh the Miis thing's kinda lame
The Xbox
Avatars will now be able to be featured
In your Xbox 360 version
Of Guitar Hero 5
To rock out I guess on stage
Which is
Interesting
And on top of that
Also Guitar Hero
Van Halen this week got its full
Track list
Some people
Are less excited about it
Um
Eh
Anyways
Some of the tracks feature
Are featured
In the game I guess
Jump, Hot for Teacher
Let's see
Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls
Panama
That's gonna be awesome
Pretty Woman
So This is Love
Unchained and You Really Got Me
Of course those are all Van Halen tracks
Other artists featured in the game
As well
Billy Idol, White Wedding
Um
Foreigner with Devil Vision
Third Eye Blind, Semi Charmed Life
The Offspring, Pretty Fly
For A White Guy
Do do do do do do do do
Queen, I Want It All
Lain Cravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead
Man just when I think
Like a song list kinda blows
I'm not really interested. They have to go in and throw in a Queen track
That suddenly takes it from Suck to
Awesome. Which by the way
Sing Star Queen is apparently out now
And I'm surprised I don't already own it
It's not out yet. I thought it came out this week
Oh yeah that's right they changed the date I forgot about that
It like got bumped up or something
I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin though
Cause Sing Star games usually end up in the discount bin
In about a month
Yeah
So yeah
All those tracks and you know
Of course those two stories just
Happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games
And not for any other reason at all
Of course not
Cause that would be purely hypothetical
Now I was
In South Lake Tahoe this weekend
And at the basement of one of their
Casinos there, Harvey's
They have a Cabo Wabo
And that was kind of a fun place to go
Cause you get good drinks and so forth
You know who started that?
Somebody that's missing from Guitar Hero
Exactly
So I was gonna say I saw some
Well I didn't see him there but I saw someone this week
That I'm not gonna see in this game
Sammy Hagar
I was gonna
I was gonna also say though
That
The game is scheduled
To come out
Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd
For most people
That seems way pushed back from what we were originally
It is way pushed back
Interesting
It is interesting now isn't it
Hypothetically speaking
Very interesting
Just before Christmas
Just before Christmas
The Christmas will come early for some
Guitar Hero faithful
Hypothetically
Anyhow hey one thing that's not hypothetical
This is fact ladies and gentlemen
Facebook is now integrated with the DSI
The whole switch happened on
I think it was the 3rd of August
When this all went down
But I know I've been seeing it show up on my
Friend feed on Facebook
None of my real life friends
Have it but some of the OLR listeners
Have me friended on Facebook and some of them are using it
So you know here's the thing
The DSI Facebook functionality
Is pretty much the same thing with your cell phone
Because when I was on my Tahoe trip
This weekend for anybody that has me friended on Facebook
I was uploading pics for my cell phone
The whole way like I uploaded
Some things and we were stopped in this
This town I can't even remember what it was called
It had a hilarious name it was like
It wasn't pond scum but like pond spring
It was something really silly
We uploaded pictures from there and you know just as we were
On the way there and actually there's some pictures from
Cabo Wabo in there
It's the same thing but with your DSI
You basically just you know instead of your cell phone
It's your DSI but since
The DSI has all the picture
Altering modes on it where you can draw
And have the borders and all the
You know weird distortion pictures
You can upload those
Pictures too which I guess you can't really
Yeah I know
Honestly it's the same functionality
You'd find in a cell phone which
You know whatever okay
More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing
On my Facebook I guess
Not something that has me bouncing off the walls
But I can see where some people find this cool
Especially if you don't have a decent camera
On your cell phone or you like to
Edit pictures as somebody
On my Facebook loves to do because all the pictures
He's posted of himself are all like
Drawn on and mirrored imaged
And all just distorted
But hey
Have fun with it that's what DSI is about
Having fun right? Is there anything else
They could really do with Facebook integration and the
DSI I mean I'm kind of glad it's just this
I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying
So and so is now playing Pokemon
So and so just stop playing
Pokemon because I would block
Those posts from Facebook so fast I mean is there
A lot of other integration the only other
Possibly cool thing I can think of is like an
Interactive high score board like you see this
With like Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games like
So and so just beat your high score
Click here to try and beat it
You know one thing I do like about
Facebook is if you find that shit annoying
There's always a hide button and you can block
Any application and all that stuff
You know Facebook used to be a lot worse but it got a lot
Better so
Anyhow
Just curious if anyone else thinks
That there might be something cool they can add to Facebook
Nope, nope, alright
How about fewer
Invites to
Sorority girl or whatever the
Fuck that is I love sorority life
I quit that so fast
Did you block it? Yes I did
I was going to say because I try not to send like
I try not to let those things go out but sometimes they do
And I only send gifts to people that I know play regularly
I blocked it, I blocked
Farm town, the only thing that I
Play on there are the retarded quizzes
And
The
Pet thing, pet society
I will admit I play Bejeweled Blitz
I play sorority life, I'm level 47
Thank you very much and I play
Farm town now, my boyfriend got me addicted to
Farm town which in reality is
It really is kind of one of the
Dumbest fucking games but
You know what it's something that Jeff really enjoys
To do so I play it to kind of have a friendly
Competition with him although he's so much more addicted than
I am so
But I told him if he likes farm town he really needs to play
Animal Crossing sometime because I think that would be right up his alley
Anyhow
Enough about casual Facebook games
Let's talk more about more video games
Dark Sakura
Well we might have some other
Video game news
How about Braid?
Braid is actually going to
PlayStation Network finally
It's supposed to be
Actually looking for
No they don't have a
Date on it yet
But
They are saying though that
Hopefully
It will be out soon I guess
It seems like a little late
I mean didn't this game come out
Like a year and a half ago or something
Maybe it wasn't that long ago but at least a year ago
Right?
It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network
I mean I guess
You know
Wherever people want to play the game
Let them
The designers make their money however
But it just seems like this game's on
Xbox
This game's on PC
Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN
I have no interest in rebuying the game that's for sure
Yeah but there's people who have PS3s
That don't have an Xbox 360
Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since
Or have a PC
That they could download the game on
But I guess not everybody likes to game on PC
I would be more interested in this if there was like
More levels or something
But I just, to be honest
I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid
Without kind of dumbing it up
Because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool
Is the storyline
Which is very finely contained to those episodes
I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage
Or anything like that
I think it is what it is
And new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough
That's for sure
Frisbee brings up an interesting point
Talking about Facebook in our chatroom
chat.orangestory.com
I'm sorry, not Facebook, but the DSi
Remember when the DS was going to have
VoIP at hotspots?
Whatever happened to that?
That's a good question. Remember they demoed that at E3 one year?
The Skype type thing on the DS?
Why did that suddenly go away?
Anyone know?
I think they just integrated it into some games
To know how they have voice chat
And like certain games
Like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that
You can do voice chat with the DS
I think that's what it came down to
Hmm
That's what some folks in chat are saying
EasyHP in chat says it's called
Pokemon voice chat
Probably because the DS isn't that powerful
Shit, it can't really run a web browser
That well without an expansion card
It has no real RAM in it
It has a few megs of RAM
But that's about it
I would think it would be very tough for it to
Process that kind of stuff
I don't know
I'm very interested to see
What Nintendo's next handheld
Is going to be like
And I bet we see it in about three years
I'm very curious to see
Maybe even two
I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit
It'll be GameCube graphics
We'll see
It makes sense, it's the progression
That's true
I wouldn't mind a portable type F0 though
That's for sure
And yeah, I agree with Frisbee in chat
I'll just use Skype
Alright, a few more stories
And we're going to get to the mailbag tonight
Loki
Yes, well unfortunately
For Starcraft fans
You're going to have to wait a bit longer
Yes, Starcraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010
And that makes a lot of people sad
And you won't be able to buy the trilogy
Or at least the first entry in the trilogy
That's still annoying
The fact that they got rid of LAN
And it's still being sold as a trilogy
Instead of all three things being part of one game
Huh, that sounds like an Activision move to me
I'll get you to buy the game three times
Well what's also kind of sucky about this
Is the fact that everything is fucking getting delayed to 2010
There's tons of games
Bioshock 2 got delayed to 2010, right?
There's been other games
It seems like what's left this year?
Well they want to announce a lot of games
It's just not already
Well they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter
First off they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines in 2
It just gets buried under everything that comes out
And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2
Because they don't want to release a game out around the same time
Because they'll just get ignored
And
I don't know, I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out
But at the same time
I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff
Like Kane & Lynch 2
Stuff like that
I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year
Because
I don't know, they just weren't ready yet
Hmm
Alright
Well hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009
You're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet
But only if you were one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omega-Thon
The game Halo 3 ODST
Is going to show up in round 3
Of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omega-Thon
The other games
Mario Kart Wii is round 1's game
Round 2 is Bookworm Adventures
Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game
They don't know what game it is yet
But speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet
Like Rock Band Beatles
Or DJ Hero
And round 5 will be Connect 4
The final round, as always, is a mystery game
That will probably be either something new
Or something really old
So
Like Epic Pong type of thing
They've already done that
What were the games they did last year?
I don't even remember
The Omega-Thon stuff from past
I think Combat was one year, I remember that
Combat was one year, Pong was one year
They did Halo 3 one year
Um
I don't remember what was last year
I think we were broadcasting
Versus Excitebike was the last game last year
That's right
I remember now
So by the way
Speaking of Penny Arcade Expo
Sadly, it looks like no one from OLR is going
Loki, obviously, is not going to be able to go
Dark Sakura
Has not been planning on going
I was kind of on the fence
Right now, I'm a real heavy no on PAX
If something comes up
Like a really great opportunity in the next few days
Um
Then I'll change my mind
But right now, there's just so much other stuff going on
I just think there's other stuff I can do
Besides Penny Arcade Expo
There's others up there and so forth
But I'll just have to try again next year
Someone must pay for me, I'll go
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen
And here's the other thing
I am still aiming for
And this should be clear
The one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year
Is because I am still definitely
Set on going with that
Unless something happens to PAX Boston next year
Which I know is weird
Because I'm on the West Coast
But I do want to go visit the East Coast
With all the appointments and time off
I've been taking during the pregnancy
And last week and stuff
I've just run out of
Oh, and this week, I've taken the whole week off
I've run out of my paid time off
Sure, sure
New trips for a few years
So
Yeah, that's my plan
Again, if there's this huge opportunity
For OLR, all games that I've heard
I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting
Again this year or anything
I think Bobby was heading all that up last year
And I think he's trying to do something
For at least his show this year
But I don't know if it's going to be as big as last year
And you have to remember guys
As I think some of us thought might happen
E3 did pull some of us away
And our money and time
That we were able to spend on PAX last year
There it is
Alright, but I am still hoping for PAX Boston
We'll see
But if you're going to PAX online, don't get me wrong
PAX is a fun con
Just because we're not going
I don't want people to get the wrong impression
It's just economy and so forth
The reasons why we're not going
But PAX is a fun con
If you just want to sit around and geek out
That's the best way I could describe PAX
Just geek out all weekend long
It's like an anime convention with a whole lot of games
Yeah, it's cool
I do want to go again
That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston
Because then it won't only be like
OMG PAX, but OMG
I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before
And I have friends there, so
Cool
What we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our
Email bag, and I'm sure the mail bag
Is busting at the seams this week
Because we haven't been on in a little while
I don't know, I think it's just average size
What are you doing over there?
You got a dude standing in his underwear
On The Sims, what are you doing?
It's a bathing suit, he's in a Speedo
Look, just the one problem
It looks like tighty whities from back here
Well, I think that they were based off
The same model, but
Wait, this doesn't answer the question
What are you doing
Designing a naked dude?
He's not naked
Half naked
I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in
You should have seen what I had him in
Here, here's what I had him in before
Yes
This makes for great radio, it's alright
I've seen these little short things before
That's what he was in before
He can stay in those, fine
No, I don't care, I just think it's funny
That I look over there and then suddenly
Yes, this is Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock
But the problem is that I
Changed out the default skin
So he's like extra buff now
And besides that, the underwear is better
Alright, let's
Go to the mail bag
You can go to orangeonsradio.com if you want to send us some emails
So, the first email
Duh duh duh
I'm trying to go in chronological order
But, um, this comes from
Okay, I'm really not gonna read the explanation
Of the guy's name
So, um, I apologize for fucking up your last show
I accidentally sent all my
Contacts that message
Do not hate me, I hate spam too
My email is filled with spam
As for the Skype shit, I was
Using my PSP on a horrible connection
I am in the market for a computer
This is one, isn't it? I remember reading this
Okay, that's who it is
Fuck Windows Vista
Do you know any good operating systems?
Yes, Linux Mint, it's free
Windows 7 is gonna be better than Vista
Linux Mint is better than it all
Um, next
And he sent a couple by accident
So I am just going to read the one
That looked like it made the most sense
Um, hey, O.L.R.
All I wanted to say
That almost all the game purchases I've made
I've recently made have either been
Talked about or recommended on your show
And I love them all
So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose
And it is this
Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well
Alive for the
Now old school gaming
And I would like to expand my gaming horizon
To include some old school stuff
So I was just wondering if you guys had
A good starter console for someone like me
Thanks guys, Mike V
13 years old?
13 Dude, I think
We had a listener that claims to be our youngest
Listener at 14, I think he just got beat
Sorry dude
Just pick up one of those, um
You know, used
I would say, like, if I have the Famicom
Um, NES
Systems that are kind of third party now
You can pick up, pick up one of those
Go to, like, one of your youth game shops
Or even, I was reading
There's a lot of people that found pretty good deals
At thrift stores and stuff, you can find some old consoles
I actually found
Discontinued games at thrift stores, like I found
Of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase
And Casey Munchkin
For the, uh, Odyssey 2
Wow
Or, you know, Dark Tetsuya makes a good point
Get the Wii
Or the Virtual Console
It's a pretty faithful recreation
Of the original stuff
Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13
I feel so old because that means I would have been
18 when he was born, oh my god
But, uh, Super Nintendo
If you missed out, I mean
Honestly, Super Nintendo, I don't think has ever
Been beaten in terms of great consoles
Super Nintendo was the best
Gaming console, purely 100%
Game console, Super Nintendo
Was the best gaming console they ever made
If you're gonna start anywhere, I say start there
Actually...
If you wanna start where we started, go to Atari 2600
But if you wanna just jump to the good shit
The Genesis, though, did have better versions
Of some games, like the copy of Mortal Combat
Well, Mortal Combat 2
And, um, Samurai Shodown
That was on Genesis for better
Super Nintendo did have a few better
Versions, like, um, Super Street Fighter 2
I thought was better on Super Nintendo
Um, the other, and this is
Of course, just for sampling purposes
You know, disclaimer, disclaimer
Disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try
Um, GameTap, or
You know, Zofar's Domain
But, I actually
The Wii's gonna be your best bet
You know, you can sample the
Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world
Neo Geo, you know
Go that way
That's actually not a bad recommendation
If you do wanna go all the way back to some of the
2600 games that we grew up on
Things like Adventure, Kaboom, uh
Keystone Kingdom, Kangaroo
Popeye, you know, you wanna go back to the
Really old school stuff, um, GameTap
Does actually have a lot of Atari 2600 in their
Library, I was actually playing, believe it or not
A couple weeks ago, I was playing Sword Quest
Cool, well, another thing too
Valve
The Steam Clan, you know, if you're
They don't have a lot of old
School stuff, but they have the old PC
Stuff that we played
Some of it, some of the old LucasArt stuff
Oh, yeah, I'll give you that, like, I just downloaded
Loom for five bucks, I'll give you that
I still wanna go buy
The TurboGrafx version that's 35
At a local store, but, hey
But, um
You know, and if you want a
List of actual games
Um
Go ahead and, go ahead and
Sample the different systems, see what you think
It would help to know what kind of games you're into
Like, are you liking the old school RPGs?
Are you liking the very simple things
On the Atari, cause you have the older
RPGs, you're gonna wanna go with the SNES
These arcade games were very much
All about repetition
Look at some of the greatest video games of all time
They came out of the 80s, Pac-Man
That board never frickin' changed
The whole time
Until it degraded
Donkey Kong, basically a loop of the same
What, three screens, right?
Three with the, um, the Pie Factory
The Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one
Yeah, play the one with the Pie Factory
You're not really playing Donkey Kong
Play the Kill Screen
Yeah
Beat What's-His-Face, Billy What's-His-Face
Yeah
You know what, that's what I'd like to see
Our young 13 year old listener accomplish
Make it a life goal to
Beat some of these scores on these 80s games
But if you're into repetition games, go for the
Old games from the Atari 2600
I know repetition often sounds like a bad thing
But it's not, I mean, Bejeweled is kind of
A repetitive game, you know, you realize
A game like Bejeweled could've been made on the Atari
2600, there's no reason that
Game could not have been made on the Atari 2600
Um, seriously, it wouldn't be as pretty, but hey
No, it wouldn't be as nice looking, it probably wouldn't have
Caught on back then, but
That's totally a game that I could've seen back in the day
Okay
Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay
Um,
Hi all, as per usual, I thought
That I'd write in with a few topics
First off, I'd like to get some opinions
On an ongoing debate that I've been having
With a neighbor. You see, my neighbor
Is a rabid, no, not in the literal sense
If not fanatical Beatles fan
I don't know anyone like that, do I?
Tease, tease, tease
I mean, it's to the point that I'm
Surprised he hasn't already built an
Altar enshrined to them and started a Beatles
Cult. The debate specifically
Centers around whether or not the Beatles
Right band game should be made or not
My neighbor's attitude or position, if you
Will, is that it shouldn't be made at all
To do so would essentially
Be sacrilege. He believes that the band
Is something special and not a game
And he further continually states
That you had to be there
I, I
I assume this is an older neighbor
Then, um, I continually remind
Him that the Beatles are a band, not the
Second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not
The game gets made
Lies with the band, the copyright
Owners of their music and
EA, and really, he has
A very rare say. All he can do is decide
Whether or not to buy the game. I tell him that
Even though the band may enjoy
Uh, enjoy playing music
Ultimately, they, as well as
Just about any band out there, have three goals
Become famous, become rich, and get laid
I don't think so
You need to remember this, too, is that
And this is something to tell your neighbor, is that
At E3, let's not forget
Paul McCartney
Ringo Starr
Yoko Ono
To Harrison's wife, sorry, I forget her name
They all came out on stage
In support of this game
Yeah, so
The end, sorry
Yeah, tell your neighbor that
Um, I ask him that if he were in the Beatles
Would he have turned down buttloads of money
That EA was shelling out to make the game
Every time he tries to say he would have
I outright call on the bullshit answer
Well, you know
There are people who
Um
Who actually
Are really talented
Musicians who are
In bands for the purpose
Of enjoying their music
That they play
These are, now maybe they don't all become
Famous, maybe they have a small
Following, but the first reason
That I think anyone
If anyone has any integrity
And wants to get into music
Is because they love it
You know
Can I read these real quick?
Marissa Cungusto has a great comment
My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent
With their image or message
But if it creates new fans, cool
And yeah, especially when we talk about generation
And this whole thing, you know
Certainly the 13 year old who emailed us before
Wasn't around when the Beatles
Were big, but you know
I wasn't around when the Beatles were big
But I can appreciate their music through things like this
But I like this too
Geekboy2424 says
Yoko the neighbor will go crazy
Good point, leave Yoko out of that story
Don't say Yoko came out on stage
At any rate though
I don't think that
I think it's a generalization to say
That people
Get in a band to be famous
Rich and get laid
Seriously, I think that
The first thing
And this is honestly
Because I've done things
With groups before, like I was in a jazz band
And I played in a jazz band
We didn't get paid for shit
I mean, they maybe gave us some gas money
But we did it because it was something that we loved to do
That you know
You like getting the crowd into it
Knowing that you're sort of evoking
That emotional response
And you know, the people that you're performing for
I think that's a big thing
It's a massive adrenaline rush
You know, I think that the
The people who I think
They've had staying power
The people that love what they do
In the end, that's honestly what I think
Yeah, usually these bands
That are created to get laid
Are the ones that break up after one album
Yeah
Next area here
This may be old news to the three of you
But for the sake of other listeners
I thought I'd throw this out there especially
For those who own both the 360
As well as the PS3
Apparently if you have an external
32 with miscellaneous media on it
Music Fodios, whatever
The HDD will work
On both systems
This does not mean you can play system specific
DLC or downloadable games
On the other system, it just means that you can
Use the other media on both systems
I discovered that my external hard drive
Worked on my 360 last week
Last weekend, shortly after the last show
Typically I use them on my PS3
Finally
As per usual
I hear that as per usual
It makes me think of Eddie Izzard
We've left you a huge fuck off horse
As per usual
Sorry
I thought I'd end this email with some of my
Visual recommendations from the video section
Of the PSN store
This week I have three recommendations
Season 1 of the original Transformer series from the 80s
Woohoo!
Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan
And centers around two warring clans
Of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8
Okay
The rest 4, 5, and 6
In limbo
With these selections, you can't go wrong
Zarkon ate them
As they are all pretty good
Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email
It's appreciated, this email is brought to you by Florida
The Lemp Wengus of America
Who's that from?
MrSpazzinator
Is that it, or we got more?
Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me
Huh
The band that was formed mostly to get laid
Was poisoned
And they were very successful
That guy's still getting laid
Seriously
Good point
He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid
This comes
Okay
I originally intended this message to be
A Rob I miss you
And wow type of thing
And then I came to the website to see the
OLR's template
I hope on hiatus
Say I think so
I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things
Are well with everyone
Guess I'll have to wait and see
Oh and Rob, I do miss seeing you and well
Maybe we can play together again sometime
Your old pally
Ghoulie
Nintinctus
99
Oh I see
It's 99 cents without vowels
Yep
You know I have my reasons
For leaving wow and
I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO
I'll be in Final Fantasy 14 for sure
For sure, no doubt
At least when it first comes out
I'm gonna have to play it for the first month
Just to see
Whether it goes beyond that I don't know
Just you know wow I think I just finally
You know you play something for so long
You just finally like I just don't have it in me anymore
Rob with two B's
Our dear friend who always links me to informative
Articles
Linked a couple that were on
Game politics
One of them saying that video games
Are blamed for low vitamin D
In children
Because they're not going out in the sun enough
I would suppose so
And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure
I
Think that really it's more
For the high blood pressure I would really think that it's
More of the
Not getting out and getting enough exercise
Sort of thing
And also low vitamin D
Exactly you said kids aren't getting enough sunlight
But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things
And I don't watch Oprah but it was on in the waiting room
Of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed
Is that
Most people
Especially in America
And in big cities
Are very vitamin D deficient
Because of sunblock
I actually
I'm not allowed to use sunblock because I
Am very vitamin D deficient myself
I have to use sunblock
Or I'll have to take supplements or something
If I'm lacking it
What they say is that everyone should have
15 minutes of
Unfiltered sunlight
15 minutes a day
I can handle that if I wear a hat
Well you can put it on your face
I still use my makeup past sunblock
In and on my face
But I um
I can be outside for like
Intense periods of time
And even then I only really wear an SPF 15
Because I'm that
I was pretty on the dangerous side of low
I always wear like an SPF 70
But that's only when I'm going to be out all day
Disneyland
Or Great America
It's just dumb not to do that
Well the way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies
Is the synthesis is made with vitamin A
And UV radiation
Sunlight
Not
I'm kidding
What are we talking about I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention
Like breakfast cereal
That's why you eat special K because you get lots of vitamins in it remember
Drink fortified milk
Eat your Wheaties
I would love to drink the vitamin D milk
You can't by the way supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish
What are the vitamins
Since I'm going to ask
Totally tangent that you can get too much of
Like C you can never get enough vitamin C
Like you know if you get too much you go
You peep it out
Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones
Or is there a limit
I know zinc has a danger
Your minerals will have a limit
Iron, zinc and all that
With vitamins actually you can have an overdose
Of niacin but it takes a long time
To build up
Beta carotene turns your skin orange
I did that when I was 2 true story
When I was 2 years old I had my parents I dated in the ER
What was your name on the Partridge Family
Susan Day
The Partridge Family
Come on get happy
She ate so many carrots
Because that's all she ate
That she had a build up of beta carotene in her system
But you know the yellow rice
That they passed out internationally
Is actually beta carotene fortified
Because of deficiencies in those areas
I'm just saying
There's just certain
You know me
She's not a doctor
I'm a big nutrition nerd
You know even if I don't even follow my own advice
All the time I still know it
Because I worked at GNC like freaking forever
So I had to be able to warn people
You know because I'm not one of those idiots
Who just says oh you can take it you're fine
Have some ephedra with your hypertension
No you won't have a heart attack
Anyway
So to go ahead and back to the rest of the email
Two back to back articles on game politics
Link two different studies blaming
The health of defects of children on video games
We all know how ridiculous that is
To put it in perspective
To a non-game player
The claims are also stating
These two things are also caused by video games
One playing video games reduces
Incidence of skin cancer
That's back to the sun
Two playing video games reduces
Bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries
Well duh
It sounds even worse
When you talk about the benefits
Of video games benefits in quotes
It points out that the events
Playing video games and ailments
Very independently of each other
Silly pseudo-scientists
It's just a bunch of ridiculousness
Also
Playing video games gives you
A rash
Kidding. Itchy
Last email
Hey O.L.R. Crew
Hey
Hey
A.C.H.P here
I got a joke for you
Was it Kelly? Hey
No what do gay horses eat?
Hey
We are the Supreme Court
Alright read the damn email
I'll put the mic down I promise
Okay
See you heard it. That was Rob putting down the mic
A.C.H.P here
First of all I'm glad that
Where's the duct tape? Let's just tape his hands together
First of all I'm glad that my last email
Was a gold star
Now I doubt this one
Will earn similar acclaim
But I want to relate to you all briefly
A synopsis of the way
Way off broadway DDR musical I came across
On the internet. What?
And hopefully it will distribute you all as much as it did me
Well it got a let from me
Stop me if you've heard this one
Long story short there's a guy named
Moonbeam Funk which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first
Who carries around
A fetus in a jar on his belt
And starts a dance revolution in the city
Where dancing is prohibited
Wasn't that Footloose?
Anyway
He is joined by a small child named
Small Child
And Small Child's
Prostitute Sister Trampoline Sally
Moonbeam is about to
Unleash a dance move called
The Flaming Rooster
But it is stopped by a policeman who
Wears kilts
The revolution disbands Moonbeam Funk
Leaves and comes back later to have
Sex with Trampoline Sally after performing
The Flaming Rooster
Kills her during sex and ends up in a
Catastrophic level 9 dance off
See what they did there?
Ordered by a judge where he faces off against
Jacquece who loved Trampoline Sally
That had his legs broken by the police
However Trampoline Sally's ghost gives
Jacquece dancer juice
And he wins despite having broken legs
Okay I can't take it
I picked the mic up
Moonbeam Funk returns to his home
Planet using gravity shoes
You can't make this stuff up
This is somewhere between
Camp that they know as
Camp and the most pretentious
Goddamn modern art bullshit
I've ever heard of in my life
Remember they made a DDR movie
One time in Japan
Whatever, stop trying to make a movie
Out of DDR, they are all stupid
Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan
No it wasn't
There's more
I remember that, sorry I just remembered how hilarious
That movie was
Now while this may still seem
Still sound like the best musical ever
Bullshit
The one thing
It could do to ruin itself
More than it already had it did
They didn't use Tack
They didn't use B4U
They didn't use Oh just name of the money artists
They didn't use them
No they used DDR, Disney's rave music
Yes, Zippity Doo Da and Chim Chim Cheree
And Night of Fire
I left out a lot of things but you can check out the article
At vjarmy.com
I'll go ahead and read it
I'm actually going to put it in the chatroom
But it's vjarmy.com
Slash archive slash 2008
Slash 12 slash bucket of
Tears dot PHP
And that's all
Separated by an underscore
For details
The best word I can think of to describe this play
Sounds like is gay-tarded
I mean that's really what it sounds like
Like you know you don't want to say that's gay
Because that's offensive, you don't want to say that's retarded
Because that's actually really offensive too
So I'm going to make up a new word
So when it's a new word it wouldn't be offensive to either group
I still like my word, but-tard
But-tard?
I've been using that for years
So this play sounds completely gay-tarded
Is what it sounds like
I can't fathom
Paying money
New York City theater can sometimes be expensive
Like how much money do they want for this?
I don't know
Wow, I mean anybody can do theater
It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make
That's pretty nasty
Hopefully this email isn't too long
To make it to the show
Because I think a lot of old fans of DDR
Will get a laugh
Or at least a facepalm out of this
I got both
Long live DDR EZHP
That's for $20 says Rama
No thank you
That's $20 I could spend on like
Cocaine or something
You know, like
And I could probably see the same things
We did get a couple more emails
Don't do drugs kids
We also did get a couple more emails
But one's for Loki and one of them we just got
So I'll read it next week
Winners don't use drugs folks
Unless you're on steroids
And are on the Chinese swim team
If you would like to send us an email
And the folks in chat are pointing out
It's way off Broadway
As in way way way off Broadway
Like it's in Staten Island
That's how far off Broadway it is
I don't know if that's true or not
A couple more stories for you guys
And then your calls on the skype line
At 877-GAME-OLR
Loki
So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion
That's gonna actually
Build upon
Some new modes here
Wrecking Crew mode
Which features different challenges
Including
I guess different combinations of
Weapons
Backpack settings
And sub modes
Basically you just destroy as much crap as possible
And then you get put on leaderboards and whatnot
They've added some more levels
For that
I guess the 4 pre-order bonus levels
That everybody got
That are pre-ordered in game
Now are unlocked for everybody
Including 10 more levels as well
And they've added
Weapon and backpack disabling in multiplayer
If you feel like doing that
XP multiplayer for matchmaking
Playlists
Double XP playlists are now possible
Or deposits
On the mini-map
And support for upcoming
Download content as well
And then other fixes
They've done
Just some other glitches
That they were running into
Drops in multiplayer
Certain ties not being recorded
In leaderboards and whatnot
So overall
A pretty nice update
But
I still haven't played this game yet
And that makes me really sad
Is this a game that's very popular?
Are there a lot of people playing this?
This isn't usually the type of game that's up my alley
It's kind of popular
It's like Saints Row set on Mars
But you can blow up everything
Sounds good to me
I always like blowing things up
Saints Row set on Mars
That's a really good way of describing it
Well I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row
But it's the same developer
And it's that open world kind of feel to it
I think it's a little bit more linear
This game
But it looks fun
Interesting
And of course when I hear Wrecking Crew mode
I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew
Remember that?
It was crap
Woot explosion says Missy in chat
Absolutely
Alright let's go on to one more story here tonight
And then we're going to open up our skypelines at 877-GAME-OLR
And this story has to do with porn
That's right
DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan
They are going to be bringing on demand
Blu-ray quality
HD adult movies to the Playstation 3
Woohoo
Console wars over
That's right
Didn't I say that
The system that gets porn first would win?
No that was HD DVD
And Blu-ray wasn't it?
I don't remember
Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show
The problem with that is they adopted both
Anyway
You do have to have a broadband connection
An HDMI cable of course if you want the high def
And of course a Playstation 3
You will download the movies for a fee
You go onto this dmm.tv Blu-ray website
And then you can search for titles by
Actress, keyword, what have you
So if you've ever wanted to see
Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators
There you go, you can watch that on
Playstation 3 in full
High definition, congratulations
Now what's kind of interesting about that
It's kind of bypassed Sony somehow
It sounds like you're logging into their website
And downloading them to your PS3 or something
Isn't that what it sounds like to you?
This can't be sponsored by Sony
This must be using the web browser
And some type of backdoor or something
Pun intended
It might be downloading
Video files to your PS3 or something like that
Or downloading them to your PC
So you can watch them on your PS3
I don't know
Maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there
Who knows
Vidpower calls this 1080p-ness
Ba-dum-bum
God I love the listeners
Don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?
At least all the ones I've ever seen
Of course I always saw the funny ones
Like Final Fuck X and all that
Where they did blur it out
Yeah they're all blurred out
Unless it's softcore
It's just all the Vash P and stuff gets blurred out
SSJ100Matt says
All we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples
We got a bunch of comedians
Tonight
Oh god this is awful I'm reading that article by the way
D5T is calling
Dot fuck apparently
Instead of dot hack there's a
Porn called dot fuck
That's funny
Oh my gosh
You know what?
Whatever
Something I think
I don't know do I want to go on a tangent?
Why not? We have plenty of time
We're going to be opening up the skype line soon anyway
Something to remember
Everybody has sex
That's how we get here
Granted I realize that some people define themselves
As asexual
Which means you don't really
Care for sex
But I'm still assuming that at one point or another
You've tried it
Everybody has sex
So what's the big deal at some point
I mean if you're the 13 year old listening
You should not be having sex yet
According to Oprah
You probably already are
You know what?
I don't have
That same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week
For better health
I don't have a problem admitting
I was 20 so you know
By Oprah I would be a late bloomer
And I know there's people that wait even longer than that
I was 30, 35, 40
That's fine
But I'm saying at some point
This is not a spiel about virginity
My spiel is about everybody
Has sex
Or thinks about having sex
So why is porn
Such a big taboo, big deal thing
I mean you know
They should just get over it and put porn there
We're in a country that was founded by Puritans
Because they have 100 masturbators
In that film
That's just way too much
Masturbating
And besides
You own a PS3
If you're interested in this
Therefore you have access to the internet
Therefore you have access to U-Porn
And many other porn alternatives
That are free
Why would you pay for porn
When you can get it for free
Do you have a day on chat that says
I was 21
My cousin is almost 25
And she's still a virgin
Nothing wrong with that, but she probably thinks about it
I mean she probably still thinks
That doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex
Doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn
In fact
The other day we were
For the hell of it, just for fun
Shits and giggles I guess
We decided to watch the triple x parody of
Friends
And I can tell you it was awful
What was it called, fucks?
No, frenzy triple x parody
It's ridiculous, none of the characters look like
The other characters from the show
And they're really exaggerated
As far as how they act
It's just so ridiculous, but it was funny
Did somebody at some point
Look at one of the girls and go
How you doin?
No, unfortunately no they didn't
But the woman's name was Monika instead of Monica
Cause of course they have to do that
I love porn parodies so much
They're so funny
I still like the Ali McFeel one
I liked Beaver and Buttface
I haven't seen that one
They have Office
Seriously, all the TV shows now
Are parodies, Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek
The best line I've ever heard
In a porno was in Beaver and Buttface
Huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something
Laughing
That's awful
Laughing
And on that note, let's open up the phone lines
1877-GAME-OLR
Our username on skype
Orange Lounge Radio
There we go, we're off the Do Not Disturb mode now
Laughing
1877-GAME-OLR
Our username on skype
We will take calls here tonight
And look, we're already ringing
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
This is Ronman, I wanna know
When did this become Porn Lounge Radio?
You know what, it's been a few weeks
We have a lot of pent up energy
What can we say, what's on your mind tonight?
Yeah, I can see that
Before I start
Loki, just because the porn is free
Doesn't mean it's that good
Just so you know
You're just not looking hard enough
I look more to my fair share
Okay, I look more than anybody else
In the chat room, okay?
Laughing
But um, the reason why I called
Is to make a comment about the whole
Best Buy price matching
Thingamabobber here
Yeah, pretty
It pretty much did still make their money
How so?
Alright, I used to work for Best Buy
And the discounts at the time were great
5% above retail core
They paid for it
I bought a cable for my PS2
That retailed for $9.99
I paid $1.72 for it
Interesting
I mean
Even if they take a $5 loss off the games
They're still going to make the money back
Off of the accessories on the games
Accessories for the consoles
Accessories for home theater
The electronics, everything
That's absolutely not true
I mean, yes, it's true in the long run
They're going to cost average that stuff
Across all the different lines
That they carry
That's why they can take a loss on games
And still be fine because they mark up everything else
And it just averages out
But if you're looking at strictly games
I mean, okay, let's say
The average Xbox 360 game
Is $48
Their cost
And they may get it cheaper
It's roughly the high 40's though
Is what they're paying for
And yes, there is a markup there
And yeah, if they drop it down $5
They're not really losing a lot of money
So, I mean, they could do it
And it's definitely possible
That the margin on accessories is about 20%
On average, if not more than that
But, um
Yeah, I mean, I guess there is
They won't really be losing
Out a lot
But it could get ridiculous
Especially if they're dropping the prices
Of used games at GameStop or whatever
And they continually do this
I don't know, I don't see this program being very successful
I mean, it's going to be successful
But not their benefit, I guess
Well, it depends
I mean, if they do this
They probably won't be having to do their
Fire sales that they have on games
Like every 8 or 9 months, give or take
Hmm
I guess we'll see
Do you really think, though
They're going to expand it past this Utah store
I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking
Honestly
I don't think so
And if they do
It probably won't hit New York City
Case in point, like back in March
The blowout sale on anime
50% off
First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City
To see if I can find it
None of the stores in the five boroughs
Were participating
I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for
Out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth
That's right, something we sometimes forget
Is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions
That they don't necessarily have to participate
Mmhmm
Very interesting
Alright, well any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Rama
Um
The Screensavers rocked
The Off-Broadway DDR musical
Was way, way off-Broadway
It was around the corner from where you saw the Rocky Horror
Picture show when you came to New York that time
And according to Japanese porn laws
They're not allowed to show that type of stuff
But you can still find uncensored
Stuff
Interesting, huh? Yep
Alright, well thank you very much for the call, Rama
No problem, take care fellas
Love you, Jamie
Bye-bye
1877 game OLR
username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio
Who's this?
Hello?
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Uh, Deathwishing
Hi, Deathwishing, we can hear the speakers a little bit
Matt, I want to turn them down, what's on your mind?
Yeah, sorry
It's okay, we'll forgive you this once, what's up?
Well, thanks for making me not be able to sleep tonight
With all the porn talk
That's what we do here
Scarring listeners for life
Hey, look, we've got like three weeks to make up for it
I don't know, but did you guys hear about
How they're raising prices on like
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
And like Britain and stuff, from what I heard
I haven't heard about this
I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus
I heard about it
Are they doing it here also? Because I think they did
No, it's still 60 bucks
Because I felt like with the
I pre-ordered normally collector's editions
Like 70 bucks and this time it was like 80
Well, not all collector's editions
Are 70 dollars either
Yeah, because I saw like they're raising the price
Way up and it's just like
I don't know, kind of not right
People care about this, but no one gave a crap about
The Wii version of Guitar Hero
Being 10 dollars more here
Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like 40 or 50 dollars
More than the regular?
The legendary one, the one that came with the cat suit
Well yeah, but this is all
Look at the collector's editions
For Modern Warfare, I mean that's like 200 bucks
Yeah, this is true
And also
I also
I picked up
ChromeHounds
Ah yes
The old school met game that dates back to
When the 360 first came out
And Loki was a big fan of this game
Everyone should pick it up
What do you like about ChromeHounds?
It's like
I've been seeing like
There's these ingenious designs people make
Like of mechs
Like so far
I made one where now I can't like be hit
Like directly
Kind of cheap I guess
Remember when we always talked about how we were gonna have this big blowout
ChromeHounds tournament between us and the Bobby Black Wolf show
And we were never able to do it
Because we couldn't get enough people
Here we are 3 years later, we could have recruited Deathwishing
For our team and now just
A distant memory
Before I
It's not crap, shut up
I wanted to get it because it was like
Armored Core
And then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether
The problem with the game was
It was too slow
Armored Core is very quick
And it's a mech fighting game very similar to
ChromeHounds, but it's a lot faster
It's a lot more faster paced
ChromeHounds is just slow
Slow, slow
What type of person did you play?
I played a four legged mech
That's why
Four legs are slow
Well I wanted a lot of weapons on there
You could have used chicken legs
The most important thing to Loki
Is firepower
Clearly, I mean I've never even watched him play
ChromeHounds, but I could just tell
Not necessarily
It was trying to be more all around
That's what I was trying to do
You can't be all around, you gotta specialize either
Close up or far away
That's the strategy before you build
Well, Deathwishing
Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Please?
No, we're broke, I don't even own it myself
You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast
No, Xbox
Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast
These days
But no online play
You kids and your online play
I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us
Redemption codes for the game
We will send you the first one we get
How's that sound?
There you go, have a good one Deathwishing
Bye bye
Capcom, if you're listening
You can send those to
Rob Roberts
Hey, I haven't even reduced those into the calm line
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku
Hey, Legend of Zaku
Have you checked out the DDR play yet?
Which one?
The one that aired last winter?
No, the one with...
What the hell is this?
The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever
That sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit
The one with Moonbeam Punk
DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly
Yeah, that's the one I was referring to
Because that one was actually late last year
Did you see it?
Unfortunately, no
I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets
I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected
So
I mean, it was shocking
To say the least, the fact that it sold out
You know, for the first few days
It was really hard to get
Even will call for that matter
Was Tom Cruise in it or something?
Like, why did so many people want to see this?
I don't understand
I guess it's because of DDR
That's the only thing I could pretty much boil down
From the fact that it's DDR
Or people thought it was DDR
In a musical
Which is far-fetched
To say the least
Anyways
Where was I about to get to?
I think I mentioned this earlier
But yeah
Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5
From the looks of it
It looks like the
Activation is in a pissing match
Between Konami and seeing
Who can whore out the franchise
Who can whore out their top franchises
The farthest
Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?
Well, many people
I mean, I'm referring to the fact that
There's a lot of hostility towards the fact that
They're just doing it
For the sake of just milking
The franchise even further
That's what I've gotten
In terms of all the comments that I've read
So far regarding this story
Yeah, but you know
It's not like there's a Guitar Hero
Johnny Cash game coming out
This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5
And I mean, ever since the third one
You would have just random
Band characters show up in the game
And I've got to say, you know
It doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash
I think you hit it on the nail right there
After the third one
The series pretty much went downhill
Because by then
Rock Band came out
And the rest was history
The fact that you could add as many
Guest appearances
Many guest stars
Famous people in that game
And make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise
Loki asked a good question
Did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?
Um, I heard
I heard of that game
Is that the one coming out for the DS?
No, it's exactly Guitar Hero
Now it's with more family friendly songs
In other words, it's just another excuse to put out
Another fucking Guitar Hero game
There you go, there you go, Loki, see
Exactly, that's the milking
Of the franchise
Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero main game
Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?
When you have
When you basically have all your clothes
Strewing around in Hot Topic
When you're basically on cereal boxes
When it has nothing, you know
When you have those little minigames
That you find right there
You know, inside the cereal boxes
Right there
I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR
The way Konami has hoarded out with the toys
In both Subway, Burger King
And to an extent
No, milking the franchise is not about merchandising
Milking the franchise is about having
Five releases for the damn series in one year
That is milking
No, I'm sorry, six releases
I can see what Zaku is saying though
Because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games
That have the Guitar Hero name on it
Such as little portable things
You see in Hot Topic or whatever
Well yeah, that sucks too
It gets to the point of prevalence
Where it's just ad nauseam
Rock band keeps the whole thing
Consistent on the fact that
You hear a diverse set of music
In rock band, you don't just hear like
Nothing but, you don't hear
All number one hits
All you hear is just like some schmuck band
From nowhere getting into rock band
Versus a lot of
A lot of A listers on Guitar Hero
Mostly A listers
You know, it's just, Zaku
It's not that I disagree with you
That Activision is milking the shit out of their franchise
I just
But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash
In the game, that's actually the first thing in a long
Time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise
Where I'm like, that's kinda cool
I'm the devil's advocate, alright
Johnny Cash's inclusion into Guitar Hero 5
Would pretty much introduce
Him to a new generation
Of fans, that's one way
That's one argument
That could be made to defend
The milking of the franchise
But then again, with the Beatles
At least it has its own game
And it's done within the
It's done in a way that actually
Brings out the
Culture and the history of the
Beatles
And it actually does a good
Chronology of the whole
Band's history
Through their music
Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5
Packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists
So you don't
Like this because you don't
Think it's respectful enough
They just kinda threw him in there
Yeah, that's pretty much
The case, they just threw him in there to make more
Cash, no pun intended
Now I'm following you
A little better, I get it
You think the milking is coming from the fact
That you're just kinda like, let's just
Reskin, let's just slap
A face of a popular rock star
On this and put it in our game
When somebody like Johnny Cash
Deserves epic
Style treatment
With Guitar Hero
Metallica
They did it differently
It came out to be a good game
Not only had Metallica's music
But it had a whole bunch of other
Metal bands that were probably
Personally picked by the band
For all we know
It's almost the same as
Beatles Rock Band
It wouldn't
Do any
Chronology to the band
It put it to a level where it's
Respectful, it has its own game
It has the
Entire catalog right there of Metallica's
Music, that would be the only
Exception to the
To Activision's milking of the franchise
I guess it'll get worse
Once Van Halen gets their own game
Obviously with the whole Aerosmith thing
It's gonna be very interesting to see
What develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into
2010, but Zaku, I understand
Where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time
I'll let you go
Have a great one, okay Zaku?
Alright, later dude
1877 Game OLR, we can probably squeeze in one more phone call
Oransons Radio is our username on
Skype, we'll go ahead and take one more
Call if you want to give us a call
Do we have any last minute stories tonight?
I think I forgot to put it on the show roll
We have a call coming in
Hi, you're on Oransons Radio, who's this?
Hi, this is Fazinator
Hi Fazinator, what's on your mind tonight?
Two things
Unfortunately that email
That I sent you
Was a couple of weeks old
And I just wanted to update a couple of things
Yeah, first and foremost
It's probably
More directed to Loki
But I just wanted to
Send my condolences
To you and your wife over what happened
Thank you
Yeah, believe it or not
I'm not gonna go into too many
Details
Because they're running late right now
But I definitely know exactly
Where you're coming from
So I can't totally relate
So
Now
As for the second topic
I'm kind of
Surprised you didn't mention it already
But
I don't know if you guys are into
Sports games at all
Or at least the arcade style ones
But
Recently there was an announcement
That EA's
Could be making
I'm sorry, did you start
Something?
Did we lose him?
Oh, I'm still
Here
Echoing
Oh, sorry, I'm not following you
So what type of games were you asking
If we were into? Sports
Sports games?
Yeah, recently
We announced that they're gonna be making
A
Madden arcade
Which is
Could be kind of like
A Maddenized
Version of 3 on 3
NHL arcade which came out
Earlier in the year
So, you know, if you like
Arcade style games
You know, sports games
They may be up really
If not, then
But
Let me explain
My kind of thing with sports games
I've kind of been wanting to try and define
This on the show for a long time because
The interesting thing is that
We're a show that we're not really big on sports games
We don't really talk a lot about them and that's kind of our audience
But I do enjoy
Casual sports
Games, if that makes sense
You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?
I like casual sports games
I don't mind them at all
I kind of
Desire those old school sports games
Like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl
The Blades of Steel
Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into
Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one
The ones today, I have a really hard time
Just kind of pick up and running with
Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them
Like, you know, and hey
For the hardcore sports fan
Cool, you know, more for you
They don't play role playing games that I play, probably
They play their sports games and that's cool
You know, there's a lot for you
But like, I actually think
Probably one good way to define the type of sports game
That I can get into is an arcade
Type of game, insert, quarter, play game
You know, it's just very, very easy
Like NBA Jam, that was one of my
Like, favorite video games like years ago
And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show
That I was ever into a sports game at some point
But some of them, I can get into
But we, yeah, we haven't had
A lot in a long, long time
So EA's trying to
Bring out more casual sports gaming, is what you're saying?
Yeah, basically
Yeah, it's
Well, I
I don't know if you've ever
Tried to release a demo on
Either the 360 or
The PlayStation 3
But last year they, you know, earlier this year
They came out with
An arcade style
Hockey game
Basically, you think NBA Jam
To hockey
Have you ever played that? Do you know the name of it?
It's called
NHL, or, you know, 3-on-3
NHL Arcade
It's basically NBA Jam with hockey
I will have to check that out
I don't think I ever played it
You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kinda like
Ah, sports game pass, sports game pass
But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully
I check it out, I mean, Wii Sports
And Wii Sports Resort, aren't these kind of
Casual sports games in a way, too?
Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking
Video game of the past
10-15 years
Oh yeah, yeah
I can't say I really know much
About the Wii games
Because I really haven't been following them
I don't even
Know what it's like
Most of my knowledge
About video games are about dollar
Two systems
One less
Touch
Before I do, you know, hang up
Yeah
I know if it's something
The 3 of you would be interested in
But there's a free download
On the video section
Of the PlayStation
Network store
It's a
1980s enemy
Pilot
Called Zebra Rider
I can do
Free?
I don't know if that's going to cut you off
Oh no, I can do free
I always like free things
They probably put this up on there to get people to
Check it out because they're probably going to sell the series
Yeah, probably
I haven't seen it yet
But I did download it
So I can't really give an opinion
All right, well
Maybe in a future week
But for now we're going to let you go
Thank you so much for your phone call
And we're going to wrap up
Later, buddy
Casual sports gamer
That would be me
I can't do these harder to get into
With the playbooks and all that stuff
The most playbook I could get into was
Tecmo Bowl
Run, run 2, pass, and pass 2
That's as playbook as I get
All right, anyhow
I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight
Let's get any last minute stories, Loki
Yes, this is interesting
Apparently Konami is relaunching
The Drummania and Guitar Freak series
With Guitar Freak's Drummania
XG
It's going to be in HD
And it's also adding more fret buttons
To the guitar controller
Now with five fret buttons with adding
Yellow and purple
They're also going to have hold notes
Or longer notes just like you'd see in
Other rhythm music games
And also
The open
Open strums are actually going to be
Part of the normal guitar charts
And vibration is added when you're wailing
Drummania
They're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom
And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal
And a second bass pedal
As well
Apparently the new machines
Are going on testing very soon
Some of the new songs include
Hyperjetland
Kaiser Phoenix
Blue Planet and Piranha
All those of course
Looks like in-house artists
And some of the old songs
Returning Vampire Killer
Over the Limit
Highway Star
And some others
Let's see here
They're going to have a new interface
Also beginner mode
And
I guess
There's also
Gameplay being shown in the background
I guess with your note link
Over the top
The machine looks really cool
I don't know, but a little too late
I think
That rumor that the
Xbox Pro system is going away has a little bit
More to back
It up, apparently the new
Arcade packaging that's making
It's way out to stores right now
Seems to be missing the Pro system on
There, so it's just the Pro and the
Arcade and the
Elite system
The rumor is that they're going to be dropping
The price of the Elite system to match
The Pro system and just get rid of
The Pro altogether
Hmm, probably going to happen soon
If it's already on the packaging
Apparently some very
I don't know
Special people have decided
To modify a version
Of Pong that will
Kind of inject a little bit of
Fetish stuff in there
Including a controller that's made
Out of a boot that you would slide your hands
Up and down, and apparently
If you miss
The ball going across the screen
You get whipped
And that's
Thanks to some people in Britain there
Um
Let's see
Ben Heck, the
Creator of such wonderful
Portable systems, has a new project
Now he is blogging about
Including creating his very own
Custom pinball machine
Which he for some reason decided to
Choose Bill Paxton as the
Theme of the pinball machine
But it is kind of neat if you want to
Check it out on how you can
Make your own very
Unique pinball machine
From scratch, so that's kind of neat
That is kind of cool
There's a game on Commodore 64
I used to play back in the day that I loved
Pinball construction set by ECA
Which back in the day was
What EA turned into
You know what I mean?
Modern Warfare
They have their really ridiculous
Prestige collector's edition
Well, not to be outdone
But Codemasters
They're releasing Operation
Flashpoint Dragon Rising
In the UK
With a really ridiculous
Collector's edition as well
It will feature a
Full
I guess
Full size army helmet
That's made from metal
Plus a dog tag
And the box is huge
Apparently the size of a rock band
Bundle box
Which makes sense because the helmet is kind of big
And then lastly
Something that kind of pissed people off
We were talking about Activision raising prices
Well apparently
And once again this goes to show you
That CEOs should never speak
Ever when it comes to video games
Apparently CEO Bobby Kotex
Says that he's
He hopes that the price of
Games will actually go higher
It says
And Tony, you know if it was left
To me, I would raise the prices even further
Yes, thank you
Mr. Douchebag
And then two last things here
Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone
Actually, can we back it up a little bit
And remind me, we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight
We got to do that at some point
What was this dude's name?
Bobby Kotek
The FUs of the Week tonight are for you
My FU
Really just goes to the suture in my hand
It pretty freaking hurts
Yeah
My FU goes to being sore
Like I feel like I'm getting so old
But my legs are so sore
I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday
Which wasn't really that much
I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe
Logie
As I mentioned in part A, most of the nurses that we had
While we were in the hospital for a very
Traumatic and sad event were very nice
However, the last nurse that we had
Was a total idiot
And the reason I say this
She apparently had her own
Stillborn baby
At full term
And so
Dying babies were her thing
As she puts it
So she comes in, basically when they're doing all the pictures
And doing the footprints
And all the impressions and stuff
The nurse beforehand
They're treating them, even though the babies are dead
They're treating them with respect
Like actual babies supporting their head
And stuff like that
Well a woman decides she's gonna come in
And she says, okay we're gonna start taking pictures
Oh this is the fun part
I'm sorry, what part of dead babies
Is fun to you, stupid
And then she treats them
Like, you know, basically dolls
Just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact
You know, that their
Heads should be supported and all that stuff
Because they can't feel pain anymore, she says
So thank you
Nurse Douchebag
For being totally insensitive
And just an absolute
Horrible human being
But you know what though
You know, in the end we do laugh
About it because she's
It just, how do people like this actually exist
They're so stupid
See, only you and Nelly
Can find the humor in something like that, honestly
Alright, that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week
Sorry, last minute stories
And the last one I have, which you'll probably like
Mark's obvious saying they are gonna raise
The cap of your friends list
I actually have a few open
Slots right now, I think I'm down to like 98
And the reason why I, if somebody
Hasn't shown up on my friends list
In like 30 days or more
I just delete them because I knew they cancelled their
Xbox, unless it's somebody I know
In real life, that's pretty much
That's what I've been doing too
Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it
If you wanna add me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots
You're not gonna see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey
But there's always something
There'll be something I'm playing after
I'm sick of the games I'm playing now
It's not the way it works
Alright
I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight
And supporting independent podcasting
You guys are awesome, especially
Downloading and listening to this entire show
After a three week hiatus
If you got all the way to the end
You rock, thank you so much for listening to us
I don't know what else to say
We say tell two people you know about the show
But honestly, by listening to the whole thing
You've already made us feel good
And live listeners
Where would we be without you guys?
Thank you so much for showing up
And especially the fact that we just said at like noon today
That we'd be back tonight, because I just didn't know
I didn't want to announce anything premature
But the fact that so many people showed up
We actually had a really good listener count tonight
And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting
From all games
That some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff
But just thank you
So much
DarkSakari, your final thought
My final thought is
Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud
Smells sick
Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?
I am, I just autographed it
Awesome, I'll sign it too
Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too
Loki, your final thought
My final thought is
I don't know, I've
Hopefully there will be some new video coming up this week
Of the Grand Theft Auto plane
Good, because those two videos
That are up there now, that's all we shot
That one day, and now DarkSakari's
Afraid to do it again, especially if Victoria
Is the camera woman, because it'll be boob shots
So we might have to fire Victoria
And get a new camera lady
It was really good that she did it
No it is, you know
You'll just get more, you'll get a different kalanto
We'll figure it out, we're going to keep that
YouTube channel alive this time
My final thought is, I have a TurboGrafx
In my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to
Steal this, so you may not
Be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say
Anyhow, that's going to do it for this
Week here on Orange Lounge Radio
You know, I pretty much said it all, thanks so much
We'll be back here to do it all again
Next week, so
Myself, Rob Roberts, she's
DarkSakra, he's Loki
Thank you guys, we will see you
