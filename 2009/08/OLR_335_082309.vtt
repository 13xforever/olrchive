00:00.000 --> 00:19.560
Today, August 23, 2009, a new pay-as-you-go business model is announced for a popular

00:19.560 --> 00:21.000
360 game.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.320
One gaming device will soon allow you to read comic books, and was a recently closed studio

00:25.320 --> 00:29.760
working on the next Final Fantasy game?

00:29.760 --> 00:35.960
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
Radio.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.560
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:42.560 --> 00:43.560
lifestyle.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.720
We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice, because we

00:47.720 --> 00:51.940
let you call in, we let you chat with us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.500
We let you tweet us, too.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.160
We try to keep up with the times and the new technologies, and it all happens live at six

00:57.160 --> 01:01.640
o'clock Pacific Standard Time, nine o'clock Eastern Time, at our friends at All Games

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
Radio.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
www.allgames.com.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.620
A big shout-out to them for letting us steal their bandwidth on Sunday nights.

01:06.620 --> 01:07.620
We appreciate it.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.620
My name is Rob Roberts.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.360
I'll be with you here over the next three hours.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.120
With me as always, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Sommers, Dark Sakura.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.120
Crunchy.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.120
How are you?

01:16.120 --> 01:17.120
Crunchy.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.780
Tell the listeners about what you are eating right now, because I find it very interesting.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.800
I really wanted cereal, but I really wanted peanut butter, and then I was like, I've got

01:25.800 --> 01:28.280
some really tasty bread from Trader Joe's.

01:28.280 --> 01:32.360
So what I did is I took my sprouted wheat bread from Trader Joe's, and put a bunch of

01:32.360 --> 01:37.240
creamy Jif, and have put- Why not Skippy?

01:37.240 --> 01:39.760
Annette Funicello is crying somewhere.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.720
Um, oh well.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.120
But I have a layer in between layers of peanut butter of all-brand flakes, so I can get my

01:48.120 --> 01:50.140
crunchy cereal on.

01:50.140 --> 01:54.040
It's actually pretty delicious, but not quite as epic as I thought it was gonna be, and

01:54.040 --> 01:57.800
it hasn't really abated my desire for tacos.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.720
So, to summarize, you are eating a peanut butter and cereal sandwich.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
I am.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.320
It's delicious.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.200
Orange Lounge Foodio, live Sunday nights.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.400
I swear we ought to have a spin-off.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.080
This is full of fiber and protein, okay?

02:11.080 --> 02:13.560
And it's low glycemic, so the world can bite me.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.360
I swear we ought to have a spin-off show about like food or something.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.120
It just seems like a natural progression for our show.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.120
Call it Food Chef.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
All right.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.400
So as always, I don't want to ignore him any longer, because he's an important part of

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
our show.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
What the hell would we do without him?

02:27.400 --> 02:28.400
Tech master, Loki.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.400
Yeah, those are all lies.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Yeah, mostly.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
No, I'm kidding.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
How are you, Loki?

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
I'm fine.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
I feel somber, though.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
Yeah?

02:36.400 --> 02:39.400
I was working out front planting plants.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.000
How is it being a homeowner now, a couple months in, having to do all this housework?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Tiring.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.080
Actually, it's funny, though, because there was this plant that was growing out front

02:47.080 --> 02:50.920
next to our neighbor's fence, and we weren't really sure if it was our neighbor's plant

02:50.920 --> 02:55.180
or ours, but technically, it's not our side of the property, so it's ours.

02:55.180 --> 02:59.000
But apparently, you can pull it apart the way that it kind of grows.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.320
You can actually pull it apart.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.400
So we took this one giant plant and made like 16 smaller plants out of it, and they're all

03:05.400 --> 03:08.840
going to grow and expand bigger and take over the entire yard.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.840
But yeah.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.680
It's like Animal Crossing for real.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
Something like that.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
I don't know.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.960
So yeah, that's what I did there.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.840
I'm surprised you, Loki, with your handiwork.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.900
You don't get one of those things I've seen on late night television, which is those rolls

03:20.900 --> 03:26.120
of flowers that you see that you can get at Home Depot, where you just unravel.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.160
It's like a carpet or something.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.120
You throw it down, and it's all seeds, so you water it, and then you just get the hometown

03:32.120 --> 03:34.080
buffet of flowers in your front yard.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.080
Yeah.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.080
You can do that with just seeds.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.920
I mean, you don't need to spend money on it.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.100
And I don't know if you've ever tried rolling anything down.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.800
I can't roll it straight.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.800
It would just be awful.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.200
Like, last night, we got... We were actually doing stuff at the house.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.400
We bought a rug last night, which Kat decided to start tearing up, because it's the only

03:53.400 --> 03:56.320
carpet in the house, and now she can scratch it.

03:56.320 --> 04:01.200
And then we bought curtains for the front room to shield the outside world from our

04:01.200 --> 04:05.560
porn watching, and it's really sunny.

04:05.560 --> 04:12.200
So we put those up and everything, and... But yeah, I mean, we don't need all the flowers

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
up there.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.900
When are you inviting me over to see all these changes at the house?

04:14.900 --> 04:15.900
Once we're done.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.900
I don't know.

04:16.900 --> 04:17.900
I'm just giving you a hard time.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.900
Come over any time you want.

04:18.900 --> 04:19.900
I don't know.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.840
Once I get the cabinet in and stuff, but... You need a housewarming party.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
I know.

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
That's what you need to do.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
It's never clean.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
No, I understand.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.720
You've had a lot of busy stuff going on lately, but at some point, you should have a housewarming

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
party.

04:32.720 --> 04:38.320
It's almost like... I don't know when the statute of limitations on that stuff is, because

04:38.320 --> 04:41.320
we moved in, what, two months ago?

04:41.320 --> 04:47.480
I don't know when you can... You've gone beyond the point of homewarming parties.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.280
I think there's a point where you're just like, okay, you forego.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.600
You mean you would give up housewarming presents and not have a housewarming party?

04:53.600 --> 04:57.400
Hey, I would not be foregoing housewarming presents.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.080
It's just... I don't know.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.240
It'll be cooler once I get the cabinet in, because it'll be something to showcase, you

05:05.240 --> 05:06.240
know?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
Right.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.320
Right now, all I can showcase is like... I don't know.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.320
The cat-eating rug?

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
No, it's not eaten yet.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.800
I mean, she just started pulling out pieces of it and was eating it.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.800
I don't know.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.800
All right.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.480
Well, let's introduce our chat room as well.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.960
As always, where would we be without the listeners?

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.240
Let's give the chat room a name tonight.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.120
Let's call it Rufus.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Why are we calling the chat room?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.240
Chat room, your name is Rufus.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.560
Why are we calling... Barnaby.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.600
Why are we calling the chat room Rufus or Barnaby or Barnabas?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
I don't know.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.640
Which, by the way, I am all about this Tim Burton Dark Shadows movie with Johnny Depp

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
as Barnabas.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.640
I know, right?

05:42.640 --> 05:43.640
I can't get here any faster.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.640
Please.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.080
But Johnny Depp is in every Tim Burton movie now.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
I love Meesa.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Who cares?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.080
He's a great actor.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.080
I love Tim Burton.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.080
I love Johnny Depp.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.080
This is great.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.800
The chat room's name is officially Penelope.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.360
Why are we calling the chat room by any name?

05:57.360 --> 06:01.160
We're not calling it... We're not going to get in this weird tangent of stuff.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.160
Remember last week?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
It got weird.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
Chat room, your name is Penelope.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.160
See.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.420
And then people are going to tune in at eight o'clock.

06:08.420 --> 06:10.880
People that tune in late who weren't here when the show started on time, they're going

06:10.880 --> 06:11.880
to be like, who the fuck's Penelope?

06:11.880 --> 06:15.240
That's why they should have been here, huh?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.000
It's just going to get strange.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.480
I have a feeling we're just going to go.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
That's right.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
I need to take more Vicodin.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
Excuse me.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
All right.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Let's go to Penelope and read some of the comments that we have tonight.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.860
Alpha Cananagram says about Loki's house, Skye just wants to watch the porn on the big

06:30.860 --> 06:34.080
screen TV, possibly.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.320
It's not that impressive, really.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.280
I mean, I don't know.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.880
There are weird things though.

06:40.880 --> 06:48.520
The last time we had Jim and Annie and Christopher over, we actually watched the parody to Friends.

06:48.520 --> 06:56.320
When you watch those parody porns, there's nothing sexy about that at all.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.380
They're trying to make the characters look like the characters in the show and they do

06:59.380 --> 07:02.760
a horrible job at it.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
I don't know.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
It's more weird.

07:05.760 --> 07:11.600
It's like watching a very slow-mo car wreck or something.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.200
Have you thought about just watching just a straight up porn that doesn't try to be

07:15.200 --> 07:17.080
any type of funny thing?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.720
Good luck finding one, okay?

07:18.720 --> 07:21.840
They're all kind of funny and weird.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.480
I like old people, one of my favorite chat room nicknames, by the way, in Penelope right

07:26.480 --> 07:27.480
now wants to know...

07:27.480 --> 07:34.120
Ew, I just said that that person's in Penelope, wants to know, are there naked pics of Penelope?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.640
Well, look, you're... never mind.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
I don't want to...

07:37.640 --> 07:41.520
I like the alpha cananagram referred to Penelope Pitstop because that's old school yo.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.560
I didn't get that.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.560
What is that?

07:43.560 --> 07:46.200
It wasn't... it was from old cartoon.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
Is it?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
Yeah.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.200
Okay.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
I got school people.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
If it wasn't on Nickelodeon, I probably never saw it.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.080
Would that be from Wacky Races?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.080
I don't know.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
I think it was Wacky Races.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.080
That sounds like a character from Wacky Races.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.560
Any moment somebody's going to yell it out in chat anyway, so we'll get there.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
Okay.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.400
Suma asks, so we went from Rufus to a girl's name, did Chad have a sex change?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
Apparently Dark Soccer thinks so.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
It was indeed Wacky Races.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.400
All right.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.680
And that was just a guess because I wouldn't remember such a horrible cartoon.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.680
You watch a lot of cartoons.

08:11.680 --> 08:17.040
No, I don't watch horrible cartoons like that, but I mean, come on, Penelope Pitstop.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.680
It sounds like a racing character.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.740
Her car was called the Compact Pussycat.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.440
It's a compact pussy, okay.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
There we go.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.880
We have three people all just piping up, starting with X-Link, who beat everybody else to it,

08:27.880 --> 08:30.720
Wacky Racers, or Wacky Races.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.000
Let's go back to video games.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.800
We have this odd delay too.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.560
We are live and it's not like we're on a delay because people are afraid we're going to say

08:40.560 --> 08:44.980
fuck or something, but just the nature of the encoding and the fact that it takes a

08:44.980 --> 08:49.720
minute to go to all game server, then you download it because you're buffering everything.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.960
There's just by nature this 20 second delay.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.600
So sometimes the last question's in the chat.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.460
We don't see the answers for 20 seconds.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.320
That's why when you call in, by the way, it's really important that you lower your volume

08:59.320 --> 09:01.120
because there's nothing you can do about that buffer.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.120
It will always be there.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.120
All right, anyhow.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.120
Look at that, Tiger Claw.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.680
But if you turn the volume up, there's less of a buffer.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.400
Tiger Claw going straight to Wikipedia for the answer on Penelope Pitstop.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.860
Okay, look, let's try to get into video games here tonight, talking a little bit about our

09:15.860 --> 09:17.720
gaming week.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.380
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

09:21.380 --> 09:26.520
I was actually playing some Blue Dragon and some Ragnarok online, which I got back into

09:26.520 --> 09:34.040
and stuff on Gaia, but, uh, I'm not playing anything now.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.280
I have to, when you're playing MMOs, somebody on this show has to keep the added tradition

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
going.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.040
I had to stop because I had the rest of that suture removed from my hand on Friday.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.040
Haha.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.880
You can't bitch slap me.

09:47.880 --> 09:55.240
I got a left hand, Rob, and I got two feet, and you are not protected.

09:55.240 --> 10:02.960
Oh, I'm actually reading up on Janet Waldo, who did Penelope Pitstop's voice.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.520
She was Judy Jetson.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.520
Fascinating.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.520
Yep.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.040
Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.960
I'm assuming she's done if she's talking about the Jetsons.

10:10.960 --> 10:16.200
Apparently not as exciting as Wacky Races, but, uh, no, I actually tried to play a few

10:16.200 --> 10:17.200
different things this week.

10:17.200 --> 10:23.160
I, I went and actually played some indie games, and of course people were recommending that

10:23.160 --> 10:28.520
I play, um, you know, I made a game with zombies in it, and yeah, it was funny, and it was

10:28.520 --> 10:37.040
actually pretty fun, um, so I enjoyed that, um, also, for whatever reason, because, you

10:37.040 --> 10:41.880
know, now that they have the rankings in there, where people can actually rate different games

10:41.880 --> 10:47.920
and stuff, um, you can actually, you know, see what the top rated, you know, um, indie

10:47.920 --> 10:49.180
games and stuff are.

10:49.180 --> 10:55.680
So I decided to play the top rated indie game, which is, um, Miner Dig Deep, and I don't

10:55.680 --> 10:58.760
know why, but I'm addicted to that game.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.320
It's almost pointless.

11:01.320 --> 11:07.960
The game, you basically, you're a miner, and you go into a hole, and you actually dig into

11:07.960 --> 11:11.120
the walls, almost like Dig Dug, but there's no, like, you know, dinosaurs around.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.400
Just to point out, though, not the kind of 17 year old miner, right, you're talking about

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
a pickaxe.

11:15.400 --> 11:20.120
Yeah, it's like a pickaxe, you know, miner, I don't know, maybe under 17.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.040
Miner 2049er, if you're old school like me.

11:23.040 --> 11:28.840
Um, but anyways, so you're in, you know, going into the ground digging, and you can buy different

11:28.840 --> 11:32.360
things, um, of course you have lamp oil that runs out after a certain amount of time, so

11:32.360 --> 11:36.800
you collect ore and stuff, and you go back up to a little shop, sell it, buy more lamp

11:36.800 --> 11:42.720
oil and supplies, and you go back down and dig some more, and you do this forever.

11:42.720 --> 11:47.640
This seriously sounds like a game I used to play, like, 15 years ago on old school PC.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.480
256 color shareware.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.480
Yeah, pretty much, and you do this forever, and I don't know why, but I can't stop playing

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
this game.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.320
I actually, you know, I don't know, I could have been playing, like, Earth Defense Force,

11:59.320 --> 12:04.240
you know, which I did play a little bit of this week, but I kept going back to play this

12:04.240 --> 12:05.240
game, and I don't know why.

12:05.240 --> 12:09.440
So it sounds like its crown as the top-rated game right now is rightfully deserved, it

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
sounds like.

12:10.440 --> 12:14.200
Yeah, it's fun, it's just, I don't really know what the point is, but I don't really

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
care.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.320
Azure Edge in chat wants to know what game you're talking about one more time.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.520
Miner Dig Deep.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.240
And it's an indie game, top-rated indie game, at least when you downloaded it, who knows,

12:23.240 --> 12:25.880
because those lists can change on a daily basis, right?

12:25.880 --> 12:26.880
Yeah.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.080
So, you know, what's funny is that, you know, we heard about the new Xbox, and I think it

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
was like a dollar.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.360
I mean, seriously, it's worth the dollar.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.960
I think we've heard a lot of chat when this new firmware rolled out about how there was

12:35.960 --> 12:39.880
going to be ratings and so forth, but I don't think we've really heard a lot about how that's

12:39.880 --> 12:44.660
really played out, you know, because I think there was some concern that, just like people

12:44.660 --> 12:49.480
spam Dig, some of these indie developers might try to spam Xbox to try and get their titles

12:49.480 --> 12:50.480
to the top.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.200
Does it seem like it's working?

12:52.200 --> 12:59.040
If they are, it's hard to notice because there's so many people voting on stuff that, really,

12:59.040 --> 13:03.400
I don't see how that can be, and actually, it's not a matter of, like, you can place

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
a vote for a title.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.880
I mean, you can vote, like, a five, but, like, say later on, something really pissed you

13:07.880 --> 13:10.720
off about it, you can change it to a zero, or one, or whatever.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.760
You can change it whenever you want, so it's basically just, you know, tallies, whatever

13:14.760 --> 13:17.480
people are thinking of it at that time.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.020
When I went in there, you know, because, unfortunately, you know, if you listened to last week's show,

13:21.020 --> 13:25.920
you know I'm Xbox-less right now, but when I was playing with that new patch last week,

13:25.920 --> 13:29.840
one of the first things I did is I went in there and I rated Snake 360, you know, to

13:29.840 --> 13:33.560
support our buddy who was on the show a couple months ago when that game first rolled out,

13:33.560 --> 13:36.760
and I was like, oh, I'm going to rate this a five and see kind of how it takes place.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.200
But it didn't seem like my vote, because, you know, you can see the number of people

13:39.200 --> 13:42.160
that have voted, it didn't seem like my vote took at first.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.080
Like, it almost seems like there's a waiting period before the vote actually registers.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.120
I don't know if they update overnight, or what it is.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
It might take a while.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
It's kind of weird.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.880
I mean, because I don't think they could do it in real time, it would just be bogging

13:52.880 --> 13:55.680
everything down.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.720
I did find it very interesting that the game rating worked very similar to the Netflix

14:00.720 --> 14:05.720
rating, how since you don't really have a mouse and pointer to click how many stars,

14:05.720 --> 14:09.980
you have to kind of cycle through all the way to five or back to one, you know, to rate

14:09.980 --> 14:12.360
it by hitting the A button so many times.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.480
And I don't know, it's pretty cool, like, I played Earth Defense Force earlier this

14:16.480 --> 14:21.600
week as well, and that's rated a solid four now, which it rightly deserves because it's

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
awesome.

14:22.600 --> 14:28.000
It just broke 80 hours this week in the game, and I don't know why because it's just really

14:28.000 --> 14:33.720
hard and frustrating, but I'm actually working my way through it some more.

14:33.720 --> 14:38.560
I finally got one of the higher up weapons and I'm missing, I'm still missing some of

14:38.560 --> 14:43.120
the other weapons though, but in order to farm them, the one level you have to play,

14:43.120 --> 14:47.880
it only drops like one or two weapons a level, and you know, since it's random at what weapons

14:47.880 --> 14:53.120
it picks to me, it could be one of any 200 weapons that are in that game, and I'm missing

14:53.120 --> 14:57.960
like two, and you can see how it could take forever to get what you need.

14:57.960 --> 15:05.560
But I've been playing that and I'm about 80% done with the game, getting almost to the

15:05.560 --> 15:12.200
point where, you know, I need to really get some good people to help out with it, but

15:12.200 --> 15:17.040
I have a friend who's actually playing that at work as well, and so he's been helping

15:17.040 --> 15:21.040
me on breaks and stuff like that when we're not playing Grand Theft Auto, then of course

15:21.040 --> 15:25.520
I played Grand Theft Auto this week and didn't really change anything, although I went over

15:25.520 --> 15:30.920
to my sister's house because she has a modded 360 as well, I got her that for her birthday,

15:30.920 --> 15:35.660
and so I've been giving her every now and then copies of, you know...

15:35.660 --> 15:38.720
Did you really give the gift of piracy for someone's birthday?

15:38.720 --> 15:43.760
She's poor, she can't, okay before that she had a modded PS2 with games dumped to the

15:43.760 --> 15:47.860
hard drive, so yes, I've been giving the gift of piracy to her because she can't afford

15:47.860 --> 15:49.000
actual games.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
She does rent though, so you know, she rents legitimate games, but I shouldn't be supporting

15:54.000 --> 15:58.240
such blatant piracy, but you know, it's out there I guess.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.760
Well she has, to be fair, she does have a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto IV, so she

16:02.760 --> 16:07.640
does have it, legitimately, so the fact that I'm burning off a new copy of it that happens

16:07.640 --> 16:13.280
to be modified, it's still kind of in that gray area, but I mean, it's not like she doesn't

16:13.280 --> 16:15.000
own a legit copy of it.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Okay, fair enough.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Okay.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.080
But anyways, so she, I was showing her because she didn't actually try any of the weapons

16:21.080 --> 16:24.840
that I modified or anything because she doesn't have the phone yet, she's been too busy trying

16:24.840 --> 16:32.060
to punch people with the super punch, although for whatever reason, the nuke shotgun that

16:32.060 --> 16:37.360
I built in there, because normally I play Lost and Damned and so some things don't work

16:37.360 --> 16:43.600
quite right how they're supposed to, but since she only has Grand Theft Auto IV, that nuke

16:43.600 --> 16:48.400
shotgun works like a nuke, and it, like, no matter where I shot it, somehow the shockwave

16:48.400 --> 16:50.000
hit me, killed me every time.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.480
You really do need to YouTube some of this stuff, I know you're working on it.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.880
I have two hours of footage, okay, I have to go through it, but yeah, it's going to

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
be awesome.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.320
Alright, looking forward to seeing it.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.880
One more question I want to ask you about the whole, because as I mentioned before,

17:02.880 --> 17:06.880
my Xbox 360 is broke right now, so I can't really look at this myself, I don't know if

17:06.880 --> 17:11.760
you've bothered to check it out, maybe a chatter knows, what is the top rated Xbox 360 game

17:11.760 --> 17:12.760
right now?

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
I don't know.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.760
Hmm.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.920
I wonder if that's something that you can look up on Xbox.com, can you see ratings on

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
Xbox.com now?

17:18.920 --> 17:19.920
I think you can.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.600
I'm sure, maybe a chatter will look that up for us, because if I try to go on Xbox.com

17:23.600 --> 17:29.520
while we're recording the show, it won't like that, so it uses up a lot of memory, so.

17:29.520 --> 17:33.120
I'm kind of curious, if it's like Mass Effect or, you know, I'm trying to think of the games

17:33.120 --> 17:37.240
that were high rated when I took a peek, but you know, everything was so new at that point.

17:37.240 --> 17:42.400
I know Grand Theft Auto is pretty high up there, it's like a four and a half, I don't

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
know.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.600
I don't think there's anything else to solve five, so it's going to be really hard to distinguish

17:46.600 --> 17:52.880
since, you know, it's sections of a star being shaded there, it's like, is that a half, third,

17:52.880 --> 17:54.960
I don't know, you know.

17:54.960 --> 18:01.680
Halo 3 says, sex with the elderly is their chat name.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
Is that the game tonight?

18:02.680 --> 18:06.040
Everybody's going to name themselves something really foul that I have to read?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
Whatever.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.760
I think it's a good idea.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.800
No, it's a terrible idea, I won't read your chats, alright, whatever.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.800
Have fun with it, whatever you like, as long as it's consensual.

18:15.800 --> 18:22.800
Alright, um, I wonder if that's just a lie, I wonder if they just shouted out an Xbox

18:22.800 --> 18:26.880
360 game because they knew I'd read it and just believe them, because I'm a sucker.

18:26.880 --> 18:32.560
Alright, hey, my gaming week, obviously I've been QQing about my broken Xbox 360.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.000
You know, and I'm calmed down a lot this week than I was last week, because it was still

18:37.000 --> 18:41.160
fresh in my mind last week, I'm a little more mellow this week, I think I have my plan of

18:41.160 --> 18:43.080
action for what I plan to do about it.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.400
I will not be buying a new Elite, I'll tell you that much, that is one thing I did decide.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.320
Maybe I'll talk a little more about this later on because we're going to get into a story

18:51.320 --> 18:54.400
in a little bit that's kind of related.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.020
But that means obviously I still have a Playstation 3, I still have a Wii, I have plenty of places

18:58.020 --> 18:59.020
I can be gaming.

18:59.020 --> 19:03.800
I think PS3 kind of wins this week, I've been playing Wipeout HD, I went back and visited.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.120
Oddly enough, the whole controversy about the ads in the game kind of made me think,

19:08.120 --> 19:12.280
oh yeah, I never really played enough Wipeout HD, so I went back and played some, and I

19:12.280 --> 19:16.200
did actually see an ad once while I was playing, I didn't play the new expansion, I was just

19:16.200 --> 19:20.840
playing like old school Wipeout HD, like the, I guess, well how old school is Wipeout HD,

19:20.840 --> 19:24.680
but you know what I mean, the original version of it.

19:24.680 --> 19:29.280
Because damn, I love me some F-Zero, and Wipeout HD really is kind of the closest thing we

19:29.280 --> 19:35.560
have to that on another console, and I really like that mode that's called I think zone

19:35.560 --> 19:42.000
mode when you're racing, it makes the track like all this solid color as you're racing,

19:42.000 --> 19:46.080
it has this very techno look to it obviously as Wipeout HD does, and then as you race,

19:46.080 --> 19:51.760
like the track changes colors as you accumulate so many points, and yeah, pretty cool.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.880
I'm having fun with Wipeout HD, haven't really played a lot of it online, but it has been

19:57.880 --> 20:02.680
satiating my thirst for gameplay this week with a lack of an Xbox 360.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.400
Obviously the Playstation 3 is a perfectly fine gaming system, and there's some certain

20:06.400 --> 20:10.440
things on it I can't play on 360 that I'm kind of catching up on right now, so Wipeout

20:10.440 --> 20:11.440
HD is one of them.

20:11.440 --> 20:16.160
I'm still looking for a cheap copy of Valkyria Chronicles, but from what I understand, because

20:16.160 --> 20:20.960
I remember we reported on the show a while back that Valkyria Chronicles dipped to 1999,

20:20.960 --> 20:25.440
apparently it went back up, because it has been, I don't know if the price dip made it

20:25.440 --> 20:29.560
more successful or it's a cult thing now or what the deal is, but I know that's on my

20:29.560 --> 20:35.800
hit list of games I want to play until I get my 360 situation resolved, and then of course,

20:35.800 --> 20:38.860
whenever Final Fantasy 13 comes out I will be buying them on PS3, and I was watching

20:38.860 --> 20:39.860
Blu-rays too.

20:39.860 --> 20:41.720
I finally caught up on a few of those.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.280
I think that you should hang out with me and play Dreamcast.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.280
Dreamcast?

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
On September 9th I will.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.280
Okay.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.280
It'll be fun.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.400
I forgot to mention that I also have a System 573 board coming my way tomorrow.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.600
Now for those that don't know what a System 573 board is, what is that?

20:57.600 --> 20:58.960
It's Bomani hardware.

20:58.960 --> 21:06.680
It's actually, well this one in particular is a Dance Maniacs second mix J append, and

21:06.680 --> 21:11.680
so literally if I were to hook it up to a monitor and build controls and stuff like

21:11.680 --> 21:16.080
that, I could play Dance Maniacs as an actual arcade game.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.800
And you can convert the machine into a DDR machine if I really wanted to, but it costs

21:19.800 --> 21:21.980
like an extra $100 to do that.

21:21.980 --> 21:28.480
But I have the actual cartridges and security stuff to do it if I wanted to.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.200
I don't know if I will though, because I can just run Step Mania.

21:32.200 --> 21:37.280
I'm reading some comments from Penelope at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.280
Tiger Claw says, Zone was a mode first introduced in Wipeout Pure on the PSP.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.280
I did not know that.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
I missed the PSP version.

21:43.280 --> 21:49.040
SG100Matt says, the top indie rated game is, I made a game with zombies, with 4.5 stars

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
and 5081 votes.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
So it sounds like it's changed.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.280
Yeah, it's been getting, well that was like number 3.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.280
It's been getting bigger because, you know, everyone loves it.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.280
Everyone loves zombies.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.280
It's a dollar.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.280
It's a dollar.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.280
It's a good dollar spent, you know.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.880
Definitely recommend you try it.

22:01.880 --> 22:08.600
Has a really, people are calling it this year's, you know, Still Alive basically, has a really

22:08.600 --> 22:11.640
weird catchy song about the game.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
Interesting.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.440
It's probably sung, but it just talks about the game.

22:15.440 --> 22:20.640
Does it seem like this whole rebranding of the, what was it, I don't even remember what

22:20.640 --> 22:24.840
was called before, the independent, to indie games, what was it, what the hell was it called?

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
Community games.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
Thank you.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.240
Do you think the rebranding of community games to indie games has been successful?

22:29.240 --> 22:32.520
Because it sure sounds like more people are following what's going on now.

22:32.520 --> 22:37.880
I think though what's making it better is that they've dropped the price, the minimum

22:37.880 --> 22:38.880
price.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.000
Because before the minimum price used to be 200 Microsoft points, which is, you know,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
80 points.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.720
Now your lowest amount that you can charge for a game is 80 points or a dollar.

22:48.720 --> 22:53.120
So, you know, surprisingly enough, that's still, a lot of people are just like, hey,

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
dollar, whatever.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
You know, throw it in there.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.320
You know, a lot of people may have 80 points left over after buying something.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.160
So it's kind of cool in that way too.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.920
But yeah, I mean, it's a lot easier just to buy stuff for 80 points.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.240
I mean, it goes really fast.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.120
It is unfortunate that the games don't have achievements.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.480
I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand why.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.360
Because obviously someone would make that game, you know, press A, get 200 gamer score.

23:14.360 --> 23:19.680
But even if they would do achievements with a zero gamer score, or just, you know, because

23:19.680 --> 23:23.120
there are plenty of achievements out there in the retail games that are just zero gamer

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
score.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.440
It's just unlocking it.

23:25.440 --> 23:32.240
Or maybe like a separate type of, not even achievements, but maybe like community badges.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.840
I don't know what the hell they want to call it, but something maybe separate that, yeah,

23:34.840 --> 23:37.280
that'd be kind of cool because no one let me compete against friends.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.600
Because, you know, on those games, you can't really do the...

23:39.600 --> 23:44.080
We would never do points because someone could just, you know, go, okay, you started the

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
game, 1000 points.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
Right, right.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.080
I get that.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.080
Don't get me wrong.

23:48.080 --> 23:52.200
But just something that, you know, kind of encourages a little bit of competition, you

23:52.200 --> 23:53.200
know.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
I don't know.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.200
I'm just kind of brainstorming here.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.200
I think ways they can make it even bigger.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
I think they will later.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.200
But just not right now.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.200
All right.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
Let's see.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.920
As far as other games I've been playing this week, not really a whole lot.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.620
I was playing Guild Wars for a little bit.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.620
Not a lot.

24:07.620 --> 24:12.080
But, you know, it's one of those MMOs I have that I'm not really paying for because I already

24:12.080 --> 24:13.360
bought the game.

24:13.360 --> 24:18.520
And Guild Wars' model is that once you buy the game, you can play online for free pretty

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
much forever.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.280
So it's kind of cool that you can just go back and revisit it whenever you want.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
I did.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.520
Speaking of Guild Wars, and I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, I also watched

24:25.520 --> 24:27.560
that trailer for Guild Wars 2.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.580
Looks pretty sweet, I got to say.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.440
So definitely keeping an eye on Guild Wars.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.440
All right.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.520
Let's get into some more gaming news tonight.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.040
After some housekeeping, we do of course always want to plug some of the ways you can follow

24:39.040 --> 24:42.520
us and join the community that we sometimes call the O.L. Army.

24:42.520 --> 24:49.040
If you want to join our Twitter, www.Twitter.com slash O.L.R., also you can join us on Facebook.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
Just search for the O.L. Army.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.160
We're on LiveJournal as well in Orange Lounge.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.160
Follow us.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.160
Get involved with the community.

24:55.160 --> 25:00.280
We try to read your comments and so forth on every show all the time.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.160
Also some other comments from chat.

25:02.160 --> 25:07.760
INGN0, INGO, I know how to spell this, or he's told me how to pronounce it before and

25:07.760 --> 25:11.440
I always forget, asks, no Wolfenstein question mark.

25:11.440 --> 25:17.000
No, not this week, especially, it's not really the type of game that I've been really eagerly

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
anticipating.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.240
I played the old Wolfenstein 3D and that was about it for me.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
I don't know.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.560
Wolfenstein, any interest, Loki?

25:24.560 --> 25:25.560
Nope.

25:25.560 --> 25:30.680
I will tell you, this has got to be probably the first podcast or gaming blog anywhere

25:30.680 --> 25:33.360
that did not talk about Shadow Complex this week.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.760
I would have played it if my Xbox worked.

25:35.760 --> 25:41.040
I looked at it and I was like, how much did I play Castlevania Symphony Night when I bought

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
that on 360?

25:42.040 --> 25:44.640
Oh wait, no, I didn't buy it.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.580
But still, all the more reason.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.880
I'm probably not going to buy it.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.880
I don't know.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.880
I'll think about it.

25:49.880 --> 25:59.040
But I haven't finished, you know, Bionic Commando and more than half a dozen, a few dozen games

25:59.040 --> 26:01.280
that I've bought already.

26:01.280 --> 26:08.120
I'm just kind of taking a break from buying full price Xbox Live Arcade games.

26:08.120 --> 26:12.240
Now, don't get me wrong, if they ever came out with a Bionic Commando sequel that would

26:12.240 --> 26:18.200
be on Xbox Live Arcade done the same fashion as, say, Re-Armed, then yes, I would probably

26:18.200 --> 26:19.640
buy that in a heartbeat.

26:19.640 --> 26:24.360
I have not seen a single person on the interwebs say that Shadow Complex sucks.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.480
I have yet to see a tweet about it.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.480
I don't know.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.480
Chat, does it suck?

26:28.480 --> 26:29.480
Just say it just to say it.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.680
Like, if it really sucks, tell me why.

26:31.680 --> 26:35.160
It seems like the reception of this game has been very, very positive.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.800
And I do love the Metroidvania games.

26:36.800 --> 26:41.200
I was looking at screenshots kind of going, doesn't look like the type of thing I normally

26:41.200 --> 26:42.840
play, but I'll check it out.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
It's fun, it's fun.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.640
Doesn't matter what the theme is or what have you.

26:45.640 --> 26:49.960
By the way, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us on all games radio,

26:49.960 --> 26:52.800
he starts at five o'clock Pacific on Sunday nights.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.620
He is in chat saying, we are the second podcast to not mention Shadow Complex, even though

26:56.620 --> 27:00.100
we did, because he was the first.

27:00.100 --> 27:01.560
My bad.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.640
Give credit where credit is due.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.800
Beaten by one hour, curses!

27:04.800 --> 27:05.800
Alright.

27:05.800 --> 27:10.600
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, Shadow Complex or whatever the game is that we're

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
talking about.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.720
And please, don't hear me wrong, I'm not bashing Shadow Complex.

27:13.720 --> 27:18.920
Again, if my Xbox 360 hadn't fried last week, I would have gladly checked it out this week,

27:18.920 --> 27:21.160
but you know, shit happens.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.680
Alright, so Loki, get us started with some gaming news tonight.

27:24.680 --> 27:32.240
Alright, so Microsoft had a little bit of a keynote during Gamescom this week, however

27:32.240 --> 27:33.860
they didn't really discuss a whole lot.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.640
Really the only thing they discussed was Fable.

27:37.640 --> 27:44.120
So of course, I'm totally shocked that they announced a new Fable game, but Fable 3 will

27:44.120 --> 27:49.840
be coming out next year, and they didn't really go into great detail what exactly you're going

27:49.840 --> 27:55.160
to be doing, but apparently you will be, I guess, assuming that they're going to be playing

27:55.160 --> 28:00.020
as the son or daughter of your Fable 2 hero, and you're going to be starting like a revolution

28:00.020 --> 28:06.380
to become the new ruler of Albion, and of course, based on, you know, what you do as

28:06.380 --> 28:13.580
a ruler, you know, that have obviously positive or negative effects on the world around you.

28:13.580 --> 28:18.720
Just like Fable 2, and I'm sorry, but if it's just like Fable 2, then it's going to be all

28:18.720 --> 28:20.600
hype, no content.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.000
Well, not no content, but not as much content as promised.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.120
I kind of liked Fable 2, but...

28:26.120 --> 28:30.800
It was alright, but it just wasn't like, oh my god, the best game ever, as he was like,

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
you know, pitching it.

28:31.800 --> 28:37.080
Well, Peter Molyneux kind of has a reputation for really, really hyping things beyond what

28:37.080 --> 28:42.740
they really end up being, and you know why we all approach this project, Milo, with a

28:42.740 --> 28:45.000
hint of skepticism, at least I do.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.400
But I did like Fable 2 quite a bit, actually, it's one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
last year.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.620
But here's my question about Fable 3.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.480
If you're going to be playing the child of a character in Fable 2, does that mean all

28:56.480 --> 29:01.660
these decisions you made in Fable 2 ultimately are going to impact in Fable 3?

29:01.660 --> 29:03.920
That didn't really happen in Fable 2 with Fable 1.

29:03.920 --> 29:08.680
Yeah, I'm not really sure if that's the case, and they're just saying that the storyline's

29:08.680 --> 29:14.280
basically that your, you know, hero is going to be, you know, it's their children, since

29:14.280 --> 29:20.600
the game starts off in Fable 2 where you pick, you know, a sex, and that's basically it.

29:20.600 --> 29:27.000
But I guess they said the game's going to take place 50 years after the first one, and

29:27.000 --> 29:34.560
you play the child of the hero, Bowerstone has continued moving on, become quite industrial,

29:34.560 --> 29:37.680
and the game's not just about Albion this time.

29:37.680 --> 29:42.000
And they also said that half the game will be spent trying to ascend the power, and the

29:42.000 --> 29:45.480
game will not turn into, like, a micromanagement RTS.

29:45.480 --> 29:50.840
And then they're also going to have the judgment and touch systems, which will be used to influence

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
the world.

29:51.840 --> 29:56.160
Basically, a judgment system was people will come to you and say, okay, this poor child,

29:56.160 --> 29:59.240
you know, stole bread from this person.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.860
Do you want to let them go or kill them, you know?

30:01.860 --> 30:07.400
You can just, you know, obviously pick the right or wrong, whatever you feel is right

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
or wrong.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
But you can't come up with creative punishments.

30:09.400 --> 30:14.480
You can't say, you know, make them bake bread for the entire town or anything like that.

30:14.480 --> 30:21.280
Yeah, it's like you can, you know, judge her immediately, like the person that stole food,

30:21.280 --> 30:23.280
or you can investigate the situation.

30:23.280 --> 30:28.560
Or you can set her on fire.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.360
I vote for fire.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.040
Clearly, your character was evil and fabled too.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.920
No, mine was actually really good.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.640
No, and you set people on fire, and you were good?

30:37.640 --> 30:39.480
No, I just said I vote for fire.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.840
I do like this feature.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.620
Touch apparently will allow players to grab NPCs.

30:44.620 --> 30:50.080
So for example, if, you know, somebody, if a child was in a burning building, you can

30:50.080 --> 30:54.020
actually grab the child and pull them to safety instead of waiting for the child to figure

30:54.020 --> 30:58.320
out how to get out of the burning building and probably dying in the process because

30:58.320 --> 31:02.100
some of the AI wasn't that, I don't know.

31:02.100 --> 31:05.400
That means if you're evil, you could grab them and throw them into the burning building.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.240
That saying, like, you can also shake someone's hand or refuse to.

31:09.240 --> 31:14.200
You can also embrace somebody, snog them.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.200
I don't know.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.200
Baby shake?

31:16.200 --> 31:20.280
I hope you can throw them off cliffs.

31:20.280 --> 31:26.640
Or even better, jump off a cliff while holding onto them and then drag them with you.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.640
Throw your dog at them.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.080
That would be kind of funny.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.560
So yeah, that's basically the game.

31:33.560 --> 31:40.320
It's, you know, becoming the king and it will be the best game ever, I'm sure, and somehow

31:40.320 --> 31:42.720
they'll probably work in Milo in there or some crap.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.720
I don't know.

31:43.720 --> 31:47.240
Fable 3, my life as a king.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.640
But yeah, that is, you know, basically Fable 3.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.720
So it's, I don't know, it's neat.

31:55.720 --> 32:00.900
Now the other thing that they talked about, because goddamn if Fable 3 wasn't enough,

32:00.900 --> 32:06.040
they talked about Fable 2 Episodic, and people were thinking, oh my god, there's more content

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
coming.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
Wrong.

32:08.040 --> 32:13.400
Actually, Fable 2 Episodic is a pay-to-play version of Fable 2.

32:13.400 --> 32:17.820
And basically Fable 2 had different, like, chapter points, I guess, in it.

32:17.820 --> 32:23.520
And so the first chapter is free, and then of course, you know, once you're done with

32:23.520 --> 32:28.320
that, you can choose to buy the next chapter or buy the rest of the game.

32:28.320 --> 32:33.120
And I guess there's five episodes in total, and it's supposed to be released on September

32:33.120 --> 32:34.840
29th.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.040
And they didn't say how expensive the game will be.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.920
I'm guessing around the same price as Fable 2.

32:40.920 --> 32:45.680
Yeah, probably when you buy all five parts, or the last four or whatever it is, it ends

32:45.680 --> 32:48.320
up being the same price as Fable 2, I'm sure.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.180
Kind of an interesting business model, though.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.340
What do you think about this?

32:52.340 --> 32:56.720
It's clearly a test to see how well it's received, but what do you think of the business model?

32:56.720 --> 32:59.520
I actually...

32:59.520 --> 33:04.120
You know, for somebody with gaming ADD like me, who probably only played through a few

33:04.120 --> 33:08.040
chapters of Fable 2, I mean, granted, I like the idea that I can go back and check it out

33:08.040 --> 33:09.440
at any time.

33:09.440 --> 33:15.320
I have to say, I'm actually a little more welcoming of this idea than you might think.

33:15.320 --> 33:20.360
I think it's a good idea because Fable 2 didn't have a demo, and this would be a good way

33:20.360 --> 33:22.800
to check out, you know, a game.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.720
Say for example, you know, it's more of like an extended demo because you get to play through

33:26.720 --> 33:31.560
the first part of the game for free, and then if you just, if you like it, then you can

33:31.560 --> 33:33.680
go ahead and purchase it later.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.900
Or if you're just on the fence about it, you know, you can buy the next chapter and see

33:37.900 --> 33:40.000
if you still like it or something like that.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.600
So it's not just dumping all the money.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.800
But they are getting more money, though, out of you by charging you in an episodic manner

33:47.800 --> 33:50.240
as opposed to buying the whole game.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.080
Well, granted, we don't know how many points each part is going to cost yet.

33:54.080 --> 34:00.040
I would assume so because, I mean, that's typically when you buy, for example, an individual

34:00.040 --> 34:03.980
size of something or when you buy the six pack, you know.

34:03.980 --> 34:04.980
That's a fair comparison.

34:04.980 --> 34:07.960
Like, I was kind of thinking of it as a pizza, is that when you buy Fable 2, you get the

34:07.960 --> 34:09.520
pizza, but now you can get a slice of pizza.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.160
Oh, pizza sounds good.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.160
Pizza does sound very good, actually.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.160
Let's get pizza.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.960
We might have to during break or something.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.680
Wait a minute, you didn't bring food tonight, Loki.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.680
You didn't.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.680
I went sushi.

34:18.680 --> 34:19.680
Oh, okay.

34:19.680 --> 34:25.120
And then I had a TNT roll, which is, what is it, and it all comes back to food.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.120
Hey, you asked.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
My fault.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
My fault.

34:28.120 --> 34:39.720
So it was like McGrew, I want to say there's spicy yahi and yellowfin and some other stuff

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
in there.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
But it was good and hot.

34:41.720 --> 34:42.720
Spicy mayonnaise.

34:42.720 --> 34:46.440
Comments from chat, because of course this seems to be lighting up our chat room a little

34:46.440 --> 34:47.440
bit.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.640
I think Bobby's on the same page we are.

34:48.640 --> 34:52.720
Black Wolf in chat says, I like the episodic model because that way if I don't continue

34:52.720 --> 34:54.240
the game, I'm not paying for the whole game.

34:54.240 --> 34:56.560
I'm only paying for the part of the game that I finished.

34:56.560 --> 35:00.240
Unfolded Raptor follows up with, but that's like watching 15 minutes of a movie then paying

35:00.240 --> 35:02.000
for another 15 minutes.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.680
Black Wolf says, well, you know, if I want to walk out of the movie after the first 15

35:05.680 --> 35:08.240
minutes, I didn't pay for the entire two hour movie.

35:08.240 --> 35:13.580
You know what's interesting is that you do see actually a lot of movie companies putting

35:13.580 --> 35:17.400
out like the first eight minutes of a movie on the internet for you to watch.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.920
Amazon does that with TV episodes that you can download.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
And books.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
Yeah.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
We'll give you samples of the books.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.280
I mean, it's a good idea, but I'm thinking that they should offer an incentive that if

35:28.280 --> 35:32.800
you decide after the first episode that you want to buy the whole game, that they give

35:32.800 --> 35:36.520
you an option to pay the difference.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.220
Well that's the thing.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.520
They're going to do that I think.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.920
They're just basically, the first episode's free.

35:42.920 --> 35:47.280
So after the first episode, you can, after each chapter I guess, you have the option

35:47.280 --> 35:53.320
to purchase the rest of the game or just purchase the next chapter.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.720
You know, this really could be.

35:55.720 --> 36:01.420
We could be looking at the future of how we're going to pay for a lot of our games.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.520
Especially if this is successful, I don't know how successful it will be because it's

36:04.520 --> 36:05.800
not a new game.

36:05.800 --> 36:09.280
I think a lot of people that were interested in this game already got it, but it's certainly

36:09.280 --> 36:14.120
by tempting folks with a free chapter a way to entice folks to check it out maybe and

36:14.120 --> 36:15.640
get a few more extra sales.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.440
I can't see how that's going to be bad news for Microsoft or Lionhead.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.920
It's the pot of the video game world.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.160
Just one hit, man.

36:23.160 --> 36:28.720
But the interesting thing is, I mean think about it, PSP Go, despite the crap we've given

36:28.720 --> 36:36.000
it on this show for not being that much better than the PSP and especially price wise, is

36:36.000 --> 36:39.080
going to be completely free of media.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.160
It's going to be digital downloads only.

36:42.160 --> 36:47.840
Nintendo DS, or the DSi I should say specifically is a large part, is going to be digital download

36:47.840 --> 36:48.840
only.

36:48.840 --> 36:54.200
Some of the biggest components and biggest games you see now on 360, PlayStation Network,

36:54.200 --> 36:57.500
Nintendo WiiWare, are all download games.

36:57.500 --> 37:04.600
I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the major players, Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft,

37:04.600 --> 37:13.920
in the next console, and I think if anybody it's going to be Sony, says no media, no discs,

37:13.920 --> 37:18.080
no Blu-ray, or you know this will play Blu-rays but the games do not come out on Blu-rays.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.100
It will be 100% digital distribution.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.400
And it will fail.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
You think?

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
It will fail.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.640
What if it's like this though?

37:25.640 --> 37:26.640
It will still fail.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.320
And you know why it's going to fail?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.880
Because people like owning stuff and people like the option.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.960
I don't have a problem with adding other ways you can purchase content if you decide that

37:35.960 --> 37:36.960
you know what?

37:36.960 --> 37:39.360
I don't feel like buying the game.

37:39.360 --> 37:44.880
I can buy either the episode, I can buy the full digital download which is available on

37:44.880 --> 37:52.680
their service as well, or I can go purchase the retail game out there and do that.

37:52.680 --> 37:57.720
If I'm not given that option then that's kind of crappy and then you know what happens later

37:57.720 --> 38:02.640
on with, say, your console dies.

38:02.640 --> 38:08.040
I know a lot of times with the Playstation 3 and stuff I'm sure you can go re-download

38:08.040 --> 38:14.200
all that stuff later because it's just tied to your account, but still though it's not,

38:14.200 --> 38:19.720
you can't loan out your games, you can't sell used, I mean it's really, there's a lot more

38:19.720 --> 38:23.600
factors in there, and people like the, I mean people like the collector crap.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.120
I mean, hello, Modern Warfare 2 with some fucking night vision goggles.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.920
Can't digitally download night vision goggles.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.780
Look at my vault.

38:32.780 --> 38:36.940
Maybe I'm apples to oranges here a little bit, but then tell me why iTunes and iPods

38:36.940 --> 38:38.400
are so successful.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.240
Because people that purchase Apple products are suckers for that kind of crap.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.600
But you cannot deny iTunes is successful.

38:46.600 --> 38:52.780
But seriously, what phone out there, okay, what phone has cartridges or discs that plug

38:52.780 --> 38:53.780
into it?

38:53.780 --> 38:54.920
No phone does.

38:54.920 --> 39:01.200
So that kind of content is expected on there, and that's why it's not a big deal.

39:01.200 --> 39:07.320
Now if Apple were to come out with, say, a console and decides that, okay, it's only

39:07.320 --> 39:11.820
gonna be through like their app store, then people might not be so apt to it.

39:11.820 --> 39:15.440
They might go, eh, you know what, I'm just gonna stick with a console that I can actually

39:15.440 --> 39:18.060
purchase physical stuff for.

39:18.060 --> 39:19.060
Very interesting.

39:19.060 --> 39:22.320
A lot of negativity in the chat room on this idea.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
Penelope.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.320
Sorry.

39:24.320 --> 39:28.720
In Penelope, there's a lot of, and not necessarily the Fable 2 thing, I'm talking about the what

39:28.720 --> 39:31.800
if the next generation of gaming was all digital.

39:31.800 --> 39:36.880
Let's see, we have Act Def says, it will fail.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.720
Code Man says, I hate downloading games.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.760
My internet connection is so slow.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.260
Frisbee says, I like having a disc to hold or cart.

39:44.260 --> 39:48.600
And I like this comment from Sex with the Elderly says, I can't wait till people start

39:48.600 --> 39:52.060
stealing PSPs and all their content with it.

39:52.060 --> 39:56.160
Then having no media will suck ass.

39:56.160 --> 40:04.240
And I'm sorry, I don't know, we'll get into this later why the PSP goes sucks, because

40:04.240 --> 40:09.600
we have to bring it up on every show, but they're really dumb.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.080
I'm sorry.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.400
Sony is so retarded, it is just mind boggling.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.720
And if they decided that, you know what, we're not gonna have any media and it's gonna be

40:18.720 --> 40:23.800
a purely digital download system, it's gonna fail.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.280
It's gonna fail.

40:26.280 --> 40:31.760
To be fair, I'm only picking on Sony because if the PSP goes any indication, this is what

40:31.760 --> 40:32.760
they're thinking.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.000
I don't think it's a good idea anyways with Microsoft either.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.240
I probably wouldn't buy a console from Microsoft if it didn't have physical media.

40:39.240 --> 40:44.120
And I think that they're gonna be more apt to having physical media because there's a

40:44.120 --> 40:47.080
lot more exposure out there, whereas it's just their service.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.360
What if someone doesn't have broadband internet?

40:49.360 --> 40:53.740
Oops, can't buy your download content.

40:53.740 --> 40:54.740
That's a problem.

40:54.740 --> 40:57.940
But there are people out there that don't have internet, or maybe they're playing their

40:57.940 --> 41:01.680
console in a spot that doesn't have internet and they just don't care.

41:01.680 --> 41:05.480
But still, you know what, they can go out there and buy discs and they can plug them

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
into their system.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.000
There's still consumers in that sense.

41:09.000 --> 41:15.040
But if you get rid of that and just say, well, everybody by now should have internet, well

41:15.040 --> 41:16.840
you're gonna still lose some sales.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.880
And that's not a smart thing.

41:18.880 --> 41:25.360
Now what you should do is open up as many different avenues for people to purchase content.

41:25.360 --> 41:29.260
Like this with Fable 2 I think is a good idea because now you have three different options.

41:29.260 --> 41:32.760
You can purchase the full game, you can purchase it by episode, or you can purchase the retail

41:32.760 --> 41:33.760
copy.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.200
Or hell, you can purchase the used retail copy out there.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.840
So there's a lot of options for you, and options are never a bad thing.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.960
I guess not.

41:42.960 --> 41:48.160
Alright, well let's move on and talk about the Xbox.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.800
And obviously one big topic that dominated last week's show was me bitching about my

41:51.800 --> 41:54.280
Xbox having crashed.

41:54.280 --> 41:58.140
And apparently that wasn't the only story that came up on Xbox failures last week.

41:58.140 --> 42:02.720
Game Informer actually ran a report, and in the latest issue of Game Informer, they actually

42:02.720 --> 42:06.820
did a survey where they surveyed 5,000 console owners.

42:06.820 --> 42:11.960
And according to these 5,000 console owners, the Xbox 360's current failure rate because

42:11.960 --> 42:16.920
of the E74 error, 54.2%.

42:16.920 --> 42:22.160
Now to be fair, they also surveyed for the Playstation 3's, and their yellow light issues,

42:22.160 --> 42:28.240
10.3% on those, and the Wii's, 6.8%.

42:28.240 --> 42:34.920
Granted, despite the anger I was feeling last week, I think this number's a little skewed.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.720
And I think we're all approaching this with a little bit of skepticism because who are

42:38.720 --> 42:40.460
you surveying in this poll?

42:40.460 --> 42:42.880
You're surveying gamers.

42:42.880 --> 42:51.720
And I think, I can admit that I think those that go so far as to subscribe to a magazine

42:51.720 --> 42:56.880
or so forth probably use their Xbox 360's on a pretty regular basis, maybe a little

42:56.880 --> 43:00.860
bit heavier than some people who don't subscribe to magazines do.

43:00.860 --> 43:04.640
And so I think, just by nature, the more you use your console, the more you're going to

43:04.640 --> 43:06.080
open it up to failure.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.520
That's just true of any piece of hardware.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.680
The more you use it, the more it's likely to fail someday.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.680
That's not true.

43:10.680 --> 43:14.200
I mean, I guess it's true in general statement, but it shouldn't be failing at the rates that

43:14.200 --> 43:15.200
they're talking about.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.200
Well, I'll get to that.

43:16.200 --> 43:20.320
But I'm talking about, it's inevitable that the more you use something, the more likely

43:20.320 --> 43:21.320
it is to break.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.240
That's just a fact.

43:24.240 --> 43:27.340
But do I think this number is that far off?

43:27.340 --> 43:28.340
Probably not.

43:28.340 --> 43:32.160
I would say the real number is probably somewhere around a third.

43:32.160 --> 43:37.760
But I still look at this and go, most companies that would have that type of failure rate

43:37.760 --> 43:44.840
on some type of thing they put out, like a television, a CD player, a car, would recall

43:44.840 --> 43:45.840
it.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.120
They would be forced to recall it.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
They can't.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.240
It'd be bad PR.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.240
And they've kind of-

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
And this is good PR?

43:52.240 --> 43:54.960
Yes, it's good PR for them.

43:54.960 --> 44:01.800
Because notice, even though it may have a 54% failure rate, people, they're still the

44:01.800 --> 44:07.320
second largest console share in the United States.

44:07.320 --> 44:11.760
People don't care because people will go out and buy a new console once their console breaks.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.720
If it's out of warranty, they'll go buy a new one.

44:13.720 --> 44:14.720
Because you know why?

44:14.720 --> 44:16.240
Because the games are good.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.840
They have a good library of games and people don't give a crap.

44:18.840 --> 44:24.640
Well, see, it goes back to the system is only good as the games that are on it.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.180
And you know what's, and actually that's probably the point as to, because I know there's been

44:28.180 --> 44:30.480
people that have been asking, well, if you're so mad about it, why are you going to buy

44:30.480 --> 44:31.480
another one?

44:31.480 --> 44:35.240
And it's kind of like, well, dude, because I've invested all this money in the games,

44:35.240 --> 44:40.920
not just the physical games and the, um, online games that selling them back.

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
I'm sorry.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.920
That's, that's a waste of my money to just to buy them.

44:44.920 --> 44:50.580
If I sold back all of my games to rebuy them on PS3, I would be able to buy like one fifth.

44:50.580 --> 44:53.400
If that of the games on PS3, you know what I mean?

44:53.400 --> 44:58.040
And plus fact of the matter is some games I want to play are only on Xbox.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.200
You know what I mean?

44:59.200 --> 45:04.280
So yeah, I do feel a little bit pigeonholed where if I'm not able to repair this, then

45:04.280 --> 45:05.680
I'm going to have to just buy a new one.

45:05.680 --> 45:10.640
I would think though that the failure rate is probably around that 54%.

45:10.640 --> 45:14.880
I've had what I have had maybe a total of eight consoles and I think five of them died

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
at one point.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.280
Well, it's interesting.

45:17.280 --> 45:21.920
Everybody has their own ideas and everybody has their own interpretations of these results.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.360
You know, I think we can all agree it ain't 54.2%.

45:25.360 --> 45:28.360
That's obviously a skewed statistic, which way it's skewed.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.560
That's open to interpretation.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.440
Microsoft responded to it this week, by the way, and here was their response.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.240
And this was in a statement to T-

45:36.240 --> 45:38.040
I know what I said.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
What's that?

45:39.040 --> 45:41.960
Well, you tell me if this sounds like to you.

45:41.960 --> 45:42.960
Okay.

45:42.960 --> 45:48.080
In a statement to TG Daily, Microsoft stands behind the Xbox 360 as a superior entertainment

45:48.080 --> 45:50.800
console with one of the best warranties in the industry.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.720
We are constantly improving the design, manufacture, and performance of the console through extensive

45:54.720 --> 45:57.160
testing of potential sources of any problems.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.360
Xbox 360 is pleased to maintain the title of most played console and the vast majority

46:01.360 --> 46:06.440
of the Xbox 360 customers have enjoyed a terrific gaming and entertainment experience since

46:06.440 --> 46:11.040
their first day and continue to day in and day out.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.480
That entire statement is true.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.400
But the thing is, they're not addressing the real problem.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.680
That isn't the most smoke up my ass I've ever heard.

46:18.680 --> 46:19.680
No, it's that-

46:19.680 --> 46:20.680
It is.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.000
That entire statement is true.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
But here's the thing though.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.920
They're dancing around the real issue.

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
That's the problem.

46:25.920 --> 46:31.160
Yes, they are continually upgrading their systems and making them better and stuff like

46:31.160 --> 46:32.160
that.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.160
Yes, their warranty is pretty awesome.

46:33.160 --> 46:36.000
Three years warranty is really cool.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.160
And yes, that people do enjoy their console.

46:38.160 --> 46:43.000
However, they failed to address that their first line of systems that came out the first

46:43.000 --> 46:47.440
few revisions suck so bad that more than half of them have failed.

46:47.440 --> 46:54.320
And in fact, I would be surprised if not all of them failing at some point.

46:54.320 --> 46:58.960
The newer systems though, the newer revisions, the newer motherboards and stuff that they're

46:58.960 --> 47:01.040
putting out, less likely to fail.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.040
Yes.

47:02.040 --> 47:09.040
And probably up to par with, I'd say, the other consoles around that 10% range.

47:09.040 --> 47:14.340
But a lot of people did buy to launch or at least relatively close to launch and all their

47:14.340 --> 47:17.960
consoles are going to fail at some point or another and it's just a matter of time.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.560
It's like a ticking time bomb.

47:19.560 --> 47:20.560
That is the problem.

47:20.560 --> 47:25.360
Yes, you're continually making them better, but you fucked up in the beginning and that's

47:25.360 --> 47:30.080
a big problem and you needed to recall all of them and get them all back and give them

47:30.080 --> 47:31.940
the new revisions.

47:31.940 --> 47:33.460
That would be the proper thing to do.

47:33.460 --> 47:43.000
I wasn't going to quite say that much, but I don't know.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.720
It's a tricky issue.

47:44.720 --> 47:48.200
In the age of the internet, in gaming, we haven't really seen something like this before,

47:48.200 --> 47:49.900
but I'm sorry.

47:49.900 --> 47:56.240
You can't tell me that the PS3 and the Wii failure rates are anything close to this.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.240
Close to this.

47:57.240 --> 48:00.560
Because they rushed to get it to market and yes, it benefited them in the fact that their

48:00.560 --> 48:06.860
install base is a lot bigger, however, their hardware is kind of shoddy.

48:06.860 --> 48:11.000
I do find it fascinating they dance around the statistic in their response.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.500
They never deny it.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.500
Notice that.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.320
In the response, they don't deny it at all.

48:16.320 --> 48:19.100
I think they expected it.

48:19.100 --> 48:22.520
But here's the thing, what they say at the end of their statement, as much as that's

48:22.520 --> 48:26.040
blowing smoke up my ass, it's true.

48:26.040 --> 48:30.860
The fact that they do have a choke hold on a lot of the big games out there on the market

48:30.860 --> 48:35.600
right now that can only be played on Xbox 360 and that they are doing a lot of things

48:35.600 --> 48:43.280
right in that regard outside of just the system itself is kind of hard to deny.

48:43.280 --> 48:49.340
That's why I'm essentially, I guess some of you might say, taking it a little bit.

48:49.340 --> 48:56.840
But at the same time, I think if you're a consumer out there and you haven't bought

48:56.840 --> 49:01.200
a 360 yet and you're worried that, okay, if I buy a 360 it's going to fail, I think that

49:01.200 --> 49:06.280
worry right now, it shouldn't be a worry because now the systems have gotten to the point though

49:06.280 --> 49:09.200
where they aren't failing like they were doing before.

49:09.200 --> 49:13.600
And I think it is safe to buy it now because of all the hardware revisions they've done.

49:13.600 --> 49:17.440
What they really should have done is all those revisions before the console was released,

49:17.440 --> 49:22.440
but hey, they made a huge mistake and now they're in the process of trying to pick up

49:22.440 --> 49:24.240
the pieces and fixing the problem.

49:24.240 --> 49:26.200
But yeah, will people forget about this?

49:26.200 --> 49:28.280
Will people remember this for the next console launch?

49:28.280 --> 49:33.060
Yeah, you better damn believe it and there will be a lot of people probably waiting and

49:33.060 --> 49:38.300
seeing if there's going to be issues with their next console.

49:38.300 --> 49:41.920
By the way, if you're curious what I decided to do with my Xbox 360, I am-

49:41.920 --> 49:44.160
He's going to set it on fire and throw it off a cliff.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.160
I might.

49:45.160 --> 49:51.160
No, I decided I'm going to, although that would be kind of fun actually, but I'm going

49:51.160 --> 49:52.160
to give it a try.

49:52.160 --> 49:56.080
I'm going to let Loki try to fix it because he knows how to fix them apparently, so I

49:56.080 --> 49:57.080
will let him try.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.960
I have a 50% success rate here.

49:58.960 --> 50:03.400
Well, I'll take my chance.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.280
This way I don't have to ship it off and pay those costs or anything and Loki will do it

50:07.280 --> 50:08.280
for free.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.280
Yep.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.640
And I'll pay for parts or whatever.

50:10.640 --> 50:15.080
Also, if it doesn't work, then I know Bobby has a friend that will buy for parts, so I

50:15.080 --> 50:19.840
will send it to the junkyard to be scrapped at the pick and pull basically of Xbox 360s.

50:19.840 --> 50:25.080
I will do that unless they don't want it because Loki ruins it, then I will set it on fire

50:25.080 --> 50:26.080
and throw it off the cliff.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.080
I'll try not to ruin it too much.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.840
All right, try it please because I do want to send it off to the virtual pick and pull

50:30.840 --> 50:32.880
if that happens.

50:32.880 --> 50:37.440
And I will, if I have to because Loki can't fix it, not that I don't have faith in Loki,

50:37.440 --> 50:40.440
but if Loki can't fix it, then I am not going to buy an Xbox 360 Elite.

50:40.440 --> 50:43.920
I'm not going to wait for the price drop because I decided that was a stupid idea.

50:43.920 --> 50:48.800
Why would I in turn give Microsoft more money for their high-end console?

50:48.800 --> 50:50.400
Because the first one failed.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.400
That was dumb.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.960
That was an e-jerk reaction of mine.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.120
I take it back.

50:54.120 --> 51:01.440
I would instead buy the lowest, cheapest end Xbox 360 I can buy that's not used.

51:01.440 --> 51:05.280
Because if I go for the $199 Xbox Arcade, I don't need a hard drive.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.280
I have one.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.800
I don't need the fancy black color or whatever.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.320
The HDMI is on the arcades now.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.360
I'm fine.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.560
And then at least I'll have HDMI moving forward.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.880
That's my plan.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.680
And Bobby is saying that his friend will want it even ruined.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.680
Great.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.780
So Loki, have fun.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.780
If you fix it, great.

51:24.780 --> 51:26.640
If you don't, off to the pick and pull.

51:26.640 --> 51:29.360
I'm hoping that we're on the positive end of my 50%.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.360
Let's see.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
We'll see.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.360
Hey, I've got to tell you the one-

51:32.360 --> 51:34.580
We'll update your win-loss ratio here on our Twitter.

51:34.580 --> 51:39.120
And the one that did work, that was successful, still works today.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.120
It still works.

51:40.120 --> 51:41.120
It's awesome.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.880
I keep waiting for it to fail again, but-

51:42.880 --> 51:45.440
I will donate my 360 to science.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
That is what I'm doing.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
Alright.

51:48.440 --> 51:51.000
Well, hey, question.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.600
When you did your repairs, was your failure rate closer to the beginning or closer to

51:56.600 --> 51:57.600
the end?

51:57.600 --> 51:58.600
It was the end.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.600
Uh-huh.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.200
The first one worked flawlessly.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.400
Second one, not so much.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.240
Well, that's okay, because you know what?

52:05.240 --> 52:08.560
You can still be in business, because your failure rate is close to Microsoft's failure

52:08.560 --> 52:09.560
rate, and they're still kicking.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.560
Exactly.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.560
So you know what?

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
Off to Loki's repair shop.

52:12.560 --> 52:15.080
And I blame their console for my failure anyways.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.080
Alright.

52:16.080 --> 52:21.920
Let's move on, because I'm just going to get more angsty comments if I continue on this

52:21.920 --> 52:24.000
whole tirade with the 360 and so forth.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.560
It is a tricky line here.

52:26.560 --> 52:33.840
I do feel a sense of, damn it, shit, fuck, with the whole Xbox 360 red ringing.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.320
But at the same time, I do understand shit happens.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.120
But it just makes me- I don't know if angry is the right word.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.120
It makes me irritated.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.120
Did you try doing it without the-

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
Shut up.

52:42.120 --> 52:47.520
It makes me irritated that so many people are having the same problem, and yet Microsoft

52:47.520 --> 52:49.360
just says, well, but we're still cool.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.360
We're still the best.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.280
Did you try it without the hard drive?

52:52.280 --> 52:53.280
You know what?

52:53.280 --> 52:54.280
I didn't.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.920
I just decided I've been having, in my personal life, I've been having the most shitty week

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
you could possibly imagine.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.000
I'm faking it really well on the show tonight.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.240
Here's the thing, is that I just decided I'm not going to make my week worse by even trying

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
that 360 this week.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
Alright.

53:07.240 --> 53:08.240
No problem.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.240
I'll take care of it.

53:09.240 --> 53:10.240
I promise.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.240
I will.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.240
Well, how about other stuff, huh?

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
Yes.

53:13.240 --> 53:19.920
How about some stuff about something that I particularly am sick of hearing about, but

53:19.920 --> 53:22.320
it is newsworthy.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
How about some World of Warcraft stuff?

53:24.320 --> 53:25.320
Alright.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.040
For all of you addicts, pop the vein.

53:28.040 --> 53:30.040
It's time to go.

53:30.040 --> 53:35.480
Well, you know, they had the whole cataclysm, whatever the fuck thing that they're doing,

53:35.480 --> 53:41.680
and they have the new races, the goblin and wargun, which actually look kind of cool.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.040
I thought, like werewolves-

53:43.040 --> 53:44.040
Shocking.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.560
That's totally unexpected.

53:45.560 --> 53:51.240
And they've raised the cap to 85 for levels, but now they're going back and revamping old

53:51.240 --> 53:54.420
zones and changing them completely.

53:54.420 --> 54:01.440
Like since the big cataclysm thing, some areas are destroyed, and then some of the places

54:01.440 --> 54:09.240
like Desolace and the Barrens are becoming green.

54:09.240 --> 54:13.260
They're redesigning cities so that you can fly.

54:13.260 --> 54:21.040
And actually in Undercity 2, they are actually having more interaction with the terrain.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.800
You can have flooding happen.

54:23.800 --> 54:28.440
So also seven new zones.

54:28.440 --> 54:35.720
Like Uldum, Mount Hyjal, and the Sunken City, which is an undersea zone, so you get underwater

54:35.720 --> 54:37.800
mounts and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

54:37.800 --> 54:41.680
Twilight Highlands, and Deepholm.

54:41.680 --> 54:46.060
Sounds very dwarfy in name.

54:46.060 --> 54:48.640
So all the rumors we heard about last week were essentially true.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.640
Yeah.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.040
It's a new profession, archaeology.

54:52.040 --> 54:55.080
Oh, so you can be your Indiana Jones, but a goblin.

54:55.080 --> 54:58.000
You know what, that actually would be enough to have me try it out.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
The archaeology edition.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Really?

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah, because I'd really like to see how something like that would enhance your character.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.840
It's been a while since I've played, but honestly though, I'm sticking with RO.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.400
I don't know if this is enough to get me back to WoW.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.520
I guess I have to see it when the expansion comes out.

55:14.520 --> 55:15.520
Never say never.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.760
I said I would never go back to Final Fantasy XI, and I did for a month, so whatever.

55:18.760 --> 55:22.720
But you know, I do think it's interesting because they've been talking about revamping

55:22.720 --> 55:29.400
old Azeroth for a long time, and now they're going to do it and make you pay for it.

55:29.400 --> 55:33.120
But I mean, to be fair, it does sound like they're doing a lot to it, and from what I

55:33.120 --> 55:37.440
understand, even the free players, or I shouldn't say free players, but even those without the

55:37.440 --> 55:43.060
expansion will still get some of those benefits because Azeroth is going to change basically

55:43.060 --> 55:44.680
to accommodate this new expansion.

55:44.680 --> 55:47.640
So it's interesting.

55:47.640 --> 55:51.720
I do think some of the other things that they've talked about briefly, like the guild leveling

55:51.720 --> 55:56.880
and the guild charts and so forth, it will probably lead to more guild drama, but I do

55:56.880 --> 55:57.880
find it interesting.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.920
Well, there is some other stuff.

55:59.920 --> 56:06.320
There's a little bit more as far as the racial abilities for the new races.

56:06.320 --> 56:11.520
For Worgen, you can switch between human and Worgen form instantaneously at will.

56:11.520 --> 56:16.320
You have Dark Flight, which increases movement speed by 70% for 10 seconds with a 3 minute

56:16.320 --> 56:17.840
cooldown.

56:17.840 --> 56:25.200
Viciousness, you have Flare, and then Goblins are basically like the Ferengi of the Horde.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.200
They're the businessmen.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.200
Makes sense.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.200
Yeah, that's a good comparison.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.160
So you can...

56:30.160 --> 56:31.160
There's actually a...

56:31.160 --> 56:32.160
You kind of look like Qwark too.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.960
A skill called...

56:33.960 --> 56:36.480
I wonder if you can give them Umax.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.480
You know where...

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480
Anyway.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.320
I wonder if they can make me a warp core breach.

56:40.320 --> 56:42.040
Do they have the lobes for business?

56:42.040 --> 56:44.480
God, it's so nerdy.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.280
But Best Deals Anywhere is one of their skills.

56:47.280 --> 56:52.700
Better Living Through Chemistry, which increases Alchemy skill by 15 points.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.800
And I like Time is Money.

56:54.800 --> 56:59.280
So it increases attack and casting speed by 1%.

56:59.280 --> 57:06.240
The Archeology skill gives you the ability to excavate hidden items in ruins.

57:06.240 --> 57:13.320
You can do research notes that let you unlock new abilities for the Path of the Titans character

57:13.320 --> 57:14.640
progression.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.980
So go flip that whip.

57:18.980 --> 57:22.120
I think personally as a WoW player, I think Goblins are annoying.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.880
I would never want to play as one.

57:23.880 --> 57:28.440
I was disappointed to hear that.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.760
Well the...

57:29.760 --> 57:34.640
For other stuff going on with that, with the new dungeons, I actually have the level list

57:34.640 --> 57:36.840
up for the 5-man dungeons.

57:36.840 --> 57:40.800
You know, I don't want to say 5-man, I'm going to say 5-character dungeons.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.040
That works for me.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.320
Or a party of 5.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.320
Or Sentai.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.320
Ahhhh.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.320
Anyway.

57:46.320 --> 57:50.680
Grim Battle is 85.

57:50.680 --> 57:53.920
Skywall is 80-82.

57:53.920 --> 57:59.160
Abyssal Maw is 80-83 and an 82-84.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.040
Deep Home is 80-83.

58:01.040 --> 58:04.320
Uldum is 83-84 and an 85.

58:04.320 --> 58:07.080
Blackrock Caverns for level 85.

58:07.080 --> 58:14.560
And then they do 5-person versions of 2 of the older dungeons.

58:14.560 --> 58:20.960
The Deadmines has a level 85 version and Shadowfang Keep.

58:20.960 --> 58:21.960
Also new...

58:21.960 --> 58:26.040
And for those that don't know, those are some beloved old school instances from original

58:26.040 --> 58:27.400
WoW.

58:27.400 --> 58:34.920
And then for new raids, 2 of them have been revealed.

58:34.920 --> 58:42.540
One is the Firelands, and one of them is called Nefarian's Throne Room, which features Blackwing

58:42.540 --> 58:47.440
Lairs and Boss Nefarian, hence the name Har Har.

58:47.440 --> 58:53.320
I do think it's interesting, this whole heroic Deadmines thing, because if you play original

58:53.320 --> 58:58.240
Deadmines at the level you're supposed to be playing Deadmines at, it takes forever.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.680
So it's going to be interesting to see if they scale it back so Deadmines does not take

59:01.680 --> 59:07.040
as long to get through, or if it's still going to be like an epic 4 hour run.

59:07.040 --> 59:12.520
Well they're also putting in, with the 3.3 patch, there's a panel that's cross-server

59:12.520 --> 59:19.160
LFG for 5-man dungeons, so you can get more people together to do.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
They're also...

59:20.160 --> 59:21.160
That's needed, actually.

59:21.160 --> 59:23.960
There's also new race combinations available now.

59:23.960 --> 59:30.120
You have Human Hunter, Orc Mage, Night Elf Mage, Blood Elf Warrior, Dwarf Shaman, Dwarf

59:30.120 --> 59:36.560
Mage, Undead Hunter, Tauren Paladin, Tauren Priest, Gnome Priest, and Troll Druid.

59:36.560 --> 59:43.720
There's a stat overhaul, the stats are being simplified.

59:43.720 --> 59:52.520
So you have your spell power, MP5 armor penetration, all of that's gone.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.880
It's really just a whole bunch of them, it's actually all up on the WoW page.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:04.160
For other class changes, just look on the panel on your thing, it's all there.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:12.320
Flying mounts are available in Azeroth, so you can fly around all you want to.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.440
And thank heavens.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.800
You have your guild progression, they actually have a numerical method now.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.760
You have rated Battlegrounds, new PvP changes, a bunch of other crap.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.280
And a bunch of other stuff that I personally don't care about.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.280
It sounds like it's going to be a pretty good expansion, a good swift kick in the pants

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.360
to the game.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.280
That's one thing Blizzard likes to do, they really like to change that game up.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.720
That game is nothing like it used to be, you know what I mean?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.840
I think that that's, honestly, the whole point that I see with that is, this is how, going

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.680
through their head, well, people get tired of the same old, same old, same old, same

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680
old.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.080
You know, people are going to leave when they get bored with it.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.200
Well, why not give them no excuse to get bored, why not make something new?

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.400
However, the thing that bored me was the way the game plays in general, and the fact that

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:12.120
there's a bunch of idiots playing it, so that's still not enough to- I mean, I would like

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120
to-

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.360
You probably have to find the right click to play with.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.160
I would like to check it out.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.320
You know, I think I might consider looking at it.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.200
You know, I certainly haven't installed World of Warcraft on this computer, and I still

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.200
have my account, you know.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.480
It might be worth it for me to check out, but certainly not until I'm, you know, healed

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:40.160
up enough to be able to play a game that requires a keyboard.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160
And we'll see.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.680
I have other MMOs I want to check out for now.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680
Please play R.O. with me.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.000
I want to look at Aion, Aion's out next month, I'm definitely going to pick that up.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I want to play that.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It's out next month, you should.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Check it out.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Aion-

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Star Trek!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And then Star Trek next year, and Final Fantasy XIV.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Yeah.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.840
No, some of the gameplay video came out for that from Gamescom, ho ho ho ho ho.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840
That looks sweet.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.840
Did you see it?

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
Doesn't it look sweet?

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840
Uh huh.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.840
I am sorry, but I am all over Final Fantasy XIV.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
Star Trek!

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
Because I have to-

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840
That looks great.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:14.840
I have to make the O.L.A.rian, and I've already started picking races that I want to make

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.240
the O.L.A.rians from.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.880
Well you go on with your bad self.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880
They're going to be orange.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.400
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.480
Well speaking of something that leaked out way early anyways, the PS3 Slim has finally

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.480
been announced.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.400
Oh my god, didn't know that was coming.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.320
But yes, it is coming out and oddly enough, or I guess it's not really odd at all, but

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.120
you remember all those box shots and stuff that were being leaked out and that kind of

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
stuff?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120
Yeah, those were all authentic.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:53.800
So, the new Slim system is 30% smaller, or actually 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and uses

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.200
34% less power.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:05.680
It comes with a 120GB hard drive, and of course, at the new price of $299, and that is actually

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:13.600
going to be released supposedly in the first week of September, but you know, according

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.520
to Gamestop, it's actually supposed to be coming out next week, or as early as next

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:27.960
week, but basically we'll be replacing the 80GB system and the 160GB system that they

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.680
had out already.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.920
Which just goes to prove that whenever you try to put out a cease and desist, you're

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.200
only validating the material.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:44.040
Yep, and on top of all this, they dropped the 80GB system to $299 as well, and they

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.800
also dropped the 160GB system to $399, which begs the question, why the hell did you do

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800
that?

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800
At least in that order.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.960
I mean, they totally don't get it.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.760
Why would you drop the price of those two systems?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.400
I understand to clear them out.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400
That's fine.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.720
That makes perfect sense.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.720
But then you announce the new system at the same time.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.880
Okay, great, so now I have these new Slim 120GB systems in my store with 80GB systems that

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880
are the same price.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880
Duh!

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.920
Am I going to buy the new system?

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.280
Does it have a larger hard drive for the same price?

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.080
Yeah, I think I will.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.280
And at the same time, would you really spend an extra $100 for an extra 40GB on your hard

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.560
drive?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.560
Probably not.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.760
So you've just rendered those two other systems completely useless.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.560
Maybe they'll bundle in a game or a movie?

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.560
They bundle in a game.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.360
They bundle in the first Uncharted with the first one, with the 160GB system.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.720
But really, is that still worth the extra?

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.000
You're basically paying for the game and then a little bit extra for the hard drive, so

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.360
that's not really a good deal anyways.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.200
And you can probably buy Uncharted for cheap anyways.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.240
Yeah, I don't know all that.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.080
There's also been a discovery, apparently when they were registering the Slim, I guess,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:01.040
with the FCC and all this, you know, trademarks and that kind of stuff, they were using false

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.040
business names.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.480
I guess Sand Dollar Enterprise, some fictitious businesses.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.880
Thank you Sony, now you have been found out and people are going to be looking for that

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880
crap now.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.840
So, and they did, and they now found that there's also been an FCC, I guess, filing

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:25.480
for another SKU that's going to be with a 250GB hard drive, so that's probably coming

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480
later on.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.760
So, great!

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.720
Now we know that there's a larger hard drive system coming out later on, why the hell are

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.480
we going to, you know, if you're really not in a hurry to buy a system, you'll probably

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480
want to wait.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.200
Well, this other one might be more money too.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200
It probably will be.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.280
Plus, I still don't really know, what do I put on this hard drive?

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.080
All those games installs, because, you know, most of the games that are released now on

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.200
BluRay do require an install because their drive is slow.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:00.880
And the other thing too, in case you're wondering, the system did get rid of the alternative

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.680
operating system install as well, so if you're thinking about installing Linux on this Slim

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.800
system, you are dead wrong, that will be happening.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800
So uh...

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.800
They'll find a way.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.400
So way to go, Sony, removing features from your system as well now.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.960
We know they're going to find a way, the Linux community is stubborn.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.480
Plus, how many people really, honestly, are getting the Playstation 3 to install Linux

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480
on it?

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.600
And it's not like the fat ones are hard to find.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.120
It's only offering them a challenge now.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.080
I mean, seriously, I mean, people may have been okay with not doing it because, you know,

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:43.000
it's readily available now, but the thing is, why would you remove that?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.080
I understand that you don't need to necessarily do that, but really, did that cost anything

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080
to them?

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.080
No?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080
Not really?

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.560
Oh, the other funny thing too is it takes two seconds longer to boot up each time, for

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560
whatever reason.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560
Strange.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560
Yeah.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560
Hmm.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.280
Maybe it must be some of the new chips they're using or something.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280
It's the new firmware.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280
Ah.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.000
Well, speaking of the new firmware, that is coming out soon, 3.0 Firmware is going to

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.240
be doing a total revamp at the cross-media bar, and adding a new What's New section.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.160
It's replacing the information board, and I guess now, whenever you start your PS3,

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.960
you're going to get this interactive Playstation news, whatever that means.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.120
It'll actually be under the Playstation Network icon, and you can see the latest game, video,

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.400
Playstation Network news release in some type of animated format.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.960
I'm assuming that's like that whole, when you hover your mouse over, or not the mouse,

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.360
but you know what I mean, when you have the thing in place, you can kind of see in the

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.520
background, some of the stuff, except now you can interact with that background, if

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.640
that makes sense at all.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.160
Also, a status indicator is coming.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.640
This will be located in the top right corner of your Playstation 3.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:52.280
It'll show your user icon that you have, however many friends that you have that are online,

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.200
and also, most importantly, a little mail indicator if you have any new messages.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200
So, that's pretty cool.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.760
Also, we'll have a little scrolling tick bar with the latest news from PSN, which I think

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.160
they already kind of have.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.720
So, that'll just be adapted into this new status indicator.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:11.520
Also, apparently, now when you hit the PS button, no longer will the battery life indicator

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.000
sit right on top of the clock.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.760
You know what's kind of cool, though, is those new dynamic themes that they have.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.280
Have you seen those?

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.120
They're animated themes now, that you can have in the background, so like they have

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.600
a little big planet one where the Sackboy's running on, you know, a planet.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.240
And I guess you also now have premium avatars, they're saying.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.640
Animated avatars.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.600
Like your little icons that you have?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.240
Yeah, we'll be animated now.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.240
Interesting.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.680
The friends list is getting also reformatted.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.080
Shortcuts to the Playstation store, because naturally they want to make it easier for

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.720
you to buy stuff, and apparently a big change coming to trophies.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.880
With 3.0 firmware, game developers will now be able to modify how trophies are displayed

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.160
for add-on content.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:00.600
So apparently you still have the list combined when you're looking at the Playstation network

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.800
or what have you, but I guess the developers have the freedom to use subcategories and

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.800
all this stuff.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800
Could be interesting.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Well, that's cool.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.240
Did it add a trophy room that they promised us years ago for this thing?

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.160
Yeah, but that was a home update, wasn't it?

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160
Well, yeah.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
But still.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
Where's my trophy room?

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.360
I'm just kind of curious what ever happened to that.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.800
I guess they had some big problems, I don't know.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Oh, I know what it is.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.840
Let's promise and then wait to deliver.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.920
Sg100Matt in our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com asks an interesting question about Playstation.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.800
Why is it that with each new incuration of the PS3, it keeps losing features?

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.640
It's lost backwards compatibility, flash card reader, fewer USB slots, and now the inability

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.000
to install an OS onto it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.240
Is it just me, or shouldn't a console evolve with each new SKU?

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.920
From the looks of it, it's devolving so much that we will lose controller support in two

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
years.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.520
Obviously, that part was sarcastic.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.800
They're dropping stuff out of the system to cut the cost of the system because that's

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.520
the only way they can drop it to $299 without losing $500 or whatever on each system.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.480
But I thought backwards compatibility was all software based now.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.080
And it's not the whole PS2 in your PS3 like it was at the beginning.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.280
I thought so too, but for whatever reason, maybe licensing.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.080
I can't imagine it would be licensing though because Linux is free.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.000
I mean it's not even really, I mean you don't even have to...

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.920
You're buying, or you're not really buying, you're downloading Linux anyways off the internet

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.160
and installing it to it.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.280
It's not like it's already there or something like that.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.400
Alright, we got one more story from Jamie, then we're gonna get into some release dates.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.600
Um, I got a pony.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.600
There's my story.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.600
No, I'm kidding.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
Congrats.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.200
Um, well you know me, a big comic book nerd.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.200
Well this is news that makes me particularly happy as long as they get good comics.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:49.160
There's a digital comic reader that's gonna be on the PSP in December.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:56.960
They actually are working with Marvel to have hundreds of comics available, which is actually,

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.040
it really goes in along with what Marvel's been doing lately with their digital comics

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.880
and their motion comic that they've been doing lately.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.200
So um, but this is pretty cool.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:17.440
You get also Archie and Image comics and um, but they're not saying though if it's gonna

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.440
be a free upgrade or if it's something that you have to buy or if you have to buy the

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440
comics or whatever.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.080
I'm sure you have to buy the comics themselves.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.120
Well I mean, you know what I mean, if you get a subscription service or something.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120
Oh okay.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:34.640
So they haven't listed the specifics, but we should be hearing something before too

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.600
long.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600
What do you guys think?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.320
Is this something as a comic book fan you uh, are really excited about, Dark Saga?

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.480
Um, well I like actually buying comics.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:54.520
I mean I love going to the store and I mean I, I read a bunch of digital comics anyway,

01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:01.800
but you know what, actually now that I think about it, I will, I don't really use our PSP

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.080
that much, but if I did, I would be interested in it because I actually have downloaded a

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.200
number of comics um, on my iPhone.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:17.240
I was, I read like the first uh, three graphic novels of Bone on my uh, on my uh, iPhone

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:23.120
and I downloaded the uh, Star Trek uh, movie countdown, the tie-in that was supposed to

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:29.360
be the prequel to the events in the movie and I, I thought that was very convenient.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.160
It was definitely cheaper than going and you know, paying three bucks for the issue.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:39.960
Um, but then again, I've gone right out and I've bought the, I'm reading the, the Nero

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.600
comics about you know, the deleted scenes pretty much for what happened in the movie.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.080
Um, it's, it's a good idea.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
I think it's a good idea.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.120
I think that a lot of people use their PSPs as a multimedia tool and I think it's going

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.760
to be a really good thing and Marvel I know would have to be behind it because they have

01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.280
been pushing the whole digital comic thing, you know, pretty hardcore, so.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.640
Um, Akdeft in our chat room says, I hope it's subscription based.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.720
SH-2100 Matt says, what does DC Comics have to say about this?

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.640
They did make the DC Universe game PS3 exclusive and now they're supporting its competition.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.560
But this doesn't strike me as the type of thing that DC Comics like, couldn't get in

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.040
on as well if they wanted to.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.040
Yeah.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.360
I, I think that, well and on top of that, you know, DC and Marvel have teamed up before,

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.720
I mean, for a number of, of things, I think that, you know, DC would have to hop in on

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.560
this and it's, it would be good for all the, the businesses and you know what I would actually

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:38.120
like to see, is see, um, some of the indie comic companies be included in this.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.120
You know, um, maybe even a web comic reader.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.120
Well, they are going to have, um, it's not just, um, Marvel though.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.920
Well, so I said Archie and Image are involved as well, but I didn't mention anything on

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.920
DC.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.200
I wouldn't see why DC couldn't jump in on that.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.800
I don't know.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.840
They're more than welcome, I guess.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.320
Just haven't done it yet.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320
Hmm.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.680
Alright, well, let's move on to some release dates before the, uh, comics get here and

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.880
we lose Dark Soccer because she'll be too busy reading them.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.000
Alright, well, this week, um, we've got a few things coming out, um, actually some good

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
stuff.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.560
The Metroid Prime Trilogy on the Wii is, uh, making its way out and of course you get three

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.840
games to the price of one there, uh, even though they've all been released before.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:30.000
Uh, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box making its way out on DS this week.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.760
Uh, Raven Squad Hidden Dagger on Xbox 360, um, also on PC.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:45.120
Cursed Mountain on the Nintendo Wii, uh, Sudoku Ball Detective on DS, also Harvest Moon Frantic

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.720
Farming on DS, kind of the sequel to Puzzle Day Harvest Moon.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:58.560
Um, also this week, um, Batman Arkham Asylum making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:08.240
360, uh, Fallout 3 Broken Seal and Point Lookout available on PC and on Xbox 360, Dissidia

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.680
Final Fantasy making its way out on the PSP, which will be really awesome, Real Fishing

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:20.760
Angler's Dream on the Nintendo Wii, uh, this is going to be an excellent title for the

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.760
DS.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.400
Uh, The Click, Diss, and Make Up, and of course I'm being sarcastic there, it's probably going

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.400
to really suck.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:35.000
Um, same with this one, Wizards of Waverly Place, uh, based on the Disney, I don't know,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:44.320
teen comedy, um, Emergency Room Real Life Rescues on the DS, um, Harvest Moon Magical

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:52.960
Melee being ported to the Wii, Mana Kimia 2 Fall of Alchemy getting its limited edition

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.640
on PlayStation 2, and that would be it.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.960
Alright, let's move into some Japanese release dates, and after a couple of slow weeks, we

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.520
finally have a pretty busy week over in Japan, uh, look at the Xbox 360 Dream Club comes

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.260
out on the Xbox 360, and I'm sorry, I have to read the description of this game, uh,

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.840
it certainly does not sound like something we will be getting over here, but it looks

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.600
uh, all kinds of awesome.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.040
Do you have a pure heart?

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040
Welcome in.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.400
Beautiful women are bowing at you as you sweep across the luxurious lounge, pick your favorite

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.820
hostess and drink with them to get to know them more.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.560
You have an annual ticket to the Dream Club.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.840
In this 365 days, enjoy the company of these ladies fully.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.160
Earn money, plan your schedule, and improve your alcohol capacity.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.280
Chat with the ladies to persuade them to drink with you.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.800
They may divulge secrets about themselves if you prove to be a good conversationist

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.920
and drinker.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.960
The ladies are not just companions, they are performers as well.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.320
Watch them sing and dance.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.800
The better you know them, the more songs they will perform.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.120
Be sure to get to the club during the special event nights instead of the usual maid outfits.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.800
The ladies will welcome you in get-ups such as yukatas and bikinis.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.320
Have a lovely clubbing experience.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.060
Get your VIP card today.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:01.880
That game again is Dream Club from D3, and it sounds pretty fucking amazing and I want

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.880
to play it.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.600
You know if it's D3, we may get that over here, because D3, they're, um, likely to put

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.920
out crazy shit like that over here, especially since the women in this game from the screen,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.760
based on the screenshots, have giant boobies.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760
Of course.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.440
Another game with chicks with giant boobies, also on the Xbox 360 this week, Memories Off

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440
6 Next Relation.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.640
Yeah, Next Relation.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.840
Well, hopefully, she's not related if, uh, if it's Memories Are Off.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.640
Uh, moving on to other consoles on the PlayStation 3.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.680
Grand Theft Auto 4 gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.360
By the way, Fear 2 also making its way out to Japan this week.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.880
That was also on the Xbox 360, just so you know.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.300
Uh, also Kane & Lynch Dead Men gets a price reduction in Japan this week, but those other

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.760
two games I mentioned look to be exclusive to the Xbox 360.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.360
However, on the Nintendo Wii, you have a game called Tamaran coming out this week from Ignition

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.880
Entertainment, and if we move on back to the PlayStation 2, there's a couple of games coming

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.880
out.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:08.720
Uh, Gendai Daisenryaku Ishoku Soku Hatsu comes out this week.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.080
I have no idea what the hell that is, but it has something to do with balance, is in

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.080
the title?

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.640
No, it looks like a war game.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.960
Looks like, uh, looks like actually kind of like a, oh, looks like kind of like an RTS

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.840
type of strategy, it looks like a strategy command and conquer-ish type of game on the

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.840
PlayStation 2.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.080
Uh, Memories Off 6 is getting a PlayStation 2 port.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.080
Go figure.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.000
Uh, Tomb Raider Anniversary and Legend to get price reductions if you never caught those

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.160
on the PlayStation 2.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:41.440
On the Nintendo DS, Supa Robo Gakuen comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.800
Gakuen is high school.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.680
That Supa, so it's Robot High School, is that what this is?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.680
Yeah, is it G-A-K-U-E-N?

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680
Yes it is.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.060
Yeah, that would be high school.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.760
So yeah, looks like Robot High School is the game here, and I'm trying to look at screenshots

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.340
but can't, but it looks like a little type of a strategy type game coming out this week

01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.680
on the DS.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:08.660
And uh, lastly, looking at the PSP real quick, um, well you can import in Japan the English

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:14.120
language version of Final Fantasy Dissida if you, if you want, because obviously that's

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.160
a big game we're getting out here this week.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.440
I do want to point out though, Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is out in Japan this week.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.120
That is the new Soul Calibur game on PSP, so I bet we do have some hardcore Soul Calibur

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.280
fans that will want to import that.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.280
Probably not.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.880
We can then get that actually.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.880
Fine.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.040
That's going to do it for PSP releases and Japanese releases.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.680
Well for our UK releases, on the 26th we have Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao, and

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.000
Watchmen, The End is Nigh Part 2 on Xbox 360, both of those.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.040
On the 27th, um, for PS3 is Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:57.080
On the 28th we have Allied Ace Pilots on DS, Batman Arkham Asylum, Xbox 360 and PS3,

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:05.920
King of Fighters XII, meh, um, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on DS, Soul Calibur Broken,

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:13.320
uh, Destiny on PSP, um, Supercar Challenge, and World Cup of Pool.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.240
What is it?

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240
World Cup of Pool?

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.240
Pool.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.240
Oh.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.240
Let me, let me make sure.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.040
It makes it sound like it's a cup full of pool, but I'm, it's like chlorine flavored

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.040
water, but I'm assuming it's...

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040
I'm a sinking cup of poo.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.160
I'm assuming it's like a swimming game or something.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160
Cup of poo.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.160
I hope.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.160
Ew.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.160
If it's a cup of poo.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.160
Two girls, World Cup.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.680
La la la la la.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.360
Um, anyways, I don't know how to follow that.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.240
But um, we'll talk about the PlayStation Network.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.320
Sony, one of the things they announced while they were talking about, you know, secret

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.280
console revisions and stuff like that.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.320
Is that they're...

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.880
This was also something that was totally not rumored to be announced at, you know, Gamescom.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:08.520
But Sony introduced minis, which are byte-sized downloads, I guess, that are on the PlayStation

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.520
Network.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.000
They're gonna be available for the PSP and the PSP Go.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And basically these titles will have 100 megabyte size limits.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.560
They'll be exclusive to the PlayStation Network.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.240
And basically they will start on October 1st, which is the same day that the PSP Go is really

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.480
released.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.400
And they will apparently be less costly to develop for.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.420
And cost less to gamers, of course.

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.920
No real prices have been announced yet.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:41.200
They plan on having 15 at launch and 50 by the end of the year.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.600
And some of the titles that they did mention were coming out include Tetris, Field Runners,

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.960
Heroes of Sparta, and Minigore.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:56.760
And once again, goes back to the question, why exactly would I need a PSP Go?

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:03.320
Because, you know, if they had made this exclusive for the PSP Go, that might make it a little

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.560
bit worth it because then...

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.440
But if they hadn't, you would have bitched about it.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440
And I would have bitched about it.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.800
We all would have bitched about it.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.680
Because, you know, it doesn't sound like...

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:16.200
It's like there's no hardware feature that, you know, there's no reason these games can't

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.560
be on the original PSP.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.560
So why not?

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.560
Exactly.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.280
Which, you know, begs the question, why would I buy the PSP Go?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.800
Why would anybody buy the PSP Go other than the fact that it has a sliding screen?

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.040
Is that really worth more money?

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.740
I will buy a PSP Go when the price drops.

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.380
And it won't take long.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.080
I bet you anything it will not take long.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.920
It may be 2010, but it won't take long.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920
No.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:41.920
And I'll get...

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.520
When the price of the PSP Go matches the price of the PSP, which has to happen eventually,

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520
I will buy one.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.080
You know what they're going to do?

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.480
They're going to get rid of the original PSP.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.480
And then they're going to make you buy that.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.880
Of course, it's not going to happen anytime soon, because you've got, like, bundles now

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.200
for this idea.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.160
You've got a bundle for Gran Turismo coming out in September.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:06.920
You've got a bundle with Assassin's Creed coming out, you know, in November.

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.780
There's no reason that you can't find a PSP 3000.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:13.920
Alpha Catanagram in chat says, I would buy a PSP Go when the price drop occurs and use

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.620
it as a belt buckle.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:16.620
Actually sounds kind of awesome.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.520
Have you ever seen those belt buckles with, like, the scrolling text on them?

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.440
And like, it gets everybody to look at your crotch?

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.920
You can order those at ThinkGeek.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920
I've seen those before.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.240
The LED belt buckles.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.240
Yeah.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.240
Kind of cool.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.560
Imagine having a PSP Go, like, showing a little movie on your crotch.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.760
It'd be fun.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.720
Which is actually footage of your crotch.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.720
You nasty.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720
Which would be fun.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.120
Well, did they ever say what's going to happen with my UMDs?

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
How I'm going to put my UMDs on my Go?

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.200
No, but I read a funny article by GameStop, you know, they were saying that they expect

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.560
them to be traded in.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.320
Not that there's going to be an official program, it's just that people are going to be so,

01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:00.560
you know, I don't know, enamored with PSP Go that they're just going to, you know, throw

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.800
all their UMDs out and re-buy the content again because they love Sony so much.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
Right.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800
Yeah.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.240
Well, I'm sure there are some fanboys that will, but I just don't see it being an epidemic.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.480
No, it's, I'm sure that people would do that because, you know, obviously Sony's not giving

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:24.560
them a way to, and you know, my thing is that at the same time, if you do own an original

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.560
PSP system, and they may just say, you know, fuck you, you own an original PSP system,

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.480
why the hell do we need a method for you to, you know, dump your UMDs on there, just buy

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.920
new games, or, I don't know, just don't buy a new system because you have a PSP system

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920
already.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.320
Why would you buy another system, you idiot?

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320
That's just my opinion there.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.240
I don't know, yeah, I'm just still not seeing the reasons to jump ship.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:57.000
The Go, though, I think is, would be good for people who don't already own.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.160
Even then, it's not the right price.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.060
I would say if you don't own a PSP, buy a PSP.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:07.480
You don't need the PSP Go yet, there's nothing that super that it gets you unless you really

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.560
need a quiet system or something, I don't know.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.440
And there are ways you can run stuff off your memory card even now.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.580
I mean, no, legit ways, actually, I mean, you can still purchase all those games online

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.160
if you do want to do digital downloads, just buy your own memory card.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:32.440
What do you want to bet that half of the games in this mini thing are virtual console rehashes,

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:38.320
you know, old games sold yet again, Galaga on my PSP?

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.200
They already have PlayStation Network games that are, you know, independent titles.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.440
They're like PlayStation Network games, like Super Stardust and stuff like that.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.440
How's that any different?

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.100
Okay, the file sizes are smaller, they're gonna be cheaper, whoop the shit, okay?

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.180
Just make them cheaper and make the file sizes smaller.

01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:00.360
You don't need to necessarily make it a whole new category of games, I guess if you want

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.640
to draw more attention to the PSP or something, you can do that, which is what they did, but

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.060
I don't know.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.600
Making something cheaper and, you know, cheaper to develop for doesn't really, I don't know,

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.320
doesn't really warrant them putting another bullet point in their system, I guess.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.920
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week, and I

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.600
want to talk about a classic band, of course, the Beatles.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.120
Rumor was this week that a SingStar version of the Beatles was going to be coming out

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.960
around the time that the Beatles rock band was coming out, and it turns out, I guess

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.880
that was a British gaming outlet that reported the whole SingStar Beatles coming out, but

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.360
it is not true.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.140
MTV Games and Harmonics came out this week and said, nope, we have the exclusive rights

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.580
to create music games based on the Beatles.

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.880
They have an exclusive partnership with Apple Core Limited, so there will be no SingStar

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:48.880
Beatles.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.520
So why this rumor then?

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:56.460
Apparently they are thinking about a version of the Beatles rock band that would be the

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.640
game, and only microphones.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.800
So basically it would be a singing version of the game, no instruments.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.400
Beatles karaoke revolution.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.980
Well, it's still rock band, it's just a singing version of it, so you don't have the instruments,

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.960
you just have the singing parts.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.380
To be fair, you know, again, it's about options, it goes back to what we were talking about

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.760
earlier in the show, it's just another way to buy the game, and you know what, there

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.520
are some people that don't really want all those plastic instruments.

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:30.440
And I could see this really being aimed at the Beatles fans who are wanting to have the

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.640
game, but they don't want all this plastic instrument crap in their house.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.480
Those people are communists.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.480
But I understand.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480
I'm kidding.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.920
It might be a small audience, but it's an audience, and certainly they want to sell

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.160
this game to as many people as possible.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
That's true.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.440
Or perhaps you already own all the instruments and everything and you just want some extra

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.880
microphones so you can do your three part harmonies.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.160
This is actually a certainly plausible outcome as well.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.740
So no singing star Beatles, but you know, hey, rock band Beatles, it's not like it looks

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.740
that bad or anything.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.040
It looks pretty awesome, actually.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.080
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.240
And if they are planning on releasing this, they sure as hell haven't told anyone yet.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.560
Well, this might also only be in Britain.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.040
Keep in mind, all this news is coming out of Europe, so it may not be something that's

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.720
actually planned here, but it might be just planned over there, so who knows?

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720
Yeah.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.600
So it's that time of the show where we're going to take a trip down History Lane and

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.520
take a look at gaming's past and take a trip into the vault and find a game that Dark Soccer

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.680
thinks you kids ought to be playing right the hell now.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.680
So Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:40.480
The Classic Game of the Week is Silfied for Sega CD.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.760
It actually originally came out in Japan on the PC-8801 in 1986, and then the Mega CD

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.960
version came out, which of course was the Sega CD over here.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.480
They've actually made a ton of improvements over the PC-88 version.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:07.760
Instead of just having the static background, the background for each level is full motion

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:20.120
video with a polygon overlay for all the ships and asteroids and everything coming at you.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.400
And it's a really, really good game.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:35.540
There was an FM7 version that was also released, and it came out in the US for PC, but that

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:38.320
was put up by Sierra Online.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:46.920
At any rate, it was actually a competitor with Star Fox for the day, except Star Fox

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:58.000
was all fully rendered on the cartridge, and like I said, this had a full motion video

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:07.760
background, and it still is a traditional kind of shooter.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.720
Honestly though, graphically it was better, but it didn't have that innovative feel to

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.680
it that Star Fox did.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:22.400
So yeah, terrorists take over the earth, and we get these cool ships, we get to shoot people

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.800
in the end.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:32.760
I did have a sequel, which was Silphed The Lost Planet, which was a PS2 game.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:41.440
And then Project Silphed was actually a spiritual successor, not really a game in the series.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:53.560
A little bit of trivia about Silphed 2 is that there was a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh that's

01:30:53.560 --> 01:31:02.080
called Silphed, and in Mahoro-Matic there's actually a jetpack that Mahoro used that's

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.800
called the Silphed.

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:11.520
And then in BlazBlue, Silphed is the name of Rachel Alucard's drive.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:17.320
This game also has one of the best intros ever.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.440
It's really one that you have to watch and listen to, and the other thing that I really

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:27.520
dig about this one, as opposed to the original version of it, is as you're flying through

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:35.760
the level, you get radio feedback, you know, from the rest of the fleet.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760
Like in Star Fox.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:41.600
No, it's not quite the same.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.480
In Star Fox, it's your, like, if you go back earlier in that file, we'll play a little

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:49.480
bit of it, it's a little different.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480
There we go.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.480
It does have really good music, too.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.480
I heard it yelling.

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480
There you go.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:32:18.480
Yeah, and see, as in Star Fox, the way it's going, the way it's going, the way it's going,

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:27.720
the way it was, is that it was your squadron, your formation of ships, you know, you had

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:35.920
your partners, and this is, you're getting, like, have you ever, alright, I know this

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.680
is kind of old school, but have you ever listened to just CB channels?

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680
Back in the day, yeah.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:47.040
When you can hear the other conversations going on, you're hearing the communications

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:52.080
going up from the fleet, because, like, you know, look at it in a realistic sense.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:58.800
If you were part of the squadron, and orders went out, or feedback went out, or some sort

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.360
of announcement, it may not be necessarily directed to you, but you're still gonna hear

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.360
it.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.360
Do people still use CB?

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.360
Yes, actually.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.360
Wow.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:14.440
Um, well, trackers do, um, but if you see, though, in that sense, then it actually adds

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.480
a sense of realism to the game.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.560
And for the record, in, in terms of, if you're traveling with people, like, and you're in

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.680
separate vehicles, having a CB is actually very good for areas that you're in that you'll

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:28.160
lose, uh, cell reception.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.000
Plus cell cost minutes, anyway.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.440
Not always.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:38.720
But, um, but at any rate, you know, I think it's a fantastic game.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.720
Alright, so there it is, Silpheed.

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.720
Silpheed.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.720
At least I didn't say Slipheed.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.720
Alright.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.440
I got people used to do that all the time, too.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:53.040
Your classic game of the week, not the newer one that came out on 360.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.560
This is the, uh, old school one on Saturn.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.720
Well, the sequel, though, is PS2.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:58.720
Huh.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.720
I think I played that one.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:00.720
I think I played that one.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720
I think I have it somewhere.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.680
And, and for the record, they were talking about Policenauts earlier.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.760
I came very close to using Policenauts as, uh, the classic game.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.640
You know, we're gonna get into a story about Policenauts later, but I'll, uh, I'll leave

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640
that for later.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640
Oh, I didn't mean to.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.640
No, that's alright.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.640
It's a Twitter thing, so it's gonna come up later.

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640
Yeah.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.640
Alright.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.720
Alright, speaking of Twitter, we'll get into Twitter topics right after a little bit of

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.720
a break.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.720
We are gonna take a break, though, here in studio to do, uh, cover more.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.120
Um, actually, we take the break, though, to, uh, you know, get energized.

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.120
To pee.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.120
To pee.

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120
To, uh, maybe order pizza.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.120
We'll see.

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.120
Mmm, Becky's bringing me tacos.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.120
We can do all that.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.120
Oh, lucky.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.960
But, I was going to offer to you on the air, guys, do you want me to make you guys pizza?

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.440
Oh, that's actually okay.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.480
I probably shouldn't, cause I had, I had a big ol' crepe earlier today.

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.760
I have organic mushroom and black olive pizzas.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.560
That does sound kinda good.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.800
I also have, um, plain cheese pizzas.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:56.800
Maybe.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.440
No, I don't want any unless you're gonna have some.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.640
Dude, if I make pizza, I can just have it for lunch tomorrow.

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.640
Hi.

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.640
We'll see.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.640
Alright.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.600
My man, by the way, is not here, so I am gonna be going stir crazy.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.640
So people will be seeing me at IRC.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.640
Whee!

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.640
Alright.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.640
We're gonna take a break.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.840
We'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.680
We have plenty more to talk about in Part B tonight, including our rapid fire news and,

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.560
uh, talk about, um, a new interesting achievement on Xbox 360 for killing 1,000 children in

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:31.280
a game and, uh, a possible revamp of DSiWare and, uh, a Final Fantasy game you will probably

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.560
never ever see.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.680
We will talk about all of that in Part B after a quick break, so stay tuned here on Orange

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:45.280
Launch Radio.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:51.280
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, episode number 335 for this Sunday,

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.280
August 23rd, 2009.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.240
Of course, we are taping live on All Games Radio.

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.880
Our friends over there let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night, so come join

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.880
in the fun!

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.280
There's, uh, programming such as the Bobby Black Wolf Show also on Sunday nights, the

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.520
tapes with us, and there's, of course, programming on All Games Radio throughout the week.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.720
And, um, you can take All Games in your pocket with you everywhere you go if you're an iPhone

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.720
owner.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.760
There's an All Games Radio app available on the store, which is actually pretty cool.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.080
I gotta give kudos to whoever wrote it, because what I like about it is that it actually shows

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.960
a little picture of, uh, like the video game that song, that song is playing, uh, not always

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.560
during our show, because our tags during the break aren't standardized, but, uh, like,

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:33.560
and when we're on the air, it actually shows a little picture, our little Orange Launch

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.120
Radio album art while we're actually live, which I think is kinda cool.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.960
So, uh, kudos to whoever wrote that application, I know somebody at the All Games staff did

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.960
that, so, good job.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.400
Hopefully we see something like it for other phones and other platforms soon, who knows,

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.400
I don't know how, uh, how easy other things are to develop for.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.640
But I do know we have a PSP website.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640
I don't think there's a lot of-

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.640
That never gets updated!

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.760
Not, we should work on that, I just paid to have our domain names extended a couple, uh,

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.080
actually this past week.

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:07.640
I paid something like 60 bucks to extend OrangeLaunchRadio.com and OLRPSP.com for two years, because I use

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.280
the, um, anonymous things, I don't want my address out there on the internet, but, uh,

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.160
yeah, so, uh, it costs me a little more money since I do that, but, you know, whatever.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.760
I still have a OLR-We, but I haven't done anything with that.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760
Do you?

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760
Yeah.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:24.760
And we need, like, an OLRPS3.com or something like that.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:25.760
Yeah, maybe.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.760
We'll see one these days.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760
I'll work on it someday.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.040
You know, if you're interested in helping us build websites and develop, you wanna,

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.000
for that, we pay great, nothing.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.920
But pat on the back and job well done.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:37.920
Eventually.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.920
It just, I don't know.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.680
Well, we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in a little bit, but I do wanna

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.480
mention, actually we're gonna get into Twitter topics in a minute, but I do wanna mention

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.200
before we get to Twitter topics tonight, um, I wanna mention, I went to Dave & Buster's

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.880
yesterday, which is a place I have not been for a while, and, uh, you know, if you haven't

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.960
been to Dave & Buster's, it's like, I guess there's another chain on the East Coast called

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.960
Jillian's.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960
It's very similar to it as well.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.800
Um, it's kind of like Chuck E. Cheese, but for adults, because there's an open bar.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.200
But oh my God, the bar's a ripoff.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.520
Do you know how much a drink cost me at Dave & Buster's?

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.600
I ordered a Malibu and pineapple.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.600
You know how much that cost me?

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600
Uh, seven bucks.

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.600
Seven fifty.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Damn close.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Six fifty.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600
That's what it got.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.160
And after I left a tip, really, it's seven fifty.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160
Because I always tip.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.400
Well, you know, though, I used to go for my birthday every year, and...

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.720
I miss that.

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.280
And between everyone who bought me drinks and buying drinks for myself, I would probably

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.560
easily go through about seventy dollars worth of liquor.

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:32.560
You've seen me do it.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560
Yep.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.560
Good times, though.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560
It's basically gambling for tickets.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.060
But I have on my card eight thousand five hundred tickets, which is almost enough for

01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.200
me to get a free Xbox 360 game.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.360
It's nine thousand tickets for an Xbox 360 game.

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.480
I have eighty five hundred tickets.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.880
Now, what's interesting also about Dave & Buster's, the reason why I want to bring it up.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:56.200
They were actually, um, had for sale a little like, I hadn't seen this, like a little table

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.220
top arcade cabinet.

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.040
Not a full size arcade cabinet, but a table top arcade cabinet.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.240
It was some type of Namco twenty fifth anniversary thing.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240
Yeah.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.000
So it was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Galaga were all on it.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.040
They wanted a hundred and ninety five thousand tickets for that thing.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.600
That's like three thousand dollars in real money.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.000
They're, trust me, they're not really that expensive.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I was going to say.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Dang.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.800
Probably a few hundred bucks, that's it.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.440
You could build one cheaper.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440
Probably.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440
But it did look pretty cool.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.940
I was kind of curious to get one, but whatever.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940
It was fun.

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:33.960
Um, we have some questions in chat room.

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.760
Um, I can't pronounce this name, but T-O-A-G-A-C. Toagak wants to know, where is this PSP radio

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.000
app?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.960
We haven't talked about the radio app in a while, but we do have a radio app that will

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.240
work on your PSP, right, Logie?

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.240
Yeah.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.800
It works on, um, the actual PSP, O-O-L-R PSP site, you can download it.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:58.480
It's basically, um, something that you replace your, or it's a radio player, you just install

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.640
it to your memory stick, where you would put your radio players, I think there's a guide

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.400
on there somewhere, um, to do that, and once you do that, it will connect to a website,

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.240
and you can literally listen to the all-game stream, um, straight from your PSP, just like

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.400
you would, you know, the stations, and there's some RSS feeds and stuff, and I hope it still

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.880
works correctly, because I know they've changed their website since then, I used to pull stuff

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.240
off the all-game site, so God knows, because I haven't used my PSP in a long time, but,

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.240
um...

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.240
I think it still works.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.240
The stream's still in the same place, that's the important part, right?

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.240
The stream's still in the same place, yes, but like, some of the stuff that I've made

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.680
for it, because it was all fancy-looking.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.520
So it may be a little broken, but it'll still get you the stream, so you can listen to us

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.720
on the iPhone on the all-games app, you can listen to us on the PSP on the O-L-R app,

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720
you're covered.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720
One way or another.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.720
Alright, uh, Twitter topics tonight, every night we invite you guys, we need a theme

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.500
song for Twitter topics, I don't have anything, I'll have to think about that for next week.

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:53.440
Like, Conan O'Brien has a little theme song for his Twitter segment.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.040
You know what, you should do, um...

01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.040
I don't know, yeah, it's...

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040
Rislem.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.040
I don't know.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.040
Yeah, I don't know.

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.040
I was picking something up.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040
I'm not picking something up next time.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.560
Alright, in the meantime, don't call me during the show, why are my parents calling me during

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.560
the show?

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.520
You should use the beep, you should use that beep.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.600
What beep?

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.640
That beep-beep should be the theme for Twitter topics?

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.440
Alright, yeah

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.180
We have I'm not reading the name in chat cuz they're all naming themselves immature names

01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:24.800
But I see Twitter tracker Twitter tracker Twitter tracker. That's what the from the Tonight Show by the way change your names to something more mature

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.080
I'm not reading black cock all right

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:32.720
Let's see you haven't had that in a while Twitter topics tonight. We'll start with them

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.440
ray

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:42.960
Ayanami wants us to talk about raystorm HD and not just because his name is in it, but apparently there is a new game coming out called

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.660
Raystorm HD. This is a remake possibly of an old-school title game

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.320
apparently they

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:57.720
It appeared on partner net that's where they saw it partner net is Xbox's little testing grounds for us

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:05.760
Let's talk about partner net somebody did ooh, so there it is raystorm HD. I don't remember the first one very well is this

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.880
I I almost feel like I should bring it up on YouTube and look at a clip of this does anyone know the game Jamie

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.660
Do you know raystorm if it has to do with what was a ray crisis?

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.480
Then I think so

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.600
Hold on I'm bringing up some of the gameplay here in studio, so I can check this out

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:29.600
Oh, this is like a punch. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it okay fun series

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.760
So if you shmup fans all right well the graphics of nice

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.040
Major targeting and this is an arcade game originally wasn't it I?

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.960
Don't remember, but I've got I've got all kinds of versions of that series

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:49.160
Is that a vertical game that looks like a vertical the graphics are kind of rad for something this old school

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.160
I imagine it has to be an arcade game

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.680
I might have to check that game out that looks kind of cool. I don't know much about it, but I like a little clip

01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.680
I'm seeing you could probably borrow ours

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.700
Cool, all right. Uh let's see moving on

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.760
Take array wants to know to KO ray. Sorry wants to know

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.480
Would the ol army be interested in raising money for extra life?

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:16.060
I hope you can discuss this tonight, and then gave me a link and this is kind of interesting. It's a

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:19.220
A fundraiser that's going on called extra life

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:24.340
And they're calling it a 24-hour gaming marathon to fund pediatric cancer research and treatment

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.500
And I guess this is taking place on October 17th of this year

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:32.980
And they're trying to get all these sites to come together to raise money for this

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:39.780
Extra life charity, and it's to raise money for pediatric cancer which sounds like a great cause honestly

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.660
It's going to be 8 a.m.. On October 17th, and they have all these groups participating

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:46.660
I guess our tech sarcastic gamer

01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:50.620
I've not listened to that show, but I've seen their thing on iTunes

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:53.260
This part of this

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:58.940
Destructoid is apparently on board as well limit break radio. I guess they'll probably be doing a Final Fantasy 11 marathon

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.540
Wants to know if we could come on board as well um

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:06.700
Maybe I don't want to commit to something if I can't give it a hundred percent

01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.220
But I think it's a great cause and I think if we don't do it ourselves

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.120
We'll have to support somebody else doing it, but I don't know what do you guys think gaming marathon?

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.740
October 17th could we do it probably 24 hours worth of games?

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:22.780
Obscure fucking vault games would be the theme of our marathon. I don't think anybody else could do that I

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:28.300
Think that would be good and to keep the the continuation going

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.740
We'll have a different systems hooked up to that

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:35.580
While one systems going we can switch games to a new one and just pass a controller over so that we don't have a lull

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:38.140
I'm playing maybe like a new game every hour or something works for me

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:42.460
So I figured out because I don't know if we could do that here because it might be just adventure marathon

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:44.660
It might be too small of a space here. We might have to do it at the

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:48.460
Room, but maybe I don't know if we could get all this stuff

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.740
I think because there's also that the weather should be better

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.780
We could always go back to the garage

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:57.820
But we'll see if we do it on the big TV though we can actually put up a cam footage without it

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.500
Without a

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.420
refresh hmm

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:07.460
Because you've seen me take pictures off of my TV. I Loki would you be willing to do it too?

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:13.980
Could we do this for 24 hours you do it? I have HD capture stuff now mm-hmm, so I could capture

01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:21.700
Once I figure something out we let's you I don't want to commit to we're 100% sure we can give it our all

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.700
But we are interested

01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:27.140
I think we've been talking about doing a gaming marathon for a long time so it'd be fun to get in on something like this

01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:30.220
with some other podcasts and things like that and certainly the causes is

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:35.260
Great, so we want to help I still I still though wanted

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.940
you know along the same lines want to do a

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.860
a

01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:47.580
Classic game segment every week too. You know I think we should do nothing, but classic games like we should just do obscure

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.580
Fuck I'm not talking about for that. I'm talking about

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:55.260
You know us having a classic gaming. No like on YouTube or something. Yeah, might be fun

01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:59.340
I don't know if you guys have some ideas I get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch ready calm

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:05.580
I'd be curious what you guys think would be fun for the marathon, so we'll see um so

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.540
Thanks for the heads up on that

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:11.540
I'm not sure I'll have to read a little more in that website about who we contact for more information

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:17.100
But if you're out there listening, please get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch rated calm because I think

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:19.860
That could be fun

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:28.340
Tweet from act deft to our Twitter, or wants us to mention the police knots English localization apparently there is a fan

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:33.900
Translation of police knots that was finished now this game of course was out on the PlayStation 1

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:40.020
It was also on the Sega Saturn and get this the 3do and what makes this game notable is that it was a Hideo?

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:43.780
Kojima game that was the the thing that made this game notable

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.380
I don't know a whole lot about this game, but it looks like kind of a very cutscene heavy game

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.380
Which is no surprise at all because it was a Hideo Kojima game, but it also looked like a point

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:57.260
Yeah, it's like a point-and-click game like it's like a shadow gate or deja vu kind of game, right?

01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:04.620
What's point-and-click game so it has but it never came out in English, but the fans got together and translated it

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.980
And it's a patch that you can apply to your

01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:12.220
Rom, I'm supposing of police knots. I don't know what version it is

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.380
That they patched I'm assuming it's got to be the ps1

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:22.180
That's probably the easiest one, but there you go, so if you want to check out police knots you can do that now

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:26.060
In a completely non-legit way well

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.780
I mean if you actually own the import game

01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:33.940
And you make a copy of it dump your own copy of it with whatever programs out there, and you patch it with this yeah

01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:39.860
You probably know that most people aren't going to do this all right that are downloading this or probably getting it illegally

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:45.220
But I know what it's the game is 13 years old, and I say if they if they cared that much about it

01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:47.220
They would have translated to English 13 years ago

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.420
Obviously they don't care at this point. Nope. They don't care so

01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:57.740
There you go all right all right the dark soccer. I think is like digging it out of the vault right now

01:47:58.420 --> 01:47:59.740
so

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:04.460
And act F2 says in chat right now that I think it's the ps1 version so there you go

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:11.500
Um a couple more quick Twitter topics technicolor with the three wants to know what are our thoughts on the halo 3 o DST

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.860
Tour truck thing going around the country right now. I wonder if they have one of those at the state fair

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.940
They had Rock Band 2 there last year. It's only going game stops. Oh is it yeah?

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:22.700
I guess if you want to check out the game is certainly a good way to do it

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.540
No publicity is gonna be bad publicity in that regard. It's like a little slice e3 in your backyard

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:32.800
It's only a few more weeks away. I was like a month away. I mean is that close. Yeah, it's coming on 22nd

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:37.500
September interesting I don't know any okay

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:44.140
Play halo 3 there. There's a good impression on what halo DST is gonna be like I mean really they haven't changed too much

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:47.980
I mean yeah, you're playing you know the shock trooper

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:53.700
But and it's not the scales been kind of dropped down a little bit, but I don't know

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:56.500
It's not like it's like night and day gameplay. I think

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:05.940
Hmm all right well last more Twitter topics tiger claw 305 says Blizzard is planning a pseudo land support for Starcraft 2 and possibly

01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.940
Diablo 3 and links us to a story

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.500
Talking about I there was a quote in here. I wanted to read

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.500
where

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:20.180
The interviewer and this is from Shaq news.com asked the developer if they were possibly working on a solution

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.420
That would be like a pseudo land connection where the game will check in with battle net to authenticate

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:28.300
And then it'll go back to acting like a LAN and they replied something like that

01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:30.660
Maintaining a connection with battle.net

01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.300
I don't know if it's once or periodically

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:37.980
But then also having a peer-to-peer connection between players to facilitate a very low ping high bandwidth connection

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:43.520
So those are the things that they're working on so a bit of an olive branch to the community. Maybe I don't know

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.540
Hopefully I would think this type of thing was probably always planned

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:50.580
But they they're gonna want the regular pings to battle.net to make sure the game is legit

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.940
You know because if they only pinged at once somebody would figure out a way to patch that they're gonna figure out a way to patch

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.660
It anyways it doesn't matter

01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:02.740
I think I think the planners are gonna have to give the concession that they're gonna have to attach to battle net to give this

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:09.380
Game, but they'll at least not have to play through battle net because that would suck if battle net goes down your whole game is fucked

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:15.460
Right so yeah, hopefully there'll be some type of a concession there SB. Hale tweets us and says

01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:20.380
$300 ps3 definitely not an under-the-radar story, but for those of us Xbox 360

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:26.860
And we owners do you feel there's a need to own all three consoles besides the fact that the ps3 is a blu-ray player of course

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.860
I've yet to find a good reason why I shouldn't pick one up at that price

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:34.260
Hmm well you know the golden rule of gaming here at orange lounge radio

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:38.860
Is that a system is only as good as the games that are on it the interesting thing about the PlayStation though?

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:43.960
As a console is that you also have that added blu-ray in so you do I mean whether?

01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:48.540
You know you say besides that or not you have to factor that in a little bit to your decision

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.540
But I think the question is really going to be

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.360
It does what the PlayStation 3 offer

01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:59.220
As far as exclusive games and things you can't get on your Xbox 360 is that what you want?

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.140
Do you want games like little big planet?

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:05.460
Do you want mag do you want you know some of the Final Fantasy 14?

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:10.660
And some of these games that are PlayStation 3 exclusive is that worth the $300 to you if so then yeah?

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.620
You got to get one if not right now

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.300
Then you can stand away a little bit

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:19.240
But also don't discount the other features of the PlayStation 3 the fact that it is a pretty good media device as well

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:25.420
You know that it does have home if that's something that interests you and the whole fact that you can have that the online movie

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:31.620
Store which has some different offerings than the Xbox 360 does if that you know the HD movies and all that are important to you

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.240
I think you have to consider all of that

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:39.220
But in the end if you're getting everything that you possibly need out of gaming on your 360 then no you don't need a ps3

01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:44.460
but if there's something that the ps3 offers you that you need and

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:46.900
It I will say it's a hell of a lot quieter

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.700
Then go for it

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:55.740
But if you oh by the way if you don't have an HDTV though, there's no point in getting blu-ray it really isn't but

01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.180
I'm assuming you probably are an HDTV owner and

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:02.980
Zebun Chow wants to point out Final Fantasy 14 is gonna be on the PC too. That's a good point

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:09.140
So you know and that may be where most people want to play it and there we go Dark Sakura found her copy of police

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:10.900
Nauts on the PlayStation 1

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.660
There it is. I wish we had webcam in this studio, but we don't know well

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:20.920
But it's definitely all in Japanese. You won't put down the website the pics orange lounge radio. All right, there we go

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.100
One more and sorry if we didn't get to all the tweets tonight, but Matt OS

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:30.480
I can't say his last name. It says this j100 Matt Matt

01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:37.060
Ostrowski, I think says interesting story about a company that is close to making the first ps3 mod chip

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:41.440
Who could a mod chip be coming soon to the PlayStation 3? Have you heard about this?

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.860
Loki, no, but that would be a pain in the ass to burn stuff on to

01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:50.940
You know blu-ray and stuff blu-ray discs are really expensive and that's like, you know

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:53.580
almost 50 gigs of data

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:59.340
But I know for a fact that every every single PlayStation 3 game that comes out is being dumped

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:04.940
So, you know just in case for whatever happened, you know, whatever they do come up with a mod chip

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:13.220
Well, apparently it's a mod chip that's gonna happen and it's called the bells are chip and it works on all models all regions

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:19.940
Direct boot of ps3 original import and backup games direct boot of ps2 original important backup games

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:25.460
I'm assuming that means only if your console plays ps2 games does multi region blu-rays multi region DVDs

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:31.640
No configuration disk needed. It's a transparent stealth operation. They call it no USB interface

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.920
It's up-to-date only 12 wires to solder

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.640
solder yeah, sorry solder

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.280
tempting

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:46.000
Yeah, but still you have to solder and what if what if they fix it with a patch that's gonna you're gonna be screwed because

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.440
That thing's hardwired to your system. My Wii is

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:55.200
Soldered and it has a soldered in mod chip. I'm not worried about it because you get that that thing has an on-off switch, huh?

01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah, but I don't use it. Hmm. It's always on I mean they have it just in case

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And it's only really have them been updated once and really I don't need the on-off switch on there

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.200
that's just an optional thing you can install in there and

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.800
I

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:17.380
mean worst case scenario if for whatever reason this decided, you know, they broke it or something or they

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:24.920
You know disable the chip. You can always clip those wires that you solder. Hmm. Yes, that's true. I am interested

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:30.000
Well, there's a whole thing on Twitter. Look at the you the tweets to olr ask as I share 100 Mac

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.280
Cuz he opposed so much. All right

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.480
Huh, I don't know I didn't see on that site. So check it out. All right

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.720
If you want to tweet us a story that's we like stuff that's under the radar because obviously you knew this week

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.840
We were gonna talk about Wow cataclysm. You knew we were gonna talk about the ps3 slim

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.840
But usually the stuff that might fall off the radar

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:53.360
We definitely want you to bring to our attention on Twitter or any topics you want us to discuss

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.600
Keep an eye out Sundays a couple hours before we go live. I usually put a shout out on there

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:03.640
All right. Let's get into some rapid-fire news Loki. You're gonna need just you need to stop reading tweets

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.840
By the way, the first picture is up

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.680
Oh the police knots game and that's what an orange lounge radio.com in our picture gallery, right? Cool. I've been waiting

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:16.360
I'm ready to go. All right, Loki rapid-fire news. All right, Robin. You may remember that Sega had a

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:24.040
You know a survey asking what should be the next game that they published on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and we were well

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.920
Earthworm Jim won that however

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.760
they had to pull Earthworm Jim because

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.120
Unfortunately interplay at the same time also announced that they're making a new Earthworm Jim game for PlayStation Network

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.600
We were an Xbox Live Arcade as well as mobile platforms. So

01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:46.560
New Earthworm Jim coming, but there's still another Xbox Live Arcade Genesis poll. So

01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:49.620
You'll have to see who wins that I think currently right now

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:53.320
Toe jam and Earl was winning that one

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:55.320
Um

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.840
There is a rumor that

01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.760
Looks like Canada will be getting a new elite bundle

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.640
It's gonna be coming with halo 3 and on top of that

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:12.360
They're also going to be throwing in a wireless network adapter, which is kind of cool and all that can be had for

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.940
349.99. I think that's Canadian dollars and

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:22.840
And um apparently it is available it's actually gonna be

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:26.780
It's available at right now at the source

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:33.520
Which is I guess is a circuit circuit city affiliate out of Canada and they have the online offer. It's actually for

01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:36.300
329.99 and

01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.940
That's pretty interesting

01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:40.660
Wow

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.100
huh

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.100
anyways, um

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.700
And then finally in Guitar Hero 5

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.580
Their download content will be incompatible with world tour

01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:52.300
So that's right

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:53.220
if there's new

01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:59.780
download songs that come out now for Guitar Hero 5 you will not be able to download them for world tour because apparently they're adding new

01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.780
features to them and

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:03.660
I

01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:05.660
guess only

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.380
Also the download content for

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.460
world tour I guess of the

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:14.060
158 songs are on world tour and

01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:18.860
Smash hits you'll only be able to download 152 of those

01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:23.060
Back to your console, I guess when you're importing songs

01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:27.740
but I mean that makes sense because rock band there was like five tracks you couldn't download because or three or

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:32.660
Three or five tracks that you couldn't download because of licensing stuff. So hmm

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:38.540
All right. Well, by the way, the chat wants us to mention that toe jam and Earl was the new winner of the poll

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:42.020
Yeah, that's what I thought. It was earthworm Jim remake was mentioned

01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:46.800
Getting into some rapid-fire news over in my corner Diablo 3

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.400
Had its fourth character class revealed and it was spoiled a little bit early by a Korean website

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:58.820
But it was barbarian witch doctor wizard and monk monk is the fourth class there

01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:02.500
I don't know if that's gonna be the last one or if there'll be more after that

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.340
I imagine it's got to be at least one or two more

01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.780
But monk by the way was originally in the Hellfire expansion in the original Diablo

01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:12.260
Where barbarian bard rogue sorcerer and warrior showed up?

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:15.060
So I assume there's gonna be at least a couple more classes that show up in Diablo 3

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:19.180
Although not too many because you know, they got to do the expansions later on, right?

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:27.080
Mm-hmm. Hey the Wii and the DS are getting new Tetris games next year. That's right

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:30.060
It's a partnership between Majesco and Tetris online

01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:34.380
They'll be coming out on the Wii and the DS in the spring of 2010

01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.060
No idea what the Tetris game is going to be like, but you know what Tetris DS is pretty badass

01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.060
I don't know if we necessarily need another one. Oh

01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:50.420
Well, I have judgment is making its way to the PSP that was announced at gamescom this way

01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:54.900
You will get a basically a version of the Eye of Judgment, but of course there is no eye

01:58:54.900 --> 01:59:01.860
Okay, that's why there's no bet there's still a lot of questions as to whether this will use the same cards or what-have-you

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.780
We just know the game is coming out and Loki says it will not count towards the bet

01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.860
Why not look the reason why I won't count towards the bet because it's not as ridiculous as the Eye of Judgment

01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:16.420
The Eye of Judgment is an actual physical card game that you had to play, you know using the PlayStation eye camera

01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:21.020
Basically, it was you know, the camera in the game portion of it was completely

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:25.580
You didn't need it. I mean, it's like playing Magic the Gathering with someone filming you on camera and you know, something like that

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:29.140
This is actually a card game that's in digital form

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:34.500
That's an actual game that counts that that's that's you know, fine that makes sense

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:37.420
you know, that's how they should have done it in the first place, but

01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:43.780
However, if it did come out with like, you know, if they decided to release a version that was a camera

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:47.260
You know and played the same way as the normal Eye of Judgment

01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:51.260
Then yes, I would probably count towards the bet but it's not so sorry

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.260
And you're getting booed from the chat room, but you know what they can do

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.260
Not too bad

01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.260
I completely understand why you're doing that

01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.260
You know, even

01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.260
You're right

01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:03.260
The whole reason we made fun of the game in the first place was the fact because it had the camera to look at the cards

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.260
That was a little silly

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:10.260
I mean, it doesn't matter even if I did add the Eye of Judgment to the bet or whatever

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:14.260
It's still wouldn't meet a million units and it it but it's not so bad

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:19.260
It doesn't meet a million units and it but I'm not gonna do that because it's just stupid

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:20.260
Okay, the whole

02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:21.260
You need to move on

02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.260
Yes, we need to move on

02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:25.260
Yes, we need to find a new cause and a new outfit

02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:26.260
Exactly

02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:29.260
Alright dark soccer

02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:30.260
Do you have some rapid-fire news for us tonight?

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.260
I do indeed

02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:38.260
Actually Midway Europe is now Trade West games

02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:41.260
They were purchased

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:47.260
So, that's actually gone through. It's being fully rebranded.

02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:55.260
Also, LittleBigPlanet is getting a re-release with 18 new levels and 7 download content packs.

02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:57.260
Pretty cool, huh?

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.260
Yeah. I remember when Tradewest, by the way, did Double Dragon back in the day.

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:06.260
They were a big 8-bit developer. I don't know if it's the same company, but I just remember that name.

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:16.260
Well, the LittleBigPlanet packs are going to be the Metal Gear Solid level pack featuring the Paintinator.

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:22.260
Metal Gear Solid costumes, monster costumes, monster packs, history costumes, history pack, and animal costumes.

02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:30.260
Did you see the new announcement that they're going to be adding a new expansion pretty much as epic as the Paintinator and all that stuff?

02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:35.260
Where you actually have real water in the game now. That's going to be pretty awesome.

02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.260
Hopefully we'll get some new levels.

02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:42.260
I love that they're still adding big stuff to the game even though it's been out a while. Props to a media molecule.

02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:52.260
Since we've had some discussion about Hideo Kojima, he actually has said that he finds the Metal Gear Solid series very puzzling too.

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:59.260
Which is why he keeps detailed timelines for all of the characters in the game.

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:07.260
He says, and I quote, this is especially tricky when you create the future first and then go back in time to create something new.

02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:12.260
There are a lot of small aspects where sometimes it doesn't match completely. Sounds like Marvel Comics.

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.260
Or Star Trek.

02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:18.260
Seriously. Well, yeah, but they fixed all that with the movie.

02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.260
Not the newer canon. Just saying.

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:29.260
By the way, one other thing I wanted to mention though was the whole little big planet stuff.

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:33.260
I forgot what I was going to say. Forget it.

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.260
The water levels coming out soon. There's something I wanted to say about that.

02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:42.260
The water, it's real water now so you can actually make real water levels and that kind of stuff.

02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:53.260
One more comment from chat. Amazatsuma on the whole tingle bet says, we will move on once we see Loki dress as Tingle. Am I right, Penelope?

02:02:53.260 --> 02:03:00.260
I renamed them back to OL Army. However, they were balls for a little while.

02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:05.260
You had your opportunity. I can't help it if you can't come through with your end of the bargain.

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:10.260
You know what? It's just like, I don't know. I make bets that I know I'm going to win.

02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:15.260
For example, there was somebody, one of my customers was betting me on the top grossing game this year.

02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:21.260
And he said that, you know, he bet that Wii Sports Resort was going to be the top grossing game.

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:29.260
Not only was he cocky about it, but he said that they would beat out anything, the number two one by two million units.

02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:37.260
And he also said, you know, so my guess, of course, was Modern Warfare 2 because you're a fucking idiot if you think Wii Sports Resort is going to sell that many units.

02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:44.260
And he's like, fine, I'll give you Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. I'm like, you are so stupid.

02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:48.260
But OK, I'll take that bet.

02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.260
I will win that bet as well.

02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:52.260
What is the bet?

02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:58.260
We haven't figured it out yet what the actual prize of the bet will be, but he's so confident he's going to win that he'll probably do something stupid.

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:02.260
So I just have to wait for him to act on it.

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:05.260
Fair enough. Let's get back to some more gaming stories.

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:09.260
We have the mailbag coming up before too long, whether Dark Soccer likes it or not.

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:14.260
And the Skype line tonight, which will probably be kind of short tonight because we've been doing a lot of talking.

02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:18.260
We've taken a lot of calls in the past couple weeks, but we'll at least get a couple of you on the line.

02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:22.260
1877 game OLR, but that won't be for a little while now. So, Loki.

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:34.260
OK. Well, there's apparently an achievement that was discovered for the new game, Fairy Tale Fights, where you get some points for killing 1,000 children.

02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:38.260
Yes, lots of child homicide.

02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:46.260
Of course, the game is actually a beat-em-up that's extremely bloody. Think of like a Castle Crashers type of thing.

02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:58.260
And of course, Yu-Gi-Oh! is reporting though that while this achievement is currently in the works, it's most likely going to be removed from the final game.

02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:01.260
I don't know. I think they should keep it because that'd be funny.

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:07.260
So it's kind of one of those things that's lolsy for now, you know, in their little development, but probably won't actually get out there?

02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:08.260
Yeah.

02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.260
Boy, oh boy. Can you imagine if it really did-

02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:15.260
Your pizza's burnt!

02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:17.260
Dark Soccer burnt my pizza.

02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.260
I'm smelling it. It's smelling nice and toasty.

02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:24.260
I know. It does smell- Oh, no. Is it really, like, crispy? I kind of want to see it, but we're trying to do a radio show.

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:26.260
Can you do a monologue, Loki, while I go look at the burnt pizza?

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:32.260
Can I do a monologue? I don't know what to talk about. We just talked about fairy tale fights.

02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:35.260
The game looks okay. I don't know.

02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:42.260
But they're investigating a burnt pizza as if you haven't seen a burnt pizza before. It's just black and crispier!

02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:45.260
I don't know.

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:54.260
So yes, going back to the bet, there is no way that I'm going to add Eye Judgment PSP to it, even though I am confident if I did that it wouldn't matter.

02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:59.260
But see, that's the problem, though, is once we add Eye Judgment PSP, then where does it stop?

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:02.260
I'm just going to have to keep adding games until you eventually win.

02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:08.260
And who really wants to play that way? That's not a bet. You should have won the first bet in the first place.

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:14.260
Why is everybody so curious about the burnt pizza?

02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:17.260
Oh, they're weird.

02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:19.260
Anyways, um-

02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:21.260
Come back, come back, come back. Sorry.

02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:23.260
Alright, alright.

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:30.260
No, I'm making her upload a picture of it to the pictures blog at orangehonestrader.com so you can see the fail.

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:32.260
Because it's pretty amazing.

02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:38.260
And Becky is here and just brought Dark Sakura tacos. You, ma'am, are possibly the nicest friend ever.

02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:43.260
Because she's been complaining about winning a taco all night long, and look at this.

02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:49.260
She doesn't just bring her a taco. She brought the taco on a fucking silver platter. Look at that.

02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:53.260
It's a dish covered in tin foil. It's a silver platter.

02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:59.260
It's aluminum platter.

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:03.260
I'm getting yelled at from the kitchen. Technically, it's aluminum alloy.

02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:06.260
I thought it was aluminium.

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:10.260
Because you're so British.

02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.260
God, I wish our microphone would pick up the yelling from the kitchen.

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:15.260
I just literally heard screaming, I'm not British!

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:20.260
And deathwishing says in chatroom, there's an achievement on Dirt 2 called two girls, one cup.

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:27.260
It's actually two cups, one girl. It's about winning two cups in the game with one female driver.

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.260
Alright. Let me move on. I'm sorry.

02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:35.260
I'm getting into another story that doesn't involve burnt food or what have you now that the whole house smells like crispy.

02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:40.260
And I'm eyeing the taco on a silver platter that I want to devour.

02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:44.260
Independent Xbox Live game has been banned. Why?

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:48.260
Because of visual sexual assault reminders.

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:52.260
It's a game called And Yet I Love You.

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:54.260
I can't even hear what she's saying.

02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:57.260
Well, she's not on the radio, so we're just ignoring her.

02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:00.260
If you don't have a mic, I can't hear you!

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.260
That's bad radio etiquette.

02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:04.260
Terrible radio etiquette.

02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:09.260
Alright. It was on the Japanese marketplace. It was pulled because it was too erotic.

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:12.260
It was an independent developer, Naoki Sagawa.

02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:14.260
Is this related to the DDR Naoki?

02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.260
No, probably not.

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:19.260
There is no sex in it. It is not an adult game.

02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:24.260
However, apparently there were visual reminders of sexual assault.

02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:28.260
Because in one scene, the girl's hands are restrained.

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:33.260
In one scene, a girl is being pushed down and her panties are visible.

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:37.260
That doesn't mean she's being assaulted. They could be having a fight or wrestling.

02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:40.260
I mean, that's perfectly harmless.

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:44.260
What's interesting about this is that this was just Microsoft Europe that had a problem with the game.

02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:47.260
So Sagawa basically wanted this to be limited to Japan.

02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:52.260
However, Microsoft just basically said you need to stop distribution of this game altogether.

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:55.260
And there it was. It was kicked away.

02:08:55.260 --> 02:09:00.260
Now, what's interesting is that I'm reading this story on Kotaku here, and they make a very good point.

02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:07.260
And they say, by the way, while this is acceptable, you have Dead or Alive where you punch and kick females.

02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:10.260
And you can see their panties pretty well.

02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:14.260
You need to take a picture of the taco on a silver platter and put that on the blog, too,

02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:17.260
because that's pretty amazing what Becky did there.

02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:19.260
The taco is in the platter.

02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:21.260
All right.

02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:26.260
Oh, I thought that was the taco on the platter. Sorry, hi. Bad radio. Bad host.

02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:28.260
Mmm, they're real tacos, too.

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:31.260
I know you're dying for food, but we've got to get your story, Dark Sakura.

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:32.260
My story? Oh, yeah.

02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:33.260
Yes.

02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:34.260
Give me a sec.

02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:36.260
All right. Dark Sakura needs a moment.

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:40.260
Dark Sakura needs freaking food real bad.

02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:42.260
I feel bad about the pizza, although, you know.

02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:44.260
Your pizza's bacon.

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:45.260
Yay.

02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:50.260
So, Sony has to make some explanations.

02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:54.260
They got some explaining to do.

02:09:54.260 --> 02:10:01.260
When they removed the backwards compatibility from the slim,

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:06.260
they needed to say what exactly was going on.

02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:15.260
So, they say, and this is a quote from John Kohler, who's SCEA's director of marketing.

02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:21.260
Now that we're at a point where we're three years into the life cycle of the PS3,

02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:25.260
there are so many PS3 disc-based games that are available that we think,

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:29.260
and notice this from our research, that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3

02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:32.260
cite PS3 games as a primary reason.

02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:36.260
So, basically, they're saying, oh, people don't care about PS2 anymore.

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.260
What do you think?

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:40.260
Chat? People in the studio?

02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.260
Are they right?

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.260
Do people not care about PS2 anymore?

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:46.260
Or as Ray Iyanami in chat says, and I love this,

02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:50.260
backwards compatibility is so last gen.

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:52.260
I remember seeing an old OLR reference.

02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:53.260
I don't know.

02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:54.260
What do you think, Loki?

02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.260
Are they right?

02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:56.260
No, they're not right.

02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:59.260
It's just they're basically saying, why the hell would we give you a feature for free

02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:04.260
when you can buy our PlayStation 2 system for $100?

02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.260
Or soon to be PlayStation 2 downloadable titles.

02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:10.260
I bet you that is what you're going to see in the next year.

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:12.260
Then they're going to start releasing the PlayStation 2 as downloadable titles,

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:14.260
just to fuck us all.

02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:16.260
But we can't add backwards compatibility, Butch.

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:19.260
We can sure as hell emulate these titles perfectly.

02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:21.260
We know software emulation is out there.

02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.260
We know it's possible.

02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:24.260
They just don't want to give it to us.

02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:27.260
Yep. Lame.

02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:29.260
And yes, I do kind of want backwards compatibility.

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:32.260
I mean, yes, I realize the games are old, but I still have them.

02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:34.260
And who doesn't sit there once in a while and go,

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:37.260
you know, I kind of want to play Magic Pen Gel and draw a giant penis.

02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:41.260
You know, it's sometimes we get these desires to play the old PS2 games

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.260
or Final Fantasy 12.

02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:43.260
I never did beat.

02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:48.260
Yes, I have a PlayStation 2 that I could go back and hook up if I really wanted to.

02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.260
But that's valuable shelf space.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:53.260
I have enough crap in my living room as it is.

02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:57.260
I realize Sony likes to live in a world where I don't own a 360 or a Wii,

02:11:57.260 --> 02:12:00.260
but reality check, I do.

02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:05.260
And in order to not have a tangled cobweb of wires behind my television,

02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:08.260
some things had to go.

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:11.260
That's what twist ties are made for.

02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:13.260
Just still.

02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:17.260
I am sending updated pictures of my tacos, by the way.

02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:20.260
I love how we have the food blog going on.

02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:23.260
I posted a link in chat, but it's on orangelunchrody.com.

02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:26.260
And you'll be able to see all these pictures if you're listening on the podcast,

02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:29.260
but you probably don't care.

02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:31.260
All right, anyhow, I don't know.

02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:35.260
I think it's a little silly of them to rid us of the backwards compatibility,

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:39.260
especially when software emulation, at least of some titles, has been done.

02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:43.260
It's a little bit frustrating, but whatever.

02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:47.260
I mean, yeah, true, I can hook up the PS2 if I really want to play them that bad.

02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:52.260
I'm just saying I would be more apt to still buying PlayStation 2 games if they would play...

02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:54.260
I haven't bought a PS2 game since Final Fantasy XII.

02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:56.260
That was the last one I ever bought.

02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:02.260
Yeah. Well, they'll be happy to sell them to you as a digital download later on.

02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:08.260
Well, with the announcement of the PlayStation Network minis,

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:15.260
of course, Nintendo is looking to revamp its DSiWare service to kind of combat it.

02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:20.260
And what they're planning on doing, although the pricing won't change on the actual downloads,

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:24.260
they'll basically stick to the $2, $5, $9 price models,

02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:29.260
they will have a lower barrier to entry for publishers,

02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:34.260
and also they're going to have some size limits as well,

02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:38.260
including, for example, a $5 game must be under 200 megabytes.

02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:43.260
Otherwise, Nintendo will charge a higher royalty.

02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:49.260
Which, that doesn't seem like much of an advantage, but okay.

02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:56.260
And, I don't know. I just think they need some better games on there.

02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:00.260
I know from seeing a lot of reviews I've been reading for different things,

02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:02.260
I always see reviews for clocks and calculators.

02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:06.260
And honestly, I don't need more fucking clocks and calculators.

02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:09.260
I don't need a clock or calculator on my DSi.

02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:13.260
The DSi has a clock, at least I know the regular DS, I don't have a DSi,

02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:17.260
but at least the regular DS has a clock.

02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:20.260
So, I don't get it.

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:21.260
It's themed clocks.

02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:24.260
Silly.

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:29.260
We don't need more clocks or calculators.

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:33.260
What does Nintendo need on DSiWare in order for people to pay attention?

02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:36.260
Virtual console.

02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:38.260
Really?

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:43.260
That would- people would be eating that crap up, okay? Seriously.

02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.260
I guess, but I would just be frustrated,

02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:48.260
because you know they're not gonna let me just carry over the virtual console games I already have.

02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.260
Oh, of course not!

02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:50.260
I'd have to re-buy them.

02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:52.260
And I don't think I'd be- homie don't play that.

02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:54.260
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be-

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.260
Your chair broke.

02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:57.260
Did the chair just break live on air?

02:14:57.260 --> 02:14:58.260
Oops.

02:14:58.260 --> 02:14:59.260
Uh oh.

02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:01.260
That can't be good.

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.260
Oh, it just popped off.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.260
Oh, popped off.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:04.260
No, it broke.

02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.260
Ah, shoddy chair.

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:12.260
Oh dear, tonight's show is-

02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:14.260
I just can't lean back.

02:15:14.260 --> 02:15:15.260
Poor Loki.

02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:18.260
It's alright, at least it's not a-

02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:19.260
Footstool?

02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:22.260
Yes, it's not the footstool.

02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:23.260
Poor Loki, we need to get-

02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:27.260
I almost bought an inflatable chair with my Dave and Buster's tickets.

02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:28.260
No!

02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:31.260
It's a hot pink inflatable chair with a pair of legs on it.

02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:35.260
And now I'm thinking we need one for the studio for Loki.

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:37.260
I'm gonna pick up a folding chair next week.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:39.260
Did you know, in the old studio at my house-

02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.260
So they want a picture of Bork chair?

02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:42.260
No.

02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:44.260
The couch is now gone.

02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:47.260
The ex came and took your couch away.

02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:50.260
I'm glad our studio's here.

02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:51.260
Alright, anyhow.

02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:53.260
Sorry.

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:54.260
Random show is very random.

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.260
Hey!

02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:56.260
Grin!

02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.260
Remember them?

02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:59.260
Well, Grin turned into Frown because they had to close last week.

02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:00.260
And that was because-

02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:01.260
Ah, Frown.

02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:02.260
Yes.

02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:03.260
Grin frowned because they got closed.

02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:05.260
And we shouldn't laugh though, that's not nice.

02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:08.260
But apparently they were the ones behind the Bionic Commando game.

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:10.260
And we didn't end up reporting this on our show last week.

02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:11.260
I mean, it was just kind of a busy show, I guess.

02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:12.260
But they actually closed.

02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:15.260
They were the ones that were behind Bionic Commando.

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:20.260
Which was received a little bit lukewarmly, I guess you could say.

02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:21.260
I mean, some people-

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.260
I have some friends that are really into it, but not-

02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:24.260
It was alright.

02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:25.260
It had the sales figure.

02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:28.260
It didn't reinvigorate the series like a lot of people thought it would.

02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:34.260
And, unfortunately, the studio just had to go bye-bye because of it, I guess.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:41.260
But, apparently, one of the former employees posted to their LinkedIn profile that Grin

02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:43.260
was working on an unreleased masterpiece.

02:16:43.260 --> 02:16:49.260
And that masterpiece was a Final Fantasy game that they were working on for Squeenix.

02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:55.260
I guess this guy on his personal site, Tomislav Spajek, actually posted to his personal site

02:16:55.260 --> 02:17:01.260
some concept art, and Fortress, apparently, is the game that was like a Final Fantasy game

02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:02.260
that was being worked on.

02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:08.260
Probably not like Final Fantasy XV or anything like that, but some type of spin-off Final Fantasy game.

02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:10.260
Do I have to close? Does that make them frown?

02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:13.260
That's what I already asked. I made that joke a minute ago.

02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:14.260
I didn't hear you. I was-

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.260
You were too busy stuffing your face full of taco.

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:17.260
No, I was busy kicking someone out of the chat room.

02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:18.260
No.

02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.260
Regulate!

02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:22.260
Do not anger, Doc Sockers.

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:26.260
No, you act like a fucking child in the chat room. I'm gonna treat you like a freaking child.

02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:28.260
Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.

02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:30.260
This is not a democracy.

02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:32.260
This is a cheerocracy.

02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:37.260
No, this is a freaking fashion-

02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:39.260
Becky got the reference. Did you hear the wall in the background?

02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:40.260
Yes.

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:41.260
Thank you.

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:42.260
Alright.

02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:44.260
It's a dark socorosity.

02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:49.260
Alright, speaking of dark socorosity,

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:52.260
it's her chance to take over the show for a little bit.

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:57.260
She's gonna have to swallow the taco and get to the mailbag.

02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:01.260
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you send your emails.

02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:02.260
This is not a fish taco.

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.260
Every week.

02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:06.260
Chew that taco, dark socor.

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:09.260
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. Let's read some emails.

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:15.260
Dear Rob, fuck you. Love, Jamie.

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:17.260
Dear Jamie, fuck you back. Love, Rob.

02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:19.260
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:21.260
Anyway, first thing I know.

02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:23.260
I'm only on me.

02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:24.260
Hey, guys.

02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:26.260
Hi.

02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.260
This summer has exhausted me.

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:30.260
Are you spent?

02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:36.260
Between the summer of Arcade PSN and the two Monkey Island games that have been released, I am worn out.

02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:38.260
Need a cigarette?

02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:39.260
Just kidding. No smoke.

02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:44.260
I just got into the Champions Online beta, and let me tell you, they're doing it all wrong.

02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:50.260
There's some real good qualities in that game, but it will take a lot to fix things if they want to attract people to the game.

02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:55.260
Then again, with an offer that includes a spot in the Star Trek beta, I don't think they need to.

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:58.260
Okay, I feel I need to ask a question now.

02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:01.260
What three games are you looking forward to next month, if any?

02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:05.260
I'm waiting on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Scribblenauts, and Beatles Rock Band.

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.260
Uh, keep what you're doing, guys. Peace.

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:09.260
And that's from Dan Chateau.

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:11.260
Um.

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:12.260
Excuse me.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:13.260
I held the microphone away.

02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:14.260
Hi, Dan Chateau.

02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:18.260
Dude, I'm totally waiting. I totally, totally want Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.260
Except it's some freaking stupid Civil War crap, and I hate the Civil War crap.

02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.260
Um, Scribblenauts, I'm also looking forward to, um...

02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.260
You make Abraham Lincoln cry.

02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.260
What?

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:34.260
Oh, shut up. It's the Marvel Civil War crap that they did that I got so sick of.

02:19:34.260 --> 02:19:37.260
They could at least do, like, the Skrull War or something.

02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:39.260
The Secret Invasion.

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:43.260
Uh, to answer the question for me, Ion, I'm looking forward to.

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:46.260
Uh, Beatles Rock Band is a good example of something else I'm looking forward to.

02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:48.260
Um, that'll be very cool.

02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:52.260
And, um, I don't know. Everything's kind of a blur for Christmas,

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:55.260
and a lot of the stuff I was interested in got pushed back to 2010.

02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:59.260
So, um, I'm not sure. Those are definitely the two at the top of my list.

02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:02.260
It depends on if I get my 360 fix soon or not.

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:05.260
Loki? Games you're looking forward to? Any planned purchases?

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:07.260
Um, TJ Hero.

02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:10.260
Oh, that would be number three for me. I definitely have to check that out. Good call.

02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:12.260
I thought that was October for some reason, not September.

02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:14.260
It is October. Oh. Sorry.

02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:16.260
But it's almost September, so we can have it.

02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:17.260
Eh, good enough. Close enough.

02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:18.260
September, I don't really have any...

02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:19.260
He'll take that answer and he'll like it.

02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:22.260
September, I don't really have anything I'm looking forward to.

02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:25.260
Scribblenauts, I guess, would be kind of cool, but...

02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:27.260
I probably won't be buying that.

02:20:27.260 --> 02:20:29.260
I don't know. I may be buying that.

02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:33.260
Omkara222 in chat says Final Fantasy XIV. I don't think that'll be out next month.

02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:35.260
Keep talking. I'm still eating.

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:38.260
We'd be lucky if the beta would come out next month, but I somehow sadly doubt it.

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:40.260
So...

02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.260
There you go.

02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.260
Alright, we're gonna get to the next email as soon as StarSakura finishes chewing.

02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:48.260
But a mailbag at Orange L'Anchor, I am so stealing a chip.

02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.260
And I just want you... I'm gonna dare you to stop me.

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:53.260
Oh, uh, is the pizza still cooking?

02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:54.260
Um...

02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:57.260
Hey, OLR crew, what do you think of Bethesda's Wet?

02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:59.260
It actually looks kind of pretty.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:04.260
This game looks really interesting. I like the fact that it infuses a sort of kung fu game, a shooter, and a 3D fighter.

02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:09.260
What did you guys see of it at E3? Thanks in advance, I like old people.

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:13.260
Oh, and PS, it puts the lotion in the basket.

02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:15.260
Or else he gets the hose again.

02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:17.260
Um...

02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.260
Let's see, um...

02:21:19.260 --> 02:21:22.260
I saw a little bit of it, and it looked cool.

02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:28.260
I think Bethesda has a very good way of putting style on a lot of their games, unless it was the Star Trek game.

02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:34.260
Um, but every time I hear Bethesda, I'm always like, where's Oblivion V? Where's Oblivion V? Or, I should say, sorry, Elder Scrolls V.

02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:36.260
Where's Elder Scrolls V?

02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:37.260
But...

02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:38.260
They're working on it!

02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:41.260
I still need to go back and play the Call of Cthulhu game.

02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:42.260
What now?

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:44.260
Because I still want to play the Call of Cthulhu game.

02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:53.260
Wet looked cool, but it didn't seem like the type of game I would probably drop $60 on, just because, you know, I like roleplaying and different styles of games.

02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:59.260
Is there a demo out there? Oh, Henderson Man says the demo for Wet is on the European PlayStation Network store, and I thought the demo was awesome.

02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.260
So go check it out.

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:02.260
I will.

02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:03.260
Write us a review of it.

02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.260
Yes, please. I'm curious to know more about it.

02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:08.260
I have a profile for every region, so I can do that.

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.260
Woohoo!

02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:10.260
Next email.

02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:12.260
Next email, these ships are tasty.

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:14.260
Okay, from J-Rod.

02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:17.260
Ow, it bit my lip.

02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:25.260
Hey guys, I had something to speak up about. I had two Xbox 360s, and both of them ended up dying multiple times.

02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:26.260
Okay.

02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:31.260
After I sent them back to be repaired, they eventually died again, and I ended up getting a PS3 in the end.

02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:34.260
Rob said that his 360 just died as well.

02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:36.260
Now here's what I don't understand.

02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:44.260
Why did Rob complain about customers giving Microsoft a free pass for faulty hardware, and then in the same breath say, well, I'm probably just going to pick up an Elite?

02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:51.260
The product was rushed to market to beat Sony to the punch, and it couldn't be more obvious that they took shortcuts and screwed the customer to do so.

02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:55.260
So this type of behavior is now somewhat rewarded.

02:22:55.260 --> 02:23:02.260
Just because all my friends have one doesn't mean I need to give Microsoft my time and money for absolute shit hardware quality.

02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:12.260
The problem is that people use Xbox Live as a MySpace page rather than a game console half the time, so they just keep buying new ones over and over.

02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:16.260
The only time a company will learn is if you tell them with your wallet.

02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:21.260
Send it back, and if they don't repair it, then scrap it, sell the games, and move on.

02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:26.260
I hate to say it, but if Rob buys another Xbox 360, he's basically just part of their problem he's complaining about.

02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:32.260
My current 360 is on its last leg with lockups, and if it dies, out the door it goes to eBay along with my games.

02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:34.260
Excuse me.

02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:36.260
Don't be a part of the problem, Rob. Be a part of the solution.

02:23:36.260 --> 02:23:40.260
I absolutely disagree with you.

02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:43.260
I think it's just the viewpoint's a little too extreme for me.

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:47.260
I get what he's saying, and I said earlier in the show, it was wrong of me.

02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:50.260
You're right. If I buy an elite system, I'll meet you at that point.

02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:55.260
If I buy an elite system, I'm rewarding Microsoft for borking my old system.

02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:59.260
So I came to my realization about that earlier this week.

02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:04.260
If I get another Xbox 360, which assuming Loki can't fix mine, I'm going to have to go for the low-end system.

02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:11.260
So I see you there, but when you talk about this whole sell your games back and the whole thing, that's where you lose me.

02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:22.260
Because you're smoking crack if you think that I'm going to sell all of my games back that I've invested hundreds of dollars in for a fraction of the cost.

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:26.260
And therein lies the problem, and therein lies where I'm screwed.

02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:34.260
Because I have invested all this money not just in that, but on downloadable content, and some of which does not exist on the PlayStation 3,

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:37.260
that yes, I do like to revisit on a regular basis.

02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:40.260
I have to have the hardware to make it work.

02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:45.260
But I do agree that I should not reward Microsoft by buying the highest, most expensive version of it.

02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:49.260
That I should buy a bare-bones system because I already have the hard drive and all the other crap I've bought.

02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.260
I don't need all the other crap.

02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:57.260
Hey, if you want the right to actually complain, you know, go buy 3% of the stock and then go to shareholder meetings.

02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:05.260
I still do think, and I think most people agree with me, no matter if you think I was being a baby last week or what, no matter where,

02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:09.260
I think everybody kind of agrees with me, that Microsoft does need to be held accountable for this.

02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:10.260
No, they do.

02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:13.260
And history needs to show this negatively on Microsoft.

02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:17.260
When the next console comes out, the question needs to be asked.

02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:20.260
Have you tested this so that half of them do not fail?

02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:27.260
And somebody at Microsoft needs to go on record and assure the public that when and if the consoles fail,

02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:30.260
there will be a program in place to do something about it.

02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:37.260
And I'll tell you, though, what I'm going to do if this Xbox Red rings, because I think I'm on my third.

02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:43.260
But also keep in mind, we can just, you know, go to the store and Dan can get a new one.

02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:53.260
But I really think that, well, I don't know, I'd still be in warranty, so technically I'd get a new one for free.

02:25:53.260 --> 02:26:02.260
But regardless, I would still take the time to write a letter and say, you know, hey, I still enjoy my games.

02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:10.260
I own more in games than I own in the cost of the three systems.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:13.260
So to me, it's a justified expense.

02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:17.260
You know, it'd be like my computer, okay?

02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:20.260
My last computer went kaput. What did I do?

02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:24.260
I bought a computer and installed all the old same shit that I had on my last computer on my new computer.

02:26:24.260 --> 02:26:28.260
You know, I've got all my Photoshop, my whole CS suite and everything.

02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:32.260
I'm using my same tablet, you know, a peripheral.

02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:35.260
I'm using my portable hard drive, the same thing.

02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:44.260
So if you know a computer's going to be obsolete, you know, in a year, then what's the point of buying a new computer?

02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:46.260
Same difference.

02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:56.260
I just, at the end of the day, though, I do think it's bull that clearly the Xbox 60 fails more than any other piece of hardware we've ever seen.

02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:59.260
Atari 7800.

02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:01.260
In the last 15 years.

02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:08.260
The Atari 7800 had issues with the power supply and they failed almost as much as the Xbox 360.

02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.260
All right. Any more in the mailbag?

02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:16.260
Oh, yeah.

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:20.260
Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real.

02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:23.260
Oh, we already covered this.

02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:27.260
But this is actually kind of funny. It's from one, is all I'll say.

02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:35.260
Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real and will be coming out the first of next month and the original PS3 will drop $100.

02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:41.260
I already saw the box at GameStop. My friend works there and showed me inside where the consoles are.

02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:47.260
Also, the Xbox 360 price will be going down after Project Natal is released.

02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:51.260
P.S., what is with these women having no bras anymore?

02:27:51.260 --> 02:28:00.260
Don't get me wrong. I love tits. But when someone 50 years older than you does not have a bra on, I barf.

02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.260
I think we should just let the e-mailers report on the news from now on.

02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:05.260
Who did this? Juan?

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:06.260
Juan.

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:10.260
Juan needs a segment. Oh, my God. This is the same Juan that e-mailed us before, I bet, huh?

02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:11.260
I think.

02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:14.260
He needs a segment on this program one way or another.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.260
What is up with that?

02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:20.260
He's like our new extra fur.

02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:22.260
You want a slice of your pizza, DarkSucker?

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:23.260
Yes, I do.

02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:24.260
Okay, hold on.

02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:25.260
Give me a cheesy piece.

02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:27.260
I will let you pick whatever piece you want.

02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:28.260
All right.

02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:30.260
How many more e-mails do we have tonight?

02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:31.260
This one, a few.

02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:32.260
A few, all right.

02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:33.260
I put this one in the name of science.

02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:35.260
Make it snappy.

02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:39.260
Shook here. Or is it Shookay? I never was told.

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:47.260
Last week, I sent an e-mail about my Final Fantasy X dilemma and your advice worked.

02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:55.260
Oh, yeah, you had the bigot dad. Sorry, no offense.

02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:59.260
Oh, yeah, your dad was the asshole. Oh, sorry, no offense.

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:00.260
But you're cool. You're cool.

02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:08.260
I'm not in the habit of talking ill of other people's parents, but really, the way that you portrayed your dad made him look to be a major bigot.

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:14.260
But if I were to start with one, you are the winner.

02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:19.260
Anyway, I just sold Madden 04, 05, and 06 for about $40 to a privately-owned game store.

02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:22.260
I bought Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger and I'm loving both.

02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:24.260
I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever.

02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:25.260
Yes.

02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:34.260
And when you beat it, go back and actually hop on the teleport device right at the beginning of the game and you can beat Lavas from the beginning and get the artist ending.

02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:37.260
I'm sitting here in awe that he got that much for those old-ass Madden games.

02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:38.260
Props to you.

02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:47.260
Well, my dad walked in on me during the opening scene with Blitzball when he asked what it was. I made up something and said it was Super Soccer Extreme 2000 and he bought it.

02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:54.260
Again, my huge thanks for the advice.

02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:58.260
P.S. Dark Soccer, my username is pronounced as if the K was silent. Oh, sorry.

02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:01.260
So, it's shoe.

02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:03.260
K.

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:04.260
K.

02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:05.260
K.

02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:07.260
Well, I'm glad it worked.

02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:11.260
Now move out.

02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:14.260
Okay. This is from Rob with Two B's.

02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:15.260
Ra-ba-ba.

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:17.260
I'm gonna say Ra-ba-ba.

02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:18.260
Hi Ra-ba-ba.

02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:25.260
I ran across this crap accidentally coming to a PS3 near you, LittleBigPlanet Water.

02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:38.260
There's a trail of, there's a link and it looks like Sackboy will swim materials that float will float and Sackboy will have a hold your breath limit of air and I'm hoping they will give him scuba gear, the water equivalent of the untethered backpack.

02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:40.260
So, yeah, we talked about that.

02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:44.260
It has a, there's a video of creation mode on here.

02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:46.260
So, that's kinda cool.

02:30:46.260 --> 02:30:52.260
I can't wait to see how this gives a swift kick in the pants to all the user-generated levels and I agree with Ra-ba-ba.

02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:55.260
Sorry, I have a mouth full of pizza.

02:30:55.260 --> 02:31:00.260
I agree with Ra-ba-ba that it would be awesome if there was like a scuba gear or something like that.

02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.260
Cause that means you can make these levels that were nothing but floating.

02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:07.260
And do you know how much that's gonna increase the amount of clone games we see?

02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:09.260
Like space shooters and stuff?

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:11.260
Amazing.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:13.260
They're gonna reduce space shooters but the thing...

02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:15.260
It may be, it'll be easier with the water thing.

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:19.260
Well, I think with the water though you are gonna get limited air supply and that type of stuff that's gonna work into it.

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:23.260
Well, what if there's a scuba gear like Ra-ba-ba suggests? I think that's a great idea.

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:25.260
Yeah, there will be that.

02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:30.260
Well, there's also another email from him.

02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:36.260
I just noticed a recent post on NeoFM.com about that old project.

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:40.260
It's not really an update but some smart cookie converted it to Pump It Up.

02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:43.260
Both are five panel games in the arcade.

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:49.260
It's at the game zone at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in the Great...

02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:54.260
Is it pronounced Olathe or Lathy? Kansas?

02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:56.260
Anyway, somewhere in Kansas.

02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:58.260
That's great.

02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:02.260
But there's details in the article at NeoFM.com.

02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:08.260
And then the other...

02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:14.260
And yes, I do remember this dancing game. This is the one that was gonna look like a BeatMania controller but it was with feet.

02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:16.260
Yeah. So, there you go.

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:18.260
It was lol-worthy.

02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:20.260
And they have video of it.

02:32:20.260 --> 02:32:22.260
Interesting. And in Kansas?

02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:23.260
Yeah, it's a...

02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:25.260
How random.

02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:31.260
It's from... It's a tooth... Well, NeoFM and a Pump It Up machine and...

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:33.260
Well, because the whole thing runs off StepMania.

02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:38.260
I'm saying we should send Shane to go look but he won't care.

02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:39.260
I know he won't.

02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:41.260
Oh, I got something for him. Thanks to Becky.

02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:43.260
What's that?

02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:45.260
Let me get it.

02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:50.260
He'll love it. We should send it to him and autograph it and everything.

02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:52.260
He wouldn't care about our autographs.

02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:55.260
He probably already has that but you never know.

02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:59.260
Okay, well then, I'll do something with it.

02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:03.260
Okay, O.O.R. listeners, who wants a copy of High School Musical 3?

02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:05.260
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:08.260
Let us know and you'll get it.

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:10.260
Because nobody in this room wants it.

02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:15.260
Or nobody in the hall either, else it would not be in my house.

02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:18.260
No, I'm sure... Ask him. He may not have it.

02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:20.260
He may not have bought it for whatever reason.

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:25.260
Yeah, actually it says there's apparently the code leaked out for NeoFM.

02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:30.260
So it says, meanwhile some cool cats managed to get their hands on two separate leaks of our code

02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:37.260
and put them in a centrifuge with some fairy dust and in the groove pumping up Linux code.

02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:43.260
They're pumping up machines to a local arcade neon FM 2009 machine.

02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:48.260
By the way, there's stuff leaked out to the internet a while ago in StepMania format.

02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:50.260
I have it, but eh.

02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:53.260
Oh, this is good pizza.

02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:57.260
Look how much of it I've eaten. It's good stuff. I like it.

02:33:57.260 --> 02:33:59.260
Except it's making me fat.

02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:02.260
Alright, any other emails tonight?

02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:05.260
Um, no.

02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:07.260
Alright, mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:11.260
It's time to get angsty and I don't really have a good story to lead us into this tonight,

02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:30.260
but what would the show be without the FUs of the week?

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:33.260
You know, I actually didn't have a story to lead us into that.

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:35.260
You want to tell us real fast?

02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:43.260
Yeah, well I mentioned it earlier, GameStop saying GameStop expects a UMD dump by new PSP Go owners.

02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:50.260
Since, obviously, Sony's not supporting them, Tony Bartell, the GameStop EVP of Merchandising and Marketing,

02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:55.260
said we have a very clear roadmap on how we can drive profitability on the sales of games.

02:34:55.260 --> 02:35:03.260
It will also be a strong contribution in their trade-in process when you have people that will have UMD games

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:08.260
and they will no longer work on the platform and they'll fuel additional currency for GameStop.

02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:11.260
Hail, GameStop.

02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:13.260
That's it.

02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:15.260
DarkSaga, you're angst then.

02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:18.260
My FU goes to how much my hand hurts.

02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:25.260
I had surgery again on Friday for him to pull out the rest of the suture, and what happened is that the suture was in a knot,

02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:27.260
which is why it wouldn't come out.

02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:30.260
It had been knotted up inside my hand.

02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:33.260
So when it got tugged on, of course, ow!

02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:36.260
So, yeah, suture stuck in hand.

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:42.260
But it's gone now, which means I get two more additional weeks off of work.

02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:44.260
That means you'll have the time off when Misty's here, huh?

02:35:44.260 --> 02:35:46.260
Sure will, except for my anniversary.

02:35:46.260 --> 02:35:47.260
Right, no, I know.

02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:48.260
Thank you.

02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:52.260
I have to work that day. I hope she has something planned for the day.

02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:54.260
We'll figure something out.

02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:59.260
And also announcing to the universe, September 1st is my four year anniversary.

02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:02.260
But you've known Dan for like nine on top of that, right?

02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:05.260
We've been together for eleven and a half years.

02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:06.260
Nice.

02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:08.260
Loki, any angst for you tonight?

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:14.260
Not really. I guess I have to wait for my arcade cabinet to come in.

02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:18.260
I have to wait another four weeks, basically.

02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:22.260
And, yeah, that just sucks.

02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:25.260
But, no, that's all I got.

02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:29.260
My F.U. of the week, I've had a really, really shitty week.

02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:33.260
I just want to say F.U. to people that want to play political games

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:38.260
and all that crap when I'm just not down with it.

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:41.260
You know what? I am a professional individual.

02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:45.260
I go to places to get a job done and I'm not interested in playing games.

02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:47.260
So I will get my job done.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:52.260
Also an F.U. to the fact that when I'm having these bad days,

02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:57.260
the person I want to turn to to talk about these things about

02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.260
is absent with better things to do, I suppose.

02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:03.260
I've not had a good week.

02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:05.260
I'm going to go home and cry into my pillow.

02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:07.260
We're going to get ice cream after the show again.

02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:10.260
We've got to finish in the next hour because Baskin Ramen closes at ten.

02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:11.260
So step on it!

02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:13.260
We'll get you pie later.

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:15.260
Alright, we've got some news from Loki.

02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:17.260
Actually, we're getting to the Skyplane pretty soon.

02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:19.260
We're almost to the end of the show, believe it or not.

02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:20.260
Yes, we are.

02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:26.260
Lots of Rock Band information, including the details on the first download content

02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:28.260
that's going to be available for Rock Band Beatles.

02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:32.260
The first two albums that they're going to have available will be

02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:37.260
Abbey Road and also Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:44.260
Abbey Road will be arriving first on October 20th at the price of $16.98

02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:55.260
or 1360 Microsoft Points with each individual track running you $2 or 160 Microsoft Points.

02:37:55.260 --> 02:38:00.260
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band will come out in November.

02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:06.260
I guess also the next album after that will be Rubber Soul and that will arrive in December.

02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:10.260
Lots of tracks coming out, man.

02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:13.260
They've got Uber tracks.

02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:16.260
And what's going to be kind of cool about that though, I'm assuming,

02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:20.260
is that each one's going to have the different animations in the background.

02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:24.260
So some of those songs actually would be kind of cool to see.

02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:27.260
I'm really kind of considering maybe buying this.

02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:28.260
I don't know.

02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:31.260
I don't really play a lot of Rock Band lately.

02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:33.260
But it might be fun. I don't know.

02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:35.260
I like some of these songs.

02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:38.260
I think I'm totally going to have it.

02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:42.260
I'm so mad my Xbox crapped out right before a song I really wanted to play had come out

02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:43.260
and I didn't get to play it.

02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:44.260
Here's the problem.

02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:47.260
Here's the thing I have a little problem about.

02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:50.260
And I'm kind of confused in this sense.

02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:53.260
Because some of these songs I thought were already in the game.

02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:56.260
Remember how they were showing us different songs like

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:59.260
Octopus's Garden and stuff like that?

02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:04.260
I thought that was already in the game.

02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:09.260
But for some reason it's listed on the Abbey Road download content here.

02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:13.260
Well it might also be that when you download the album you're kind of getting the rest of the album.

02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:16.260
Because I think every album has some representation in the game.

02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:18.260
So I don't know.

02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:22.260
Maybe. I guess maybe they're just listing what's on the album and not actual download content.

02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:25.260
That could be because if these people said to the website,

02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:27.260
like, hey we're releasing these albums,

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:30.260
the website probably just went to Amazon.com and just wrote out the track list

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:33.260
without thinking, oh this song is probably in the game already.

02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:34.260
You know what I mean?

02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:35.260
Yeah.

02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:36.260
That makes sense.

02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:39.260
And apparently I guess the All You Need Is Love download content,

02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:41.260
which is going to be a single,

02:39:41.260 --> 02:39:44.260
will be available as a timed exclusive on Xbox 360

02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:46.260
and the game's launch is September 9th.

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:49.260
And then also if you purchase a full Abbey Road album,

02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:52.260
you'll have the option to play the B-Side Melody,

02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:55.260
or B-Side Medley I'm sorry, from

02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:59.260
You'll Never Get Me Your Money Through The End

02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:01.260
as one continuous track.

02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:03.260
I may not be the biggest Beatles fan in the world.

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:08.260
I'm like, cool, Beatles are cool. I respect that people are in love with them.

02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:10.260
I understand why they have such a place in history and so forth.

02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:13.260
But I'm actually really excited about this game.

02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:15.260
It just looks so cool.

02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:17.260
It's fun to watch and play.

02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:18.260
Yeah.

02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:19.260
Other stuff.

02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:22.260
This week on the Rock Band Store,

02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:27.260
they're going to have Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and Jet.

02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:30.260
The individual songs, of course, from Billy Idol.

02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:32.260
Please say it's Cradle of Love.

02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:33.260
No.

02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:34.260
White Wedding.

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:35.260
That's already in there.

02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:36.260
No.

02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:39.260
It's Mony Mony and Rebel Yell.

02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.260
Oh, Rebel Yell's cool. Okay.

02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:44.260
And each of those are available for 160 Microsoft points or $2.

02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:49.260
Fleetwood Mac, you have Don't Stop and World Turning.

02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:53.260
Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow, Baby.

02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:55.260
I should sing the Rock Band songs every week.

02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:58.260
And Jet, you have She's A Genius.

02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:04.260
And then finally, Tom Petty, you have I Won't Back Down and Running Down a Dream.

02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:09.260
And those are all available August 25th through the 27th,

02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:11.260
depending on which store you're getting in from.

02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:13.260
Tom Petty's kind of awesome.

02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:15.260
And then, of course, the Wii.

02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:17.260
You've got lots of stuff coming there.

02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:20.260
A lot of it just previously released stuff on other things.

02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:22.260
You have a lot of tracks from Grateful Dead,

02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:27.260
Foo Fighters, Dropkick Murphy, White Zombie, that kind of stuff.

02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:30.260
And those will all be available for 200 Wii points each.

02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:32.260
And those will be available on the 25th.

02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:36.260
And then finally on the PSP, you're getting two things of download content on the 27th,

02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:41.260
including the Zombies She's Not There and White Zombie Black Sunshine,

02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:43.260
each available for $2.

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:51.260
And finally, Rock Band's download content is expected to hit 1,000 tracks by the holiday.

02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:58.260
And there's going to be some new tracks, of course, coming from Queen, Nirvana, Tom Petty,

02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:06.260
which we got some this week, Elton John, Iggy Pop, The White Stripes, Pantera, Talking Heads,

02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:09.260
Korn, and The Raccoon Tears.

02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:11.260
What do you have from Iggy Pop?

02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:14.260
I don't think they've given any songs yet, just bands.

02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:18.260
No, they're just listing stuff, as well as many more from other artists.

02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:20.260
But hey, that's kind of cool.

02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:22.260
It's kind of like Elton John, Queen.

02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.260
Need I say more?

02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:24.260
I need to get Sing Star Queen, by the way.

02:42:24.260 --> 02:42:25.260
That is out and about.

02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:26.260
Oh, need.

02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:29.260
I'm waiting for the price drop, because you know, once the game's out a month,

02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:31.260
it'll be in the clearance bin for 1999.

02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:34.260
That's what I'm waiting for.

02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:35.260
And that's it.

02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:36.260
Sweet.

02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.260
That was a lot of Rock Band news.

02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:41.260
They are busy bees over there, considering there was no Rock Band 3 this year.

02:42:41.260 --> 02:42:42.260
500 tracks a year?

02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:43.260
That's not bad.

02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:44.260
Good lord.

02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:46.260
A lot more than certain other music franchises.

02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.260
Apparently.

02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:48.260
La la la la la.

02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:51.260
Alright, hey, Gran Turismo 5 is the last story we have tonight,

02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:55.260
before we get to the phone lines a little later on.

02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:58.260
Apparently, this was being shown off at Gamescom.

02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.260
Not just Gran Turismo 5, but Gran Turismo PSP.

02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:04.260
There's some images of the game that have leaked out to the internet,

02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:07.260
and of course, they are pretty.

02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:08.260
The main menu looks like what you see in-

02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:09.260
I like how you said that.

02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:10.260
What?

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:11.260
Pretty.

02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:12.260
It is pretty.

02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:13.260
Look, it's pretty.

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:15.260
I always want to say Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:43:15.260 --> 02:43:18.260
It's Gran Turismo 5, because GT-

02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:19.260
I just want to put the A in there.

02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:24.260
GT5 Prolog uses that same kind of menu.

02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:25.260
So there you go.

02:43:25.260 --> 02:43:27.260
There's going to be 80 tracks in the game.

02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:29.260
1,000 cars.

02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:33.260
830 regular ones, and 170 with a little more modeling.

02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:38.260
Damage will be in the game, and GTTV is back.

02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:40.260
And it can also be run on your PSP.

02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:43.260
No release date yet, which you know what that means.

02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:45.260
2010.

02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:46.260
It's been a long-

02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:47.260
It is 2010.

02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:49.260
Considering we got that prologue quite some time ago,

02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:51.260
that's a long wait.

02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:53.260
That's a very long wait.

02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:55.260
Very cool if you're a fan of Gran Turismo.

02:43:55.260 --> 02:43:57.260
I am not as big on the Gran Turismo series,

02:43:57.260 --> 02:44:00.260
because I like my arcade racers.

02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:02.260
Gran Turismo is a little too realistic for me.

02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:04.260
It's more like Project Gotham and stuff.

02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:05.260
It's not that I hate them.

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:08.260
I think they're pretty to watch other people play that are good at it.

02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:10.260
I'm just really bad at them.

02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:12.260
So there you go.

02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:14.260
Hey, it's your turn to give us a call.

02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:16.260
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:44:16.260 --> 02:44:18.260
Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundrio.

02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:20.260
The Skype line is open right now.

02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:22.260
We're only going to take a couple calls tonight.

02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:26.260
But we want to also get any last minute stories that might be out there

02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:28.260
while we wait for folks to call.

02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:30.260
Yes. Why not?

02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:31.260
Go ahead.

02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:32.260
Darcy, do you have something?

02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:33.260
I like pie.

02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:38.260
And you know, and think that I was going to let you go ahead and go first.

02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:40.260
That teaches me.

02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:46.260
Anyways, UK is getting a pretty cool deal with Guitar Hero 5 purchases.

02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:50.260
Much like how we're getting the free Van Halen over here.

02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:57.260
Folks that purchase Guitar Hero 5 in the UK will be eligible to get a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:44:57.260 --> 02:44:59.260
That's more songs.

02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:01.260
And you know, probably a better selection.

02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:02.260
It's something.

02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:03.260
Hey, we've got a call.

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:05.260
Hi, you're on OrangeLaundrio. Who's this?

02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.260
It's Deathwishing.

02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:09.260
Hey, Deathwishing. What's up?

02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:13.260
Nothing. I just had a really cool week and it's ending really well.

02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:22.260
But I wanted to talk about the Halo ODSD tour and how in a way it's kind of crap.

02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:24.260
Why is it crap? Someone asked about this on Twitter tonight.

02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:26.260
It has an age requirement on it.

02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:27.260
Oh really?

02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:30.260
Yeah, you have to be 17 and older. I don't know if they check ID or anything.

02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:34.260
I mean, I don't have ID. I don't have a driver's license yet.

02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:38.260
You know, in California they make you pay up the ass to get one.

02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:41.260
Well, it is a mature rated game.

02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:48.260
Yeah, but I just find it really lame because it's just like...

02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:52.260
It's a mature rated game and yet we're all going to get our hands on it.

02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:53.260
There's going to be like 8-year-old kids going,

02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:56.260
Oh my god, I pwn you, noob.

02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:58.260
T-bag.

02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:00.260
That's because parents suck.

02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:03.260
Hey, my parents were cool. I was playing Grand Theft Auto back then.

02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:07.260
And look at me, I grew up to be perfectly fine.

02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:12.260
Are there individuals out there that might debate that comment, Death Wishing?

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:19.260
That one Californian politician who got banned.

02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:21.260
If you know who he is.

02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:22.260
No idea.

02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:25.260
But did you go to the tour? Are you planning on going to the tour?

02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:29.260
I'm planning on going to it. I'm going to try to talk my friend into taking me down to Pasadena.

02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:34.260
But I don't see any coming near you guys, sadly.

02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:36.260
I'm not sad.

02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:40.260
Hey, it's pretty cool. You get free stuff. I think you get t-shirts and stuff for doing it.

02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:44.260
Whoopee. I'm not that big on Halo.

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:46.260
I understand why people love their Halo.

02:46:46.260 --> 02:46:51.260
I used to play Halo 2 all the time with my college friends, but I'm kind of over it.

02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:56.260
Rob, about your 360, I don't see why yours is broken down so much.

02:46:56.260 --> 02:47:01.260
I'm on my second, but my first one still works.

02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:03.260
I just have to close the tray in.

02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:06.260
I just open and close it to get games to work, and I'm letting my friend use it because his blew up.

02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:08.260
Like, literally exploded.

02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:11.260
Wow. That's impressive.

02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:13.260
The amazing exploding 360s.

02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:17.260
I call mine the Jesus box because it won't die.

02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:18.260
It just keeps resurrecting.

02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:20.260
Alright, well, Death Wishing-

02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:22.260
The red ring then came back.

02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:25.260
We're going to let you go so we can get as many calls as we can tonight and still have time for ice cream.

02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:27.260
But thanks so much for the call, okay?

02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:28.260
Boy.

02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:29.260
Boy.

02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:32.260
I should ask him if he's going to the Silent Hill house.

02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:34.260
Because I still want to go.

02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:36.260
I still do. I think we're just going to have to go.

02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:38.260
We're just going to have to get in the car and go.

02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:40.260
But I'm poor.

02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:42.260
So?

02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:44.260
Sell your soul.

02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:46.260
No, I already did.

02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:48.260
That's why I've-

02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:49.260
Never mind.

02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:52.260
Alright. Hi, you're on the wrong side. Who's this?

02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:54.260
This is DS Master 26.

02:47:54.260 --> 02:47:56.260
Hi, what's on your mind, DS Master 26?

02:47:56.260 --> 02:48:00.260
I'm hearing Echo. Try to get the microphone away from the speaker.

02:48:00.260 --> 02:48:04.260
Oh, sorry. I'm going off the PSP 3000 here.

02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:06.260
It's fine.

02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:10.260
Here, I'm going to get my headset in here.

02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:14.260
Ironic. DS Master on a PSP.

02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:16.260
Ah, whatever.

02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:20.260
Basically, I'm here to do a review of a new game.

02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:22.260
Yes.

02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:24.260
Poppin' Music for Wii.

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:30.260
Oh, you played Poppin' Music for Wii, and you don't sound happy about it. Please tell us all about this game.

02:48:30.260 --> 02:48:33.260
It's complete crap.

02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:40.260
I've been a long time Beemani fan, and this has done great disgrace to the series.

02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:46.260
Okay, I need to know the reason why it's crap, and I need to know how it's different from the Poppin' Music us Beemani fans know.

02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:48.260
Basically, all-

02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:52.260
You know what they did with the DDR games and thrown those in the crapper?

02:48:52.260 --> 02:49:01.260
Well, it's all licensed stuff like Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus stuff into Poppin'.

02:49:01.260 --> 02:49:08.260
And there's no controller with it. You just use the Wii Remote nunchuck like you would on...

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:13.260
Oh, let me see here. Rayman Raving Rabbids in the dancing section.

02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:17.260
That's pretty much how it's played. It's complete crap.

02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:20.260
Hmm.

02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:24.260
Well, that's too bad.

02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:30.260
Ray Ayanami in chat is asking, no Konami originals?

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:37.260
Very few, if any. They tried to put in a revamped B4U song in there somehow.

02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:43.260
And then something out of, like it sounds like I've, I don't know if you've heard of this cartoon.

02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:48.260
Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. They came out a few years ago.

02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:52.260
Puffy's an actual pop band in Japan.

02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:57.260
Yeah, and I think one of their songs ended up somewhere in the game.

02:49:57.260 --> 02:50:04.260
I don't remember which one it was, but it was complete crud. It was one of the DLC tracks.

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:09.260
I mean, that's one thing this one has that all the others didn't have was DLC.

02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:14.260
I mean, yeah, I'm glad they're finally getting to the next gen and DLC to their music games.

02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:21.260
But at the same time, Konami's just disappointing the B-Monic fans left and right.

02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:23.260
Hmm.

02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:31.260
And, by the way, just to let you know, that line you coded, it's straight off one of my favorite series.

02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:34.260
Bring It On.

02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:38.260
Only the best movie of all time.

02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:44.260
Yes, and they just got a fifth one, and I have a review on that. It is awesome.

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:48.260
They have a fifth Bring It On movie now? I've only ever seen the first one.

02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:50.260
Yeah, way too many Bring It On movies.

02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:53.260
I said, brrr, it's cold in here. Alright, forget it.

02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:56.260
Anyhow, alright, we're letting you go, DS Masters, we're gonna get some more calls.

02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:59.260
Go watch Bring It On on your PSP.

02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:14.260
Um, no, no, no, but basically I heard rumors of possibly that the choreographer from that is doing a second All Star Cheer Camp game, or whatever, for Wii.

02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:15.260
Yes, they are.

02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:20.260
Which I actually pointed, it does give you a workout twice as much as Wii Fit will ever give you.

02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:26.260
Okay, great, bye. I guess he didn't hear the part where he said I was letting him go, he just kept talking.

02:51:26.260 --> 02:51:30.260
It's important that we know about All Star Cheer Camp, though.

02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:33.260
Poor guy, I was so rude to him. I hope he hears this.

02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:36.260
You're horrible, Rob. Horrible human being.

02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:40.260
Well, did I not say, okay, we gotta wrap up to get some more calls?

02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:43.260
He wasn't done yet, okay? That's just wrong.

02:51:43.260 --> 02:51:45.260
He was talking about choreography.

02:51:45.260 --> 02:51:48.260
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:51.260
What?

02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:54.260
Ah, crap!

02:51:54.260 --> 02:52:00.260
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:03.260
Give us a call if you want to talk.

02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:09.260
Our number is 555-4444.

02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:12.260
No, it's not really, it's 1877 Game OLR.

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:14.260
Since it's not ringing, I'm gonna give it some more.

02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:16.260
If you don't call, we'll get off the cleanse.

02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:18.260
Oh, here we go, last call.

02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:20.260
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:21.260
Hi, this is AgDef.

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:23.260
Hi, AgDef, what's on your mind?

02:52:23.260 --> 02:52:28.260
First of all, sorry about your 360. I'm definitely sorry it happened.

02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:30.260
Dude, I don't know why you're blaming yourself.

02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:33.260
The damn thing was obviously gonna break eventually.

02:52:33.260 --> 02:52:37.260
At least I went down in a blaze of glory.

02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:39.260
Yeah, that's true.

02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:41.260
I'm just joking, man.

02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:45.260
Though I am sorry about the thing breaking.

02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:47.260
I blame Microsoft, not you.

02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:49.260
What's on your mind?

02:52:49.260 --> 02:52:53.260
I wanted to talk about the digital download thing.

02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:55.260
You were talking at the beginning of the show?

02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:58.260
Yes.

02:52:58.260 --> 02:53:02.260
I think I made a comment in chat, or in Penelope,

02:53:02.260 --> 02:53:11.260
that most people have a really good connection to internet.

02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:15.260
Like me, I don't have a really good connection.

02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:20.260
I have only one megabyte per second connection,

02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:24.260
so it would take me an eternity to download a four,

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:28.260
or maybe six, or bigger game.

02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:30.260
That is a damn good point.

02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:33.260
That is a damn good point I think a lot of people forget to consider,

02:53:33.260 --> 02:53:35.260
is that you know what? In some parts of the world,

02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:37.260
they're still on dial-up.

02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:39.260
In fact, I bet there are some places where they're still using

02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:42.260
two Dixie cups and a string to connect to the internet.

02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:45.260
Basically.

02:53:45.260 --> 02:53:50.260
It is not all super fast cable connections everywhere in the world.

02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:54.260
Granted, I guess not every game company technically does business

02:53:54.260 --> 02:53:56.260
in every part of the world if you want to get technical,

02:53:56.260 --> 02:54:01.260
but still, it is a little bit sad that if they go this digital distribution route,

02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:03.260
I mean, how easy would it be?

02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:05.260
I know you've called in the show.

02:54:05.260 --> 02:54:07.260
You live in Mexico, and I know you've talked about sometimes

02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:09.260
coming up to the U.S. to get games,

02:54:09.260 --> 02:54:11.260
or having them shipped down to you or what have you.

02:54:11.260 --> 02:54:13.260
Imagine if with this digital distribution stuff,

02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:15.260
they could just say,

02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:17.260
oh, block Mexico, it's not their time yet.

02:54:17.260 --> 02:54:19.260
We have to wait until we get the localized version for them,

02:54:19.260 --> 02:54:21.260
so we're just going to block their IP,

02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:23.260
so that they can't get the game.

02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:25.260
That would suck.

02:54:25.260 --> 02:54:27.260
Yeah, like it happened with Palapon 2.

02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:31.260
It's only a digital download in the United States.

02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:34.260
Though, Sony made a good decision,

02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:38.260
and they brought the UMD over here.

02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:41.260
So maybe if they do that in the future,

02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:43.260
if you can have the digital download,

02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:45.260
or you can have the disk,

02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:49.260
you have the option that maybe it could work better.

02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:51.260
But if you only have one option,

02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:54.260
and it's the digital download, it won't work.

02:54:54.260 --> 02:54:55.260
It definitely won't work.

02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:58.260
I think, Akdeft, you definitely bring up a good point

02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:00.260
about something that I bet a lot of people don't think about

02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:03.260
because a lot of us are spoiled with our cable connections

02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:05.260
here in the States.

02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:08.260
Akdeft, anything else real quick before I let you go?

02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:10.260
No, nothing else.

02:55:10.260 --> 02:55:12.260
Okay. See ya.

02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:13.260
See ya.

02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:15.260
Thank you for calling.

02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.260
Yes, thanks as always for calling.

02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:20.260
I like it when our callers get us to think about things

02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:22.260
that we didn't think about before.

02:55:22.260 --> 02:55:24.260
I don't like thinking. It's horrible.

02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:26.260
Well, too bad. Think about some other last-minute stories

02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:27.260
while I close up Skype.

02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:29.260
If you didn't get through, hey, you can always tweet us,

02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:31.260
email us, chat with us.

02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:33.260
Or buy me a pony.

02:55:33.260 --> 02:55:35.260
Or buy Jamie. Guess what I saw yesterday, Jamie?

02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:36.260
A pony?

02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:37.260
Derby Owners Club.

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:39.260
Where? Where's the doc?

02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:42.260
Dave & Buster's. Milpitas. Still.

02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:45.260
Ooh, I love the horsey racing games.

02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:46.260
I'm kind of over it.

02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:49.260
They needed a sequel about five years ago.

02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:52.260
Hey, there's a new game coming to the PS3

02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:55.260
called 3D Dot Game Heroes.

02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:59.260
It's basically kind of a 3D version of pixel art.

02:55:59.260 --> 02:56:01.260
If you were to take, like, an old-school Final Fantasy game

02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:04.260
and make it all 3D and high-res,

02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:06.260
that's what the game would look like.

02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:07.260
It's kind of cool.

02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:10.260
And that should be coming out in Japan this November.

02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:12.260
No word on it coming over to the US,

02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:16.260
but I only hope it does, because that would be awesome.

02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:18.260
Castle Crashers is getting new download content

02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:21.260
in the Necromatic pack,

02:56:21.260 --> 02:56:24.260
and that will feature some really cool things,

02:56:24.260 --> 02:56:29.260
including a chainsaw, a golden mace,

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:32.260
a dragon head animal orb,

02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:35.260
and also two new characters,

02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:39.260
the necromancer and the cult minion you'll get to play as.

02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:41.260
So all that available.

02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:44.260
No word on what the cost or when it's coming,

02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:47.260
but hopefully soon.

02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:51.260
Ubisoft has officially revealed a new game

02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:53.260
that they're putting out called Just Dance

02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:57.260
for people who, I guess, want to dance.

02:56:57.260 --> 02:57:02.260
And the game itself actually focuses more on arm and leg movements,

02:57:02.260 --> 02:57:05.260
mainly arm movements, it looks like.

02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:08.260
But, yeah, the people in there,

02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:12.260
they call them, I think, the lifestyle shots or whatever,

02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:15.260
look absolutely ridiculous.

02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:18.260
But it is going to be coming out,

02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:22.260
and they have 30 licensed tracks,

02:57:22.260 --> 02:57:24.260
including Groove is in the Heart,

02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:26.260
Pump Up the Jam, and You Can't Touch This,

02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:32.260
who are, you know, I don't know.

02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:37.260
And also, I guess people are slightly interested in this title

02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:41.260
because they think that maybe it's being developed by Q Entertainment.

02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:45.260
This might be the secret title that they're developing.

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:47.260
Hope not!

02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:49.260
It looks like crap.

02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:52.260
I hope it's not.

02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:56.260
Konami is apparently location testing Pop'n Music 18.

02:57:56.260 --> 02:57:58.260
That's right.

02:57:58.260 --> 02:58:02.260
The new mix, I believe, was...

02:58:02.260 --> 02:58:05.260
God, I just had it, too.

02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:14.260
I forgot the name, and I can't find it.

02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:16.260
Anyways, Pop'n Music 18. We don't even know the subtitle.

02:58:16.260 --> 02:58:19.260
It's not important.

02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:21.260
But apparently they're going to be conducting that

02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:23.260
starting, actually it was last week,

02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:27.260
starting August 20th at AMPIA,

02:58:27.260 --> 02:58:30.260
at Kungawa Prefecture,

02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:32.260
and that's going to run from the 20th through the 30th,

02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:38.260
and then at Rundown at the Fukuoka Prefecture.

02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:40.260
Fukuoka.

02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:44.260
Fukuoka Prefecture from the 21st through the 30th.

02:58:44.260 --> 02:58:46.260
So you can check that out.

02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:49.260
They have more information on the location test site,

02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:54.260
that's konami.jp slash AMP slash location test slash Pop'n 18.

02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:56.260
So check that out.

02:58:56.260 --> 02:58:59.260
If you live in Japan.

02:58:59.260 --> 02:59:01.260
And then, let's see here.

02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:04.260
Modern Warfare 2. Of course, I have talked about in the past

02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:06.260
about how Activision is trying to rip people off

02:59:06.260 --> 02:59:08.260
with the price of Guitar Hero 5 on the Wii.

02:59:08.260 --> 02:59:10.260
No one seems to give a shit.

02:59:10.260 --> 02:59:13.260
But now that it's available on PC,

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:18.260
apparently they are trying to raise the price of the PC version as well.

02:59:18.260 --> 02:59:22.260
Ubisoft Amazon Best Buy are now showing the PC version with a $60 price tag.

02:59:22.260 --> 02:59:26.260
Now that might not be a big deal for people that normally buy console games,

02:59:26.260 --> 02:59:33.260
but for PC owners, most games only retail at $50 retail.

02:59:33.260 --> 02:59:38.260
But see, I told you they were evil, and no one believed me.

02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:43.260
But now that it's a more important game, people might listen.

02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:49.260
And then finally, Namco Bandai is releasing a new game

02:59:49.260 --> 02:59:52.260
on the Playstation Portable in December.

02:59:52.260 --> 02:59:54.260
I believe this is coming out in Japan.

02:59:54.260 --> 02:59:58.260
It's called Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos.

02:59:58.260 --> 03:00:01.260
And Queen's Blade apparently is a...

03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:05.260
They call it a Lost World style combat picture book game.

03:00:05.260 --> 03:00:11.260
And features characters with large...

03:00:11.260 --> 03:00:14.260
Boobies.

03:00:14.260 --> 03:00:16.260
Sweet.

03:00:16.260 --> 03:00:19.260
To the point that it's absolutely ridiculous.

03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:23.260
I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous.

03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:27.260
That's how I try to make my character an ion with boobies that big.

03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:33.260
So that should be coming out this fall on PSP in Japan.

03:00:33.260 --> 03:00:35.260
Alright.

03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:38.260
That's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:41.260
but first we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:43.260
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:45.260
Boobies.

03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:48.260
My final thought is ice cream, then boobies.

03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:53.260
Loki, I get my arcade hardware tomorrow, but it's no good right now

03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:56.260
because I don't have an arcade machine to play it on.

03:00:56.260 --> 03:01:00.260
But I get to stare at it, and caress it, and...

03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:02.260
And boobies?

03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:04.260
Boobies.

03:01:04.260 --> 03:01:08.260
Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our show tonight.

03:01:08.260 --> 03:01:10.260
We really appreciate it, and...

03:01:10.260 --> 03:01:12.260
Oh, TigerClaus reminded me.

03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:16.260
I forgot to mention the Starcraft 2 thing I was going to mention about

03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:19.260
the chick from Battlestar Galactica is voicing Kerrigan.

03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:20.260
Trisha Helfer.

03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:22.260
Six.

03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:24.260
Hot.

03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:27.260
Totally random, but just thought I'd mention it.

03:01:27.260 --> 03:01:31.260
Because Jamie would, like, know probably.

03:01:31.260 --> 03:01:34.260
I heard that the new, is it Caprica or whatever like that?

03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:37.260
That Patton Oswalt's going to have a recurring character on there.

03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:39.260
Ooh.

03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:41.260
That means I actually have an excuse to watch it.

03:01:41.260 --> 03:01:43.260
Alright.

03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:46.260
And so enjoy your Battlestar Galactica, kids, until next week,

03:01:46.260 --> 03:01:48.260
because we'll be back next week to do it all over again.

03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:52.260
Hey, if you enjoyed the show, be sure to tell two friends about the show.

03:01:52.260 --> 03:01:55.260
Leave us a nice review on iTunes, you know,

03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:57.260
or just tell people about the show.

03:01:57.260 --> 03:02:00.260
Word of mouth is what sells the show and helps us spread around,

03:02:00.260 --> 03:02:05.260
because remember, we don't have a big magazine behind us or anything like that.

03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:07.260
So that's going to do it.

03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:08.260
We'll see you next week.

03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:12.260
We'll be back to do it all over again on another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:13.260
Good night!
