Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and LocoCade

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, August 16th, 2009

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Is there a wee cushion on the horizon?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Will the Playstation 3 soon see you laughing?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And could you soon be able to take a trip to Silent Hill for real?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Well hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
With you for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Happiest bunny on the farm, as I used to call her every day on this week

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Wait, how did that get started anyway?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I don't even remember

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, because I had my happy bunny stuff for a while

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You used to be obsessed with happy bunny if I remember right

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And now I think happy bunny is kind of stupid

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh really? Well, happy bunny kind of jumped the shark a little bit

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Now you see happy bunny everywhere on everything

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Happy bunny was cool when no one knew about it

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Exactly

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Fine

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Not the happiest bunny on the farm, Loki

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
No, I'm not a bunny on a farm

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
You're very quiet tonight, Loki, what is going on?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Nothing, I'm trying to remember a password

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And I think I got it

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
And I got it

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh, I'm trying to see what you're trying to log into

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Alright

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Imani Sowz is what I'm logging into

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Not the download torrents, but to read their forms

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I see

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
What's so important on their forms?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Nothing, I want to see if some guy returned my PM

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
And he didn't

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
He's a bastard

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I thought they said read their porn, so

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
If you are corresponding with Loki, you should write him back, ass

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
No, it's alright

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I was second in line for a system 573 board, but I didn't

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I probably don't need it now, so it's alright

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
You are very quiet tonight, and I can't figure out why

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Let's try turning up your mic a little bit

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
The beauty of live radio, boys and girls

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, I thought you meant like I wasn't saying a lot, not that I was quiet

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
No, like you were actually quiet on the mic, now you were too loud

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I think we're good now

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Alright

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
So there we go

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
The joy of live radio as we tape live here on Sunday nights at All Games Radio

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
www.allgames.com, live after The Bobby Black Wolf Show

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I have an announcement

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
You have an announcement, yes

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Rob had chicken for dinner

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I did, it was delicious

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
He didn't get me any

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Grilled chicken

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I had chicken and a biscuit

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It still smells like chicken in this room, and it's driving me nuts

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Look, I was hungry, I literally had nothing to eat today

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm gonna make my husband bring me some food

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
You should do that, that's why you got married, right?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, so that it'd be my man servant

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I too had chicken for dinner

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Did you?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yes

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What kind of chicken did you have?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I had chicken covered with Ritz cracker bits

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Have you been, since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
We'll get into our gaming week in just a moment

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Have you been to that new restaurant?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And I think, you know, we're an international show

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So I'm sure this place exists, other places

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
But it's new to Sacramento

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Have you been to Wingstop?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
No

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's pretty interesting

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I refuse to eat there

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Why is that?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Because it's attached to Pizza Hut

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
No, that's Wing...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
No, Wing Street

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
That's a different one

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
No, Wingstop is a new one that they have here

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Where they just, you know, they serve wings, obviously

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
In all these different flavors

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And I don't think I've ever had, like, food worse for you

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Probably that food at Wingstop

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Hooters wings are worse for you

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Are they?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
But Hooters wings are good

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
No they're not

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
No they're not

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I think Hooters wings are good

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Everything at Hooters sucks

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Even the women suck

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Everything at Hooters is awful

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
What is wrong with this picture?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm gonna keep the dirty comment down

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
What is wrong with this picture?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I love Hooters more than anyone else in this room

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Their food, I have given their food, like, three different chances

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And, like, not only is their food bad, but their service is worse

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's just, it's absolutely crap

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Their hostels taste like too much vinegar

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
For example, I went in one time and I decided

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Okay, I'm gonna get a burger and what the hell

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Let's get, order the wings because everyone's raving about the wings and stuff

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Order the burger, the burger took an hour for me to get at my table

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
The wings, mind you, which is their staple food that they serve there

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Took two hours to get to me

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Now Loki's too loud

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And they tasted like shit, okay

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Get him angry, then he'll be louder

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
And not only that, okay, so I tried normal, like, their normal hot wings or whatever

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
They tasted like shit

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I tried them, like, a different flavor

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It's a different flavor of shit

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's just, it's, it's awful

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
There is nothing good at that place

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
All their food sucks and if you go for the ambiance, you're stupid

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
You can get better food at a strip club

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Are you kidding?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I just, the last time I went to Hooters was Victoria and I

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
We were like, where should we go eat?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Let's go to Hooters!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
And we went, we had fun, we were laughing the whole time

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Our waitress had big boobies and we were, you know, making fun of her

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
But in a positive way, like, you know

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Seriously, okay, strip club food is not very good

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It was better than Hooters

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
And you know what?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
At a strip club, I'm not gonna just have to imagine naked boobies

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I can see them firsthand

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
So, you know, I'm sorry, it's just not worth my time

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Here's my, here's my question about Hooters

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Do you remember that E3?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
It was probably 2004, 2005

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
When we were staying at the ghetto, ghetto ghetto ghetto

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Like, I don't know what inspired us to stay there

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I ought to be young and in our 20s again

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
But to be staying at that ghetto Motel 6

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And we had to walk up Hollywood Boulevard

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Through a concert that Jimmy Kimmel Live was doing or something

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
To get to Hooters, because we were like

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Hadn't you never been there at that point?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I've never been there

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's right, and I was like, Loki!

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
You're like a manly man and you've never been to Hooters

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm like, don't tell me you're gonna make a gay man take you to Hooters

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
So eventually a gay man did have to take him to Hooters

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
So we went to Hooters

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And, you know, it was, it was our first experience

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, his first experience at Hooters

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And I guess it wasn't favorable

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, just also getting there took us like 30 minutes

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
When it was just like a block up the street

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
We could see it, but it took a half an hour to get there

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
So, anyhow

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
But it wasn't crowded, because everybody was out in the street watching the concert

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
And then once the concert was over, oh damn, did that place fill up fast

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
It's crazy

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Alright, anyhow, sorry, we'll stop talking about Hooters

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
And talk about our gaming week!

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
What types of games have you been playing this week?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
It was actually busy, believe it or not

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I've really been getting into Blue Dragon

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Which, yeah, it took me long enough, but shut up

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
And I really like it for its classic RPG-ocity

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You know, it's been pretty fun for me

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
And I also played through Raiden Fighters Aces

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
And nearly beat the game, except that I was in a lot of pain when I was playing it

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, I was, it was really more that I was just gonna play for a little bit of it

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And then, you know, put it aside

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
But I actually played all the way through

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And then I kept getting to the last stage

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And because my hand hurt so bad, I couldn't hit the fire button fast enough

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
So I kept also not counteracting the fire that was coming at me

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
And kept dying

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
And it turns out that when you have to continue, it starts you off from the beginning of the stage

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And I just said, you know what, fuck a bunch of this

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And, you know, I'm not gonna do it

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
So I put it down and then promptly went to go put my hand in a big thing of ice water

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Because it really, really hurt

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
And then I also played a lot of the Namco Museum package that we picked up

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
And, you know, just some Galaga and some Pac-Man

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Wait, is this the 360 compilation?

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay, so this is like the Galaga Resurrection and some of the arcade titles they've put out over the past couple years

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
They kind of butchered the Galaga one

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I like, I had more fun going back and playing Galaga 98, uh, Galaga 88

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
So, you know, Dan and I were actually talking about, you know, this is more fun on TurboGrafx

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
So, um, it's not a bad collection, it's a really good collection

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And I love Namco, yay Namco, kiss kiss

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But, eh

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
And then, um, we were gonna play some Symphony of the Night and as it turned out that Dan hasn't authorized our Xbox yet

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So I can't play it

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Even though we have it on his account, I can't play it

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And I was like, ugh, ugh, ugh

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So, um, so then I started playing a lot of Blue Dragon

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And I love, love, love, love, love Blue Dragon

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And I just got back to their village

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
If anyone who's played the game knows where that is

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
What part of the game I'm at

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
Now that game took a lot of shit for being kind of generic, for being kind of, like, not that impressive

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Some people have said for considering who all's behind it

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
You know what? They can bite me

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay then

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
Because the thing that I like about it is that it has the classic RPG feel

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It has a good solid story

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And yeah, maybe it's not, ooh, innovative

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Maybe it doesn't have the stigma of being Final Fantasy

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
But I bet if you slapped a Final Fantasy name on it and changed the characters, I bet you'd love it

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Seriously

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
But I mean, it has the charm of, uh

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I've noticed this typically about games that Toriyama designs

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
That they tend to have that charm that comes with his art style

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And I loved that

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That was fantastic for me

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And Uematsu's music, I mean, oh my god, Uematsu

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It made me happy

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
See, I get that, but I'm way more about Lost Odyssey than I was Blue Dragon

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I didn't think Blue Dragon was as terrible as a lot of folks made it out to be

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
But I just thought it was, eh, it's aight

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It's aight

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Did you just say it's aight?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Stop

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
It's classic, it's new and classic at the same time

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You know what I mean?

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
It's a new story, it's something to play through, but something that you can pick up that will automatically be familiar to you

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
So for me, it's been filling my must-play Super Nintendo with a more comfortable controller

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Alright

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And of course I've been playing Sims 3

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I started another family because the game decided to fart on one of mine

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, technically what happened is that, um

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Someone turned off my computer while I was in the middle of a game

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And didn't save said game

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
So it was either the Spouse or Windows Updates

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Which I thought I had turned those off too

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So, whatever

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And um, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, I've also been playing on Gaia

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I like the booty grab

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Uh, going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com for questions and comments

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Ray Iyanami asked Dark Sakura, hold it

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Which game on RFA, which Raiden fighters, and was it on one credit?

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Um, actually no because like I said, my hand hurt a lot

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So I played the first one

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Um

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You know, I was really just gonna sit down and see what it was like

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Cause I hadn't played the Aces ones

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So I played through and

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, I was

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I really don't have the fine control that I used to

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Because I've, you know, like I said

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
My hand has been, um, sticking with a suture in it

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And my tendons are healing themselves

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So I haven't really been able to play

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like I might have, you know

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
A few years ago

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
So, uh, no I didn't do it on one credit

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
But hopefully in a couple months that'll be all better, right?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah, well when it's all better I'm gonna be going back to R-Type

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Alright

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Loki, how about you and your gaming week?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I played DDR, that was it

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That's all I played is DDR

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Or, not DDR, what the hell am I talking about? I didn't play any DDR

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm a DDR freak, so you know

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Really? This is actually kind of noteworthy

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm like, you actually started exercising

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What is this?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Eventually I will, but no

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm a green DDR freak, so

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
No, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto all the week

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
All week long, and we have

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Been recording our, like, multiplayer game

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Because Grand Theft Auto and DDR have so much in common

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Okay, it's a three letter acronym

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I was looking to say, and I was staring at DDR freak

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
That's why I made the slip, okay?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So, whatever

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
With all due respect to the many friends I made on there

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Including you guys

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Since when was DDR freak relevant again?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It's not, I'm looking at

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm trying to, okay

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Because I have my pads that I've built

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
You remember when I built them? Hell, it was that long ago

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I've used them since

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
No, I haven't used them since then

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
So, I have them sitting in my garage

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And I'm just seeing if it's going to be more

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Agentageous to actually

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Purchase some

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Already pre-done arcade style pads

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
For DDR

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Or should I just fix it?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Because right now I have to ground

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
The pads because the static electricity being built up

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
By the Lexan

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Arrows

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It causes the

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Thing I have it attached to

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
To interpret the keys

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
To short out

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Because it just builds up static electricity

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And then, like, shocks it

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Which is not good

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Because it'll stop working after about two minutes

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And then have to reboot the whole computer

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
So

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I need to figure out how to ground them

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And one time I read how to do that

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And I can't remember now, so

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm just going to buy new ones

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Because it's easier that way

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Frisbee in our chat room says

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Grand Theft Arrow

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
No, but Grand Theft Auto

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
We've been playing quite a bit, of course

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I have like

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Five hours of footage now

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Of us playing Grand Theft Auto

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Even a little bit of me playing

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Earth Defense Force

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because we decided to switch off to Earth Defense Force

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Because our other co-worker decided

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
He wanted to go play Magic the Gathering with somebody

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So we were like, ah, fuck that

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But yeah, Grand Theft Auto

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It'll be awesome, I just have to

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Edit it down now to

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Something funny

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And set the music

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Good, because the Orange Launch Radio channel needs more content

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It's in HD, so it'll be awesome

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, because that new capture thing I have

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Is awesome, it works so well

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So it'll make things a lot easier

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
For capturing video to put on the site

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Good, we need to do some mystery science

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Theatering to video games

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That's what we need to do

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
There's actually some old school talk going on in the chat room right now

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
What's it called?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Block Box

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So we brought up Tetranet

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
You remember Tetranet?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I remember Tetranet, I used to play that stuff all the time

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Sorry to interrupt

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And I'm getting an arcade cabinet

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Really?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Is it an actual game, or what is it?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's an arcade cabinet

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Just the cabinet?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
For what?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
What do you plan to put on it?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Maim, DDR

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's a candy cabinet

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Do you know what a candy cabinet is?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I haven't the slightest idea what that is

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You know those cabinets that line Arcade Infinity?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
The really small ones?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh, yeah, like the ones you sit down and play?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Yes, that's a candy cabinet

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh, those are pretty cool

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
There's a deal going on

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
There's the Neo Geo forums

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I found it looking for something else

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Because at one time

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I wanted to buy a DDR machine

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But then I had to scale down

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
my wishes

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Because a DDR machine would cost me at least $2500

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Probably more than that

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And that's just not affordable

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
So a candy cab

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm looking at a

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
new Astro City machine

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Which is a Sega made one

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And um

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's supposed to run somewhere around $450

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I think

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And they're basically doing a big bulk shipment

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And they have some extras available

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
They're being shipped to San Francisco

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So um

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Hopefully, I'm trying to get the guy to

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
send me a personal message again

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
So I can actually put down the deposit for it

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Because they're supposed to be coming

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Between now and September, so

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
That'd be awesome

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because then I'm gonna put a

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
To become like a

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Little, short, stubby

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
DDR machine

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Are you sure it's actually DDR and not Grand Theft Auto?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It can be both

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Actually, we were thinking about

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Getting one of those for all of our Neo Geo

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, you should act on this

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I mean, 400 bucks

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And they're shipping them already

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Actually, they're already on a boat

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
They're already on a boat on the way here

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Yes, they're on a motherfucking boat

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
So they're already on their way over

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's just, um

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You know, he's trying to sell 30 of them

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Otherwise, he's gonna keep them

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And sell them for higher

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I should ask the spouse, just

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
He could pay for it out of pinball money

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
We're having a hard time hearing you, DarkSakura

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Make sure that mic's really good

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Thank you, much better

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And then I'm having a milkshake

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And my stomach feels like it's gonna explode

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because I have lots of milkshake in me

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, there you go

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Let's see my gaming week

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Wednesday

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
We all got a patch on Xbox Live, right?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And everybody, you know, had to update

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
To this new patch that

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You know, added all this new stuff in Netflix

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And blah, blah, blah

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Kind of changed some things with the achievements and so on

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
So I'm gonna download that and I'm messing with the achievements and stuff for a little bit

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Thought I'd look at Netflix

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And I like the fact that you can add the movies

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
From the Netflix channel now

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You can kind of browse through what new movies are out and things

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I thought that was pretty awesome

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Then I turn it off and I'm off doing other things for a while

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And then I'm bored

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So I put a tweet up on Twitter that says

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Hi, I'm bored, who wants to play Rock Band?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So a couple of the OLR listeners are like, me, me, me

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
So they invite me into a game

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We're playing some Rock Band, da, da, da, da, da

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I have to step away for a little bit because I gotta do some other errands real quick

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
And I got other things I gotta do

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
But then I go back after about 20 minutes

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Turn on the Xbox 360 again and then

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It starts doing all

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
That's actually the sound it makes

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It just starts throwing up everywhere

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Making all these, like, jaggeds on the screen

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And looks very ugly

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And it'll happen in the middle of a game

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It'll happen when I'm trying to boot up and so forth

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So, of course, what do I instantly blame?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
The patch that went out on Wednesday

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm like, oh my god, my system got borked by the patch

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I'm becoming a statistic

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm like, this happened before, right?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And we have a ton of people that got their Xboxes screwed up because of the patch

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, turns out

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
There's a handful of people on Twitter

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Who claim that happened, but

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I made this whole YouTube and I posted it to the

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Orange Ons Radio channel and most people are telling me

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Just have lucky timing

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And your system's about to red ring

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, I can fucking tell that

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It's obviously about to red ring

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It's broken already

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I mean, it's not getting past a certain point, red ring or not

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So, congratulations me, my Xbox is broke

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
And, once you know it

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm just outside the three year warranty thing

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That means I get to open it up

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm like three years and six months after it

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
That means I get to open it up

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You wanna open it up?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
We'll see, we can fix it

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I've had a few

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Oh, goodie

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Hey, 50% is better than zero percent

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Sounds like my trauma center record, look

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't know, I'm kind of all about fixing it

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But at the same time, I'm like

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And there's a story later on about price cuts

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And I'm like, maybe I'll just wait and get the elite system

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Because I kinda want the new stuff

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
But, hold on a minute

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Why am I allowing myself to think this way?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Why do I even need to be worrying about repairs and so on in the first place?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
What the hell kind of system

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Fries itself after three years?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Really?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Video game systems

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Most of them have been pretty stable

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Most people have old school Nintendos that still work

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Granted, you have to blow on the cartridge and so on

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
But, not bad for like 25 years old

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Eh?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
You're preaching to the choir, okay?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I have five systems that have died, okay?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
My Dreamcast is 10 years old and still works

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
We've been celebrating the Genesis

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
On Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
He was talking a lot about that

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That just celebrated his 20th anniversary

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Those still work

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
That are older than most of our listeners ages combined

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
In the back room of my house

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
That, guess what?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Still work!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Except for the Atari 7800, but it still has an hour supply

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So, let's not talk about that

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It's just stupid

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Like, and I just

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You know, it's just kind of funny

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The response I was getting was a lot of people was like, yep

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You're Red Ringing 2

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I've been there

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And, you know, I couldn't help but think

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm so grateful that everybody's letting me know

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm not alone

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
On the other hand, I'm thinking

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
What the hell kind of gaming society have we become

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That this is even borderline acceptable

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
That we've just chalked this up to

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Eh, it happens

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Those Xbox 360s

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Totally unreliable

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I guess I'll have to get another one

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm just thinking to myself

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Where did we go wrong?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Where did we allow this to be acceptable?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Why is Microsoft doing as well as they are?

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
To bring in a more sociological aspect to it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Sorry, this is the way the world is

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Because your initial systems were broken

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I was sort of doing something

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Um

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's the fact that people would rather be complacent

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Than put any effort into changing a situation

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
In general

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And so, enough people just let it go

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And they can get away with it

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
But, you know, enough people complain about something

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And something might eventually happen

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You know

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
If they think that they can get away with it this long

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
They're just gonna keep getting away with it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Until enough people hold them accountable

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
That's all there is to that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, all I have to say is that

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It just sucks

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Like, the whole thing just sucks

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And Microsoft sucks

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And, you know, you suck for not making more of a stink about it

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Not you specifically

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But you as gamers in general

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And I suck for not realizing this before

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And everything sucks

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And the fact that I'm gonna have to buy a new 360

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Sucks too

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Or I guess I could get this one fixed

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I'm having offers for fixing

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And apparently Loki has an awesome 50% fixed record

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And the other one was just unfixable

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I tried everything, okay

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
It was just too far gone

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh, who knows

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And actdeft is apologizing to me in chat

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But you don't need to apologize, it's not your fault

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Stop apologizing

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
People who apologize for things that aren't their fault

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Sucks

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Well, that's actually the big thing

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That I think

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Is the problem with the industry

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
As it is now

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
With almost anything actually

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Is that

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Too many people are just

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
More willing to

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh, I don't wanna conflict

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I don't wanna put the effort into it

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I don't wanna do this about it

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Oh, well that's just how it is

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's how things are gonna be

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
You know

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Everyone get off your asses

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And complain if you've got something wrong

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
This is the thing

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Here's what I want, I'm gonna put a challenge

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Out there

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
This would make me happy

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I will spend the $300 on a new elite

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Or whatever I have to do when the price drop comes down

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I will do all this stuff

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And continue to just let Microsoft

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Rate me in the butt as they're doing right now

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I will continue to allow this

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
If my challenge goes responded to

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
By the media and the gaming industry

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I know there's some of you insider folk that listen

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And don't wanna admit it

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I know there's some of you that work for gaming companies and so forth

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That listen and probably don't wanna admit it to your employer

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
But look, this is the one thing I want

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
That will make me happy

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Because in 3 or 4 years Microsoft is gonna come out

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And tout their new console

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Their Xbox 720

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Or whatever you wanna call it

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Or hell, there's talk that there might be a slim down

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
360

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is what I want

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This is what I want every media outlet

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
This is what I want every gamer

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
To ask Microsoft

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
About their new system

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Will it last more than 3 years?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Does this system red ring

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Those are the questions I want Microsoft

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
To be asked to their face

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And have to answer

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Why should I trust you

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That your system is not another pile of poop

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I do it

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Okay, so this hasn't been done yet

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I think that what we should do also

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Is, and this is actually something

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
As a community

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Have you ever heard of a site called

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Starbucked.com?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
No, but does this have to do with Battlestar Galactica?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
No, it's about a person who had

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Such a horrible customer service experience

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
With Starbucks

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
That he created a consumer advocacy site

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
So that people could voice their concerns regarding

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Problems they've had with Starbucks

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And his problem is actually something

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
That could have been fixed

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
If one person had gotten off their ass and helped him properly

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So, um

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I think that I should make a site

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And don't nobody make it for me

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Unless you want to make me an admin of it

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Is a red ringed, you know

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Oh, there's got to be a site like that already

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I looked, there wasn't

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Really?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
You know, to make a big, you know

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Hi, this is a picture of our red ringed system

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
This is what was done about it

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And keep a running tally

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Of all of these

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And start, you know, sending

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Up and go, hey look

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Here's where you guys have screwed up

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Here's our tally this week, here's our tally this week

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Here, just search Twitter, seriously

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Search Twitter, R-R-O-D, watch

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I even, I was at work

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
On Friday and I mentioned, we had some

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Down time because our systems were down

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And I mentioned, oh yeah, my Xbox

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
And people I never suspected even played

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Video games, like outside of like

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Madden and stuff were saying, oh you got the

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Red rings, huh? Yeah, I got that too

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And like everybody in class was piping up

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, the red rings, oh I know the red rings

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Well you know what, then why not, let's

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Let's, um, if I pulled up

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Everything on Twitter that had

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Red ring of death, printed it out

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
In black and white because I don't want to save my color cartridges

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And emailed the stack

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Not emailed, but mailed the stack

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Of papers to

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Microsoft and go, look

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't think they do anything

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Because people are still buying 360's

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But what's it do? So it doesn't boot up now?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Or is it just not play your games?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It does a blalalala thing after

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
It's been on like two minutes

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Sometimes during the boot, sometimes while I'm in the middle of the game

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Doesn't matter

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
To be honest, I haven't really tried it since that one night

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
That's where I'm at

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
To be perfectly honest though

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean, I think we're on

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
What, our third

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
360, but keep in mind

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
We have an advantage

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I just want the history of gaming to put

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
A black mark on, excuse me

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
A red mark on Xbox

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
A red ring around the Xbox

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
A red ring on the Xbox 360

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
For this travesty

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And the fact that they're covering it up very well

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I mean, has there been any console

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
In history

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
That has the hardware issues that the 360 has?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
The reason why

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
They, I think are being able

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
To keep their head afloat regarding everything

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Is the fact that they've been so quick to replace

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Systems too

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Like, I know, honestly Rob

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I think you should still give a call, give a try

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You know, say hey

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I bought this, you know, before

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
All this was going on

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You guys owe me

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You know, see what happens

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
You know, if they want to keep your business as a customer

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
They're gonna bend over backwards

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Bobby says the PS2, Bobby actually says a lot in chat

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Let me read some of the comments from chat

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Bobby says they know

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Sorry, Microsoft knows

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
They know, they won't admit it, but they know

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah, he says his original

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Xbox still works, so does mine

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Mine does too

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
And he goes on to say the difference between the PS2 and the 360

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Is that there were no blogs when the PS2s

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Were failing in mass, and you know, that's

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Certainly a legitimate viewpoint

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't know, see here's the thing though

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I don't know anyone that had a PS2 that failed

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Outside of people I've met on the internet

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Like, when I was gaming

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I didn't know anybody that had a failed PS2

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Mine didn't fail, I know like 50 people that have

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
360s fail

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
My Japanese PS2, guess what?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It still works!

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, my Japanese PS2 still works too

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I mean, first release model

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
We got ours way back when

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
We had this like

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Cause I wanted Tekken that bad

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
So we got our

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
We have a Japanese PS3

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
There was I think a PS2, sorry

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
If I'm right, it was a demo system

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Back from when Game Masters

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Was still open

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And that was years ago

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And I'm on my fifth PS2 and you met me in person

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I guess that's true

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
But you know what I mean, like, you know

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
My Japanese PS2 still works perfectly

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And those are the ones that were

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Definitely having problems back in the day

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
My PS2 that I have now

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Works perfectly

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm just annoyed

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What else did we get in chat?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I do have a stack of PS1s by the way

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I want to get onto other stuff in my gaming week

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Cause I did more than just bitch about my

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Bork to Xbox 360, but let's see, what else was there

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I think I posted a chat from Wiki

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
In response to the November 2006 update

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Error that bricked his console

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
A California man filed a class action lawsuit against

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Microsoft in Washington federal court in early December

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
2006, the lawsuit seeks

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
5 million in damages and the free repair of any

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Console rendered unusable by the update

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
This will be the second such lawsuit filed against

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Microsoft, the first having been filed in 2005

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Shortly after the... etc

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Unfortunately not enough

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
People had their consoles borked by this update

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And people are, you know, telling me up and down

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That it wasn't the update

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
All I know is that, you know

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It sure is convenient timing for this to happen

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Have you tried bringing it without the hard drive?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I haven't, should I try that?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Yes

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Ok, I'll try that, see what happens

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Because it could be something corrupted on the hard drive

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Do you have Rock Band 2 installed to your hard drive?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I do, but the thing will crap out before

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Even playing Rock Band 2

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
But you have it installed to your hard drive

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Cause it just reads your disc for a second

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And then it runs it off the hard drive

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Ok, I'll try that

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That would certainly be better, but we'll see

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Alright, anyhow

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Other stuff I played my gaming week

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Cause I have much more in my gaming week than just

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Abort 360 that I still, by the way

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
My resolution right now is I'm not doing anything

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Till this rumored price drop will get to later in the show

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Maybe I'll get it repaired

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I don't know, right now I'm leaning

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Right now I'm leaning towards just getting a new

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
360

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Get a new one and make sure it's a new elite, not an older elite

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That people have been sitting on forever

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Or, yeah, that's what I'll try and do

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But anyhow

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
What I wanted to get into elsewhere in my gaming week

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Because this is something that deserves

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Positive talk and not negative talk

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Is Ion Online I played a little more of

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
They had their next closed beta

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I guess the final one, it's the second closed beta

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I've participated in

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And I got to play the game a lot more than

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Two weeks ago, the first time I played the beta for Ion Online

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I still feel like I've only really

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Scratched the surface of the game

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And I was having a lot of problems with

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Graphics stuff

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
The game doesn't work too hot with

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Vista, but I found if I ran in full screen windowed mode

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I was able to get a much better frame rate

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So, you know, just you have to really

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Tinker with those settings and at least they've made it very

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Customizable in the graphics and so on

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
The game is a very good looking game

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
It's a very smooth game

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's kind of fun, it's wow-ish

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It definitely, you can feel the

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Wow inspiration there, but one thing I liked

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That WoW doesn't have is the

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Whole chained combat

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Meaning that there are moves that you can do

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
That only open up after you do

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
A first move, like maybe you do a

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Special little thing with your mace, then you can make

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
A lightning bolt fall down or whatever

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's branching combos

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Ragnarok Online has that

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah, Monk class, you have your combos

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Well that's every class in this game has something like that

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
But I mean, I'm saying that Ragnarok Online certainly

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Thought of, you know, implementing stuff like that

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Well sure, I'm sure a lot of what

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Can be thought of has been thought of in MMOs

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Who knows, there could be more though

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I only got my character to level 8

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Which is like scratching the surface of the game

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I didn't even get into any PVP or instances or what have you

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So can I fairly review this game?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
No, but off the closed beta

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Can I say I'm interested?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
The game was fun enough

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Where I would feel like I could buy the game

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And I won't be getting ripped off

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Yes, I think it's worth checking out

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
So that's what I plan to do in September

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And then hopefully I'll be able to spend some more time with it

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
And tell you my final thoughts on it

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So there you go

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And I've been playing a priest

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
So, there it is

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I wanna play

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Anyhow

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Hold on, I'm reading comments from chat here

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
About, yes

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
To publicly acknowledge it

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Because it keeps going back and forth in chat

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I am aware that CC Gaming

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Repairs 360s

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And would also take the 360 for scrap

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I just haven't decided what I want to do yet

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You know, because I'd have to ship it

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Which is gonna be money, but

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
You know, I don't know

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I want some time to think and try these

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Other solutions too before I just

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Commit to one particular solution

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Certainly that's something I'm heavily considering

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
But we'll see

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Alright

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
That's it for our gaming weeks

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Let's get into

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
What's this present? Ooh, present

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Some of my more obscure Bimani stuff

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You burned me a DVD mini

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah, I remember you used to use CD

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Minis all the time, now it's DVD Minis

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Well that's because it was, they were

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Cheap by the spindle and

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
You know, the pre-shift fit on them

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Perfectly, all my stuff was just fine

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But the next one I'm gonna burn you is an actual DVD

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Alright, uh

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Of which we don't have a lot, but we will continue to plug our

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Twitter at OLR and then of course we're on

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Facebook as the OLR me

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
We have a MySpace supposedly too

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Is anyone on MySpace anymore? No, we had some friend requests

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
There the other day, so I guess we do

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And yeah, LiveJournal

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Orange launch MySpace is so 2005

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It really is, okay

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Let's get into some gaming news then and we'll

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Start with Loki

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yes, there is a couple of rumors

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Regarding some Wii software

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
One of which is of course

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Wii Fit, there is a rumored price point

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
For it, which of course

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Not too surprising, they have the

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Bundle at the

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
$99.99 price point

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Which is, you know

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Or I should say $99.99 price point

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I think that's a little higher, that's kinda weird

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
But anyways, it's pretty close to what the

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Normal Wii Fit bundle is

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Then of course the rumor is the standalone

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Game is gonna be $29.99 as well

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
No word exactly on

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
When those are gonna be officially announced

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
But I don't know

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That sounds about right to me

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
You know, $29.99 for a game that's

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Not too different than the original

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Sounds fair, I guess

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Maybe

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The other weird thing though

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
That they have

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And this is also coming from

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
A marketing survey, apparently

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
They have a slide

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
That shows

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
What appears to be some

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Sort of new peripheral that's gonna be

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
With a game that's

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Like a bicycling game and the peripheral

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Itself actually looks like one of those

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Oh

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Gosh

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I forget the kind of bike

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The exercise bike?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Stationary?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Recumbent bike

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I think, something like that

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's really interesting because

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It almost looks like a Wii Fit type of

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Game

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
You can definitely see Miis in the pictures

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And stuff like that, but I don't think it's

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Necessarily something from

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Nintendo themselves

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Because

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Some of the other characters don't necessarily look like

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Miis, but they have different things like

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Road races, you can walk

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Your dog in the game, you can do

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Almost like a prop copter type thing

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You can

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Rotate one of the things

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Spin a rotisserie barbecue

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Downhill

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Racing, you name it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And of course the usual

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Calorie tracking and that kind of

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Stuff, but I mean it looks kind of cool

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And definitely something I could see on

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
The Wii, so

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
No word on what that is, I'm guessing it's probably a third

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Party putting that out, probably someone like Ubisoft

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Or EA or something

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Well it wouldn't surprise me too if one of these

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Bicycling things got picked up because it seems

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Like at E3, remember when there was a

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Kenshi Hall and everything? We would see something

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Like this demoed, like a

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Bicycling exercise game

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
There's some companies exploring this, have been

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
For a long time

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I wouldn't be surprised if it even was Nintendo doing it or something

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Just maybe that one screenshot

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Is kind of misleading because the one character

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Doesn't look like a Mii, but

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Everything doesn't have to look like a Mii in the games

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
But who knows

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
The other thing is, it sort of looks like an island

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Setting, and I know that they've talked about

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Putting the other games on that stupid island

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
That they created for Wii Fit

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
In Wii Sports Resort

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Wii Fit's on an island?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Well they have like, the jogging

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Is on an island

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
So I don't know if it's the same island

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But it's very similar

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Skinny Island, what would the name of that island be?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It's WooHoo Island or something

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
WooHoo Island? I think that's what they called it

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
WooHoo, I'm not fat anymore, yay

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Or Sex Island, as Sims would call it

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
WooHoo Island

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
WooHoo! Whoopee

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I don't know

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It's neat

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I would be more excited about the pedal thing than I would be

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The Wii Fit balance board, because at least the pedal thing

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You know, it seems like exercise

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Whereas the balance board, you're just kind of

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Standing there, leaning back and forth

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
You know, back and forth

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't know

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Again, our good friend Bobby is just piping up with all sorts of trivia tonight

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Saying Miyamoto wants that to become

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
One of the new characters that is indeed

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
WooHoo Island

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Is the name of where all this takes place

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Well I don't want to see any other games with the island

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
You know, running around doing stuff

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
You know, Mario at WooHoo Island

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
You know, killing Koopas

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh wait for it, it'll happen

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
There's a new Smash Brothers game with WooHoo Island

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
As a playable character

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
That'll be a stage, it'll be a stage

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
No, it'll be a character

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The island will be a character

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
He said it himself, the island's a character

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Spoiler right there

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I mean, how do you face off against a whole island?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
You can't

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
X-Men did it

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Giants has X-Men number one

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Uh huh

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Oh my gosh

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Told you I'm a geek

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Um, so uh

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I don't know, what do you guys think of this?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Is this bicycle peripheral something that would interest you guys?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Or no?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
It'd be interesting to see it, but

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Once again, I'd probably use it about as much as I do Wii Fit

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Wii Fit though, it fills the space

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Underneath my TV stand

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That's it

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You should lend it to me

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It's all about price to me

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I actually use Wii Fit once in a while

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I haven't lately, I've been slacking off

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And I need to stop doing that

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
It's summer, it's too hot in the summer

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The price would be $89.99

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Including the peripheral, it's about the price of a Wii Fit

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
For the bike and the game?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
That's not terrible

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
If the game was fun and the bike thing actually worked

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Cause she's actually sitting on the couch

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Or something, right?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And the bike is kinda there

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
If that is actually sturdy

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Then that might be cool

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I don't know though

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
We'll have to see

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I like exercise bikes and stuff

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
You know what, I can go to my gym

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And play my Gameboy on a bike

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But that's also how much a month?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I don't pay a whole lot for my gym

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I'm out of contract

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I see

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Alright, moving on to some other news

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Talking about something on the DS

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
As opposed to the Nintendo Wii

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Dragon Quest IX of course

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Was a huge game over in Japan when it came out

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
As all Dragon Quest games are

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And so of course the question is

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
When is it going to come out over here?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Well apparently there was a Q&A session

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
This week with investors

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And the president of Squeenix

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Yoishi Wada said that they are

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Considering releasing Dragon Quest IX

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Overseas

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And still deciding which regions are actually

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Going to get it

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And they don't plan to release it until after April

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Of 2010

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They're assholes is basically what it is

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm serious, it's just like

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Eh, why do we feel like it?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You'll be lucky and be pleased when you get it

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
It's just like

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You know, they see the fans of the series

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Over here just as like

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Beggars on the street that they

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
May casually throw down their

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Money so that they can bask in the glory

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Of Dragon Quest

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
They can go fuck themselves because I don't give a shit

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
About their fucking game

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Dragon Quest is a horrible series in my opinion

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh, now come on, now you're just being petty

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Because Dragon Quest VIII was awesome

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
No it wasn't

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And Dragon Quest VIII

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Sold about half a million copies here in North America

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That isn't any

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Small number, I mean is it a blockbuster?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
No

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Is it pretty decent? Yeah

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So why not?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And look, I'm going to say something that I know is going to piss

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Some people off but I kind of don't care because I'm just

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Keeping it real, okay

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
This is the case when I support piracy

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Honestly

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
When these foreign companies are too stubborn

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
To release the games over here

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I say you know what

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Then if you can understand Japanese

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Copy the Japanese one and get it

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Why do you have to worry about that? Because they have people that will

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Translate it and then they'll add a patch

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
To the ROM and boom it's in English

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And I know I'm going to take some flack for that comment

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
But I kind of don't care because I was doing that with

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
DDR years ago when they

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Refused to release that over here and you know

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
When they finally released it over here I bought

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Every single one even when they were crap

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
For quite a while

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And Konami thanks you for that by releasing even

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Crappier games

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
The lesson we learned there that doesn't matter

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But I just

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
This kind of news that like they just

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I'm all about like

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I understand resources and that there's

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Other games they want to do

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And maybe they want to do some things that are outside the box

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And so forth but I don't know

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
This thing kind of just reeks of

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And we just don't feel

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Like it right now

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Type thing

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And some folks in chat GameGuru says

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Mother 3 in Act F speaks up

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
With the Mother 3 fan translation

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I'm all for that too

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You know

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I'm just

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I don't understand why they just won't

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I can't imagine it takes that

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Long to translate a game especially when

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
You have fans that translate it

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
For you

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I mean that's got to be the ultimate kick in the pants

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
When you have these fan companies

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Beating you to it

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
People that are paid 40 hours

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
A week to do this

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I don't know

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Keep in mind though that when

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
They do it themselves

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Not only do they have to pay

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Translator, they have to

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Pay writer

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
They have to take the time to change

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Anything in game

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Graphically that has

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
They need to

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Translate from one language to another

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
They have to pay

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Someone to localize it

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
To make the jokes come across

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I played through a

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Fan done copy of Final Fantasy 5

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And there were just a few things in there

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
That I got because I had

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Studied some Japanese for a while

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
That I don't know that other people

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Might have gotten because the joke

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Is

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
It was actually a pun

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
There are things that are lost in translation

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
That you do have to

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Go through

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Reorganizing for the cultural element

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
To make it something that would be

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Understood by your audience

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
So there is actually a good deal of cost

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
That comes in with

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
The translation process

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
When you are paying for it

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
For the fans

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
For them, it's a labor of love

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's something that they enjoy doing

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
But when the company brings it out, they have to pay

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Somebody to do this

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
And even if someone says, oh I'll do it for free

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I'm sorry that doesn't work, you still have to pay them

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Because there are labor laws

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And then there is marketing

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
There is

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Production cost

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
In the actual physical copies of the game

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
There's

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You know, shipment

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You have to deal with a lot of the money

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That they would make back on Dragon Quest 9?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
But when they also

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
And again, I'm doing this straight from a business

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Perspective, they have to look at previous sales

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And look at what their overhead was

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Versus how much they actually made

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
The last few games that they have localized over here

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
At least on the 360 and stuff, haven't done that great

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I mean, Star Ocean, Last Hope wasn't all that great

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
The Last Remnant

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Was not that great at all

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
The game itself wasn't that great

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
And then the one before that, which I don't remember

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The name off the top of my head

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
But that didn't do that well either

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
It's just, I don't know

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Was that Infinite on Discovery?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Yes, Infinite on Discovery

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But there's just a lot of weird stuff that they're doing

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Like, Chrono Trigger did alright

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Shit, dude, it's just a ROM

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
That they're basically running off an emulator

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I mean, that's basically all they did

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
You can't tell me that they programmed the engine

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
From scratch and rebuilt the game

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I'm sorry, I don't buy that at all

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
And I could totally see them going the route of like

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
You know, the Final Fantasy 4 after years stuff

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Where they just take the ROM and kind of edit it

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
And add some new stuff to it

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And boom, new game, let's resell it

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And even the stuff that they've done online

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Like Final Fantasy 4 and whatnot

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I mean, My Life as a King is kind of eh

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
When they had download content

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
That probably should have been included in the game to begin with

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And My Life as a Dark Lord was kind of eh

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
It was alright, I guess

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
And their tactical

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I don't remember the other Final Fantasy tactical game

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
That they had

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
The Tower Defense one

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Is kind of just

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
This is alright, but they haven't really been having

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
That many good hits lately

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And other than Final Fantasy 4 and 3 and stuff like that

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
On DS

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
When they actually remade them

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And that was kind of cool

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because there's effort put into it

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
And it's Final Fantasy

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But I don't know, maybe they're just worried

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
That it's not going to do as well

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And why pay the money to have it, you know, translated

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
But it's a major release for them

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't see why they wouldn't do it

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
They're probably going to do it

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And it'll just take some time

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Because, you know, as history has shown

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Square is really slow

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
When it comes to finishing their games

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm looking at some comments in chat

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Gripper01

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Says

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Plus with fan translations they are not censored

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Like the early Final Fantasy translations

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Hmm

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Apparently

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
GameGuru is saying

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Atlas even offered to publish Mother 3 for Nintendo

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And Nintendo of Japan denied it

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And I guess this whole back and forth

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Is that because of all the parity

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
In the games

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Nintendo of America is afraid of getting sued

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So they want to make some changes

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And Nintendo of Japan won't let them

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
It's just weird, that whole mess

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
So why don't they release it in, well

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Do they, have they released it like on

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Virtual console or something like that?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Mother 3 is a DS game, so no

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It's a Game Boy Advance game

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
But they could still do it

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I don't know, I mean it's basically Super Nintendo

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I don't, they

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
In theory I think it could be done

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Actually I need to find the translated ROM

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Because I am going to play the translated ROM

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
People

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I'm saying this now

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Because I don't care

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
But yeah, actually something that brings the other thing

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Going back to what I was saying

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Is you also have to deal with distribution

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
And with dealing with the companies

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
That you're going to be releasing the game through

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Money, it all comes down to money

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I guess

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Alright, well let's move on

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
With some more news while I steam over

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Not having Dragon Quest 9, I guess

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It's not that bad, because this is a DS game

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And I don't have the attention span for DS games

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
So whatever

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Well, how about something else that you'd have

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
To have a bit of an attention span if you plan on

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Finishing it at all

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Mega Man 9

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
There's new download content, and guess what it does

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It makes the game harder

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Why?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
You have Super Hero Mode

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Which costs a dollar

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
A whole dollar

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
A whole dollar, it's 80 Microsoft points

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
It basically

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Just keeps, it increases the number of

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Enemies that you're going to see on screen

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
At any given time in the game

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
So yeah, it's for all you

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
People who want the next big challenge

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
It's basically for people who like asshole Mario

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Or who have like those

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Leftover points that you just can't seem

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
To get rid of, because everything is

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Everything is in multiples

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Of 100, except rock band songs

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
See, that would be kind of cool

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
If they did that for like Super Mario Brothers

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Like re-release Mario Brothers

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
With a level editor or something like that

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
And then have it where you could share levels online

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Of course that would be innovative and use online

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
So Nintendo would never buy that

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
A perfect example of something you could do

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Simple, you don't have to actually program

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Really a whole ton to it

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Release it

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
People would love it

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
And you'd get a lot of money back

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You'd put a lot of effort in

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because Nintendo certainly doesn't do that

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Yeah, but then they'd get sued for copying

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Little Big Planet

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, I'm in the camp that's like

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Isn't Mega Man 9 hard enough?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I guess there's definitely the hardcore fans

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I haven't played it yet, I bought it a long time ago

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
But I still haven't played it

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I only was able to beat like 3 or 4 of the robots

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Before I was like, okay I'm spent

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm done

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
You know what I'd like to see?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I'd actually like to see a new

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
That would make me happy

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
How about some Mega Man 9 easy mode content?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I'd pay a dollar for that

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Actually I had an idea of something that I would like to see

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And that's called like

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Like Uber Man

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Where it's Mega Man and you have to fight through

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
All of the 1 through 9 robots

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And then do the Uber Wily stage

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
I think that's every Mega Man fan's dream game

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Just Mega Man orgy

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Where it's like all 81 master robots

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Or however many they've had over the series

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Not even counting X

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I'm not even going to throw the X series into it

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Because that could be like the sequel when this game does well

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But Mega Man orgy would just be a game

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Where it's like all 81 robots

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Going at it at once

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
And then do it Metroid style

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Which is a very interesting orgy

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Considering one of those robots is a woman

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And the other 80 are men

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Just do it all Metroid style

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And make the dungeons like Mega Man Legends

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Tie that in there

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Oh that would be hot

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
But it has to remain 2D

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It has to remain 2D

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I was thinking of a game that just had all 81 stages in it

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
And playable at once

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
But I like your idea of a

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Metroidvania style Mega Man game

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
With all the robots

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
That's pretty cool

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
And if you totally used the escape velocity thing

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Then you would be able to

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Go back to your last save point

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
You know, location

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Do weird warps like that

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
And then Samus would come out and kick Mega Man's ass

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
So you totally took my game

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
But that actually is

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Ok we're putting that under Dream Games

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
And 4 player co-op because that would be awesome

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Just for fun

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
That's under Dream Games now for Orange Knowledge Radio

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
It's an official Dream Game

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
What Mega Man orgy?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Yeah Mega Man orgy

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I like what ActDeft calls it in chat

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Mega 10 RGY

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
So the 0 is an o in orgy

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I like that

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Ok

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
You are now marketing director of this game

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Congratulations on your promotion

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
You now get a non-existent job

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So add that to the wiki

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
That's going on the list

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
And at the end

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
There's a big butt

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
What?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Are you high?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's an easter egg

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
You know like when you can hold the buttons down

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And the stars turn into chickens

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Why would you just put a big butt

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
At the end of the game?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Are you like high?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Because it's on our list

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Are you 5 years old?

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Way to take a perfectly awesome game

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
And just literally shit on it

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Because it's on our list

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It would have a caption

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Kiss our ass Capcom

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
No you don't do that

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
That's wrong

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Oh come on you should look at our other games on our list

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Exactly

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
This is why it doesn't need to be on the list

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Because that list is just ridiculous stuff

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
This is ridiculous it's never gonna happen

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Well it's just because it's never gonna happen

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
It's just I don't have

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm sure there's people out there that have done custom Mega Man games

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
And it wouldn't be that difficult

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
The chat room would like to point out that what you're describing

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Could be Guts Man's ass

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
It could be

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Easter egg in the game you know

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Guts Man with a certain number of life left

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
And you get a butt

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
What is wrong with you?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
What is wrong with me for finding this funny?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
How old am I? Like five?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Seriously?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
It doesn't matter it's all for fun

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Fun does not require an age

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Alright but fun requires a new story real quick

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Here before this story or before this show

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Literally goes down the crapper

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Speaking of your butt

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Nintendo has patented a brand new

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Inflatable cushion that you would use

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
For a horseback riding game

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Why?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Just that's the most retarded thing

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I have ever heard

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
It looks absolutely awful

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
It basically their picture that they have

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
First off looks like this like grown man

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Dressed up like a little kid

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Which is creepy enough if you ask me

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And then the actual cushion itself

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Is literally just like an inner tube

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
That they have strapped the Wii remote to

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
And you rock back and forth

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I think that's supposed to be a kid

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I understand it's supposed to be a kid

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
But it looks like a man child

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
So what is this for?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
For a finally arcade perfect port

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Of Final Furlong or what is this?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
It's for I don't know

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Sitting on your butt

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
It's for those racing games that they have

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Where you sit on the Wii balance board

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
But if you have hemorrhoids you can't do it

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
So then you can sit on the cushion

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Is this where your butt gets a little tickle

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
If you do well on the game?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
This is stupid I mean seriously

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
You know what this reminds me of?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Do you remember that episode of South Park

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
With the bicycle that was powered

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Like it was something like when everything

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Was going green or whatever

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
And they would sit down on the thing

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
That was just basically a giant dildo

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
And then they had to blow on this thing

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
To make it go that looked like they were

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Sucking cock

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
That's what this Wii inflatable cushion

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Reminds me of like I'm gonna have that

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
In my living room

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Let me describe how this works first off

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Thank you wild wacky action bike

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Thank you

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
As if it wasn't completely obvious

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
It's an inflatable air cushion

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Or other type of seat

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
With pockets for the Wii remote

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
It's for simulating horseback riding

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
Or riding of other animals real or imagined

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Or even vehicles

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
For example

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
You can indicate the gait of a horse

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
By gently

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
By gently moving forward and backward

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
On the cushion

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
To go slow

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Or fast forward and backward

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Rocking motions to gallop

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
So basically this game

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Will adjust your speed based on

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
How fast you hump the cushion

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Awesome

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
That seems completely useless

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And not only that

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
But I mean really is this practical

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I mean seriously

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
We had a problem with the Wii balance board

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Only holding 300 pounds

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
People got pissed off

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Because I'm a fatty

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
And I want to do Wii Fit

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
But I can't play it

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
What about riding the horse

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I pop the cushion

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
You don't even have to be fat

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
To pop the cushion

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Or let's say you're getting too into this game

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And you're rocking back and forth

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Or even you have special piercings

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I can just see

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
This is the whole rocking back and forth

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
The whole thing deflates

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
While you're playing it

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Like how sad

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Is this for real

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It's for real

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Is this Nintendo making the patent

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Or whatever this is

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
You know what this thing kind of looks like to me

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
You know those

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Okay

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You know at the gym they have the inflatable

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Balls and they have the ones that are half

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Size

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Which makes me think of those with another rocking

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You know thing put on it

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
This one also looks really um

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
It looks like a wacky action bike

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
It's not necessary

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I mean seriously how many games

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Are you going to play where you're riding

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
A horse

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
It's absolutely not necessary

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And why the hell would they patent this

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Well keep in mind though

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
It's a good idea to

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
They could patent something and not actually bring it out

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
But it keeps someone else from doing it

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
GameGuru in chat says we find out

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Why it's called WooHoo Island

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Great

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
So we're going to get WooHoo biking and WooHoo horse riding

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
With this thing

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
It's just strange

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I mean why can't you

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Although if this is legit

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
If this is a real thing that Nintendo is planning

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
You know you can't wait for that

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Press conference when Reggie Fils-Aime

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Comes out of one of these

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Like

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
It's next year's E3 press conference

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
When you're just like oh my god Nintendo is seriously

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Just fucking lost it this time

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Like just the last two years of press conferences

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Were bad but now when Reggie Fils-Aime

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Comes rolling out on one of these things

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
You're just going to be like oh my god

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
This is just difficult to watch

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I would love to go there and just walk out

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Walk out right at that

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Well that's it I'm done

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm done

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I give up

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
This is absolutely stupid

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Can somebody please do that at E3

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Somebody who's special enough to get

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Invited in Nintendo's conference

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Somebody who doesn't mind

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Getting blacklisted a little bit

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That's it I'm done

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
This is so stupid I'm out of here

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
See ya

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I am done D-U-N

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Done

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
And get up and walk out

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
There is no practical use for this whatsoever

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's a giant device that holds a remote

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
That shakes it back and forth

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
How difficult would it be to take this

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Same horse riding game and just

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Shake the remote slow to go slow

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Shake it faster to go faster

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Oh my god look at that I didn't have to buy

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Any more peripherals

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Can you imagine the size of the box

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
This game is going to come in if it's just this

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Giant device

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Well you probably have to inflate it yourself

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
It probably comes in a small box and

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
You

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
You have to inflate it yourself

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
You know what the whole talk about

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
The cushion thing just sort of made my brain

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Shut off so I decided to look at Teriyaki Doritos

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Instead

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Will you stop being so random

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
First you want our Mega Man game to have

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
A butt then you say I don't

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Care about inflatable Nintendo cushion

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
This could be the biggest joke of the year

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I want Teriyaki Doritos

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Really

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I really want Teriyaki Doritos right now

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This is going to be one of those

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Shows where it's like

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I'm sorry the whole concept of this

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Cushion thing literally made

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
My brain shut off

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
For like a minute

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
And then by the time

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I came back to consciousness I was looking

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
At Teriyaki Doritos

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
You know the best part about this is

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I bet you the Wii remote is not sensitive enough

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
To sense these little rocking motions

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That would be the

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Punchline to the whole thing

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Let's see some comments

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Frisbee says

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
My name is Reggie I'm about kicking ass

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Taking names and fucking a pillow

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Boy oh boy

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Gripper01 in chat says

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Is this something we need to be teaching our kids

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Hold on shush

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Gripper01 says I'm still waiting for Excitebots to be released

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
In the UK Nintendo hates Europe

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Well hey at least you'll have this peripheral

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Possibly

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So is this going to break certain girls' hymens

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I mean are they going to become women

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Just from playing this game

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's what I want to know

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because this game sounds

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh my god

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Just chalk that up to the list of Wii injuries

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Broken lamp

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Shattered television screen

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Broken hymen

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Just add that to the list

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Oh my god Loki why did you go there

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Because that's horseback riding

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Hello

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
It was on topic

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Hymen Breaker Wii 2009

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Ok I think we can

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Pretty much just you know

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Sum it up this is a horrible idea

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You know what

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Is it Nintendo horrible

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You know what here's the thing

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's kind of interesting

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
In all honesty all jokes

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Aside like

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
To see somebody putting you know

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
A respectable reputable game company

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Behind an inflatable pillow

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That will move

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
You really have to wonder

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Like where are they going with this

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It could be interesting

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I see potential modifications involving the res vibrator

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I just you know

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It is hard for me to be serious about this Rob

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I think if anything this is a sign of hope

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Because it gives me hope

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
That at any conference that

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You know they hold from now on

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm hoping that I see this

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
What's her name

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
That new one

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
What's her name Piper

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Is that her name

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I want her to come out on one of these

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
No

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
She autographed an Xbox supposedly

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That's doing horrible things for my imagination right now

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Alright

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Let's move on please

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
To another story

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And we're going to talk about

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Hey other Nintendo Wii news but this one

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Is actually a lot more serious I'm sorry to say

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
32 gigabyte SD cards

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Will soon be usable in Wiis

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Actually I think they already take the 32 gigabyte

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Or sorry gigabyte

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah gigabyte cards right

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
They take them now but here's the thing is that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Apparently

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Right now if you want

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
To use download content

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You basically you can store it on the card but you have to

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Copy it over basically to the actual

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Wii console every time you want to use it

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But not for much longer

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Apparently pretty soon

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You will be able to play your download content

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Directly off of the SD cards

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Which will finally justify

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Nintendo's

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Choice to not put a hard drive in these things

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Because as you can change out the cards and so on

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
That's kind of cool

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
But apparently

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
There's a new IGN report

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Saying that all the tricks used for both

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the past

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Leaving internal memory open is gone

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Instead straight up booting off the SD card

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Is available and that means easier downloads

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Larger expansions and quicker

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Loads when bringing in song data from the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
SD card into Guitar Hero

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Nintendo 5 and apparently that's the first game

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And no support from Nintendo

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So they just figured this out on themselves

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
On their own

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Interesting

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I'm curious to see if any other developers are going to use this

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Other than companies that are just trying to mirror

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
What they're doing on the 360 and the PS3

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It does piss me off though that they haven't

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You know done any download content

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Other than I guess Animal Crossing

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
But Animal Crossing you don't really actually

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Buy the download content I don't think

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
It's kind of something that comes in the mail

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Just like you get used to

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
It's probably already in the game anyways

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I'm kind of pissed off that they aren't

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Actually doing any expansions

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And stuff for these new games that they're putting out

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And even still like

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Let's support the MP3 stuff

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Before on the SD cards and then

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Now with the newer games

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Sorry we're not going to do that anymore

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
You're taking a step backwards come on

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Well

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I'm glad to hear that they're putting in that functionality

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That really should have been there from the get go

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But hey better late than never right?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You know ironically enough though I haven't bought really

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
A lot of virtual console games in a long

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Long time

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
There's some stuff coming up later in the show

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That I find interesting but

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
As far as you know virtual console stuff

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
There really hasn't been a lot lately I've been interested in

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Except the Final Fantasy IV

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
WiiWare games

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
What about the WiiWare game that's

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I haven't heard of this what's that?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Next quest that used to be called

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Ikiran something or whatever

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It's like Kid Icarus basically

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Oh neat no I hadn't heard of this

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They changed it because apparently

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Ikiran quest or whatever it was called

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Is too close to Kid Icarus and Nintendo got pissed

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Interesting

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
When's this coming out is it already out?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
No I hadn't heard of this game

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I don't know that last WiiWare game I downloaded

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Was so terrible that BitBoy or whatever it was called

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I think I'm turned off to WiiWare games for a little while

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I mean that's how awful this game was

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
So awful

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Anyhow more gaming stories

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And then release dates coming up soon

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And of course the classic game of the week before we end part 8 at night

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Well how about some more Wii stuff

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Wii?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Wii sing actually

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
That is going to have a four

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Player karaoke mode

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
As in four mics

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Four people singing at one time

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It says

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That there's actually not

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
A full track list out yet

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But they are working with EMI

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Warner Universal and a few independent

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But there are thirty

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Songs available already

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Pokerface, Locomotion

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Delilah

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
There's also

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Viva La Vida

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You know some stuff from

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That album

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And then

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But the big thing Rob that should make you happy

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Is if there's Abba

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yes

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You get four part harmony

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Awesome

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Yeah but I'm kind of done on the karaoke games

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I mean is there really room in the marketplace right now

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
For yet another karaoke game

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Well I would play this one though because

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It wouldn't be me singing by myself

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I guess it's cool that

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
You know cause the Wii doesn't really have

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
A lot of karaoke games that I know of

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I think there's some overseas

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Like they have a karaoke channel right

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And then the Konami's karaoke revolution

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Is coming out, there are new ones out on Wii

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
They have American Idol's on Wii

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Oh do they? Well that's the same thing

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Konami just lost their American Idol license

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Or whatever, their new series of karaoke

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Games don't have that branding on it

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So I consider that the same series

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Is that the only series available on Wii right now?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
There's Disney Sing It

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
That's the other series that's available

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
That's got a narrow

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Audience, that's not something I can

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Break out at a party

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yeah

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Um

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Rock band

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Yeah I guess you saw that

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I don't know it just seems to me that the karaoke marketplace

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Is kind of oversaturated right now

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I mean is there really room for all these games to be doing well

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
From what I understand, and I could be completely wrong

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
But my understanding was that Lips

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The Xbox 360 one was not doing that well

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Lips is ugh

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Which is too bad cause it's by the guys who did

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Elite Beat Agents

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yet they're still doing another one though

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Are they really?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I remember that

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I was under the impression that Sing Star

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Was actually doing better than Lips

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But maybe that's just because Europe

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Sing Star is the karaoke game in Europe

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You know

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I like Sing Star

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I don't know, they have a lot of versions coming out

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You actually got me to play that

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Sing Star's fun, I like Sing Star

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Which is weird, I wouldn't consider myself

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Like oh I'm a rabid Sing Star fan

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But yet I have Sing Star volume 1, volume 2

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And ABBA all on PS3 and I want Sing Star Queen

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I would get that

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
We should do another Sing Star Party

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I think it'd be fun, Sing Star Party

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Ok, I'll bring people

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
We'll have to make that happen, maybe later

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I'll bring someone who's listening right now

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Since I'm not going to PAX, I'm thinking Sing Star Party

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
This might have to happen

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Let's have our own PAX

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Call it O-O-O-O-O-O-O

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Tampax

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
No, you need to

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Call it Tampax

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Well what time is, or when's

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
We got BlizzCon this year

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
It's right before PAX, right?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
This next weekend is BlizzCon

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, you could just become part of

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The second annual QQCon

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Ah, QQCon, I like this idea

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That's right, I remember QQCon last year

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But this year I'm not sad

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That I'm not going to BlizzCon

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Because I'm over WoW now

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And WoW got spoiled anyways, we're going to get to it a little bit later

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You know what, it just occurred to me

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
We could actually rent

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Like

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Like an office room or something

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And have just

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Systems set up and just do O-L-R-Con

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
First year O-L-R-Con

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Just some little office

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That's how they start

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I guess that's true

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Airport Hilton

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
No, we used to do

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Actually, we used to have

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Ground Zero Con in Mobile

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And they held it at college

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
In the student center

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I like Frisbee's idea, PAX in the back yard

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
PAX yard

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Nice

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
We haven't had it, remember we used to do

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The old Baymani parties way back when

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
That should be the same thing, just be

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Gamer nerd syndrome party

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
NerdCon at my house, dude, I've got pinball

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I wonder how much it would cost

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Her in a small space just for the day

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Oh, look into this

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You should, you've got time off because of your hand right now

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You need to find us a place to have a con

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Quick poll of chat

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Who would come to O-L-R-Con?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Y or N

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You would check out for O-L-R-Con

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And your response must be either a Y or an N

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Spelled out W-H-Y

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Or E-N

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Like I said in random today

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Alright

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We might have to make that happen

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Anyhow, let's get to some release dates

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
While we ponder the idea of an O-L-R-Con

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
We can host it at an Olive Garden

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
They can cater

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Catered by Olive Garden

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You know what, fuck that

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I cook better than Olive Garden

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I will cook

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
What about doing one of those really

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
No offense to

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
SacAnime, but remember how they used to have

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
SacAnime at Sunrise Mall

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
You know, the really ghetto mall that we have around here

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Wouldn't it be funny to do O-L-R-Con

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
At Sunrise Mall

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
At the mall?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
With the one room that they have that's

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
They had movies playing at

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
A closed down

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
McDonald's

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I remember that

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That was the strangest

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
AnimeCon I'd ever seen in my life

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Was the one that was at the mall

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Where the closed stores served as screening rooms

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And then you'd just see random people in costumes

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Throughout the mall

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Meanwhile there's people trying to go to Macy's

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You know, it's just so strange

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It's the most awkward thing I've ever seen

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
In my life

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Alright, anyhow

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Anyways, this week

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Not a whole lot coming out

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
There are some pretty good games, but it's still

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Kind of that slow part of the summer

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
This week on DS Core

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Game from Graffiti

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It's a first person shooter

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It's been delayed forever

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But finally making its way out

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Still Life 2 on PC

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Coming out this week as well

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
My friends on

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
DS

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Because

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Apparently if you play this game you have no friends

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So you need

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Your friends on the DS

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
War Leaders, Clash of Nations

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
On PC this week

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Sudoku Ball Detective

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Yes, it's a

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Game that you solve detective

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Mysteries by playing games of

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Sudoku

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Awesome

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
My Makeup

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
A game for girls

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Delta Force Extreme 2

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
They have that coming out

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
As well as Plants vs. Zombies

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
The packaged version

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Is making its way out this week as well

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Wolfenstein

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
On PC, Xbox 360, and PS3

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Coming out this week

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Spectrobes Origins

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Pretty good

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Roleplaying game

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
From Disney Interactive

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Making its way out to the Wii this week

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
My Dress Up also goes with

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The My Makeup thing

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Also for girls

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
ATV Quad Kings from Zoo

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Games

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
That's the most generic ATV off-road racing

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Game I've ever seen

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Joint Operations

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Combined Arms

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Coming out on PC this week

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
And that is it

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Let me move on to

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Japan in Japanese

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Release dates

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
About the My Makeup thing

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Could also be for the occasional

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Cross-dresser

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I guess

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Don't say something is just for girls

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Because some boys might be into that

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
My character in Ion looks like a drag queen

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Your character in Ion has a fan

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
She has a fan, how amazing is that

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I do have to mention this because I think it is

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
On Steam, but it's an awesome name

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
For a game

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Pizza Morgana, Monsters and Manipulations

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
In the Magical Forest

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Pizza Morgana

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's an adventure game

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's kind of a gothic

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Hot topic looking type thing

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Interesting

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Games coming out in Japan, not a lot

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There is nothing new on the

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Playstation 3 or the Xbox 360

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
There is a new game coming out on the 20th

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
On Playstation 2, it's called Melty Blood

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Actress Again

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Yes, that is really the name of it

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Melty Blood Actress Again

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It's a fighting game

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Bringing a whole new level to the 2D fighting world

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Three different fighting styles

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
A larger moveset and new characters

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I guess this is continuing

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
In the Melty Blood series

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Is that an anime or something?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Or is this just a video game series I've never heard of

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
L2 Love Cross Loop

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Is also a game coming out of Japan on the

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Playstation 2 this week

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
On the Nintendo DS

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Live Battle Card

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Is the only new release this week

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It's a very slow release week over in Japan

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
There is on the Sony PSP

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Heart no Kunen no Alice

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Comes out, as well as

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Ukame Kakushi comes out from

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Konami this week

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I'm trying to see what kind of game this is

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But it doesn't look like any of their series

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It just looks like

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's O-O-K-A-M-I

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Is what it is

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So I'm not sure what series

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I think that's a new one

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Great God something says Dark Sakura

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
It's a big sight

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Exactly

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
For something like that actually that would be something

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I'd have to see the kanji for because I should know

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Both of those kanji, aha

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Well there you go that's really all there is in

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Japan this week

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
For our

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
For our buddies in the UK actually

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
We've got a number of releases

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
If you've been able to ignore Madden

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
That game

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Has touched my life because Dan

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Had to go for a minute opening

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
On the 19th we have Shadow Complex

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
On Xbox 360

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Did you make a yay?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
No I said how do you share me?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The cat's hanging around

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
She's about to be dinner in a moment

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
On the 20th Tales of Monkey Island

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
The Siege of Spinner City

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And the 21st DJ Star

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And Raven Squad

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Supercar Challenge and then Wolfenstein

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Oh it's a Dworkenstein

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Anyway

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
That's it

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Alright well there's a new patent

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Submitted by Sony

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Apparently it's a device

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Or

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
A program to

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Interpret whether you

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Or different emotions that you are feeling

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
While playing I guess the PS3

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
One example

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
That they show is laughter

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Which apparently they have this

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Really weird looking guy laughing at a

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Video of somebody

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Kicking themselves in the ass with a machine

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
That they're powering with their own

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Hands

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Will it sense boredom?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Yes

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Well apparently

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
They make that joke too

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Actually they're saying that

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Not necessarily sure what it would do

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
But it would be able to sense laughter

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
As well as other emotions

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Sadness, excitement, anger, joy, interest

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And boredom

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
They say perhaps if the game detects boredom

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
They have enemies on screen, if it detects anger

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
The difficulty can go down and finally

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
If it detects sadness

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And they're punchline to the joke

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
It will tell you just to stop playing

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Lair

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I'm wondering though if it's gonna

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Detect me laughing when they make an announcement

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
About like some new PS3 system or something

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Like that that's gonna be more expensive than the

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Previous one just like the PSP Go

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Because that would be hilarious

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So yeah you think I'm gonna buy that?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Nope

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
You know um this peripheral

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Should go with the Nintendo one

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Like they needed to combine their forces so that

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
It can sense me giggling when I'm riding

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The inflatable

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Wii sack or whatever it's called

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
The Wii sack

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I like that

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
That'll be the name

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Alright then it's called the Wii sack until we get a

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Real name for it

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
That seems kind of a

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Dumb technology because like

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
All I had to do was act angry

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Or something like

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Grrr I'm angry

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You know and the game gets easier

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I don't know

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
What if it doesn't tell you

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
That this is in the game

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Like it's just something that is kind of there

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
People will find out

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
They have ways of finding out

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It's probably something that they're not really gonna use

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But they wanna you know

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
In case PS3

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Wants to do a Milo you know

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Something like that

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
They can detect laughter and all what not

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Something so they have the technology

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Before Microsoft does maybe?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Yeah something so they can say hey we patented

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
That we sue you now

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Hmm

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Well I don't know

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It could be

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Interesting but I really would have to see

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
The application of how this is used

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Like I'm into this a lot

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
More than I am the Wii sack

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But this is

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You know it could be hokey

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It could be kind of neat you know I like the idea

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Of a game you know because you all know those

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
People that get so angry when they're playing the games

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Not that there's anyone in this room like that Loki

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
That they're throwing controllers on the ground

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I never throw controllers

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I never throw controllers because controllers

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Are expensive and there's no reason to get pissed off

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But you get angry you do get very angry

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
When playing games no come on

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I've heard you do that

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Well okay if I was playing Grand Theft Auto

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Or something like that and the game

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Glitches out on me or something like that

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Like uh

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You know I fire six sniper rounds

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The game retarded

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I fire six sniper rounds into the back of someone's

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Head and then they're like oh hey someone's

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Shooting at me and they turn around and fire a pistol

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And kill me and they're like come on

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
My favorite is when Loki will go

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And then the game's all like I don't know what I'm doing

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
What the fuck

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Exactly because it's retarded

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
My favorite is when Loki impersonates

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
The game

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I do that to people too

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's fun all around

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Alright something that is

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Gonna be impersonated all over again

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Blizzard for

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
WoW's fifth anniversary

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Onyxia is making a return

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Y'all Onyxia was a level

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
60 raid of course in old school

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Warcraft where 40 of you would

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Fight the dragon Onyxia once

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And now it's kind of a bit of a joke like people

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Will go run the Onyxia thing because you can totally

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Solo Onyxia now or at least

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Duo it

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Very easy and kind of take her

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Down and do that whole quest where you get the

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Onyxia's head in the middle of Orgrimmar

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Or whatever it is that you're at

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
So they're gonna go back

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
For the fifth anniversary and basically

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Redo Onyxia's lair and the Onyxia

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Boss as a 10 man

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And heroic 25 man as all

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The raids in WoW are now long gone

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Are the days of the 40 man dungeons

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Apparently there's gonna be loot

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And the cool thing about the loot if you're a WoW player

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Is that she's gonna drop

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
The same stuff she did before

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
But it's all been

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Scaled to level 80 gear

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
So meaning that like the

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Stats that was on the

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Gear before was for 60 they're scaling it up to

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
80 so it's like you can have tier 2

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Gear that's just as cool as some of the gear they

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Have now that's pretty cool

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Also there's gonna be a

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
310% speed flying mount

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Modeled after Onyxia that's gonna be

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
A rare drop so that'll be something

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
A lot of folks are after

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Hopefully it's not glitched out like the dragon was at one time

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
During Final Fantasy 11

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Where you couldn't kill the dragon

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Remember that?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Oh yeah I heard about that

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
That was after we were playing but yeah I remember hearing about that

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
No no it was while we were playing

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
But it was hilarious

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Also some WoW news this week

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Of course Blizzcon's coming up this next weekend

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And some details have apparently

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Been leaked about what they are gonna be talking about

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
At Blizzcon. Cataclysm is supposedly

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
The name of the new WoW expansion

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I don't even know if the name's been confirmed yet

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It's a registered trademark from them now

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Alright well anyway

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
So despite the name possibly getting out

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Apparently some of the information about the game

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Has leaked out too

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You will be able to go to 85

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
In this new expansion

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Which is different because usually

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
WoW has been doing the 10 level increments

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Burning Crusade lets you go to 10

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Or sorry lets you go to 70

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Which was 10 up from 60

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Wrath of the Lich King lets you go up to 80

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And now you can go up to 85

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
In Cataclysm

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Also the other interesting thing about Cataclysm

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
It's not really a new world

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
They're not launching a new world

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
There's no Outlands or Northrend type thing

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
No what this is gonna be is improvements

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
To the old world

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Which is kind of interesting because

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I don't know how they're gonna be able to do that

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Yeah isn't that something everybody benefits from

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Because that's a big thing that WoW does now

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Is the whole phasing element

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
So maybe you can only get phased if you have the Cataclysm expansion

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Otherwise you're stuck in the old WoW

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I don't know

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I don't know what they're doing with this

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Also some new races are rumored for the game

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Worgen will be the new Alliance class

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And Goblins will be the new Horde class

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And the other interesting thing

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Is that some new job

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Race combinations are opening up

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
For instance now you can be a Tauren Paladin

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Or Troll Druid

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
That's a big one because Druids you had to be

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Tauren or Night Elf to be

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
But apparently now Trolls can be Druids too

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And assumably Worgens

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Since nothing else on the Alliance side opened up for Druids

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So interesting

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You'll be able to fly in some parts of old world now too

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Which was a thing that was being requested

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I don't know though

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
For me honestly as somebody who recently left

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
WoW this isn't really

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Cool enough sounding for me to want to go back

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I have to be honest

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
The improvements sound neat and sound needed

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
But I'm not seeing anything where I'm like

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Oh damn

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Well I'm sure that's not all the details about it

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
True

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
They usually put a little more effort into their expansions

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I would think a new heroic job class would be in there too

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Like Death Knight

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Like I was hoping for the next heroic class would be cool

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I'm sure there's

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I don't know

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
It'd be interesting

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
It could all be speculation too

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It could be like one of those you know

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Culmination of all the rumors that are on there

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The new name of the expansion

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Because of the registered trademark

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
The rumor of the new classes

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Based on the Halloween masks

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
That appeared or whatever

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And some other crap

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
You know I'm

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I don't know

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
We'll find out next week I guess

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I mean seriously

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
We'll find out in a week

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But all of it sounds plausible

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I mean nothing that's being announced sounds unplausible

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But I think the new race job combinations

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
That's going to be very interesting

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Alright let's get into a segment here we like to do on

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Orange Lawns Radio called the classic video game

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Of the week

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's a moment where we take a minute to reflect back on

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Games history and

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Dark Sakura likes to take a trip to the vault

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And find a game that she thinks you know what you guys

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Ought to be playing this game this week

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So Dark Sakura

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
What is the classic video game

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Of the week?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I'm going for another series this time Rob

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
How dare you?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Sorry we can't get the music volume down

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
There we go

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Raiden you say?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Alright let's cue up some music from Raiden here

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Well

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Basically yeah this one goes through the whole PlayStation screen

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Launch up thing sorry

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But basically for anyone who doesn't know

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Raiden is

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
A scrolling shooter

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It's put out by Seibu Kairatsu

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And it was

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
In the arcades

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And I think we got it by Fabtech

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Over here in the states

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Also supposed to be

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Kind of hard to emulate because of

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
The way that they changed the game boards

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
For them

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But it came out

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
On PlayStation as the

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Raiden project

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Well at least Raiden 1 and 2 did

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And then we got

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
It came out on Amiga, Atari Jaguar

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The TurboGrafx

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
It came out on the duo

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
As Super Raiden

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Atari Lynx, Super Nintendo

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Came out for PC, Genesis

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And there's actually a mobile phone version too

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Seibu Kairatsu did

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
All of the ones that came out

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Until 98 and then

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Moss Limited did the games

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
That came out since 2005

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And the games since 2005 also came out

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
On the Taito Type X boards

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Which were supposed to be

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
They were pretty hard to duplicate the emulation for

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So anyway

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
The world was taken over by aliens

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And the world says screw you aliens

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And fights back, that's the story

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
So you also had

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
You could play one player

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Or have two players and play together

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
You also had a variety of different weapons

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You know

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That you would get through different power ups

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
My favorite being the little electric

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Thingy weapon which

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
In fact it's on the screen right now in the example

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Showing where you would fire this

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Continuous stream of energy that would

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Lock on to

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Certain enemies and then wrap around them

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And you know

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Pull towards them, it's kind of like how

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
You know those electric globe

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Things where you put your hand on it

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And all the energy goes to where your hand is

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
That's my favorite weapon in the game

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
And the games that came out in the series were

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Raiden, Raiden 2, Raiden DX

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Raiden 3, and Raiden 4. Raiden DX

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Of those is probably my favorite

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
There were also spin off games

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
That were

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I'm sure

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Actually we talked about them

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Recently

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
When I was going over my

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Gaming week

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
It was Viper Phase 1

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Big, big, big, big, big

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Big, big, big series of games

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It's actually probably one of

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
My favorite shooters to this date

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
It's also

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
It can get pretty hard

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Because you get a lot of

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Bullets and a lot of enemies on the screen

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And they're big and

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It's just a lot of fun

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Definitely a lot of fun

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Plus the music is great

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I'll turn it up here a little bit

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I think the clip that I gave you

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Is actually from Raiden Project

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I have a story about Raiden Project

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
What's that?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I remember being completely

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Intoxicated on Everclear

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And beating this game

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Nice

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
That was the same night that I ended up having so much

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Everclear how close I needed

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I was 19

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
No, I take that back, I was 20

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
You say that proudly

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Yeah, I was 20

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Alright, well there you have it folks

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Your classic game of the week

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Raiden, the whole dang series

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Because Dark Soccer said the series

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So that's what you get

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Alright, well thank you very much Dark Soccer

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
We'll look forward to see what you pick for us next week

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But in the meantime we're going to take a quick break

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
We're going to do some Twitter and so forth

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But we have plenty more show to come

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
When we come back from a break

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Twitter topics

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Something new we're trying tonight

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
We've been trying to incorporate Twitter into the show for a long time now

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So we're going to do some Twitter topics when we come back

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Rapid fire news and some more discussions

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Including Silent Hill

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
A chance for you to go visit

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Like real Silent Hill

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Not really, but as close as it's going to get

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
We're going to talk about that

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And it sounds kind of cool

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So stay tuned

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And welcome back everybody

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
To more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
August the 16th of 2009

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Where we are taping live

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Our what, 334th

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Slightly more than half evil

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yes, it just keeps on going

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And no signs of quitting anytime soon

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
We're coming back this segment

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
We're going to get into some Twitter topics here shortly

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And if you wanted to submit a topic

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You could do that earlier

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
By joining our Twitter

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
You can't send it now, it's too late

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Because we already have picked what we want to talk about tonight

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
But if you want to do that for future weeks

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You can send those to us at OLR on Twitter

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And if you're not following us on Twitter yet

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Why not? You should be there

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I wanted to mention one game

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I didn't mention it during my gaming week

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Because it wasn't really my gaming week

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And not a game I've been playing

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Non-stop

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Just been obsessed with it

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I think he's racked up like 15-16 hours

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Just this week alone

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
It's an iPhone game, believe it or not

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And the iPhone game is called

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Zenonia is the name of the game

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Z-E-N-O-N-I-A

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And it's a game I probably need to look at and check out

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I guess there's a free demo available out there

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But if you want to play more than a certain amount of time

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
You have to pay money for it

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
But I guess it's like a

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
The best way I can describe it from what I saw

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Is a style game

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Kind of like the role playing game

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But more of the action style

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Like Secret of Mana is

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
With the multiple quests going on at once

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Like WoW has

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And I guess you can be good or evil in the game

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
John was trying to tell me a little bit about the game

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I thought it was interesting enough to give a mention here on the show

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Because iPhones have some pretty interesting games on it

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Some of the games I didn't even mention

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That I played this week were on the iPhone

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
There's a new Space Invaders game on the iPhone

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
That I checked out that's kind of interesting

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Because you can use your own music collection in some of the stages

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And there's also Civilization Revolution got a release on the iPhone this week

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Which is a pretty neat port I got to say

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I didn't play it a whole lot

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So I don't want to give it a full review

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
But I was fairly impressed with the port of the game I must say

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I played Peggle

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Did you play Peggle? Good times on the iPhone

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
It's not bad on the iPhone

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
It's the only version of it I have

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Good stuff

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Alright let's get into some Twitter topics

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Tell us some things you want us to talk about tonight

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Deathwishing says

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Starcraft 2 petition has over 100k signatures

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
For LAN support

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Discuss that

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Remember we were talking about

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Was this the one where we said people need to get over it?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I don't think it was this actually though

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I think it was something else

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I would think because LAN is a big part of Starcraft

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I know how they have tournaments

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It's really huge over in Asia

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And the regions over there

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
But it's just

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I don't know why they would

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I think the reason why they want to take out

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
LAN because

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
One, piracy

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Because they want all their online play

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Or all the multiplayer to go through

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I want to say BattleNet

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah BattleNet

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
But

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I always thought it was for statistical purposes

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
They want to

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Log every game that's played by folks

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And keep track of statistics and so forth

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
But yeah piracy is a nice little bonus

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Basically piracy is what it is

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I mean it makes sense because

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
You're making these people buy

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Three different versions of the same damn game

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Because you're just saying

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Oh well

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
The campaigns are separate

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
When any other RTS

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Game out there

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Command and Conquer

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
How even the original Starcraft had all the campaigns

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Right there from the get go

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It's kind of a little bit

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I don't know milking it a bit

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
So yeah I can see how

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Some people might be a little pissed off by that

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And you know what

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And I'm just going to say this now because

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
We're going to be reporting on it later on I'm sure

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
They're going to crack this

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It's going to happen

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
People want to play this in LAN

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And you know what's going to happen

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Is they're just going to tunnel it just like they do with the PSP

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
And the Wii or the Gamecube and all that stuff

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
You know warp pipe was mentioned earlier

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But they're just going to find a way to tunnel this

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
With some third party software

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Why don't we just give them

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
The benefit of the doubt right now that

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It'll be secure for about a week and then

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It'll be broken again

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Actdeftinchat says online petitions

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Never work for a few exceptions

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And you know that's kind of true too

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
If you want to, if you really want to make a statement

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Guys, put your money where your mouth is

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Don't buy the game when it comes out

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Because if there's 100,000 people

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
That dent in their first week sales

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Of the game, that'll be heard loud and clear

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
But this online petition

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
That can be swept under the rug

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
At the end of the day, do you still buy the game?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
If yes, then

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
They had no reason to put it back in

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
You need to send physical mail instead of like

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
You know, just a petition

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
You send a letter

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Because 100,000 letters

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Look a lot better than 100,000 emails

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And definitely a lot better than 100,000 signatures

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Or do both

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Do all three

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Surtur, I might be saying that wrong

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Or Surtur, Surtur, S-U-R-T-U-R

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
On Twitter says please discuss the PS3 slim

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I'd like to get a PS3 but they're too expensive

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I assume the slim will be cheaper or there'll be a price cut

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
What is this slim that you're talking about

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
There's no slim, they denied it

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Denied, denied, denied

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
You know what's interesting though

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Surtur, if I'm saying your name right

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Just because, you know, we've made that assumption before

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That just because they are remaking the system

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Means it's going to be cheaper

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Not true, look at the PSP

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
See they're going to be cheaper, I guarantee it's not gonna be cheaper

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It's not gonna be cheaper

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
This is their MO

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
They basically take the console or whatever

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
They drop the price of the old system

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Which is something that we're starting to see a little bit

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And then

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
They basically release the new system at the same price the old system was

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I would hope that they would drop the price of the system

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Because I think it would be something that is in their best interest

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Because their sales are hurting

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And they're definitely not getting better anytime soon

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And yeah, the slim PS3 might be appealing to some people, because hey, it's new, it looks different, it's nicer looking, we're assuming.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And whatnot, maybe some backwards compatibility is added in. I think that's kind of wishful thinking there, but we'll have to see.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:13.000
They're going to announce it next week, I'm sure, at Gamescom. It's going to happen. I mean, that's the rumors right now, and they're definitely prepping for it.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And between the birds and you guys, I guess, it's definitely happening. I mean, it's just a matter of time whenever they decide to announce it.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Gripper01 in chat says, the PS2 Slim was more expensive than the Fat. Was it? I think I remember a comment earlier, though, he's overseas, so maybe it could be different from region to region.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I don't think it was more expensive. I think it was probably the same price, if not cheaper. But hey, that seems to be the trend nowadays. Let's release a new system with less features for more money.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And Frisbee says, this tiny enemy crab... I like that. Funny.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:12.000
It's a matter of time. It's just a waiting game until they announce it, and no one's going to be surprised by it. If I were Sony right now, I'd be probably pissed off, because they can't fucking keep a secret for anything.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:21.000
They really... I mean, even though it kind of hurts our business a bit with the moles and everything, they really need to root out those moles if they want to keep some secrets.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:33.000
What you need to do, not that I endorse this in any manner, what you need to do is you tell one person something different, and you see what gets reported, and then you know who your mole is.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Dr. Noir says, free tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour, and then gives us a link to an article that talks about new Guitar Hero World Tour tracks that are coming out. Apparently there's an Activision track pack that came out.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Apparently it is... folks that work for Activision, they're bands, so you get these bands Awaken, H is Orange, and 100 Reasons, and these songs that... hey, they're free!

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:06.000
It's very hard to complain about free things, but I would probably... I don't own Guitar Hero World Tour. I would probably get to Guitar Hero 5, though.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Free tracks are good, I mean...

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:16.000
It's hard to complain about free tracks, but honestly, very rarely would I probably play them. I mean, I look at the Rock Band tracks, very few of those do I play.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But at the same time, there's one or two that I do enjoy, and considering they were free, you know, and I had to sift through 20 to find one or two that I like, it's still free, you know, so it's very hard to complain about free things.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
You can download it, and guess what, if you don't like it, you can always delete it later.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Yes you can.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And it's free.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So when do those come out? Those are coming out this week? Yeah, today, or they just came out this past week.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So check that out in the Guitar Hero World Tour store right now.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:56.000
If you want to send us a topic to talk about on Twitter, we'll open up Twitter topics next week, just a little bit before the show, but probably if we already are covering your topic somewhere else in the show, sadly you probably didn't make it tonight, but always try again next week.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Let's do some rapid fire news quickly. We don't want to talk about this news a long time, but we want to get it across anyway. So Loki, how about some rapid fire news?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So this is a total shock, but apparently Activision is offering Guitar Hero 5, and then if you buy Guitar Hero 5, you get Guitar Hero Van Halen free.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Totally new news to me, but yeah, so that is the offer. It's all through the month of September, and basically you purchase your game. There's apparently codes in the back of the manual.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I think that's the way it was with World Tour as well, and there's some other stuff that goes along with that.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:49.000
But using those codes, you enter them in online to prove that you've purchased the game, and then you can get your free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen. Not only will you get it free, you will get it weeks early, because it takes six weeks to ship to you, and the game doesn't come out until December 22nd.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Which I gotta imagine their sales on that game are going to be crap, unless they're going to count the free copies of the sale.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I am totally surprised and shocked by this news.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I am shocked. It's like a hypothetical situation come true. It's just so weird.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
There you go.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Some other interesting stuff. Also rumors, of course, that the Elite is going to be getting a price cut at the end of this month, and apparently this is coming from a leak of a Myers catalog.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Good, because I know someone who needs a new 360.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:36.000
It's a catalog that's going to be hitting stands on August 30th. It shows that the Elite model has a new price of $299.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And of course, that kind of goes along with the whole rumor that the Pro system is going away, because on the new arcades, the box art only shows the arcade and Elite systems.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:58.000
No Pro system to be found at all, so the rumor is that that SKU is going away and is being replaced by the Elite system for $299.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Makes sense to me. Probably will happen. Might even get announced next week, so wouldn't be a big surprise.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And then, last but not least, there is another rumor that white and pink DSIs are coming to America.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And apparently these were found in a Toys R Us database, listing both color schemes.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I don't know, that sounds totally false to me. I don't believe that that's ever going to happen, especially not in September.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Okay, fine. Some rapid fire news I've got for you guys.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Hey DDR fans, there's finally a point to those USB slots in the DDRX machines.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That's right, Konami this week opened up the new DDR Edit website. It's DDREdit.KonamiOnline.com.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
You can actually go in there and open up a little editor and make your own steps to various songs in the game, except not all of them.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I actually went in there and played with it a little bit. It looks like there's only about seven or eight songs you can edit, at least right now.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Maybe they're doing it in waves or what have you, but you use this little, it's all a web tool.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.000
It's not something you download. It's all online in Flash or whatever, and it runs horribly, at least on my computer it did.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
It was all out of sync and everything.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I miss the days of edit mode and doing hell edits.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I miss that too. We would actually get the Japanese games that you could edit the songs and take them into the arcade because it all matched up.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Yeah.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Fun times.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Or we'd edit hack them to add freeze arrows to songs that didn't have freeze arrows.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
That's right, I remember that.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Yeah, fun times.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Fun times.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I remember you giving away the boxes of movies.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That's right, it was make edit, get porn.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Yes.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Good times.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Epic times.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Whatever happened to that kid that won? Dave, remember him? Whatever happened to him?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
He became a man that day.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Did he?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Well, I got the box full of anime and stuff that one time, which eventually went back to, which went to Dimple.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Funny.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Hey, live at QuakeCon 2009 has been spotted some new games on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Doom 2 has been spotted out there on the show floor apparently.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And Quake Live, both for Xbox 360's arcade, were both apparently out there on a floor, on the floor.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I guess, let me actually clarify, I guess only Doom 2 was out there actually playable on the floor,

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:16.000
but somebody actually had like a shirt that said Quake Arena Arcade or what have you, and they've got some pictures and so forth.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Lies! They're all lies!

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I don't believe it, one second.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I don't know, I just had to be the counterpoint to that.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
There's somebody, there's like a picture of somebody playing Doom 2 on Xbox with an Xbox controller.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
It's photoshopped, it's a lie.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Shut up.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Lastly from me tonight, there's a brand new game coming out for an old system, and the old system, the Atari Lynx.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
What? I have one of those.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
There's a new game called Zaku coming out for the Atari Lynx.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Yes, it is named after one of OLR's infamous callers is getting his own game on the Atari Lynx.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I'm getting this.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It's the same people that brought you, do you remember Baker Prince that came out on the Genesis in 2006?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Kind of.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
The Legend of Wukong also.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Now those are actually like localized games from Taiwan that I guess just came out or whatever,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
but this is something I guess that was built on the development kit for the Atari Lynx on an Amiga, of all things,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000
and is actually coming out and supposedly has pretty kick butt graphics for a Lynx, that is.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It's too other than not bringing it out in other systems because, I don't know, I don't have a Lynx simulator.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I have a Lynx, but I just don't...

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Are they actually doing a cartridge for it?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
That's what the plan is, it looks like.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I think I might have to pick this up.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
They did one for Baker Prince, I know, and they charged a lot of money for it.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
This looks like a lot of fun.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Those carts were expensive.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Well here's an idea of what it's all about.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:46.000
It's a horizontal shooter and it is a hero who dons her rocket shoes and power gloves

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
and sets off on a journey to retrieve stolen development tools being used to flood the market with bad games.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
There you go.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I'm actually signing it for the mailing list right now.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Sounds like a cause that you can believe in.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Well DarkSakura, don't sign up for the mailing list just yet because you have to give us some rapid fire news.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Do I? Well crap, okay.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Well here's some news.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I really like corn chips. No, for real.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:13.000
The actual news, there is an addition to the PAL PSN updates.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:22.000
They're getting Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which will be 11.99 euro, 14.99 pound.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
It has a free trial.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And also are getting Call of Juarez Bound in Blood demo and more content for Red Faction Guerrilla.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Also, Rock Band Unplugged is getting some Iron Maiden songs.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:42.000
The Trooper and Number of the Beast for 99 pounds of pop.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
So that's pretty good.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.000
And also there's stuff for NHL 10 and Little Big Planet, blah blah blah.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Oh, and one last thing.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
For that one, Fat Princess is getting a connectivity patch.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Moving forward, Tecmo is getting a few games on the Virtual Console.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Ninja Gaiden and Rygar are to be coming out.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Also, I think they were talking about, Tecmo Bowl already did come out.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I really like Ninja Gaiden, but also Solomon's Key is being added to that too.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I like the old school arcade Rygar. That was an awesome game.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Also, this makes me a very very very infinity happy girl, is Loom.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
There's news about Loom.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Telltale is talking about considering doing another Loom game.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Which I will be all over happy happy happy if that actually happens.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:02.000
It was actually said that the game itself was about two and a half hours long.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And that they're trying to do two and a half hour long games and Loom fits quite well with that little strategy.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I like Loom. I have Loom. I should actually start playing it.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Loom is cool. I'd be down with a Loom remake.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
There's definitely a lot of nostalgia behind that.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Alright, let's get back into some discussion topics tonight.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Yes, apparently there's a new deal.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:42.000
This is coming from the Raven software designer Manveer Har, who has tweeted that apparently he's going to offer to reimburse you for your copy of Wolfenstein.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
If you purchase Wolfenstein, obviously. Keep your receipt.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:55.000
If, and this is the big ifs, if they beat out Madden 10 in this month in NPD sales.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Ha!

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000
So the offer only applies to sales in August. The NPD figures will be used to calculate the totals.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
You have to follow the guy on Twitter.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And in case you really wanted to do that, his name is Manveer Har is his Twitter name.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And limit one copy per person.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Let me go ahead and restate that again.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Ha!

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I mean, no disrespect, but come on. Madden 10 is like, you know, it's not the type of game we usually talk about here on this show.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But I can clearly recognize the impact that that game has on, you know,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I have co-workers who came into work dead tired on Friday.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Like, I have students in my class who came in dead tired on Friday.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And I'm like, what's going on? What gives?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And they're like, oh, Madden came out yesterday.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And I'm like, I should know that.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Like, I do a video game show on the internet.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I don't like to tell my students that because I don't want their teacher, you know, them to download and hear their teacher saying fuck on the internet.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But, you know, I just, I'm thinking in the back of my mind like, oh, duh, you should kind of know that.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
But Madden 10 is a huge game.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000
That's the point I'm trying to make. It's a landmark event game.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Well, your husband probably had to work like till 3 a.m. that day, huh?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I am so confident this will never happen that will this apply to the Tingle thing as well?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
What? You just extended the Tingle bet?

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
No, no, no, no, no. It's a different bet.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It's a different bet altogether.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Hold on, hold on. Hit record, everybody. Hit record. Here we go.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
It's a different bet altogether.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Not only will he give you free copies of Wolfenstein, I will dress up like Tingle playing Madden. Or Wolfenstein, I guess, that would be appropriate.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
But it's never gonna happen. Never.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Tingle with the gun, speaking German.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So, if, I just want to clarify the terms of the bet, just in case, because you never know what might happen.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:54.000
So if Wolfenstein, the new Wolfenstein, should outsell Madden in the first month of release, you'll dress up as Tingle here on the show.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
If this gentleman has to reimburse all his customers, you too will dress up like Tingle here on the show.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Alright, but not, you will not set fire and Bobby Black will fire a judgement on it.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
No, that's just, that's a judgement, because...

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
But instead, you will play Wolfenstein.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yes, and this isn't like we're adding the numbers of Wolfenstein to the millionth. No, that is not gonna happen.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Completely different bet, and you all wanted, you all wanted something to come back.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You all wanted something where Loki would be willing to dress up as Tingle again, so here it is.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
It's not gonna happen. I only make bets that I'm confident in that I'm gonna win, so...

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I mean, come on. Really? Something's gonna outsell Madden?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I know, from selling Madden, that that's not gonna fucking happen, so...

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
But hey, let's hope for the wishful thinking there.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Hey, and the guys behind Wolfenstein thank you, because you just upped their sales by, you know, how many people listen to the show?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Two.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Oh yeah, two. There you go.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I mean, anyone with the same mind knows that there's no way, it's just like him, he knows there's no way that's gonna happen, but hey, it makes him look nice.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So there you go, you're just nice. You're offering the Tingle thing again.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
One of these days, man, you know, some day this show is gonna have to end. Some day.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
And I hope before it's over we get you in a Tingle costume one way or another.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Nope, never gonna happen. Had to lose a bet, and unfortunately, uh...

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
My judgement's not selling.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Alright, anyhow, we're being made anymore.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Let's move on to something else. Hey, maybe Loki could dress up as this. This is a little more manly. He could dress up as Pyramid Head or something out of Silent Hill.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Uh, hey, Silent Hill, actually we'll have a lot of people dressing up in the name of Silent Hill.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Apparently there's going to be an actual Silent Hill haunted house, or as they're calling it, a haunted attraction coming to South California, Southern California.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Orange County, to be specific. The OC is going to be getting this Silent Hill haunted house.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And, uh, yeah, I'm guessing that it's actually going to be like a haunted house that you walk through.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Apparently they did like a Saw one last year that was really scary based off the movie Saw, which, you know, you already know how we feel about that.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.000
But Silent Hill's cool. So, you know, they'll have probably people dressed up like the nurses, and they'll probably have a giant Pyramid Head.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Like, you could get raped by Pyramid Head IRL. That would be awesome. Sadly, this haunted house or whatever probably isn't going to be that awesome, but whatever.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It might still be worth a look, especially if you're in the area. Hey, if you're in Southern California, you should probably go check this out.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Although it does sound like it's going to be a little bit pricey. I think I was looking at the website, and it was something like 20-something bucks. I don't remember. It was kind of expensive.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:36.000
That's about normal for, like, a haunted house. Like, the last haunted house we went to, which was... I'm going to bring up the site. It might make music, guys, because I think it makes music. Sorry, guys.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Oh, by the way, it's also the slowest loading site. Oh, that was weird. Ooh, it makes Silent Hill music. Ooh. Yeah, there's two mazes, and the other one's called Fear.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.000
This looks scary, Jamie. Are you sure you want to go? Not to Silent Hill. Single admission, $13.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:00.000
God, we are doing this. So, anyway, sorry. Sorry for the Silent Hill music, but it gives you a little ambience there.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:06.000
That would be fun, actually, to go down there and go to the haunted house and go to Disneyland. I think we might have to make that happen.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
I had a Saw attraction one time. That was pretty cool. Yeah, that was a year ago, right? Yeah.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Yeah, but I'm not into Saw. You already know how I feel about Saw. Torture porn. Silent Hill, cool. Saw, torture porn.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Saw is too hard to figure out what's going on nowadays. It's like trying to figure out what's going on in Crank 2.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.000
It's a twist. And... Tigerclaw says if you guys go, you will need to record it on video. They won't let you.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
They probably won't let us in there with a video camera. Plus, I don't need... Hat cam!

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I don't need me screaming like a girl out there on YouTube, because Jamie will be able to testify to this after.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Maybe she already can. I don't know. But I will scream like a girl in this attraction the minute I see something that is scary.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You want to know how I won't be scared? How you can tell if I won't be scared? Huh. Because I won't be saying anything.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
You've been in scary situations with me, and you know what I do. I shut up. And I'm really quiet.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I will scream obscenities, even if there are children around. My voice will get even higher than it's ever gotten on the radio.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Yes, it will. Yeah, you've seen me on rides. Yes.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You should just put a mic or turn on your phone to record just the audio, because that would be hilarious.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000
We're getting requests from chatters wanting us to pick them up on the way to the haunted house.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
We should just tell people when we're going, and then we'll have like, we'll all go in together.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It'll be a big, because I know like, Jimmy, who used to do the show, what the hell was the show he did with John?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
STFU. That was the show they did. The one that's based off that sports show.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
He lives in OC. Like, they live in that area, so I know he would come.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000
We should get a whole bunch of us to go, and I'll meet up, and then you can all hear me scream like a girl in person, laugh, ha ha ha.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
And then we could at least film before and after. And then I'll be like, white as a ghost, and so forth.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Ospher in chat says, Rob, reciprocate that high voice, please.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I'm not going to do that here on the radio. I can't. Like, I legitimately cannot do the screaming like a little girl obscenities.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I'm going to do my imitation of scared Rob.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Oh, God.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Okay, let me take a breath. Get in character. Oh, my God.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
When have I ever said, oh, my God, y'all.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
You do that when you're teasing.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Oh, my God.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
You do that when you tease people.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Fine.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Oh, my God. That's Rob, by the way.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
He's pretty close, a little higher. Needs more swearing. Needs more swearing.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Well, I, you know, wasn't going to, but that's Rob. And, yeah, it is high enough to break glass.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:30.000
You know who else lives in L.A. that we should challenge to come to this with us?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Uh-oh.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Is our friends from All Games Interactive.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Oh.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Yeah, that's what we need to do. We need to get Lawrence. We need to get Scott.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
We need to get Jessica and all of them to come with us.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
And we should have, like, a scare off or something.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Becky says she'll come with us.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I'm, oh, this needs to happen now. This needs to happen.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Is anybody from All Games Interactive listening? Let's throw down. Let's have a scare off.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I don't know how a scare off works.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:09.000
You should have to hold a glass of water. And if you spill the glass of water.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I want to know why Oscar's thanking me.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I like this idea. I really like this idea.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Have to hold something that shows, or, like, hook something up to our body. The Wii Vitality Sensor.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Too bad it won't be out in time.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:32.000
God damn it. Just when I found a use for the Wii Vitality Sensor to see who gets more scared here, me or Jessica, right?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
The damn thing isn't going to be out in time.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Too bad they don't have...

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I want to do it very drunk, Rob.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Do they have, like, a portable heart rate monitor or something like that?

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Yeah. They make those.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Do they?

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Or, actually, the iPhone has an app that's a heart rate monitor where you just tap in time with your heartbeat.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
No, that wouldn't work.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Yeah.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I'm afraid...

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Actual heart rate monitor is, like, 69 bucks a piece.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I'm afraid that I will be trying to contain my scary...

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Like, I'll be trying to fight it because I'm very competitive.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Like, I am a very competitive person. I'll admit it.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
That, like, if I'm going against somebody from All Games Interactive in a scare-off or whatever,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:13.000
that I will somehow, like, between being actually scared and trying to, like, hold it in, like, I'm not going to scream, I'm not going to scream,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
that I will shit my pants in the middle of the haunted house.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
You know, it should do.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
And I don't want that to happen.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
That's anonymous.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
You should have judges go with you.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Have three judges go one time with you and one time with her, and then rate the scare detection factor.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I don't know why I'm picking on Jessica.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I feel for some reason she's the easiest target of who's most likely to get scared from the All Games Interactive crew.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
But for all I know, Mary Young is the target, or Scott, for I don't know.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Okay, so who would you pick, then, to do in a least likely to be scared?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I need an All Games Interactive expert to tell me who is most likely to get scared at Silent Hill,

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
because I have an experience that I can challenge to a scare-off.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Jessica's no longer a part of All Games.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Well, she was, though, right?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Well, who, then, would you think would be best off for a least likely to be scared?

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
A what? And then a scare-off with you?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I don't know if it would be me that would be least likely to be scared.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Okay, the Tower of Terror scared the shit out of me.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But then again, I've also been in an elevator when it's fallen.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
The chat is suggesting Derek H. Does he even live in LA? I don't think he does.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Isn't he, like, in the Midwest or something? I don't know. I could be wrong.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
All right, anyhow.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Look, I'm going to stop picking on our friends at All Games Interactive and just, you know,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
we're just going to go to this and have fun.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
And if they want to come, hey, great.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
But I'm down for going to this Silent Hill haunted house.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I love Silent Hill. It would be fun. Super fun.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And Silent Hill loves you for dinner.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Let's move on with some more stories.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
And then your phone call is coming up later this hour.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Well, this is a definite bit of not really a surprise, but it's sort of happy and not happy at the same time.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Sega doesn't have any plans to do anything to commemorate the Dreamcast launch,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
because Dreamcast launch happened 9-9-99, so they're not doing anything 9-9-09.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
But they said unofficially that there should be some celebrations and some parties,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:21.000
things to mark, you know, such a momentous day in gaming.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But that they don't really have any plans to celebrate the U.S. launch.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:39.000
However, there is some talk about putting up some of the potential digital downloads of Dreamcast games.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:45.000
It's just the limiting factor being how large they are right now.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Unfortunately, I think a lot of people aren't going to realize that they're going to have a 10th anniversary.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.000
To me, the Dreamcast right now is going to be like the Cabela's game during the Halo 3 launch.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Whereas the Dreamcast's anniversary is going to be the Cabela's game to the Beatles' catalog being re-released on the 9th.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So a lot of people are going to think, Beatles? No Dreamcast.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
You know what? We need to do something on Wednesday.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
We need to come over here and play Dreamcast.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Because of the anniversary that day?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And record it.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000
You know, it's a lot of Sega anniversaries this week. It's not just the Dreamcast, but the Genesis.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I mean, Bobby talked a lot about this on his show tonight, so go download that if you want to check it out.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
But the 20th anniversary of Genesis was this week too.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And then, of course, Dreamcast is coming up very soon.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
So it's just lots and lots of stuff.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I remember sitting in that line outside the damn mall and getting so bored that we went over and bought books at Barnes & Noble and came back and got in line.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:50.000
The launch of the Dreamcast was during the period where, believe it or not, I wasn't playing a lot of video games.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Like, the years I was living in Chico, kind of away at college, I kind of fell out of video gaming.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
My love of gaming for a while. So I kind of missed the launch of the Dreamcast.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:04.000
But in retrospect, I was able to, you know, kind of catch up on it and see just, like, how awesome of a system it was.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
This was back in the day when Dan and I were like, we're going to wait for the US system. We're going to wait. We're going to less import it.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
So we already were playing our Dreamcast for a while.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:20.000
We even did the Sonic Adventure rental where you could rent a Dreamcast and a special release of Sonic Adventure.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Nice. I'm kind of surprised, though, that Sega's not even at the bare minimum, like, releasing Crazy Taxi on Xbox Live Arcade or something.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
You know, like, you know how Sega loves to re-release their old nostalgia stuff.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You know, give us a little something some Dreamcast love.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I mean, I guess, though, okay, now granted, before somebody in chat mentions it, which I'm sure they will, they do have the poll going on right now for the Genesis game that's going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Did you guys hear about this? They're, like, doing a poll at, what is it, genesispoll.com or something like that to see what game should be the next one they release on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000
And I think right now Earthworm Jim is winning by a landslide, which is too bad, because, like, Wonder Boy and ToeJam and Earl and Revenge of Shinobi are all in that.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Revenge of Shinobi are all in that poll as well.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
It'd be nice if it actually load.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Did the whole thing not load?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
No.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000
That's weird. You should see a poll in the middle there with the options of the game that would come out next.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000
That's weird that it's not showing up for you. Show it up for me at home.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Maybe the poll's over? I don't know.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Maybe.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Weird.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
But Earthworm Jim was kicking all the other game's ass. That's the one that's going to win.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Yeah.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Earthworm Jim was actually a really good game.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
And I'm sure that they're probably all slated to come out. It's just, which one do we want to release first?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Exactly. I'm sure they're all being worked on right now.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Which is kind of cool, because, you know, it's nice to know we'll get all those games eventually, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Genesis remakes on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Although, oddly enough, I do love the Mega Collection, because I think the Mega Collection's a really, really good value.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:04.000
But I think the ones by themselves don't bring that much to the table outside of achievements and, you know, just being a rehashed version of the old game.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But, heck, same thing as Virtual Console, I guess.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
If we want to put it that way.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Alright, so too bad that we won't see more Dreamcast 11 on September 9th of 2009, but I guess it was just ahead of its time.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I don't know what else to chalk it up to.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Let's move on with some more news.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Alright. Well, we talked a little bit before about Guitar Hero 5 and the free game.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Well, now you can do some song imports into it as well.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Kind of a feature that, you know, Rock Band 2 started off with.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.000
But now it's nice, at least, Guitar Hero 5 will allow you to import your tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And, apparently, Guitar Hero Smash Hits as well.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I guess the newer games now are coming with a code in the manual that basically has...

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:09.000
It's like a code in the back of the manual that's individual to each game that you can basically plug in to get, you know, your, I guess, authorization to download them.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
For costs, of course, just like Rock Band was five bucks.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
No pricing, though, has been announced yet for it.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:23.000
But the options, though, for PS3 and Xbox 360, you can download the whole lump of songs, or you can pick and choose which ones you want.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And, apparently, most of the tracks will be available, including, I guess, 152 of the 158 tracks that are available right now for download content for Guitar Hero World Tour will be compatible with Guitar Hero 5.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:47.000
The other cool thing, though, is, apparently, Band Hero also will be backwards compatible with these other games as well.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So, that's kind of cool. No word, though, on if you can import the Band Hero songs into Guitar Hero 5 or vice versa.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Isn't, literally, Band Hero just a different skinned version of Guitar Hero 5, though?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Yes.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Like, literally?

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Literally, it is.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Just different skinned version with different songs?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.000
And it's different track lists. It's more geared towards kids, supposedly, but it's just basically...

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
In other words, I like it more.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
It's another excuse to put out, you know, another version of the game.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:20.000
It's another thing that they can go, hey, look, you know, Guitar Hero's out selling Rock Band, like, ten times over.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Yeah, because you're releasing ten times more games, stupid!

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I don't know. It's just, it's getting ridiculous now.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Thankfully, I think a lot of people are seeing that, and they've figured out, hey, you know what? I don't want to buy all these games.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:39.000
And, you know, before I used to pick up some of the Guitar Hero games, even though I didn't really play them.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Not anymore. I'm not really touching them, because I do realize that they're just all stuff that could be available for, you know...

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
They're download content. They only have a few tracks to come out each month.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Rock Band has a few tracks to come out each week.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
And it's a real bummer. It's a real bummer that my Xbox died when it did.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Because I had just downloaded Janus Joplin, Piece of My Heart, which I was so looking forward to playing.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
And the Gorillaz Pack, too. And never got to play them, because of my Xbox dying.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
But anyhow, you know what, though? Loki, I actually think I'm going to pick up Guitar Hero 5.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Because the song list looks pretty awesome.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And I skipped World Tour, though. I didn't buy World Tour, ever.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I probably will get Guitar Hero World 5. At least the game by itself.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
I probably won't get the whole... I don't need the drums and all that bullshit.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
And you know what you can do? Pro tip here?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Just go rent World Tour and get the code from the back, and hopefully no one else has thought of that.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Hopefully. Hopefully.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Eh, it's a big deal. I'm sure the game will come down in price, big time, used at some point.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Well, then again, I won't be able to get the code, huh?

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Well, no. If it's used, you may still will, too.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Because the codes really don't mean anything right now. They aren't used for anything.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
So if you do happen to find it used, you can still use it.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
You know, there's still probably kind of price to use.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
And I don't know if I... I don't think there were any songs in World Tour I wanted that badly.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And then the other thing, too...

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Rock Band 2 right now is $99 for the bundle. Which is not bad, I mean, if you haven't picked up.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Okay, that's a funny thing right here.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:22.000
There's the Beatles Rock Band bundle that they have right now.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000
We found out that the title's going to be heavily allocated, which means they're only going to release limited quantities to distributors.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
And, you know, retail stores are probably going to get them.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Because they're going to be really hard to find, basically.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:40.000
It's actually cheaper to buy Rock Band 2, the bundle, and then buy Beatles Rock Band the game only.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.000
You'll literally save almost $100 and you'll get two games instead of one.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I mean, if it's that important that your instruments look like the Beatles' instruments...

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
I mean, we're talking a plastic guitar here...

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
If it's really... is it $100 important?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I mean, seriously, if you really want to spend the extra $100, you can buy another guitar that looks...

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
You know, one of the two separate guitars that they have available as well.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:12.000
But, I mean, seriously, if you're just holding out for that bundle, just buy Rock Band 2 and then get the other game.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But aren't they going to phase out the Rock Band 2 bundles eventually?

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Probably not, because not everyone's going to want Beatles Rock Band.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I'm sure Rock Band 2 will be around for a while until Rock Band 3.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Probably Rock Band 3 will be coming out probably next year.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
So they'll probably keep Rock Band 2 around until 3 comes out.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I wonder what 3 will do that really ups the ante.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Probably offer the same stuff that they did in Beatles Rock Band, like the 3-part harmonies.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Maybe some sort of... I don't really know.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I'm hoping, though, it at least does the whole thing where your Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2 library can be exported,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
and you're just going to have this gigantic jukebox of songs available.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Definitely. I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:04.000
The only thing that they may have is obviously the older songs won't support the 3-part harmonies, but who cares?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
You don't need to have that.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
And they could always maybe patch it in.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Yeah, I doubt they'll do it, but they could.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
They could.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Probably the songs they release going forward will all have that.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:20.000
And who knows, if they know that that's coming, maybe some of the songs that come out over the next year are going to secretly have it in there.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I would think, but maybe not. I don't know.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Maybe?

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Did you talk about Roadie Battle?

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
No, not yet.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:38.000
What's kind of neat, though, with the Wii version, they're actually doing something called Roadie Battle, which, surprisingly enough, is actually something innovative.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
What it's going to be is it's a mode that you use with your DS.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Basically, you need two DSs to do this, I guess, if you're playing with two humans using the DS.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And then the other two people will play a versus battle on Guitar Hero and on the Wii.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And so during that time, you have little mini-games that you play on the DS.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Like, for example, you're sabotaging the other player, so you unscrew the amp.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So you actually make the little motions like you're screwing in something, and basically that will screw up the other person.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Or they'll have one where you have to reset the soundboard.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And so they have little marks where the sliders need to be, and you have to slide your stylus to move the sliders.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I think that's kind of cool.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And I think that would be kind of cool as a standalone multiplayer game or something like that on the Wii for Guitar Hero 5.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Just say you want to play a little mini-game or something like that. Different. That would be kind of neat.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I guess any new future is kind of cool, I guess, if nothing else.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
If you don't have two people, you know, you don't have two DSs or something like that, you can actually play against a computer.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
But it's neat.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
All right. Very cool.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Hey, a lot of things that, or I should say, a lot of complaints have been made about the Xbox 360's friends list and the fact that it's limited to basically 100 friends.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Well, and people are wondering, why doesn't Xbox just up the friends list?

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.000
And, you know, honestly, guys, it's not as easy as just flipping a switch, you know.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Probably this is, you know, takes a lot of work on the server ends and so forth.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000
You know, if things were built a certain way, then they're kind of stuck that way.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But apparently, a lot of this dates back to Halo 2.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Apparently, original Xbox games were coded to be limited to 100 friends, and that limit was brought into the current generation.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:34.000
And this has to do with a report from G4, I guess, talked to a high level Microsoft source.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000
The real reason why they cannot up the friends list is because more people are still playing Halo 2.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000
So if you want the friends list to be upped, Halo 2 has to go away, I guess.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Or they're going to have to make some major fixes to Halo 2. I don't know if they can really do that.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000
So it's probably going to take a long time for that limit to go away.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:59.000
But really, I mean, I've found myself struggling with the 100 friend limit.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But at the same time, I just kind of will remove people I've never talked to since the day they add me or never have played a game with or what have you.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
And that seems to work okay.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I just remove people after they've been offline for like 30 days.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Yeah, then you kind of figure they're not coming back.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
And if they do, it's no big deal.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Or, you know, obviously if it's my friends or something like that that I know in real life, you know, I won't take them off there.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.000
But, you know, for the most part, I will take people that are not on there for 30 days.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And the thought is maybe some folks will get off of Halo 2 once Halo 3 ODST comes out in September.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000
But you know what? I don't know. I think there's always going to be some people playing Halo 2.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.000
When they pull the plug on Halo 2 someday, there are going to be some pissed off gamers.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.000
But the question is, you know, how many are they willing to risk pissing off to do it?

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Or why can't they just like, I don't know, limit your friends list to show just the first 100 in Halo 2 and then just have it later, you know, more later or something like that.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Just limit it to the first 100.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Alright. Well, let's get into the mailbag.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.000
And the lovely DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and picks a few of her favorite emails to read here on the program.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000
So, who's emailed us this week? mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. DarkSakura.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:29.000
We have one from Mark who says, I'm a new fan of your show and I added your video game talk show to my podcast to my Yahoo RSS feed so I can hear you all the time.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Now, what are all your PlayStation 3 PSN names?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I don't have one because I don't play on it.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Wouldn't that buy me a game of your favorite PS3 games?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
What? No, your PSN name.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Oh, PSN name? Um, Green Sky but IE instead of Y.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Loki, OLR, caps. I can't remember if there's a space though in between Loki and OLR.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Mine's all one word, all lowercase.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Mine's, I think on the PlayStation Network, he caps spaces. So, maybe you can.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I think, I don't remember. It's in the forums. Go look in the forums.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Next email. Oh, it's by the same person.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Well, I'm not going to read one by the same person twice.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Well, I don't know.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Read it at the end.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Well, I'm actually closing it right now.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
This one comes from Redertainment.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Hi, I'm a resident of Utah and frequent the Best Buy store where the pilot program that was discussed last week is taking place.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I didn't ask the manager about it under the guise of doing a story for a gaming site.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.000
What I learned is that they are taking the trade in values from the Gamestop website.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Also, not all the games are subject to this program, just ones that are out of print and are hard to sell.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
I couldn't get any other details as I am not an employee.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Also, Super Mormon Brothers, really? Come on, you can come up with better.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:05.000
For instance, Grand Theft Auto, LDS and City, Sim Missionary, DDR Mormon, Tabernacle Choir Mix, and Are You Smarter Than a Member of the Quorum of the Seventy?

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
That's all I have.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Staycare? Redertainment.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.000
This message brought to you by the Utah State Legislature where racism, classism, and homophobia are not just encouraged, it's rewarded.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.000
That is so funny that we actually did have a listener in that town that we were talking about last week's show. That's great.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
This is from Robert M.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Interesting you mentioned Johnny Cash in Guitar Hero 5.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I love the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, Lisa 1 and 2, especially the soundtracks of those games.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000
It seems to lose focus creatively and musically with Underground and Underground 2.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.000
The later of which containing such random artists as Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and, yes, Cash.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:46.000
I can accept such an eclectic variety of artists in a music slash rhythm game more readily than in a skating game, though.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I'm not sure how I feel about the character model in 5 yet, excuse me, nor have I made up my mind about Hendrix being in World Tour.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000
We just had commentary from Shermy.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:06.000
To play freaking morons advocate, I get the feeling that Mr. Kotick meant to say that he felt retail costs, I think we discussed this,

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.000
may need to increase as project budgets marketing increase. Of course, if that's what you mean, say that.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:23.000
In an ideal world, which this isn't, Bobby wouldn't trip over a scorpion and fall into an alligator pit and be replaced with Gary Kitchens and or David Crane after a merger with their company Skyworks Technologies.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Moving forward. Yes, I'm reading at rapid speed.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
This is from Jeff.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Hi Jeff.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Hey guys, I'm a new listener, love your show. I wanted to know if all of your episodes can be downloaded off iTunes or only a certain amount.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Also, my condolences to Loki and his wife for their loss. I also wanted to know if any of you are looking forward to Uncharted 2 or Ratchet and Clank.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Uncharted 2, in my opinion, is going to be a big seller for the PS3.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:53.000
The PS3 is coming into its own finally. Big name titles coming their way for the system. Thanks guys and keep up the great podcast.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I've heard good things about Uncharted 2. I haven't checked it out myself. I need to get the demo for it, which I will probably do now that I'm Xbox-less for a little while until I figure out what I'm going to do to replace that.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:10.000
What was the first part of that? Something about iTunes. Oh, only the last 10 episodes are available on iTunes.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:25.000
OLR PSP.com, you can get the last 20. It's the one site where it goes back a little further, but unfortunately we don't really offer any further back than that. I do know some OLR listeners have scrounged up old episodes.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Just because of server load and space, every show is 90 megabytes. It's a huge amount of bandwidth, so we can't offer every show. We have a bunch of listeners who have old shows and there's this OLR archive.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:57.000
I tried to go to it today, though, and I got a bunch of spam, so I don't know if the link is no longer good, but apparently they dug up the old, old episodes. Episode 1 even, I think. I don't know if folks in the chat room can confirm it tonight.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Did you find all the old stuff? I think that's the old ones. Did you put it? I haven't burned them yet.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Somebody said season 1 is on the OLR archive now, but you have to remember, just remember, if you're going to go back and download episode 1, episode 2, it was a totally different show 7 years ago.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:25.000
We grew. It was less mature. Totally different. Just warning you. And I had a migraine the whole first episode, just warning everyone. And then I think that was, wasn't that when I went to go sleep in the Harry Potter room?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:42.000
That was later, I think. That was later, yeah. I slept in a little bed under the stairs. Jason and Raichan found the old episodes. They had them somehow. I must have burned them off for Raichan when I sent her the ferret years ago. I bet I did. How funny.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:55.000
So, moving forward now. And actually, this is one of those weeks where I've actually had to pick different emails because we've got so many. So, if your emails aren't getting read, I'm sorry. It's just we really do have to move through here.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Shook here, or is it Shookay? I don't know. Lately, I've been thinking about getting Final Fantasy X on PS2 for my 13th birthday on October 17th. The thing is, my old man, who's just about as heartless as a grizzled non-vet, won't let me get what he calls quote pussy jab stuff. End quote. Ew.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:24.000
That's not racist at all. No, not at all. Could you give me some advice as to coercing him into letting me get it? It'd be much appreciated. Tell him it's localized for American audiences.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:39.000
That's about it. Or do what I used to do in sneak. Buy it yourself. It's Final Fantasy X for the PS2? Yeah. Dude, that's like 20 bucks now. You can do it. Sell back some old games to GameStop and just buy the game yourself.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:50.000
And, dude, Final Fantasy X had Blitzball. That's pretty hardcore. And thank you for being a lot more open-minded than your father. No insult's intended towards your father, but he sounds bigoted.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:19:01.000
He sounds like an asshole and complete ill-will meant towards your father. Sorry. Ill-will meant. I mean, I don't like to insult people's parents. Yeah, I know.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Because even though our parents may be, you know, my dad is fairly racist and thick-headed, but I still love my dad. Well, when my mom and dad say stupid shit, I call them on it.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But that's just the way we are in our family, you know? They call me on stuff, I call them on stuff. So, what can you do? Is Shermie smelling the microphone? I'm trying to get her to say something. No.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Oh, you almost strangled poor Shermie. Poor Shermie. Go sit on Dan's desk. She likes people, she just is nervous, okay?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yeah, tell your dad, you know, to get with the times. Ooh, this one's for me from Cheeseburger.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Jamie, what's a good starter pinball machine for under $1,000? Oh, and post more videos on YouTube, they're great. Just for the record, T-H-E-R-E is for location. T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E is what you intended.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Good pinball tables under $1,000. Good look on eBay and Craigslist, seriously. You're gonna pick up a beater, just so that you know, typically for that low.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But you can, it's a good way to get started, you know. If you pick up a beater machine that needs a little bit of work, and start putting the work into it yourself, you can trade it later on for other tables for things that you want better.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Yeah, those are really, also, there's a, Dan's not here for me to get the name of it from him, but there's a Sacramento Pinball Group actually puts up a purchase stuff every so often, and that's a group that my husband's a part of.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:51.000
But eBay and Craigslist, really, you just need to make sure that you look for, you know, everything works, or, you know, if there's a problem with it, don't make sure there's no, like, board problems.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:21:03.000
You know, something that you're gonna have to instantly get into soldering up a board together, you know. Playfield, you know, if you see cabinet damage, playfield damage, at least make sure that it's in good working condition before you get it.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Cabinet damage and playfield damage can be repaired. And if they can't, let you just buy a new one later on.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
So, last email?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Okay.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:29.000
From Geekboi2424, Hey guys, with the summer of Arcade coming to an end, and Rob's obsession with Super Metroid, I wanted to know if you're interested in Shadow Complex. What makes it look good to you, or makes it look bad? Thanks for the opinions, and I love the show. Logan, aka Geekboi2424.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I have to be honest, I don't know much about the game, and especially because my Xbox 360 fried this week, I don't think I'll be getting this anytime soon, but I love the idea of a game influenced by Super Metroid, and I'm all about that.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:55.000
You know, I'll check it out, at least the demo, just based on that alone. Just the fact that it's that whole exploration and power-ups, and I just love that kind of design. You know I love my Super Metroid, and I just love the design of that game. I loved Castlevania, too.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:01.000
The Symphony of the Night, of course. So, I'm all about at least checking it out, if nothing else.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Alright.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Sounds good to me.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Get your mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us more emails to read in the future. In the meantime, it's time to get into our FUs of the week. Thankfully, there wasn't a lot of stupidity out there on the internet last week, at least we didn't find any, so we don't really have anything to dedicate this week's FUs to. Oh, except for the fact that my Xbox 360 fried itself.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:44.000
My FU goes to how much my hand hurts and the freaking suture that was left in it. The end.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Lucky. FU goes to all the drinks that I just had because I feel really full, and also to the guy that's on the Neo Geo forums that's selling all the candy cabinets that won't get back to me. I know a lot of people are antsy because they're waiting here back for them, and I want to put back my deposit to guarantee my cabinet. That's it.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I don't know. I don't really have a lot of FUs. FUs to the fact that I nap too much. That's my FU this week. FU to napping. Although, actually napping is awesome. I shouldn't say FU to it because it's really cool, actually. I just do it too much. That's the problem.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I like naps.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Naps are cool. Unless you nap all the time like me. Alright, just a couple more stories, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. But we have a few more stories before we get to that. So, Loki.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Are you a girl and a gamer who wishes that there were more girl gamer perspectives for you? Yes, yes I am. Well, you're in luck because now there's the Gamers Girl, which is a brand new blog that you can find at thegamersgirl.blogspot.com, and it's a website geared towards women who are dating gamers.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:15.000
And they have interesting little articles. One of them that they're highlighting, of course, is the Gamer Widow. Basically, a woman that has lost their boyfriend to gaming.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:31.000
They offer tips for gamers to keep their significant other from resenting or interrupting their game time needlessly. Like, for example, setting aside a half an hour right when you get home from work to lavish affection on your partner before you switch on the 360.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:52.000
And I gotta tell you, from my own experience, that does work. So, you might want to follow that advice. But yes, it's neat, I guess. I also found out from a spam ad that popped up on Go Nintendo the other day that there's actually a gamer and geek dating site.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Geek to geek? I've seen sites like that before. I don't think that was the particular one I'd seen before. It's like GK to GK? Yeah, there's some of those out there.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Well, there's some for everybody, I guess. Yep. Alright, hey, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna go to the Skype line, and this story has to do with something that women and men and everybody can bond over.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Pokemons! Let me show you them. There are some new Pokemans games coming out this spring. The Heart Gold version and the Soul Silver version.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:38.000
And what these are, these are remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver, and they'll now be on the DS. So, yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know, right? They're coming out Spring 2010.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Let's see, what is the little quote here? Announcing these much anticipated game launches at the Pokemon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokemon.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:26:01.000
We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first, but of course now we all know. That quote, by the way, from JC Smith, the Pokemon Company International's Director of Marketing.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:14.000
So, there you go, remakes coming for the DS. As far as what features and so forth on them, don't know yet, but there's a trailer out there, and it looks like it does have Wi-Fi battling going on on it, so that's kind of cool, I guess.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I actually had, um, was it Gold and Silver I had? No, the last one I think I had was Ruby. I think it was the last one I had. It was an advanced game.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.000
But I'm kind of, I'm kind of not into Pokemon anymore. You don't want to show people your Pokemans? Not anymore. I'm not as into them as I used to be.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I think I remember you playing that, or maybe it was Shane playing that on the Game Boy Advance thing for the GameCube.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I was playing Ruby on that one for a while. I think I had Ruby and he had Sapphire and we were doing the training thing for a little bit.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.000
I was playing Pearl for a while when I would go to the gym and play Pokemans.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
I don't know, Pokemon's just so repetitive to me. That's my problem with it. It just got too repetitive.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:03.000
You know what, nothing will ever top Pokemon Snap in terms of coolness.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Awesome. I love Pokemon Snap. I still play that on Virtual Console once in a great while, but it happens.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Hey, how about that Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go ahead and open it up and take your calls.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:22.000
While we wait for your calls, how about some last minute stories? Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Yes, RedBox is test marketing video game rentals in their kiosk for $2 a night. They're testing this right now in their Reno, Nevada market.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Okay, we got a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Hey, it's Ranma. What's going on, everyone?

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000
You always seem to get through, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Not too much. Once again, I take another one for the team. I went out, I dropped $5 on Rock Revolution.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I heard about this insane price drop for Rock Revolution, that it was coming way down in price, so you actually picked this up, huh?

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Yes, actually it was retailing for $16.99 at most places. It's a place right across from my job price match GameStop for me, which was pretty cool.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Nice. So, uh, well?

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:17.000
If I paid more than $5.99, I mean $4.99, I would have thrown it across the room.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Well, since you only paid $5, doesn't that make it eligible to be thrown across the room?

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:31.000
The fact that it has twisted scissors, we're not going to take it. It slides because of that. Any song, any game that has that song works for me.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Wait, isn't that a cover?

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Yeah, aren't they all bad covers?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I don't care. It's still awesome.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:51.000
So, I mean, but how's the game itself? I mean, how's the interface? How does it run? I mean, are we just picking on Rock Revolution because it's, you know, the bastard child of music games, or what's the reason to really hate this game?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Because it's nothing more than, like, Guitar Freak's Drum Mania hyped up on some really bad coke and steroids.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
How so?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Okay, first off, when playing with the drums, I keep forgetting that there is an actual cymbal for the foot pedal instead of the lines. I keep forgetting about that.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Overall, the game plays where three songs, your song goes, the album goes gold. If you complete five songs, the album goes platinum.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:29.000
And there are options, one of the objectives is, where you play one of the songs, it goes up in three levels of difficulty as you're playing, but it tells you on the screen what level you're at.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:38.000
And another one is where you practice a certain part of the song, and you have to play it back fully memorized.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000
That is kind of weird.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Well, after two albums, you get the pick of an arena, no, they give you an arena, you pick three songs and you play it right through, which is not so bad.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Wow, but having to play them from memory, that's kind of dumb.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I know it is, but it's only for like, not the whole song, it's maybe like 30 seconds of the song. It goes through with you twice, and then it goes over again from memory.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I guess that's not terrible.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
That's not so bad.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I don't know, I actually am thinking of trying to find this game and pick it up. I mean, it's only $5. I mean, whatever, I've spent more than that on crappy Xbox Live arcade games.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I think that describes most of us.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:30.000
AJ Mixon Chat says, if you're going to buy Rock Revolution for $5 just for the Bomani Pack, stop. Do not.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Believe it or not, much as I enjoy playing drums, I am more really curious about going on eBay and getting the drum kit, because I Best Buy has an outlet store on eBay, and the auction starts at like $30.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Unfortunately, it comes with the game, so knowing me, I buy the drum kit and just give the game away to somebody.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Can't you still get the drums for Rock Revolution somewhere? And keep in mind, they're not compatible with anything. Aren't the drums in Rock Revolution not compatible with any of the other games?

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Pretty much, yeah.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I do, active have me worried saying that, oh, the Rock Band drums don't work with the game.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:14.000
You know what, look on Harmonix, we talked about this last week, Harmonix's website has a compatibility chart that includes Rock Band, and it will tell you right there, so take a look.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Works for me.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Um, no, not all fan.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Alright. Have a good one, Raman, thanks for calling.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
No problem. Later.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:33.000
GameGuru says, Rock Revolution is like a train wreck, you can't look away. That comment, of course, with all our other chat comments at chat.orangelandsradio.com.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Rock Revolution, the Yaris of music games.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Aw, that was sad. I almost feel kind of bad for it.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:55.000
No, I don't. I don't feel bad, because they had their opportunity, for like years they had their opportunity, but they decided, you know what, we're just going to license the rights to our guitar peripherals or whatever, we're going to license those for the guitar hero arcade game.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.000
And they only embarrassed themselves at E3 a few years ago, didn't they?

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Yes.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lands Radio, who's this?

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
This is DS Master 25.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Uh, not much, just you guys talking Rock Revolution, um, I've actually, I've had the ROM for like, probably about two days now.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:23.000
You're not supposed to tell people we have ROMs.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:35.000
This is translated, and it's really crappy on DS, other than it has one part of the game that is missing from the console versions.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
What's that?

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
The singing.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:43.000
That's right, the console versions don't even have the singing, because they're covers, huh, so they can't really match up.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:50.000
But yeah, you, uh, you, now I can't think of a lot of DS games where you do that, you actually sing in the microphone, right?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Yeah, it has the pitch bars, you know how Karaoke Revolution works, right?

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Yeah.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Basically, it's that interface, so it's a little bit iffy, unless you have the DS headset, then you're fine, so don't use the mic on the DS.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I see.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Well, here's my question about it, and this is the will it blend question of gaming, because you know, you can always ask, but will it blend?

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Here's my question, but is it fun?

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Uh, this thing, part in drumming, was about as fun as it got. The bass, I saw it first, because I had the Guitar Hero peripheral for the DS.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:47.000
So I figured, oh, they might have something, you know, along the lines of Guitar Freaks, when you're getting this sort of spiel, so I plugged it in expecting, you know, like the down, the upward note chart going on, but that wasn't the case, it was just like strum up, strum down, strum up, strum down.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Same thing for the bass, but with the four strings. It's stupid.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:58.000
So, basically, to sum it up, it's about as fun as dark grey notes on a black background.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Have you heard, though, Konami's not giving up?

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Pretty much.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Guitar Freaks has a new version coming out in Japan, and apparently now they've finally caught on to the five fret thing, they're going to go up to five frets.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I do not like that idea. What the, ugh.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:28.000
You know what's funny? Do you remember this? Do you remember this years ago? Years and years ago, do you remember when Red Octane, before Guitar Hero came out, their business was making money off of peripherals for Konami games.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:40.000
They actually released a controller, like, seven, six, five, I don't remember, five, six years ago, before Guitar Hero was out, they released a controller for Guitar Freaks with five buttons on it.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:51.000
And everybody always asked, why the hell are there five buttons on this controller? Oh, there must be a new Guitar Freaks game coming out with five buttons, and then it turns out, well, it was a precursor to them putting out Guitar Hero.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Probably the fact, probably Konami's not revitalizing their series kind of probably drove Red Octane to do it themselves, and ended up being very successful with it.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Yeah, but I could not, see, but I was a Guitar Freaks player before I played Guitar Hero, and my uncle kept telling me, like, start going up on medium, use that fourth and fifth button.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I'm like, I can't, I'm too used to the three button pressing system that was on Guitar Freaks, I'm so used to the Japanese guitar game.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:34.000
It takes time, you just practice and it takes time. Four isn't as hard to do, because you can do four without really moving your hand, it's five that gets tricky because you have to learn how to move your hand back and forth.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:44.000
That's when it gets really hard, but four, most Guitar Freaks players can do four pretty easy because it's still one hand, you just have to get your pinky, you have to do pinky exercises every day, and you'll get better.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:56.000
See, and actually get this, my school, for fundraisers for the music program, they've been having Guitar Hero tournaments all these years, and actually they finally had a rock band last year.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Now it's just a matter of time before they, because with DJ Hero coming out, do you think, I think you guys might have heard this before, but it still makes me think, because I've been working on this whole mod with Disney rock songs on Guitar Freaks, kind of like how people have been modding Guitar Hero tracks for a while.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I've been doing it with Guitar Freaks, but now it's all Disney stuff because they haven't done a Disney Guitar Freaks for Drummania, so basically, why haven't they done Disney with anything else other than DDR and Poppin?

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Don't give them ideas, because Disney has their own studio, Disney has their own gaming studio, and for whatever reason, well because DDR is Konami's thing, Disney can't really rip it off for themselves, but Konami, as you can see, does not have the locks on guitar games, so if Disney wants to do their own guitar game, they will. That's probably the reason behind it.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:37:13.000
But here's one thing I kind of figure, around the lines, no one helped operate the Jonas Brothers that are just speaking Disney. I was actually at a Demi concert, and there was this supposed preview coming up with the Jonas Brothers talking Guitar Hero, and possibly an expansion pack for them.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I could see that happening, and well, you look at the way that Gabe stopped, instead of teenage boys, you're going to be seeing tween girls in one line.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:31.000
As Kevin Smith says, in six years, those girls will be 18.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Alright, DS Master, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, alright?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Alright, just one last question.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Do you think, especially with DJ Hero and Scratch coming out, do you ever think there's ever going to be a revitalization for Beatmania, period?

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Sadly, the closest you're going to get is these knockoff games coming out. Not the DJ Hero, but the other one, the Scratch Ultimate DJ.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Scratch is as close to Beatmania as you're going to get, and it is pretty damn close to Beatmania.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Konami just doesn't care about Bomani anymore, and a lot of that has to do with the closure of their Northern California office. Sorry to say.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Which sucks.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.000
It does suck, but there's not a lot we can do.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Alright, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Peace out, and keep the shows rocking.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
We'll try.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:26.000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call, try to get through here on the line.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000
We'll probably take maybe one more call, and then we'll probably be done here.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000
DarkTit2, you want to remind us that 2DX17 is coming out.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Oh, right there.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Jesus Christ, I didn't even say hello.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Let me guess, this Legend of Zaku.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Of course, how would you have guessed?

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Did you, because you cut me off, did you know that they are releasing an Atari Lynx game named after you?

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Really?

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Yes.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Oh wow.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I'm not kidding, there's an Atari Lynx game coming out called Zaku. Check it out.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Better not be, better not rip off a Gundam or anything like that.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Well, the only thing I'm going to warn you is that Zaku is a chick, so somehow something got misinterpreted, so you'll have to go take it up with them.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Whatever, anyways, something just came up to my attention recently.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:24.000
I don't know if you noticed, but apparently Sega is pulling the plug on the ChromaHounds 360 servers.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:38.000
In other words, the $50 that we pay for Xbox Live every year isn't really helping us, isn't really keeping the servers on for an unlimited amount of time.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:46.000
In other words, we're paying $50 and yet our servers are more likely not going to, they don't look like they're going to be safe.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Because if Sega could pull the plug on that, what's going to stop other companies from doing the same thing?

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Is this really news, though? Because I thought, at least on the original Xbox, that servers were being shut down for the old sports games.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Am I correct or am I wrong on that?

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:01.000
No, they were.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:07.000
So this has happened before, it's just I think this is the first time we've heard of this happening on the Xbox 360.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:17.000
And the fact that it's a non-sports title that, you know, ages, you know, the ages gets old and replaced with a new sports title, you know, that both kind of plays into it, too.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.000
I mean, it sucks, but it's also kind of not the first time.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.000
But I mean, I understand your point, you know, what are we paying $50 for if it's not for the maintenance of these servers?

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:43.000
I mean, I don't get it that we're paying that much money and we're getting, you know, the fact of the matter is this, just getting shafted for, I don't know, I guess it's because it has the, you know, the potential to set precedent.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:51.000
And Sega could do it that anyone else has the potential to just say, oh, we'll pull the plug on the server, even though you're paying $50 a year.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000
I can understand them pulling the plug on the server if literally no one is using it.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I mean, even if it's just a handful of people, I mean, are there listeners?

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I mean, honestly, I want an honest poll of the listeners.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Is anyone still playing ChromeHounds online at least once a week?

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I mean, I don't know, you know, and again, I understand what you're saying about precedent and all that stuff.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:26.000
But I can also understand that if they need to close down this server to make room for a new game that, you know, there is a finite amount of space out there and an amount of bandwidth that maybe they just need to get rid of.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Does it suck, especially considering we're paying for it? Yeah.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I mean, the fact of the matter is that we're pretty much paying $50 for dedicated servers, and then all of a sudden we find out that aside from the sports games, which are seasonal, I bet, you know, which are obviously seasonal, and it's expected that they close out a few servers for an outdated Madden game, for example.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:59.000
But for something like ChromeHounds, which is completely non-sports, just to have the servers close and we're still paying for it, it's just, I don't know, it's just mind-boggling.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Deathwishing in chat says he plays. I find matches every night. Yeah, I think he's called in about ChromeHounds before, so that kind of doesn't surprise me. I don't think I see anyone else, though.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Hmm. Well, you know, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. I mean, unfortunately, I think it's one of those things where they'll just take a chance on pissing off a few people to make room for some new game they've got coming out.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:31.000
It's Sega Sky. I doubt they would even have the ability to follow up on ChromeHounds unless, of course, they were financially inclined to do so.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:43.000
It's a recurring theme, though, tonight, though, is that we keep getting screwed on all these things, yet we just kind of seem to take it. The Xbox Red ringings, the servers getting shut down.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:50.000
At least for PSN, I kind of expect the servers will go down because they're free, so they're only up for a limited amount of time.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Except for popular games, but we expected that in the older PS2 days when a server is free, but not for something that we pay for.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Hmm. I don't know if there's an easy answer, Zaku. We have to speak with our wallets. The Starcraft thing. That was the other thing I was going to mention.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Alright, Zaku, do you have anything else for listeners today before we go and wrap it up?

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Alright, I don't know. Is it just me that I've noticed that Quake Live, apparently John Carmack actually said over the weekend in QuakeCon, is that that free online version of Quake, Quake Live, can't really sustain itself on ads.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
I'm not surprised.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Which brings me to the point, is there even chance or any room for a viable business model for a game that just relies heavily on ad revenues?

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Because I think if Quake Live proves one thing, is that even in a tight economy, this one was hemorrhaging money.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Hence the need for them to actually start releasing premium content. Or actually, no, I take that back. It's like a premium subscription where you actually create your own servers.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I think in order to answer that question, you have to ask yourself, how often do you click on ads?

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Well, it's not that you click on the ads. It's that the ads are actually strewn all over the actual maps in the game.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I see.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:44.000
So it's not necessarily clicking the ads. It's just the fact that, I guess, if it's something nostalgic like Quake, and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't even enough even on ads to break even, then I don't know if it might be viable for future business models with that same type.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I don't know.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:45:03.000
I don't think there is enough money to be made there, because I don't think people really act on that stuff. I don't know. I think the business model is going to have to be incorporating some paid content into it for the hardcore section of it.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:14.000
I mean, EA managed to get some sort of assurance in the fact that with Battlefield Heroes, at least that paid content is for the most part optional.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:23.000
I remember reading before tonight's show about this and that Quake Live, they're actually going to do a paid thing where you will be able to set up your own private rooms and so forth.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Right. I mean, with Battlefield Heroes, it's kind of like the other side of the coin where EA is not forcing you to buy certain content in order to play the game.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:46.000
It's just mostly aesthetics and just to level up your character a lot quicker. So you can pretty much sustain without having to resort to buying DLC.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.000
So I don't know if that's a viable model that could supplement ad revenues as well.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Well, one way to find out. We'll see.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Alright, Zaku, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Alright, have a good one.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.000
You too.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:07.000
And he needs to check out that Atari Lynx game thing going on. We have a conference call coming in.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Hi.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I'll let everyone else introduce themselves, I guess.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
And who do you want, sir?

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000
And it's Shadowclaw.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:26.000
So we have a conference call coming in. We usually don't take these very often, but my curiosity has peaked tonight. So what do we owe the conference call tonight?

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Honestly, most of it is because I wanted to call in and we were talking on Skype at the time, so we just decided to, instead of actually editing the conference call, to just call in.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Awesome. Well, hello everybody. What's on your mind, Rob?

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Well, I thought I'd talk about my interesting experience at the Chicago Comic Con last week.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Please.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:47:03.000
So I went there. They wanted to get some anime and manga programming in, so I figured, you know, I'd submit a panel. I actually wanted to do a panel about localizing American comics in Japan, which you can talk about a lot there, like the Spider-Man manga, the Spider-Man live-action show, and stuff like that.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:14.000
And, yeah, it turns out they didn't actually advertise any of the anime and manga panels anywhere at the convention, so I ended up getting one person to come in on Sunday.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Wow. Oh, I think I read about this in your journal. This is that same convention. Like, horrible signage and stuff, right?

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Yeah. Well, you've been there. It's the same place that ASEN was at, so imagine if everything was at the convention center where you registered and they didn't have any signs pointing toward the hotel at all.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Like, who would go there?

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Wow. Okay. Did the convention actually have a lot of people?

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Yeah. I don't know exactly how many. In 2006, they got, I think, 60,000 people. I have no idea how many they got this year. I'm sure it's been down a lot since then. I mean, the convention itself was pretty much just a garage sale full of bootlegs and old comics.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Was it in the program or anything?

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:57.000
There was a two-page spread in the program with no schedule and no panels in there.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Wow.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:59.000
No descriptions in there.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Someone really made you the bastard child of the convention.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Pretty much.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:18.000
I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. I mean, for those who haven't been to that little area in Chicago, you have to, I mean, that walkway is no short trip either to get from one to the other, so if you don't know where to go, I mean, during ASEN, you can figure it out because there's tons of people traveling through there all the time.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000
But, yeah, if it's not being trafficked, people don't know where to go.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:31.000
And just to make this gaming related, they had a ton of gaming bootlegs there, too. Like, people were selling full sets of ROMs on the floor. They had a main cabinet going with a couple tournaments throughout the day.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000
That's pretty bold.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:44.000
There was a gaming section. Actually, it was kind of funny. They had a Street Fighter IV tournament, or they were supposed to, and they wanted people to pay $20 to enter, and of course, no one did, so they didn't end up having it.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Huh.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.000
It was an interesting convention. I can't say I'd want to go back, and if I didn't get a free badge, I don't think I would have gone.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:49:02.000
But at least, you know, now you know, and at least it wasn't, like, that wasn't the focus. I mean, you know, for, I guess, maybe a comic book convention, they probably did all right, but that's unfortunate, though.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Mm-hmm.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Kind of a waste of time.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Can I complain about King of Fighters XII a little bit, or do you want to end the Skype?

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Of course you can. I wanted to give the other guys a chance to say something, too, if they wanted to say anything.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
It's fine. You can go on.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
All right. King of Fighters then.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
We're busy playing World of Warcraft, actually.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Nice.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000
We're installing Windows 7, which is going fun.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Much better than Vista.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Shadow's Light got me hooked on World of Warcraft. It's the default.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I'm telling you, Ion Online's pretty cool. If you're a Warcraft fan, I got to say, Ion Online, I'm liking that.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Dude, I keep hearing so many good things about Ion Online. I'm going to give it a try, like, in a couple of days.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
It's worth a look. Dark Soccer?

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:49.000
I was actually wondering if his impressions of King of Fighters XII were the same as mine.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:55.000
I think it's got a great foundation. I like the fighting in it, and I like the graphics, but unfortunately, SNK didn't really...

02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I guess they didn't have enough time to animate everything, because too many characters are missing. Half the moves are missing.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.000
It's kind of like making a foundation for a skyscraper and putting up a lemonade stand.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Well, did you notice what they did, though, with the characters themselves is that they're sprite-wrapped 3D.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:18.000
It was very interesting, but it also causes some really weird... just things that don't look right graphically with the characters themselves.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
And on top of that, there's, like, no story.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Yeah, I love the animation in the game, though. I mean, it's got the best animation of any game I've seen since Street Fighter III, really.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:37.000
But the advantage, though, for them doing it in that manner is that if they want to change anything visually about the character, they can map it over the 3D model without changing movesets.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:46.000
I'm just hoping we actually get those movesets back, for the most part. I mean, I'm a Clark Steel player, and he's got two moves, literally.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Is it just me, or is he over-roided?

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Oh, yes. It's going to be impossible for me to cosplay as Clark from now on, certainly in that style, unless I decide to go shopping with Hulk Hogan or Barry Bonds sometime soon.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I also didn't like that they did Athena in the cutesy anime style.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I don't mind that so much. Actually, that one's warmed up to me. The change... I'm a little bit iffy on Kenzo so far.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Yeah. Well, I like, though, that it seems that... I like his outfit in that, though. It seems like they're doing more towards the Psycho-Soldier outfit.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000
What's up with no Mai? That's a thing. Isn't that weird?

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
I don't...

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Well, the other thing that gets me is that there's no interaction between the characters. Like, for example, if you had Leona versus Heidern in the old game, she'd come out and salute him because he raised her in the storyline.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:39.000
And, you know, you'd have the Mai and Andy thing about her taunting him over wanting a baby or something.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Uh-oh. Are we losing you guys? Hello?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Oh, hello. Sorry.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Hi.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Sorry. I think my Skype hiccup's a little bit there.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.000
That's alright.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:55.000
But, I don't know. People didn't really play as Mai that much to begin with. I mean, they were watching her bounce, for the most part.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:56.000
I liked Mai.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Mai is actually a staple of my team because I'm really good with her.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Fair enough.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Alright, well guys, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for the call and have fun with all your respective games. Windows 7 and WoW and whatever you're playing these days, Rob.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Right now I'm playing a lot of Bladesblue, actually. That's what I've been playing all night and training.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Have fun with that. Hope your Xbox 360 doesn't fry.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:20.000
You'll be getting your TurboGrafx as soon as we get a paycheck in.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Yay! I look forward to it.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Alright. Take care, guys. Have a good one, everybody.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
You too, guys.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Later.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.000
See ya.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Later, everybody.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.000
That's funny. We don't get conference calls very often, but...

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:32.000
That was fun.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:33.000
That was fun.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:40.000
One of these days I just want every single person listening to all make a mass Skype conference call and then call us. It'll be complete chaos.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
We can do SkypeCon all on Twitter.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio!

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Alright, let's start to wrap up, guys, tonight, because it's already after 9 o'clock and we want to get out of here before it's too late.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:54.000
But more last minute stories. Loki, I don't know if you have anything else.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.000
I have nothing else.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Really? Wow. It was kind of a slow news week this week. Compared to other weeks, it was a little slow this week.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
And nothing else I wanted to talk about. Let me put it that way.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:05.000
There was other things to talk about, but there's nothing I wanted.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
But nothing that big. Alright. Fine. Be that way.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.000
I'm fighting spyware and it's just pissing me off.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Oh, how annoying.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Well, it's stuff I got to do at safe mode and I don't feel like doing it right now, so...

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Ugh.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:24.000
It's just searching for crap and then I get a wrong page and then it locks your system up because it wants to download spyware and it's a pain in the ass.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:27.000
You know what's funny, since everybody's talking about this Skype thing.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I remember for a while, I don't know what ever happened with it, but they were talking about doing another show on All Games after us.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Like a late night show or what have you.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.000
And I think what would be cool is somebody should just host a Skype thing.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Like an OLR post show that's just a massive orgy of people on Skype after the show.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I think that would be kind of fun.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.000
And people can talk about the inside jokes from the show and tonight.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
That would be fun.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.000
So, alright. That's it. We're going to wrap up. Go around and give everybody's final thought.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:58.000
DarkSakura, if you have no last minute stories tonight, then why don't you give us your final thought?

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:06.000
My final thought is my dinner was really good but I still want meat.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Tasty, tasty death.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
My final thought is I want yogurt.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Ooh, robins.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
But all the yogurt places close Sunday.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
But Baskin-Robbins is open.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
We'd have to like not do Afterbirth.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
No, they close at 10.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
We'd have to hurry through Afterbirth.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Let's do Afterbirth anyway. I don't care.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
I'm thinking of the grocery store.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.000
It's totally selfish of me but I'm thinking of...

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Because the arcade cabinet is technically my birthday gift because the wife is letting me have it.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
And that's a gift alone.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:45.000
But I am going to open up the unofficial Loki's Greedy Bastard birthday gift fund for arcade cabinet use.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:48.000
So links will be in the form.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I will donate and then I can feel guilt-free when I don't get you anything else.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
That's fine. You don't have to get me anything at all anyways.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
That's what everyone says.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Alright, let's go ahead and close up guys and call it a night.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Thank you guys as always for downloading and listening to our program. We really appreciate it.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:10.000
If you want to help us out, just help us spread the word.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Tell somebody you know about the show.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Help build our community by joining the Twitter.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.000
If you can't be here to listen live, we're trying to think of ways to get you guys to interact anyway.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Through Mailbag, through Twitter, Facebook and so on.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
We want to hear from you.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Keep spreading the love you guys but use protection.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
We'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
We'll be back to do it all again in 7 days.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
