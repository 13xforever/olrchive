7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the local volcano
14000	19000	Tonight, August 9, 2009, Sony pulls advertising from one of their games
19000	22000	Details are revealed on Final Fantasy 14
22000	27000	Could you soon get a new game for the price of a used one?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	35000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio
35000	39000	Here on this lovely Sunday evening, August 9, 2009
39000	45000	We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys
45000	47000	And we're a little broken tonight
47000	51000	I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here
51000	54000	Let me introduce the cast first and I'll tell you what's going on
54000	57000	My name, of course, is Rob Roberts, joining me as always
57000	60000	Say hello to the one and only Sims-loving DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
60000	61000	Yo
61000	63000	And I see you creating a character right now
63000	67000	Actually, you know, I'm redoing an old one because I got some new hairs and clothes and stuff
67000	70000	And I'm going back to one of my older games that I've kind of neglected
70000	71000	I see
71000	73000	Isn't that nice hair?
73000	74000	It's very pretty
74000	75000	There you go
75000	78000	And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki
78000	79000	Hi
79000	80000	How are you doing, Loki?
80000	81000	I'm doing well, I guess
81000	86000	I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on
86000	90000	So, anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?
90000	93000	I don't know, I guess I could explain everything that happened
93000	95000	I mean, I don't know
95000	98000	Well, I should start because the first week we were gone was kind of my fault
98000	100000	And, you know, it was something that was unanticipated
100000	103000	And by the way, I apologize for my speech
103000	105000	Speech is all screwed up tonight
105000	107000	I have the hiccups really bad
107000	112000	Like, we were just on Bobby's show doing our little tease over to this show and I was fine
112000	114000	And right after we were done, we usually have a couple minutes
114000	118000	Because Bobby always likes to read the chatters at the end of his show and wrap everything up
118000	121000	So I'm taking a little swig of water and, I don't know, like, water went down the wrong pipe or something
121000	123000	Now I have the hiccups, like, terribly
123000	128000	Which is the worst possible thing that can happen to you in radio
128000	130000	And I've got it right now and they're not going away
130000	136000	At least you can go through and kind of, like, you know, see the gaps that you hiccup in and go in and amount
136000	138000	So, excuse me
138000	141000	So anyway, I'm going to try and hopefully get rid of the hiccups
141000	143000	Anyway, we were gone the first week, my fault
143000	146000	Because I was getting sick, like, I was really sick
146000	148000	And most of it was exhaustion
148000	152000	Because I've been really pushing myself between training at work
152000	156000	Some other things I do outside of work besides just the show
156000	160000	And, you know, the show, I pretty much almost collapsed and died Sunday
160000	162000	Not really, but, you know, just collapsed
162000	164000	And was feeling really, really horrible
164000	168000	So I called it off for Sunday and was like, let's all take a night off
168000	172000	But then we announced that we were going to go on hiatus
172000	176000	We're actually back kind of quicker than I think some people thought we'd be back
176000	178000	But I'll let Loki take over
178000	182000	Yeah, so basically last Friday
182000	185000	Yeah, last Friday
185000	187000	Well, actually, let me start
187000	190000	The week before that, the week before Friday
190000	193000	Or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago
193000	195000	So two Fridays ago
195000	202000	Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains
202000	205000	Basically, you know, during labor you get
205000	208000	Or I should say during pregnancy you get false labor pains
208000	210000	They're called Braxton Hicks contractions
210000	214000	Basically kind of going through the whole, you know, contraction cycle
214000	216000	They're not supposed to hurt
216000	219000	They're basically, you know, you feel a tightening and then that's it
219000	223000	And you get them all throughout the entire duration of being in labor
223000	225000	Well, she was getting some that were painful
225000	228000	And now they can be painful, but usually they're not
228000	233000	So anyways, long story short, we went into the hospital that day
233000	235000	To have her checked out
235000	237000	And they looked at her, they did an ultrasound
237000	239000	They did, you know, an exam
239000	241000	You know, and her cervix was closed
241000	244000	And, you know, it was five centimeters long
244000	248000	Which is, you know, long for, you know, the birth canal
248000	250000	But usually it's like three centimeters
250000	253000	So everything was basically looked to be normal
253000	255000	So we went home
255000	257000	You know, she was basically taking it easy
257000	259000	Laying on the couch and stuff like that
259000	262000	Monday she went into her normal doctor
262000	264000	Because she had an appointment
264000	266000	And she actually had her looked over again
266000	269000	And once again everything seemed fine
269000	272000	So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around
272000	275000	And she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff
275000	278000	But she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday
278000	283000	So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again
283000	286000	To have her, you know, have them check her out
286000	289000	Because now she was getting some sort of, like, fluid leaking out of her
289000	291000	And she didn't know what that was
291000	293000	Normally that's not normal
293000	296000	So they took her into labor and delivery
296000	300000	Looked at her, and they did, you know, an exam
300000	303000	And they said, okay, well it doesn't look like anything's wrong
303000	307000	So she finally insisted, listen, you know, give me an internal ultrasound
307000	309000	And I want you to make sure everything's correct
309000	312000	Because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine
312000	314000	So sure enough they give her an internal ultrasound
314000	321000	And they realize that now within the time frame of Friday to Wednesday morning
321000	324000	She's now completely, her cervix is completely effaced
324000	326000	Meaning that it's shortened up
326000	329000	Which is what happens before you go into labor
329000	332000	And she's actually three centimeters dilated now
332000	337000	And the sack of one of the babies is actually hanging out into the birth canal
337000	340000	Which means that any moment her water could break
340000	344000	So Wednesday they call me down to the hospital
344000	346000	So I have to go down there
346000	349000	And basically she let me know what was going on
349000	352000	And we, they tried basically to reverse the process
352000	355000	They gave her drugs to stop contractions
355000	359000	And they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head
359000	365000	To hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into her uterus
365000	369000	And, you know, basically the contractions would, you know, were stopped
369000	372000	And they were going to see if maybe the dilation would go away
372000	377000	Well, 24 hours later they examined her again
377000	379000	It wasn't getting any better
379000	381000	The contractions were already stopped
381000	383000	But she's continuing dilated
383000	386000	So at that point there was no way that they could stop anything
386000	391000	Basically, you know, they were giving us the option of
391000	395000	Well, we can break your water now and induce labor
395000	399000	Or you can go home, wait for your water to break, and then come back in
399000	404000	And, you know, it's basically, okay, when do you want to kill your children
404000	406000	Is basically what they were giving us the option for
406000	411000	So, because, you know, as far as we could tell the, you know, babies were fine
411000	412000	They were moving still
412000	414000	Which makes it the hardest
414000	416000	Because everything was okay
416000	418000	But we had to deliver them now
418000	421000	So they induced labor
421000	426000	Actually, before that, you know, they were, you know, trying to figure out
426000	428000	We were trying to make the decision
428000	431000	So she got up to use the restroom and then her water broke on her own
431000	435000	So it was pretty much, you know, the decision was made for us
435000	438000	And, you know, they induced labor
438000	442000	Which normally, you know, fewer full term
442000	447000	Takes about five hours before, you know, you go into labor
447000	448000	And deliver the baby
448000	453000	Well, because she wasn't full term, it took 15 hours, you know, to do that
453000	456000	So Friday morning at 5 AM
456000	458000	They examined her again
458000	460000	To see, you know, how it's going
460000	463000	Because actually during the night and everything, like around 1 in the morning
463000	468000	She got an epidural because the, you know, contractions were getting stronger and more painful
468000	475000	And then, you know, they checked her again at about 5 in the morning
475000	478000	And, you know, to see if she was dilated enough
478000	480000	And they saw feet hanging out of her
480000	483000	So they were like, well, looks like you're ready to go
483000	488000	So they went ahead, delivered the first baby
488000	490000	It came really quick
490000	493000	And my boy Michael was delivered first
493000	498000	He had died before he was delivered
498000	501000	Basically, probably from all the trauma
501000	506000	You know, his water or his sack had been broken for, you know, 15 hours
506000	510000	And he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process
510000	512000	And, you know, because he's being contracted on
512000	516000	And he was breached, you know, just all that combined together
516000	520000	You know, he died before he got born
520000	524000	And then, luckily right after that
524000	527000	Because, you know, one of the scenarios they gave us was
527000	529000	That, you know, the boy would be born
529000	534000	And then the girl, you know, might not, the sack might not come down and descend
534000	536000	And you might have to go through the whole labor process again
536000	539000	Which we were just at that point, like, let's just get this over with
539000	543000	Luckily, though, right after he was born
543000	545000	Her water basically broke
545000	548000	And then Sarah was born right after that
548000	550000	And, you know, she was born alive
550000	552000	Everything was okay with her
552000	557000	But because it's only 21 weeks, you know, she doesn't have any lungs yet
557000	561000	So, luckily, you know, they're oxygenated really well in the womb
561000	563000	In case, you know, the mother dies or something like that
563000	565000	The babies can survive a little bit
565000	570000	But because she has no lungs, she, you know, only lived for two hours
570000	574000	So, you know, basically, you know, we got to hold them
574000	577000	And, you know, say our goodbyes and stuff like that
577000	582000	And, you know, it was really, really, really tough
582000	584000	You know, very sad
584000	590000	At least our family got to see them and everything before, you know, we sent them away
590000	595000	But, yeah, so that was my week last week
595000	599000	But, you know, it's just unfortunate
599000	601000	They don't know what happened
601000	604000	They don't know why, you know, this happens
604000	608000	They think maybe incompetent cervix, which is a possibility
608000	610000	Usually, though, this might not be the case
610000	617000	Because incompetent cervix is a scenario where your cervix gets smaller during the duration of the pregnancy
617000	619000	It slowly happens
619000	621000	This happened, like, three days
621000	623000	Which, you know, that doesn't happen
623000	626000	So, you know, free term labor
626000	628000	They don't really know what happened
628000	630000	And we probably won't know what happens
630000	632000	I mean, it could be an infection, you know
632000	634000	Who knows
634000	636000	So they sent off the placentas to pathology
636000	638000	So maybe we'll learn something from that
638000	640000	But I doubt it
640000	642000	So, basically, the whole thing was just, you know, very sad
642000	645000	Luckily, we got taken care of really good
645000	648000	Except for one nurse was completely retarded
648000	650000	And I'll get into that later
650000	653000	But, I don't know
653000	655000	It's just, it's sad
655000	657000	And, you know, wish it hadn't happened
657000	660000	But there's not really much you can do
660000	662000	That's why I'm here this week
662000	665000	Because, you know, everything's kind of getting back to normal
665000	668000	And, I don't know, just got to go on
668000	670000	You know
670000	672000	So, yeah
672000	674000	That's basically everything that happened
674000	676000	And we, you know, took care of all the female
676000	679000	Because they are actually considered, you know
679000	681000	20 weeks
681000	683000	Like, if they were born at 20 weeks
683000	685000	Basically, the hospital would dispose of them
685000	687000	They wouldn't, you know, really be named or anything like that
687000	691000	But 21 weeks are considered, like, a live birth
691000	693000	Or, I don't really know what they consider them
693000	696000	But, basically, they get death certificates
696000	698000	And the girl actually gets a birth certificate
698000	700000	Because she was born alive
700000	704000	But, you know, we had them cremated
704000	706000	Sometime this week
706000	708000	I think they're, those we do
708000	709000	But we went and took care of all that
709000	711000	So we get their ashes back
711000	713000	This coming week
713000	714000	Sometime
714000	717000	And, you know, we got, basically
717000	719000	They took pictures and everything
719000	721000	Because, I mean, you don't have anything
721000	724000	To take, you know, to remember them by, basically
724000	726000	So, they take pictures
726000	729000	To do footprints, handprints
729000	731000	Measurements
731000	732000	All that stuff
732000	734000	But, yeah, they were
734000	736000	10 inches long
736000	740000	And under a pound each
740000	743000	14 ounces, I think, was the largest one
743000	745000	But, yeah
745000	748000	So I think the reasons why we weren't here last week
748000	749000	Are then pretty obvious
749000	751000	I mean, Dark Soccer and I just didn't feel right
751000	754000	Kind of doing it in that, you know, type of situation
754000	755000	So, you know, we called it off last week
755000	758000	And we said, Loki, take whatever time you need
758000	760000	We'll come back when we're all ready to come back
760000	763000	And Loki, as he mentioned before
763000	765000	He's ready to kind of just get back to normal, so to speak
765000	767000	And so here we are
767000	770000	And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki
770000	772000	And kind of given, you know, everything
772000	774000	Which might come as a surprise
774000	776000	To folks who are ready to tune into a video game show
776000	779000	But I admire that you can
779000	784000	Be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now
784000	786000	That you can talk about it very professionally, you know
786000	789000	I don't know, it's still kind of upsetting
789000	791000	I mean, I'm a little upset right now
791000	793000	But it's just like
793000	795000	It's not as bad as the first day
795000	797000	Oh my god
797000	799000	It was just, it was tiring
799000	801000	The whole process was tiring
801000	804000	You know, just got no sleep for like two days
804000	806000	And just
806000	808000	The emotional rollercoaster
808000	810000	I mean, the first day we're like
810000	813000	Okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know
813000	816000	And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy
816000	818000	We're like, okay, well that sucks
818000	820000	But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know
820000	822000	And then
822000	824000	No, there's nothing we can do
824000	826000	And then one of the nurses comes in
826000	829000	Hey, well maybe they can save, you know, one of the babies
829000	831000	And, you know, deliver one
831000	833000	And, you know, the other one will be saved
833000	835000	You know, just keep the other one in or whatever
835000	837000	And you can't do that
837000	839000	Because, I mean, let's say
839000	841000	For example, you know, the what ifs
841000	844000	Basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in
844000	846000	Even for like three weeks
846000	848000	Which would make it a viable pregnancy
848000	851000	Even though it's a viable pregnancy
851000	853000	Does not mean that they're gonna come out normal
853000	856000	I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way
856000	858000	They're gonna have, you know
858000	861000	Developmental, you know, mental issues
861000	863000	You never know
863000	865000	It's just, this was the easiest way
865000	867000	And thankfully, you know
867000	869000	The whole birthing process took like five minutes
869000	871000	Once you gave birth to them, it was just done
871000	873000	Super quick
873000	875000	And everything came out because, you know
875000	877000	If the placentas didn't detach or whatever
877000	879000	They had to go and scrape that out
879000	881000	It's just not fun
881000	883000	So, uh
883000	885000	Yeah, I mean
885000	889000	You know, Brad Pod Culture is saying that I posted something on Live Journal
889000	891000	Yeah, I did
891000	893000	Like the whole process, you know
893000	897000	Especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff
897000	899000	I kept thinking of how I wanted to
899000	902000	I don't know, kind of
902000	905000	Get everything out
905000	907000	And that was the way to do it
907000	909000	I just kind of wrote a letter to them
909000	911000	So, it helped
911000	915000	Obviously, there's a lot of outpouring from our chat right now, you know, about the situation
915000	917000	And, you know, everything
917000	919000	And I found that to be very true, you know
919000	921000	With your updates on Twitter and so forth, you know
921000	923000	I think Dark Soccer and I didn't really want to
923000	925000	We didn't want to say anything about what was going on
925000	927000	Because we didn't know what, you know
927000	929000	What was cool to say and what was not cool to say
929000	931000	So we just kind of said, shut up, it's private
931000	933000	You know, but then you came out and said something about it
933000	935000	And, you know
935000	938000	It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything
938000	940000	Exactly, exactly
940000	944000	And, you know, I thought the letter obviously was very, very touching
944000	947000	And some folks were saying they got, you know, a little teary-eyed reading it
947000	949000	But, you know, I
949000	951000	I guess the next thing to ask
951000	954000	And I apologize for continuing to kind of drag this out, you know
954000	958000	But I think, I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff
958000	961000	And I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is
961000	963000	What next? What do you do next now?
963000	965000	Well, now, the next
965000	968000	You know, obviously we still don't have children
968000	970000	Nellie's not
970000	972000	I mean
972000	976000	We can't, you're not supposed to try right afterwards
976000	979000	Because there's a higher risk of, you know, preterm labor
979000	983000	In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time
983000	987000	So, basically now
987000	989000	This is unfortunate
989000	991000	The way they kind of, the whole medical thing is
991000	993000	It's like they want you to fail once
993000	995000	And then they'll take everything seriously
995000	997000	It's just, you know, they don't
997000	999000	They're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess
999000	1001000	Or whatever, I don't know
1001000	1003000	So
1003000	1006000	Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment
1006000	1010000	Or she goes in with a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay
1010000	1012000	You know, just healing and everything
1012000	1015000	Later on, we'll meet with somebody
1015000	1017000	In the high-risk clinic
1017000	1020000	To see what we need to do
1020000	1024000	She thinks, I mean, she has her own theories of why it happened
1024000	1027000	She thinks that her progesterone levels dropped
1027000	1029000	Because she has PCOS
1029000	1034000	Which, basically, her body interprets insulin as testosterone
1034000	1036000	Or something like that
1036000	1038000	And it throws off her hormone levels
1038000	1040000	And that can also cause preterm labor
1040000	1047000	And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever
1047000	1050000	To keep, you know, an eye on that
1050000	1052000	The other thing they can do is a cerclage
1052000	1057000	Which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch
1057000	1059000	They couldn't do that this time
1059000	1062000	That was one of the options that they gave us
1062000	1064000	But the problem was that the birth
1064000	1068000	You know, the sack of the first baby was distended so much
1068000	1071000	That there was more of a chance that they were going to pop it
1071000	1074000	Than them actually successfully doing it
1074000	1076000	So it just wasn't an option
1076000	1083000	And, you know, pretty much we'll try again next year at some point
1083000	1087000	But just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months
1087000	1089000	Before we can try again
1089000	1092000	You know, just to be extremely cautious
1092000	1094000	And even then
1094000	1096000	Hopefully this time what we're going to do
1096000	1098000	Is we're going to do one round of Clomid first
1098000	1101000	Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it
1101000	1103000	It overstimulates her ovaries
1103000	1105000	That's why we got twins
1105000	1107000	But we're going to try
1107000	1109000	One round of Clomid first
1109000	1111000	And then not try an insemination at all
1111000	1113000	And then another round of Clomid
1113000	1115000	So we get one baby and not two
1115000	1117000	Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two
1117000	1119000	Okay
1119000	1121000	And this question might sound kind of weird
1121000	1123000	But this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you
1123000	1125000	And then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this
1125000	1127000	But I think a lot of people out there
1127000	1129000	When they were reading about this on Twitter
1129000	1131000	And even hearing about it now
1131000	1133000	And seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth
1133000	1135000	They were kind of wondering like, what can I do?
1135000	1137000	Is there something I can do to help?
1137000	1139000	Is there anything I can do?
1139000	1141000	Is there any charity?
1141000	1143000	Is there something I can do to help?
1143000	1145000	Not really
1145000	1147000	I mean
1147000	1149000	I don't know
1149000	1151000	If you want to do a charity
1151000	1153000	I guess March of Dimes
1153000	1155000	They research
1155000	1157000	Pregnancy loss
1157000	1159000	I don't know
1159000	1161000	There's that I guess
1161000	1163000	We talked about getting in a group together
1163000	1165000	For when they do the next March of Dimes walk
1165000	1167000	I don't know
1167000	1169000	I've actually done that quite a few times
1169000	1171000	And it's a really great charity
1171000	1173000	And I think it would be very perfect
1173000	1175000	I'd definitely go in on that
1175000	1177000	I don't know
1177000	1179000	Do whatever you guys need to do
1179000	1181000	See that's the thing too when we got home
1181000	1183000	Everyone wants to help out
1183000	1185000	I totally understand
1185000	1187000	What's there to do?
1187000	1189000	I don't know
1189000	1191000	It's fine because at first
1191000	1193000	We did not want to go out of the house
1193000	1195000	My mom would come over
1195000	1197000	She'd bring us groceries that we needed
1197000	1199000	I'd have friends come over and they'd bring
1199000	1201000	Food and stuff
1201000	1203000	That was fine
1203000	1205000	But now we've got a fridge full of food
1205000	1207000	What do you want us to do?
1207000	1209000	You want us to do something around the house?
1209000	1211000	I don't know
1211000	1213000	I don't know
1213000	1215000	There's nothing really you can do unfortunately
1215000	1217000	It's nice to know that you guys
1217000	1219000	Care
1219000	1221000	I don't know
1221000	1223000	Right now
1223000	1225000	I can't really think of anything
1225000	1227000	There's nothing really we can do
1227000	1229000	Well maybe if we decide
1229000	1231000	To go the charity route later on
1231000	1233000	I know we've always been
1233000	1235000	Toying with the idea of doing a marathon
1235000	1237000	Of some sort on some weekend
1237000	1239000	So that might be something we have to look into
1239000	1241000	Might be a lot of fun
1241000	1243000	For a good cause
1243000	1245000	That's pretty much it
1245000	1247000	Right now we've got a lot of stuff
1247000	1249000	Taken care of
1249000	1251000	I don't know
1251000	1253000	See
1253000	1255000	I feel so guilty right now
1255000	1257000	I really shouldn't be
1257000	1259000	I should be glad that I'm kind of
1259000	1261000	Over everything
1261000	1263000	This whole week
1263000	1265000	I was perfectly fine
1265000	1267000	I was
1267000	1269000	Sitting at home
1269000	1271000	At first I wanted to stay home
1271000	1273000	Because I wasn't ready to go back to work
1273000	1275000	Probably like Tuesday
1275000	1277000	Mainly just staying home
1277000	1279000	To keep Nellie company
1279000	1281000	Because she's got
1281000	1283000	Well she can't go to work
1283000	1285000	For four weeks
1285000	1287000	Doctors orders not to go back to work
1287000	1289000	For four weeks
1289000	1291000	Rest up
1291000	1293000	Make sure that you're okay
1293000	1295000	And healed and all that stuff
1295000	1297000	But
1297000	1299000	I've been editing Grand Theft Auto
1299000	1301000	For the last few days
1301000	1303000	So I've been just
1303000	1305000	Getting back to normal
1305000	1307000	Yeah it's pretty much getting back to normal
1307000	1309000	I feel so guilty
1309000	1311000	Because she's still upset
1311000	1313000	And I just
1313000	1315000	Can't
1315000	1317000	The most I get upset is now
1317000	1319000	Where I'm just talking about it
1319000	1321000	But even then
1321000	1323000	It's not
1323000	1325000	I don't know
1325000	1327000	It's probably just naturally going to take her a little longer
1327000	1329000	Yeah definitely
1329000	1331000	So she's been having to
1331000	1333000	Deal with the pain of that
1333000	1335000	Because
1335000	1337000	You're supposed to let it reabsorb back into
1337000	1339000	Your body and
1339000	1341000	Cramping after
1341000	1343000	She gives birth and everything
1343000	1345000	Her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions
1345000	1347000	And cramping based on that
1347000	1349000	And you have to give yourself massages in your stomach
1349000	1351000	To force it to cramp
1351000	1353000	So that it will shrink back down
1353000	1355000	All the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people
1355000	1357000	Don't know about
1357000	1359000	I don't know
1359000	1361000	I mean
1361000	1363000	It's like
1363000	1365000	I have pictures of them
1365000	1367000	They give you these little
1367000	1369000	Layets, they're little
1369000	1371000	Outfits that they basically dress them up in
1371000	1373000	And take pictures and stuff
1373000	1375000	As morbid as that sounds
1375000	1377000	But that's all you got
1377000	1379000	I actually have pictures but
1379000	1381000	It's hard for people to look at
1381000	1383000	Especially the boy
1383000	1385000	Their skin is still transparent
1385000	1387000	And he was really bruised
1387000	1389000	Coming out and he's all red
1389000	1391000	And stuff
1391000	1393000	Let me read this from Kitsune
1393000	1395000	Because I think this is really good advice
1395000	1397000	And we'll try to move on from here
1397000	1399000	Kitsune in chat says it would probably be worse
1399000	1401000	If you didn't get back to normal
1401000	1403000	I mean if you stay in a good spirit it would help her
1403000	1405000	Yeah exactly
1405000	1407000	I think that's what it is
1407000	1409000	I know we spent a lot of time talking about that
1409000	1411000	But it's important
1411000	1413000	And I think Brad
1413000	1415000	If you want to join me in our chatroom again
1415000	1417000	Chat.orangelandraday.com
1417000	1419000	After listening to OLR for so long
1419000	1421000	We feel like you guys are kind of like family
1421000	1423000	So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody
1423000	1425000	We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this
1425000	1427000	You know because
1427000	1429000	Don't want to go through this again
1429000	1431000	Fair enough
1431000	1433000	Alright well let's move on
1433000	1435000	Let's get back to gaming
1435000	1437000	Let's talk about video games
1437000	1439000	And the stuff that distracts us from the real world sometimes
1439000	1441000	And gets us
1441000	1443000	Makes us happy
1443000	1445000	Video games
1445000	1447000	DarkSakura I'll go to you
1447000	1449000	How was your gaming week we always start off the show?
1449000	1451000	Well not very
1451000	1453000	Busy just given that I can't
1453000	1455000	Hold the controllers for very long
1455000	1457000	Before my hand starts to hurt
1457000	1459000	We got in
1459000	1461000	We're borrowing a couple pinball tables
1461000	1463000	That we actually got
1463000	1465000	After we did the video
1465000	1467000	Attack from Mars
1467000	1469000	Which I really love
1469000	1471000	Which I love but I really like Attack from Mars better
1471000	1473000	Dude you got an Attack from Mars?
1473000	1475000	That's awesome
1475000	1477000	That's the pinball I have the holograms and all that stuff in it
1477000	1479000	Play after the show
1479000	1481000	And so
1481000	1483000	I've been playing a little bit of that off and on
1483000	1485000	But like I said my hand starts hurting me real bad
1485000	1487000	So I can't play for very long
1487000	1489000	And
1489000	1491000	Playing Sims 3
1491000	1493000	Off and on
1493000	1495000	Some of the
1495000	1497000	Newness has fallen for me
1497000	1499000	But um
1499000	1501000	I go back every so often and now I'm actually
1501000	1503000	Going to pick up one of my old families and play them
1503000	1505000	Somewhere now that you know better hair has come out
1505000	1507000	Um
1507000	1509000	I've been playing Peggle
1509000	1511000	I beat Peggle so now I'm playing through it again
1511000	1513000	It's
1513000	1515000	Pretty fun
1515000	1517000	Some Cooking Mama last night
1517000	1519000	On my iPhone
1519000	1521000	Played Light Cycles on my iPhone
1521000	1523000	Played La Solitaire on my iPhone
1523000	1525000	You've been getting into iPhone gaming
1525000	1527000	Quite a bit huh
1527000	1529000	You know my roommate downloaded something
1529000	1531000	For the iPhone and you know he's not a huge huge
1531000	1533000	Gamer but he got really into some role playing
1533000	1535000	Game that was on that phone I apologize I didn't catch the
1535000	1537000	Name I'll try to check it out for next week
1537000	1539000	The puzzle RPG game
1539000	1541000	Oh I have a
1541000	1543000	Vi that was a Sega CD
1543000	1545000	Title and I have it on my iPhone
1545000	1547000	Um
1547000	1549000	I've also um
1549000	1551000	Been playing some of the little games on
1551000	1553000	Gaia online cause my account
1553000	1555000	Is still there
1555000	1557000	Including Booty Grab just cause I think it's funny
1557000	1559000	It's where you go into the
1559000	1561000	Aquariums and if you
1561000	1563000	Manage to get one that's active they'll throw gold everywhere
1563000	1565000	And you grab Booty
1565000	1567000	I just laugh because I'm grabbing Booty
1567000	1569000	Nice
1569000	1571000	Cause I'm five years old that way
1571000	1573000	Um
1573000	1575000	And uh we picked up a couple of games
1575000	1577000	We actually picked up some Tengen
1577000	1579000	Games that were in the
1579000	1581000	Regular Nintendo cartridges
1581000	1583000	We got Gauntlet
1583000	1585000	And um I don't think we
1585000	1587000	Picked up RBI Baseball cause hello
1587000	1589000	It's RBI Baseball
1589000	1591000	And uh one other
1591000	1593000	That I can't remember
1593000	1595000	And uh here comes the husband
1595000	1597000	What was the other game?
1597000	1599000	We didn't?
1599000	1601000	Oh I thought you bought the games
1601000	1603000	Okay well we didn't get the games then we saw them
1603000	1605000	You just saw them
1605000	1607000	I thought he got them You had a daydream where you were gonna
1607000	1609000	Buy them and leave No because I went back
1609000	1611000	And I bought movies I bought the
1611000	1613000	Doctor Who movie
1613000	1615000	That just came out I found it brand new for like ten bucks
1615000	1617000	Oh nice And then I got this movie
1617000	1619000	Which I love Saved
1619000	1621000	Oh that's funny That movie is cracked out
1621000	1623000	And I got um Elf
1623000	1625000	Cause you know I normally
1625000	1627000	Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy
1627000	1629000	The crap out of me until I saw that movie
1629000	1631000	And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny
1631000	1633000	Especially when you smell
1633000	1635000	You smell like beef and cheese
1635000	1637000	But um
1637000	1639000	But also uh
1639000	1641000	For other games Dan got me
1641000	1643000	This that I haven't opened yet
1643000	1645000	But I will be
1645000	1647000	This is the game that we are in
1647000	1649000	But you're actually
1649000	1651000	You got the 360 version
1651000	1653000	That's the arcade stuff
1653000	1655000	We're in the PS3 version We're in the PS3 one
1655000	1657000	Yes we're in the PS3 one The Namco Museum Essentials
1657000	1659000	Which I thank you for reminding me
1659000	1661000	We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners
1661000	1663000	About this um we actually
1663000	1665000	Have a cameo in a video game
1665000	1667000	In the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials
1667000	1669000	We're in the PS3 one
1669000	1671000	It's a PlayStation Network title
1671000	1673000	Yeah it's a download title
1673000	1675000	It's a download title on PlayStation Network
1675000	1677000	You have to get it online
1677000	1679000	The one that we're in is the one online
1679000	1681000	So anyway
1681000	1683000	Now they're talking about that
1683000	1685000	But yeah if you, here's the thing
1685000	1687000	It's just a little cameo
1687000	1689000	But when you start the game, not the demo
1689000	1691000	But the retail version of the game, you're not gonna see it in the demo
1691000	1693000	When you start the retail version of the game
1693000	1695000	Then it comes up and it shows like
1695000	1697000	Hey now you can use High Scoreboard with your friends
1697000	1699000	And it actually on the High Scoreboard
1699000	1703000	It says Sky, Dark Sakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3
1703000	1705000	And then there's some initials thing on the side too
1705000	1707000	Where OLR is some of the top initials
1707000	1709000	On the High Scoreboard
1709000	1711000	So it's really cool and awesome
1711000	1713000	But it still has a lot of good games on it
1713000	1715000	Oh yeah I mean that's still a good collection
1715000	1717000	That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they released
1717000	1721000	Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online
1721000	1723000	Galaxian Pole Position
1723000	1725000	So yeah
1725000	1727000	As soon as my hand
1727000	1731000	Cause my hand is actually still pretty crappy
1731000	1733000	I actually heard it yesterday
1733000	1735000	Holding my friend's son
1735000	1737000	And she is listening right now
1737000	1739000	And sorry your son killed me
1739000	1741000	But no
1741000	1749000	I actually ended up hyper extending my middle finger way too far
1749000	1751000	And that's
1751000	1753000	Oh come on
1753000	1755000	I know it just sounds funny sorry
1755000	1757000	The technical term is hyper extension
1757000	1761000	I was using my middle finger too much
1761000	1763000	Hey hey
1763000	1765000	I was showing you see look at my finger
1765000	1769000	No and the suture is still in my palm
1769000	1771000	So I'm actually going to call my doctor
1771000	1773000	And tell him to get it the hell out of my hand
1773000	1775000	Because it's really
1775000	1777000	I pretty much think it's what's slowing up my healing
1777000	1779000	Cause I
1779000	1781000	It's taking longer than it's supposed to
1781000	1783000	It really is taking longer than it's supposed to
1783000	1785000	Other than that
1785000	1789000	I really haven't played a whole lot of other things
1789000	1795000	Oh I did watch Dan play the Arkham Asylum demo
1795000	1797000	And that looks hot
1797000	1799000	That is just oh my god
1799000	1803000	And it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J
1803000	1807000	And I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast
1807000	1811000	Except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different
1811000	1813000	But other than that hey I mean
1813000	1815000	It actually
1815000	1817000	I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up
1817000	1819000	And I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try
1819000	1821000	I'm going to
1821000	1823000	If I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo
1823000	1825000	Oh
1825000	1827000	Oh oh oh
1827000	1829000	And I came this close
1829000	1831000	Really tiny close to playing BeatMania
1831000	1833000	And I was like nah let's just go home
1833000	1835000	Probably not good for your hand though
1835000	1837000	Nah really not good for my hand
1837000	1839000	I'm a right side scratcher but nah
1839000	1841000	You know what's funny I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania
1841000	1843000	Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday
1843000	1845000	What? Where?
1845000	1847000	Tahoe
1847000	1849000	I was in South Lake Tahoe
1849000	1851000	It was either Harvey's or Harrah's I can't remember one of those two had it
1851000	1853000	And yeah I almost played it but then I was like
1853000	1855000	Dude it's 5 key this is old
1855000	1857000	Oh and I released a ringtone pack
1857000	1859000	For iPhone owners
1859000	1861000	Did I send it to you?
1861000	1863000	I don't think I saw it
1863000	1865000	I did a limited giveaway just a random giveaway
1865000	1867000	To give away 10 video game ringtones
1867000	1869000	That I made for iPhone
1869000	1871000	And I'm going to do it again
1871000	1873000	This time instead of doing it on
1873000	1875000	Twitter
1875000	1877000	I'm going to do it on Facebook
1877000	1879000	So the first 5 people to send me a message to my inbox
1879000	1881000	On
1881000	1883000	Facebook
1883000	1885000	So the first 5 people to send me
1885000	1887000	A message to my inbox
1887000	1889000	On
1889000	1891000	Facebook with
1891000	1893000	Your email address
1893000	1895000	Actually I'll be better than that I'll say 10
1895000	1897000	Will be able to
1897000	1899000	Download the pack
1899000	1901000	It's just 10 different ringtones
1901000	1903000	Nice
1903000	1905000	And I can tell everybody
1905000	1907000	What's in them later
1907000	1909000	Alright
1909000	1911000	Well let's move on with our gaming weeks
1911000	1913000	And Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto
1913000	1915000	Yeah I was playing
1915000	1917000	I got so much playing Grand Theft Auto
1917000	1919000	As I was editing Grand Theft Auto
1919000	1921000	Still
1921000	1923000	It's almost done actually I think it's probably done now
1923000	1925000	I think I've edited pretty much everything
1925000	1927000	I could possibly edit in it now
1927000	1929000	And I am going to record some stuff for it
1929000	1931000	I finally got my video capture thing
1931000	1933000	For doing HD video
1933000	1935000	And
1935000	1937000	Assuming everything works on it
1937000	1939000	We should be able to record some stuff
1939000	1941000	I've been having issues with the
1941000	1943000	Program that came with it
1943000	1945000	To get it to work
1945000	1947000	For some reason it's just crashing randomly
1947000	1949000	Hopefully we'll be able to record everything
1949000	1951000	And it will be awesome
1951000	1953000	So you can finally see
1953000	1955000	What the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto
1955000	1957000	It's insane now
1957000	1959000	Now the jets fly around at street level
1959000	1961000	And it's just kind of crazy
1961000	1963000	Because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by
1963000	1965000	Just like what the hell is going on
1965000	1967000	Other than that
1967000	1969000	I didn't really play a whole lot this week
1969000	1971000	I brought my DS with me to the hospital
1971000	1973000	It was something to do
1973000	1975000	So I played a little bit of Lego Battles
1975000	1977000	Which that game is kind of boring
1977000	1979000	I mean it's an okay RTS game
1979000	1981000	But the AIs are retarded
1981000	1983000	And like I would tell
1983000	1985000	You have these
1985000	1987000	You can harvest wood and stuff like that
1987000	1989000	Or it gives you bricks or whatever
1989000	1991000	So I'm telling them to go chop down these trees
1991000	1993000	And they just stand there
1993000	1995000	They're like, huh?
1995000	1997000	You want me to do what?
1997000	1999000	Or like I say, chop down these trees and they run the opposite direction
1999000	2001000	Absolutely retarded
2001000	2003000	So that got really frustrating and boring
2003000	2007000	Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme
2007000	2009000	Which was fun
2009000	2013000	And also some Planet Puzzle League
2013000	2015000	Which was pretty fun
2015000	2017000	Those games are good standby puzzle games
2017000	2019000	And
2021000	2023000	Let me think
2023000	2025000	I think that's pretty much it
2025000	2027000	Really not a good week for games
2027000	2029000	Even though I was home all week
2029000	2031000	I was just preoccupied
2031000	2033000	With just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff
2033000	2035000	And then before that
2035000	2037000	Putting away boxes
2037000	2039000	And cleaning up the house
2039000	2041000	But I have my giant HDTV
2041000	2043000	Now in my room
2043000	2045000	To do video capture on
2045000	2047000	So it'll be awesome
2047000	2049000	Alright
2049000	2051000	As far as my gaming week
2051000	2053000	Even the fact that we've been gone a little while
2053000	2055000	I didn't play a lot of new stuff
2055000	2057000	I made my way to disc 3 now
2057000	2059000	Which is way past where I was before
2059000	2061000	So that's pretty cool and I'm still enjoying that
2061000	2063000	I play Blackjack for real
2063000	2065000	When I went up to Tahoe yesterday
2065000	2067000	I took a day trip to South Lake Tahoe
2067000	2069000	It's so funny up there because
2069000	2071000	They have these huge casinos
2071000	2073000	Literally adjacent to the state line
2073000	2075000	Like you're walking down the street
2075000	2077000	There's some California little built up things
2077000	2079000	You literally walk across the street
2079000	2081000	And you're walking across the state line
2081000	2083000	And there's these huge casinos right on the other side
2083000	2085000	It's not like Reno where you still have to drive in
2085000	2087000	Like 5 miles at least to get there
2087000	2089000	But yeah I had a good time
2089000	2091000	And I played Blackjack for real for the first time
2091000	2093000	And it's kind of freaky because
2093000	2095000	It was $10 minimum bet and all that stuff
2095000	2097000	And I put in $60 and I left with $52
2097000	2099000	So I lost a little bit
2099000	2101000	But considering I was entertained for about an hour
2101000	2103000	And came out basically even
2103000	2105000	I'm not too upset
2105000	2107000	So that was kind of a thrill
2107000	2109000	It sounds like you did pretty good for yourself otherwise
2109000	2111000	I mean you didn't come out broke
2111000	2113000	And I was down to about $20 at one point
2113000	2115000	And I was like ah fuck my life
2115000	2117000	I'm going to be losing all my money
2117000	2119000	But I did okay
2119000	2121000	It was very nerve wracking
2121000	2123000	It was a lot of pressure but it was fun
2123000	2125000	But please gamble responsibly if you're over $21
2125000	2127000	Let's see what else did I do
2127000	2129000	I did play one new game
2129000	2131000	But I can't really review it because it's a beta
2131000	2133000	And it's actually one that I know somebody emailed
2133000	2135000	Us on before
2135000	2137000	And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game
2137000	2139000	To check it out
2139000	2141000	And it's from NCSoft
2141000	2143000	And it's a new MMO that's coming out
2143000	2145000	It's actually
2145000	2147000	If I understand right
2147000	2149000	It's been out in Korea for some time
2149000	2151000	It's just finally getting its localization over here
2151000	2153000	So it's finally in beta and so forth
2153000	2155000	And I didn't really play the game enough
2155000	2157000	To get a real sense
2157000	2159000	To review it fairly
2159000	2161000	I will say it's pretty
2161000	2163000	It definitely had some things in common with WoW
2163000	2165000	But I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well
2165000	2167000	I don't know if this is the way it looked or what have you
2167000	2169000	But as far as like
2169000	2171000	I'm just talking about the way the game looks on a purely
2171000	2173000	Superficial level
2173000	2175000	I'm not talking about how the insides of the game work
2175000	2177000	Because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into
2177000	2179000	Such as
2179000	2181000	When you get to level 10
2181000	2183000	You can actually evolve your class
2183000	2185000	I guess your characters get wings and whatever
2185000	2187000	And you can evolve your class
2187000	2189000	It's an interesting little game
2189000	2191000	But it was hard to tell a lot about it
2191000	2193000	Because in the beta
2193000	2195000	You just get thrown right into the game
2195000	2197000	There's no tutorial
2197000	2199000	There's nothing
2199000	2201000	You just got to figure it out
2201000	2203000	The first few quests kind of help you a little bit
2203000	2205000	But it doesn't hold your hand as much as Warcraft did
2205000	2207000	Or even Warhammer
2207000	2209000	Which is another one I played recently
2209000	2211000	It's more that Final Fantasy 11
2211000	2213000	Like WTF do I do now
2213000	2215000	Type of thing
2215000	2217000	But I don't want to make you think
2217000	2219000	It's Final Fantasy 11
2219000	2221000	Because it definitely felt a lot more like
2221000	2223000	WoW or Warhammer did
2223000	2225000	I'm going to check it out
2225000	2227000	I don't want to review a game based on a beta
2227000	2229000	But I will say the game kept me interested enough
2229000	2231000	To want to play it again next weekend
2231000	2233000	And that's what I plan to do
2233000	2235000	It sounds like fun
2235000	2237000	Yeah I'll have to talk to my source
2237000	2239000	See if I can get you another code
2239000	2241000	It'll be kind of fun
2241000	2243000	I like a good MMO but you know which one I'm waiting for
2243000	2245000	Final Fantasy 14?
2245000	2247000	Heck no!
2247000	2249000	What was that line from
2249000	2251000	Chasing Amy
2251000	2253000	Bitch you almost made me laugh
2253000	2255000	Let's move on
2255000	2257000	Into some housekeeping real quick
2257000	2259000	And of course we are back
2259000	2261000	Here after a little bit of a hiatus
2261000	2263000	And for the foreseeable future
2263000	2265000	Tonight is episode 333
2265000	2267000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
2267000	2269000	Believe it or not
2269000	2271000	We were on Bobby's show before we were live tonight
2271000	2273000	Our good friend Bobby Blackwolf
2273000	2275000	Who hosts the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio
2275000	2277000	At 5 o'clock Pacific 8 o'clock Eastern
2277000	2279000	Before we were on
2279000	2281000	He was making fun of us tonight
2281000	2283000	Calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth
2283000	2285000	Or half the Mark of the Beast
2285000	2287000	I was saying it's a holy show
2287000	2289000	Holy moly
2289000	2291000	And of course we have a new YouTube up
2291000	2293000	So check that out on the channel
2293000	2295000	www.youtube.com
2295000	2297000	And we are Channel Orange Lounge Radio
2297000	2299000	Or you just search for OLR
2299000	2301000	And you get all our videos, they come right up
2301000	2303000	Let's get into some gaming news
2303000	2305000	We're not going to cover anything that happened
2305000	2307000	In the past few weeks
2307000	2309000	I heard a lot of interesting stuff happen
2309000	2311000	I have to be honest, while we were away from the show
2311000	2313000	I kind of didn't pay attention to the gaming blogs
2313000	2315000	I did read a few interesting stories
2315000	2317000	Such as that promotion that went really
2317000	2319000	Really wrong by EA
2319000	2321000	At Comic Con
2321000	2323000	The whole take a picture with our booth babes
2323000	2325000	Thing
2325000	2327000	It was dumb
2327000	2329000	I don't know if you heard about this
2329000	2331000	I actually didn't
2331000	2333000	It was some lame brain in the marketing department
2333000	2335000	Their scheme went way wrong
2335000	2337000	At least it wasn't a goat head
2337000	2339000	It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe
2339000	2341000	And you
2341000	2343000	Send it on your Twitter
2343000	2345000	Or something like that
2345000	2347000	And you'll get entered in a drawing to win a
2347000	2349000	Date on the town with two women
2349000	2351000	And basically
2351000	2353000	The star treatment where you get
2353000	2355000	A paparazzi
2355000	2357000	Or basically a chaperone
2357000	2359000	A limo and that kind of stuff
2359000	2361000	But the way that it was phrased
2361000	2363000	It made it sound like you get two prostitutes
2363000	2365000	That you get to go have sex with
2365000	2367000	Right because the whole thing was around
2367000	2369000	The seven deadly sins and what was this
2369000	2371000	Lust was probably the thing
2371000	2373000	So the whole thing was built around lust
2373000	2375000	And it made it kind of sound like
2375000	2377000	It was encouraged like go harass booth babes
2377000	2379000	And take pictures of them
2379000	2381000	It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes
2381000	2383000	From what I understood from their thing
2383000	2385000	Or was it supposed to be I don't know
2385000	2387000	This is why you need parameters set
2387000	2389000	Here's the thing
2389000	2391000	I'm sorry to get far into this
2391000	2393000	Here's the thing
2393000	2395000	Is that I actually
2395000	2397000	Don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world
2397000	2399000	They thought outside the box
2399000	2401000	They came up with a new competition
2401000	2403000	Was it a very limiting competition?
2403000	2405000	Did they kind of close this off
2405000	2407000	To a lot of people by only thinking
2407000	2409000	Of the horny straight male? Yes they did
2409000	2411000	Did somebody in marketing fuck this up
2411000	2413000	Big time by taking it from idea
2413000	2415000	To fruition? Oh yeah
2415000	2417000	Oh yeah like where was the quality check on this?
2417000	2419000	Come on. And seriously you got to think about this
2419000	2421000	You don't do that
2421000	2423000	At Comic Con you do that at Vegas
2423000	2425000	Where you can actually
2425000	2427000	Fulfill your contractual
2427000	2429000	Obligation to get those guys
2429000	2431000	Laid. And I just don't
2431000	2433000	Like the only thing I really
2433000	2435000	Didn't like about it is it just reinforces
2435000	2437000	The stereotype that
2437000	2439000	Gamers are a bunch of desperate horny male
2439000	2441000	You know folks who can't get laid
2441000	2443000	You know what I mean?
2443000	2445000	And not that I think you see but at the same time
2445000	2447000	I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write
2447000	2449000	All these rules
2449000	2451000	Well you get on a date with two women
2451000	2453000	But if you're a woman you can get guys
2453000	2455000	Or if you're a gay guy you can get pretty guys
2455000	2457000	Or if you're a lesbian
2457000	2459000	I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme
2459000	2461000	Well I mean
2461000	2463000	Just let me cash out the damn prize
2463000	2465000	How about that?
2465000	2467000	You also won
2467000	2469000	Oh yeah you won booty as well
2469000	2471000	But that's funny
2471000	2473000	I don't know
2473000	2475000	Like I said I think they should've done it in Vegas
2475000	2477000	People just need to get over this shit
2477000	2479000	It's a contest you don't like it
2479000	2481000	Don't enter it
2481000	2483000	Don't get offended by it it's a contest
2483000	2485000	My god
2485000	2487000	Do we need to take it seriously?
2487000	2489000	I'm not offended but I'm just like
2489000	2491000	Stupid. This is stupid
2491000	2493000	This is so so stupid
2493000	2495000	And that's probably not what people want
2495000	2497000	You know us to be saying about their upcoming game
2497000	2499000	Dante's Inferno. Stupid.
2499000	2501000	I don't know about the game itself
2501000	2503000	Anyhow let's get into some gaming news
2503000	2505000	From the now. Loki please start us off
2505000	2507000	Yes so
2507000	2509000	Sony decided it was an awesome idea
2509000	2511000	To go ahead and add
2511000	2513000	Some
2513000	2515000	Ads to their
2515000	2517000	Game Wipeout HD
2517000	2519000	And these would be you know little commercials
2519000	2521000	That would play before your races
2521000	2523000	And what not
2523000	2525000	What's interesting though is
2525000	2527000	The ads that they have
2527000	2529000	Actually increase the load time
2529000	2531000	From
2531000	2533000	Basically like
2533000	2535000	8 seconds to 19 seconds
2535000	2537000	Now
2537000	2539000	That doesn't seem like a whole lot but
2539000	2541000	That's still annoying that you have
2541000	2543000	To wait 19 seconds to get into
2543000	2545000	A race because they want you to watch an ad
2545000	2547000	For a game that you paid for
2547000	2549000	Already
2549000	2551000	Thankfully enough people bitched
2551000	2553000	And so they went ahead
2553000	2555000	And got rid of those ads
2555000	2557000	Or at least that one ad that was that long
2557000	2559000	But still though
2559000	2561000	I mean come on
2561000	2563000	Adding ads after the fact because
2563000	2565000	They want some more money
2565000	2567000	I'm sorry I can understand if you want to do that for like
2567000	2569000	A free version of the game that may be ad supported
2569000	2571000	But if I bought this game
2571000	2573000	I don't want to have to
2573000	2575000	Pay extra
2575000	2577000	I don't want to have to wait extra
2577000	2579000	Seconds or whatever to play my levels
2579000	2581000	Just because you want to make a few extra bucks
2581000	2583000	Running a State Farm ad
2583000	2585000	Or something like that
2585000	2587000	The ad had nothing to do
2587000	2589000	You know what's funny
2589000	2591000	I actually own Wipeout HD but I haven't played it in so long
2591000	2593000	I totally missed this
2593000	2595000	State Farm? Really?
2595000	2597000	Like what gamer is going to be sitting there
2597000	2599000	Playing Wipeout HD going
2599000	2601000	Damn I was just thinking I need life insurance
2601000	2603000	I mean really?
2603000	2605000	Well the races are pretty dangerous and if you die
2605000	2607000	As much as I do in that game
2607000	2609000	It's fake!
2609000	2611000	Exactly but still I have to wait real time
2611000	2613000	I don't know
2613000	2615000	I think it's fucked up though that they can go ahead
2615000	2617000	And inject ads into a game
2617000	2619000	That you've already bought that didn't have ads
2619000	2621000	You know the billboards
2621000	2623000	In certain games you know like
2623000	2625000	Burnout and stuff that's fine
2625000	2627000	Whatever you know I'm not going to get bent out of shape
2627000	2629000	By that because it doesn't really affect my game
2629000	2631000	I drive past it so fast I don't give a crap
2631000	2633000	You know um
2633000	2635000	Same with like Crackdown they have the same thing
2635000	2637000	You know how like some games will have like
2637000	2639000	Especially like the sports games will have the
2639000	2641000	You know such and such sponsored
2641000	2643000	Like you know Wheaties sponsored
2643000	2645000	Car garage or something you know or
2645000	2647000	You know something like that where like a logo is inserted
2647000	2649000	Suddenly in the game
2649000	2651000	I see that kind of crap on TV although you know
2651000	2653000	I don't like the fact that I pay for it
2653000	2655000	I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this
2655000	2657000	Because this is very in your face
2657000	2659000	Captive audience that's the problem
2659000	2661000	It makes you a captive audience to these commercials
2661000	2663000	It's like those ads in the bathroom stall
2663000	2665000	It's just
2665000	2667000	It's just that they do
2667000	2669000	Do it after the fact you know
2669000	2671000	It kind of devalues your game
2671000	2673000	You know people might not purchase this game
2673000	2675000	Because it has a 20 second load time
2675000	2677000	Or you know you have to watch it
2677000	2679000	Ad for State Farm
2679000	2681000	DarkSakura I don't
2681000	2683000	You know unlike you I don't get mad at the
2683000	2685000	Ads in the bathroom because
2685000	2687000	You know again unlike you
2687000	2689000	If I don't like the ad I can always piss on it
2691000	2693000	Well no it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom
2693000	2695000	That I don't like it's this thing that they do at my work
2695000	2697000	With these little security posters
2697000	2699000	That they put in the bathroom stall
2699000	2701000	Which I'm glad I haven't had a look
2701000	2703000	The hell is that big brother is watching you poo?
2703000	2705000	What is that?
2705000	2707000	It's like give out confidential information at work blah blah blah
2707000	2709000	Don't talk about this blah blah
2709000	2711000	Security risk blah blah blah
2711000	2713000	And they look like stupid motivational posters
2713000	2715000	But not really
2715000	2717000	And I hate that more
2717000	2719000	Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick
2719000	2721000	Yay tangents
2721000	2723000	The dates back to high school you love my tangents
2723000	2725000	Admit it
2725000	2727000	There was once this kid
2727000	2729000	That ran for student government
2729000	2731000	When I was in high school and I think he was running for
2731000	2733000	Like I don't know like they used to
2733000	2735000	Like a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they
2735000	2737000	Called it he would basically be the host of all the pep rallies
2737000	2739000	Biggest loser
2739000	2741000	Okay biggest loser was what he was running for
2741000	2743000	And his campaign
2743000	2745000	You know he put up a bunch of posters and stuff
2745000	2747000	But in the men's bathroom he actually put up posters
2747000	2749000	In the urinals
2749000	2751000	And what have you and it actually said
2751000	2753000	You hold the future in your hands
2753000	2755000	And vote next Friday
2759000	2761000	I actually thought that was kind of creative
2761000	2763000	That's brilliant actually
2763000	2765000	Oh my god
2765000	2767000	And now he works for EA creating failed
2767000	2769000	You know advertisement
2769000	2771000	Oh I don't keep in touch with the assholes
2771000	2773000	From high school except the ones I liked
2773000	2775000	Who knows what that asshole's doing
2775000	2777000	But you know I just thought that was funny
2777000	2779000	That actually is pretty funny
2779000	2781000	Here's what I think they should do with these ads
2781000	2783000	And I think it's fine
2783000	2785000	If you want to place the ads in here
2785000	2787000	But I think that they should have to spend
2787000	2789000	The time to make the ads
2789000	2791000	Seem like it fits in this universe
2791000	2793000	For example like
2793000	2795000	You know the movie Running Man or you know
2795000	2797000	Fast and Furious
2797000	2799000	On DVD and Blu-ray or something
2799000	2801000	Not even necessarily that like
2801000	2803000	Okay wipe out HD
2803000	2805000	Let's make it, it can be a state farm ad
2805000	2807000	But have them like ensuring like these space
2807000	2809000	Vehicles or something like that
2809000	2811000	It fits in like the universe
2811000	2813000	It fits in everything but it's actually
2813000	2815000	Still an ad for state farm
2815000	2817000	It's just like you know
2817000	2819000	What was it? Demolition Man
2819000	2821000	The other Sylvester Stallone movie
2821000	2823000	That sucked was Sandra Bullock
2823000	2825000	No the one with Sandra Bullock was Demolition Man
2825000	2827000	Oh it was Demolition Man
2827000	2829000	It's like Demolition Man with like Taco Bell
2829000	2831000	You know where it's like a restaurant
2831000	2833000	But it still fits in their universe
2833000	2835000	You know you could do something like that
2835000	2837000	But just make it fit in the game
2837000	2839000	It's something ridiculous like you know
2839000	2841000	The 2009 Honda Civic
2841000	2843000	Or something like that in a futuristic
2843000	2845000	Racing game that takes place in the year 3000
2845000	2847000	No one fucking cares about your thousand year old car
2847000	2849000	But what about the point that you're sitting there
2849000	2851000	Making me wait, you're increasing my
2851000	2853000	Low times in this game
2853000	2855000	To be a captive audience to watch this
2855000	2857000	Ad on a game I paid for
2857000	2859000	I mean granted what, Wipeout HD
2859000	2861000	Is only about 10, 15 bucks
2861000	2863000	I can't even remember how much I paid for it
2863000	2865000	It's not an expensive game but the fact is I did still pay
2865000	2867000	For it and also I just don't like
2867000	2869000	The fact that they snuck all this shit in after the fact
2869000	2871000	After the reviewers got to
2871000	2873000	Copy it and after I mean this
2873000	2875000	Is where the fact that you can patch games
2875000	2877000	After the fact is kind of dangerous
2877000	2879000	Like what the hell is this
2879000	2881000	Really I mean
2881000	2883000	What's to say they're not going to go back and patch
2883000	2885000	Other games to suddenly throw in advertising
2885000	2887000	You know surprise
2887000	2889000	It's just low
2889000	2891000	Because then
2891000	2893000	You know when the game is reviewed and all the
2893000	2895000	Previews go out
2895000	2897000	This has to be breaking a law of some sort
2897000	2899000	I don't know how, it has to be
2899000	2901000	Like it's just shady, you're raping my eyes
2901000	2903000	You are raping my eyes
2903000	2905000	And I am unwilling
2905000	2907000	It's just weird
2907000	2909000	Unconsensual eye porn
2909000	2911000	Yes this is unconsensual eye fucking
2911000	2913000	That's what this is, thank you Sony
2913000	2915000	Here's the thing though
2915000	2917000	Poor State Farm because you know
2917000	2919000	They probably just buy out of some company
2919000	2921000	It's not even State Farm
2921000	2923000	It's not even State Farm
2923000	2925000	Don't blame State Farm for this
2925000	2927000	Just remember State Farm is there
2927000	2929000	State Farm is everywhere
2929000	2931000	Apparently even in Wipeout HD
2931000	2933000	So there you go
2933000	2935000	Hey at least it's not another
2935000	2937000	Fucking Axe commercial or something
2937000	2939000	Like that
2939000	2941000	Yeah, comments from chat
2941000	2943000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com
2943000	2945000	GameGuru says if ads are in my game
2945000	2947000	It needs to be either flavor or cheaper
2947000	2949000	Tigerclaw says
2949000	2951000	I think the ads came after the Fury
2951000	2953000	Add-on pack for Wipeout HD
2953000	2955000	And continues to say maybe if you buy the regular
2955000	2957000	Wipeout HD without the add-ons it doesn't have the
2957000	2959000	Ads. I never noticed them
2959000	2961000	I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed
2961000	2963000	The ads but I didn't play it in the last three weeks
2963000	2965000	And just to be
2965000	2967000	Clear the ads are gone now right?
2967000	2969000	They were patched out right?
2969000	2971000	Well they're not patched out but they're working with the company
2971000	2973000	Now I think that ad is gone
2973000	2975000	But they're working with them now so that
2975000	2977000	Basically the ads are shorter and they don't
2977000	2979000	Interfere with the load time or something like that
2979000	2981000	Is what they're saying. They're not seeing that the
2981000	2983000	Ads are going away they're just saying oh we're working with
2983000	2985000	This company because we fucked up
2985000	2987000	Or they fucked up by making the ad
2987000	2989000	Too long or something
2989000	2991000	So basically they're saying hey
2991000	2993000	It's not that we're getting rid of the advertising
2993000	2995000	We're just trying to find a way to keep it into
2995000	2997000	The eight second window basically
2997000	2999000	It's just I don't know it's shady
2999000	3001000	Yeah
3001000	3003000	I mean I expect those types of ads
3003000	3005000	On like let's say like a pogo.com
3005000	3007000	Type of website which are like if you've
3007000	3009000	Never visited this website it's just a ton of casual
3009000	3011000	Games it's all middle aged
3011000	3013000	Crisis women games and I love
3013000	3015000	Them like you've got like Boggle
3015000	3017000	And Scrabble and like all this stuff on there
3017000	3019000	I have no problem with them doing like a free version
3019000	3021000	Of this game or something. Yeah but they're all free and you
3021000	3023000	Expect that you're gonna have to sit there and look at an ad
3023000	3025000	For you know Metamucil in between
3025000	3027000	You know games or what have you but
3027000	3029000	Or Special K
3029000	3031000	That's the big one. I love Special K
3031000	3033000	It's delicious
3033000	3035000	Special K is like
3035000	3037000	Food of the lifetime network
3037000	3039000	I'm very pissed off that they
3039000	3041000	Really focus the demographic
3041000	3043000	To chicks okay
3043000	3045000	Fuck games for a minute this is more important
3045000	3047000	Than any other revelation that's come out
3047000	3049000	About ads and games. Fuck that whole thing for a minute
3049000	3051000	Loki
3051000	3053000	Loves
3053000	3055000	Chick cereal. True story. No I love
3055000	3057000	Special K. The fact that they're like saying
3057000	3059000	It's like oh chick cereal
3059000	3061000	That's unfair. That is really unfair
3061000	3063000	That's just like Captain Crunch and they're saying
3063000	3065000	That it's like pirate cereal or kid's cereal
3065000	3067000	I'm sorry I still like it
3067000	3069000	It's good. It's alright
3069000	3071000	I mean if you're gonna eat like healthy cereal
3071000	3073000	At least it's not like Total or something like that
3073000	3075000	You know which is like old people's cereal
3075000	3077000	I like Total. I used to eat that
3077000	3079000	When I was five. Or like
3079000	3081000	I don't even know if you remember this
3081000	3083000	Product 19. Yes
3083000	3085000	I remember that. Yeah that's almost like
3085000	3087000	Special K. Because if you even say mini wheats
3087000	3089000	Or old people food I'm gonna come over there and beat you
3089000	3091000	Mini wheats are freaking amazing
3091000	3093000	I like Crispix too
3093000	3095000	Crispix is pretty damn good
3095000	3097000	I'm the person with all brands
3097000	3099000	Sitting up there in my cabinet
3099000	3101000	No but it's alright
3101000	3103000	Instead of eating you know like
3103000	3105000	Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles
3105000	3107000	Or Captain Crunch I'm eating
3107000	3109000	Special K because you know what at least
3109000	3111000	That's not too bad for me and
3111000	3113000	It tastes alright. I don't have to put sugar on it
3113000	3115000	It's not like corn flakes which
3115000	3117000	That could be hit or miss
3117000	3119000	I am amazed
3119000	3121000	At the vast of knowledge some of our listeners
3121000	3123000	Have of the show. AlphaKananagram
3123000	3125000	In chat says to quote from guys on a show
3125000	3127000	Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge
3127000	3129000	Radio when it was a station
3129000	3131000	Like it was like on Thursday nights or something
3131000	3133000	I did that with my old roommate Xfer. It's been off the air
3133000	3135000	For like four years. But says this quote
3135000	3137000	Sky thinks Special K's
3137000	3139000	Secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice
3139000	3141000	Did I say that?
3141000	3143000	You made that up. I did not say that
3143000	3145000	Did I really?
3145000	3147000	From experience I can tell you
3147000	3149000	That I don't think pussy juice is in
3149000	3151000	Special K
3151000	3153000	Well how would that attract women too?
3153000	3155000	Well lesbians maybe
3155000	3157000	But you know
3157000	3159000	It's not bad. It's just the thing is
3159000	3161000	The only thing I don't like about Special K
3161000	3163000	Because first off they don't have
3163000	3165000	Mazes and little stupid dumb
3165000	3167000	Puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles
3167000	3169000	And you know
3169000	3171000	Captain Crunch does. But they have like you know
3171000	3173000	All this breast health
3173000	3175000	Awareness crap and like
3175000	3177000	You can lose you know
3177000	3179000	Inches off your waistline
3179000	3181000	Or something like that if you do the Special K
3181000	3183000	Diet and crap
3183000	3185000	I'm like I'm sorry. I eat your cereal and I lose
3185000	3187000	No weight whatsoever
3187000	3189000	But then again they want you like
3189000	3191000	McNuggets don't help
3191000	3193000	But they also want you to have it with skim milk
3193000	3195000	Because that's like disgusting
3195000	3197000	Might as well eat cardboard or something
3197000	3199000	I don't know
3199000	3201000	I'm sorry. I'm sorry to get off topic
3201000	3203000	But I just we had to have the Special K
3203000	3205000	Chat on this show because I think we've never had
3205000	3207000	It on the main show and it's been like seven years
3207000	3209000	And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long
3209000	3211000	It's good
3211000	3213000	I mean it's
3213000	3215000	I don't know I go back to Captain
3215000	3217000	Crunch every now and then but Captain Crunch is sharp
3217000	3219000	I mean it's seriously like for the record
3219000	3221000	I hate Special K
3221000	3223000	For the record I hate Captain Crunch
3223000	3225000	I love Special K
3225000	3227000	I like fiber cereals. Okay I grew up on Grape Nuts
3227000	3229000	And Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran
3229000	3231000	I hate marshmallows
3231000	3233000	And you have a smooth bowel movement every day
3233000	3235000	Shut up
3235000	3237000	The only kids cereal that I ever
3237000	3239000	Liked was Frosted Mini Wheats
3239000	3241000	And I still to this day it's my favorite cereal
3241000	3243000	In the universe and Rice Krispies
3243000	3245000	Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me
3245000	3247000	Oh I'll eat that stuff dry
3247000	3249000	Out of the box
3249000	3251000	I hate Cheerios
3251000	3253000	You know what else is good too that I can't stop eating
3253000	3255000	Once I get some?
3255000	3257000	Golden Grahams
3257000	3259000	You can still get Golden Grahams I just had some the other day
3259000	3261000	I know they're awesome
3261000	3263000	Here's the thing though it's funny you say
3263000	3265000	I can actually eat it dry
3265000	3267000	I only eat cereal dry like I hate milk that much
3267000	3269000	I don't eat cereal with milk
3269000	3271000	See Special K that would taste awful dry
3271000	3273000	I can't stand Special K
3273000	3277000	Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me
3277000	3279000	It is that disgusting
3279000	3281000	It's gross
3281000	3283000	Alright anyhow
3283000	3285000	Oh yeah so the ads and games
3285000	3287000	That idea
3287000	3289000	Unless you run an ad for Special K then Loki won't mind anymore
3289000	3291000	Alright
3291000	3293000	Let's see let's move on with some more news
3293000	3295000	And talking about Netflix a little bit
3295000	3297000	And Netflix of course streaming has been
3297000	3299000	Huge on the Xbox 360
3299000	3301000	It's rumored once again
3301000	3303000	And it seems like this rumor comes up
3303000	3305000	Every few months or so ever since Netflix
3305000	3307000	At the Xbox 360
3307000	3309000	But apparently an industry executive
3309000	3311000	Familiar with Netflix plans
3311000	3313000	Has talked to the website Multichannel
3313000	3315000	That the company's streaming service
3315000	3317000	Is soon coming
3317000	3319000	To the iPhone or iPod touch
3319000	3321000	As well as the Wii
3321000	3323000	By the way that doesn't mean you're gonna get to watch
3323000	3325000	Netflix on 3G that would be way too much
3325000	3327000	Of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth
3327000	3329000	And you know
3329000	3331000	Boy oh boy
3331000	3333000	AT&T the
3333000	3335000	I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T
3335000	3337000	Because they are just like
3337000	3339000	They're putting the clamp down on everything
3339000	3341000	That was other big news that came up even though it's not game related
3341000	3343000	The whole thing like Google Apps
3343000	3345000	Maybe the T stands for twat
3345000	3347000	Getting shut down by
3347000	3349000	Assholes, twats, and turds
3349000	3351000	There you go
3351000	3353000	So asshole, twat, and turd
3353000	3355000	Isn't gonna let you use their 3G network
3355000	3357000	Because it's way too much
3357000	3359000	Of their precious bandwidth
3359000	3361000	So you'd only be able to use Netflix over the
3361000	3363000	Streaming
3363000	3365000	Over Wi-Fi
3365000	3367000	Which makes sense
3367000	3369000	I mean it would be horrible quality over 3G anyway
3369000	3371000	It takes forever as it is
3371000	3373000	But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've
3373000	3375000	Been hinting at that for a long long long long time
3375000	3377000	But
3377000	3379000	Nothing about
3379000	3381000	Sony Playstation 3
3381000	3383000	And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting
3383000	3385000	Because Apple
3385000	3387000	If I'm not mistaking kind of has
3387000	3389000	Their own thing I mean you can't see
3389000	3391000	They don't have a Netflix type service per se
3391000	3393000	But they do have the movie rental
3393000	3395000	That you can do on
3395000	3397000	The Apple and you can play that
3397000	3399000	On your phone
3399000	3401000	So I would see something like this getting shot down
3401000	3403000	Just the same way the Google
3403000	3405000	What was the Google Latitude app got shot down
3405000	3407000	Google Voice that was the big one
3407000	3409000	That got shot down by Apple as well
3409000	3411000	By Assholes, turds, and twats
3413000	3415000	There's other phones out there
3415000	3417000	That do
3417000	3419000	Yes but realize whether you like it or not
3419000	3421000	The iPhone is the one everybody
3421000	3423000	Seems to have right now
3423000	3425000	It is the most popular phone
3425000	3427000	What's second behind it is the Blackberry
3427000	3429000	Probably
3429000	3431000	Which is also an AT&T
3431000	3433000	Name too
3433000	3435000	Or AT&T brand too
3435000	3437000	I'm trying to read some comments
3437000	3439000	In the chat room let's see Decipher says
3439000	3441000	Atrocious telephones and technology
3441000	3443000	Frisbee says all twats talking
3443000	3445000	So there you go
3445000	3447000	And Misty says
3447000	3449000	It's a fucking cheap phone
3449000	3451000	Hey I love my iPhone
3451000	3453000	Bad bad bad
3453000	3455000	Well I mean I'm just saying
3455000	3457000	That it actually is
3457000	3459000	Really good
3459000	3461000	I mean seriously
3461000	3463000	It's a really good technology
3463000	3465000	So whatever
3465000	3467000	Yes and Tigerclass says
3467000	3469000	Let's not forget there is an all games app on the iPhone
3469000	3471000	And it lets you let OLR on it
3471000	3473000	Yeah I downloaded it too
3473000	3475000	Did that come out in the past couple weeks? I guess it did
3475000	3477000	If you haven't checked out the all games app search for that
3477000	3479000	Cause it lets you, it's free
3479000	3481000	And you can tune into all games radio anywhere
3481000	3483000	Plug in your ears, plug in the headphones and go
3483000	3485000	I always plug in my ears
3485000	3487000	Plug it in a car transmitter and go
3487000	3489000	Like Mr. Potato Head
3489000	3491000	Alright
3491000	3493000	So there you go Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone
3493000	3495000	I think it's inevitable
3495000	3497000	It's probably gonna come to
3497000	3499000	If AT&T will let it
3499000	3501000	It'll come to the iPhone
3501000	3503000	And Apple also
3503000	3505000	But I don't know about the Wii
3505000	3507000	I don't know
3507000	3509000	For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kinda like
3509000	3511000	It doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix
3511000	3513000	They could do it
3513000	3515000	I think you could do it
3515000	3517000	I mean especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan
3517000	3519000	Why not
3519000	3521000	You could get the Netflix channel
3521000	3523000	I mean honestly though do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix
3523000	3525000	I mean granted there is some stuff I watch
3525000	3527000	It's mostly TV shows
3527000	3529000	We actually cancelled ours
3529000	3531000	I have Netflix and I find that the most stuff I watch
3531000	3533000	Is TV shows
3533000	3535000	Like NBC has a lot of stuff on there
3535000	3537000	But we were doing that
3537000	3539000	But TV shows is the thing I'll stream the most
3539000	3541000	And oddly enough
3541000	3543000	And I'm surprised you cancelled because of this dark saga
3543000	3545000	BBC everything is on there
3545000	3547000	That I know but there's still behind on
3547000	3549000	There's still behind on a few things
3549000	3551000	It's old BBC stuff
3551000	3553000	You want BBC stuff from the 70s and 80s it's all there
3553000	3555000	I don't know if Monty Python was there but like tons and tons of stuff
3555000	3557000	They don't have any old tomorrow people though
3557000	3559000	I mean not the old stuff but like the series I was wanting to watch
3559000	3561000	But a lot of it is real shit
3561000	3563000	I'm gonna tell you there's a lot of real shit
3563000	3565000	I mean some cool indie films but a lot of crap
3565000	3567000	Diversity is your friend
3567000	3569000	You can stream Hulu
3569000	3571000	You have G4 on there
3571000	3573000	YouTube stuff
3573000	3575000	Or in my case pirated videos
3575000	3577000	Alright well let's move on
3577000	3581000	Obviously Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year but nothing now
3581000	3583000	Dark Sakura
3583000	3585000	Well something that's actually really good for
3585000	3589000	For people who have an Xbox in the United States
3589000	3593000	Is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support
3593000	3595000	The option is
3595000	3599000	You can buy your Xbox points using PayPal
3599000	3605000	You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com
3605000	3607000	Find
3607000	3611000	There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts
3611000	3613000	And then
3613000	3615000	But it really only works
3615000	3617000	Through the website not through the console
3617000	3619000	And it's right now only in America
3619000	3623000	In other words any way you want to give us your money we'll take it
3623000	3627000	Hey it's convenient
3627000	3631000	Especially if you sit with your laptop by you when you play Guitar Hero and want the song
3631000	3633000	I don't know
3633000	3635000	Not Guitar Hero
3635000	3637000	Never Guitar Hero
3637000	3641000	Maybe it's just me but I don't understand how this is like super beneficial and provides more accessibility
3641000	3645000	But maybe that's because I have my Xbox tied to my debit card
3645000	3647000	So when I go on there and buy the
3647000	3649000	Virtual Bucks
3649000	3651000	I don't mind
3651000	3653000	I mean we're talking about Microsoft
3653000	3655000	They're not going to give out my information
3655000	3657000	My bank protects me from any violation of information
3657000	3659000	So I'm fine
3659000	3661000	But I'm not real worried about that
3661000	3663000	I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth
3663000	3665000	Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade
3665000	3667000	I was buying everything and it was very tempting
3667000	3669000	But I've gotten a lot better at that
3669000	3673000	But I don't see how PayPal
3673000	3675000	Helps that
3675000	3677000	You're going to run everything through PayPal
3677000	3679000	I mean isn't giving your credit card to PayPal just as bad as giving it to Microsoft?
3679000	3681000	I guess that's what I don't get
3681000	3687000	It's really just as though I think for having another option
3687000	3689000	It's like when you buy stuff on eBay
3689000	3691000	You might be able to use your credit card
3691000	3695000	But it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal
3695000	3699000	Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way
3699000	3701000	But I mean it's really just giving people another option
3701000	3703000	And I don't see any harm in it
3703000	3707000	Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account
3707000	3711000	And you can use it to track your purchases that way too
3711000	3713000	So why not?
3713000	3715000	I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online
3715000	3717000	Just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff
3717000	3719000	They have ripped me off in the past
3719000	3721000	Like there was an error one time
3721000	3723000	Where I paid for something that was $50
3723000	3725000	And they charged me for $500
3725000	3727000	And got a bunch of overdraft fees and stuff like that
3727000	3729000	Because they're super awesome
3729000	3733000	And thankfully though the guy that received the $500
3733000	3735000	Refunded me my money
3735000	3739000	But they take a portion off of each thing
3739000	3743000	But if the whole reason why you want to use PayPal is because you're under 18
3743000	3745000	And you don't have a credit card
3745000	3747000	Dude go to the store and go buy a card
3747000	3750000	I mean seriously if you want the points that badly
3750000	3754000	Just go to the store, pay the tax on it
3754000	3756000	And just go buy a card
3756000	3759000	And just redeem it online
3759000	3762000	You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards right?
3762000	3764000	You can get a prepaid Visa card
3764000	3766000	But there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap
3766000	3770000	Because if you don't have a credit card
3770000	3774000	You're going to have to tie your bank account to PayPal
3774000	3778000	And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways
3778000	3782000	I mean it's been a while since I did that
3782000	3786000	But it's just easier if you're under 18
3786000	3788000	Just go buy a card at the store
3788000	3792000	Hell you can go to your favorite game store or whatever
3792000	3794000	Trade in some games or trade in crap
3794000	3798000	And then get store credit and trade it in for a card
3798000	3802000	I've done that too because then that way it's a little easier
3802000	3804000	A little cheaper
3804000	3806000	But I don't know
3806000	3809000	It seems like good that they're supporting it
3809000	3811000	They give someone another option but I don't think it's a good option
3811000	3813000	Good for them
3813000	3815000	I guess the more ways the better
3815000	3817000	I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal
3817000	3819000	Or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever
3819000	3821000	But I don't know
3821000	3823000	Not something I really plan on using
3823000	3825000	But see even with that though
3825000	3827000	Yeah you can build up money from PayPal
3827000	3829000	But it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account
3829000	3831000	One click of a button and it takes like two days
3831000	3833000	Done
3833000	3835000	So that's kind of a lame excuse if that's
3835000	3837000	Oh I got all this money built up in PayPal
3837000	3839000	Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too
3839000	3841000	Yeah they would love it free just to spend that PayPal money
3841000	3843000	On stuff that their company is selling
3843000	3845000	Or transactions through them
3845000	3847000	Because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction
3847000	3849000	And are they going to be charging you tax?
3849000	3851000	Because that would be something interesting too
3851000	3853000	I don't know
3853000	3855000	I guess it depends on what state you live in
3855000	3857000	True
3857000	3861000	So other interesting stuff
3861000	3867000	That Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got
3867000	3869000	I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test
3869000	3871000	I can't imagine this working full time
3871000	3873000	But their new thing is
3873000	3875000	Why buy used when you can buy new?
3875000	3879000	Best Buy will now match prices of new video games
3879000	3883000	At used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy
3883000	3885000	So basically you go to GameStop
3885000	3887000	You say okay
3887000	3889000	I see this used game for five bucks cheaper
3889000	3893000	Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy
3893000	3895000	Get a new game
3895000	3897000	Call this GameStop to see
3897000	3899000	Check the price and done
3899000	3901000	You get the new game for the price of the used game
3901000	3903000	Awesome plan but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off this
3903000	3905000	Because they're going to be losing money left and right
3905000	3907000	Especially if
3907000	3909000	Somebody at the GameStop or something like that
3909000	3911000	Is a real dick
3911000	3913000	Oh yeah we're charging $20 for that game
3913000	3915000	Get a bunch of the game
3915000	3917000	Go sell it back to GameStop
3917000	3919000	For more than $20
3919000	3921000	Now something that should be stressed though
3921000	3923000	Is that this is only available
3923000	3925000	In one certain market right now
3925000	3927000	This is not something
3927000	3929000	You can't run into Best Buy after hearing this
3929000	3931000	And expect them to do it
3931000	3933000	West Jordan Utah
3933000	3935000	So they picked a really small freaking market to do it
3935000	3937000	So to our listeners in West Jordan Utah
3937000	3939000	All one of you
3939000	3941000	If we even have that many
3941000	3943000	You can go check this out
3943000	3945000	But at the same time
3945000	3947000	You kind of said it yourself Loki
3947000	3949000	The price of a used game
3949000	3951000	At GameStop is typically only $5 under that of a new game
3951000	3953000	And Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off
3953000	3955000	On all their new games
3955000	3957000	Is that really that bad of a loss?
3957000	3959000	If they can create loyalty
3959000	3961000	Because that's a big big thing
3961000	3963000	I think a lot of people build up loyalty
3963000	3965000	To one certain place to buy their games
3965000	3967000	And here's the other thing too
3967000	3969000	About that
3969000	3971000	You see retailers like this
3971000	3973000	Basically they can sell a game at cost
3973000	3975000	And it's still beneficial for them
3975000	3977000	If they're able to sell enough units
3977000	3979000	Because they get back end rebates
3979000	3981000	To buy X amount of pieces
3981000	3983000	Or whatever
3983000	3985000	Like a company like Activision or EA
3985000	3987000	Or whatever will give them money
3987000	3989000	Whether that be ad dollars
3989000	3991000	Or just incentives
3991000	3993000	Or whatever
3993000	3995000	To get them to buy more
3995000	3997000	So what they could do with this
3997000	3999000	Is if they are able to launch this full scale
3999000	4001000	Really there would be no reason
4001000	4003000	For you to go to a GameStop
4003000	4005000	Or GameCrazy
4005000	4007000	To buy a used game
4007000	4009000	Or basically the same price
4009000	4011000	Now the question is
4011000	4013000	Are they going to also count the discounts
4013000	4015000	That you get with your GameStop card
4015000	4017000	Are you going to be able to
4017000	4019000	Get the extra 10% off
4019000	4021000	Probably not
4021000	4023000	I would say just assume no on that
4023000	4025000	And store credit
4025000	4027000	Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now
4027000	4029000	But isn't that something else they're testing?
4029000	4031000	Yeah the kiosks are testing that
4031000	4033000	But right now they're not
4033000	4035000	So they're not really doing
4035000	4037000	Any trades yet
4037000	4039000	But it still
4039000	4041000	Helps and then they got to do
4041000	4043000	More of the gift with purchase stuff
4043000	4045000	Because people seem to eat that crap up
4045000	4047000	Even though a lot of the incentives
4047000	4049000	Suck
4049000	4051000	But at the same time
4051000	4053000	And this goes for both Best Buy and GameStop
4053000	4055000	They got to fucking watch
4055000	4057000	The prices of their goddamn accessories
4057000	4059000	That they're selling because a lot of stuff
4059000	4061000	If you don't watch it they're actually selling it over retail
4061000	4063000	Like $5 over retail
4063000	4065000	For example
4065000	4067000	Wii Motion Plus at GameStops
4067000	4069000	$5 more than what it should actually cost
4069000	4071000	I was an idiot and bought it
4071000	4073000	Because I have store credit
4073000	4075000	So I didn't give a crap
4075000	4077000	But if I was more cautious
4077000	4079000	Then yes you could go buy it for $20 instead of $25
4079000	4081000	Same with some of the accessories
4081000	4083000	I know on the 360
4083000	4085000	Like their video cables
4085000	4087000	Or $10 over retail or $5 over retail
4087000	4089000	So you got to watch that shit
4089000	4091000	And they got to stop doing that
4091000	4093000	On top of all that if you're cautious
4093000	4095000	Then yeah I don't see why this would be a bad deal
4095000	4097000	If you're just interested in getting a used game
4097000	4099000	And you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off
4099000	4101000	I got to read this comment from chat
4101000	4103000	Because it's really funny
4103000	4105000	Brad from Pod Culture says
4105000	4107000	They play video games in Utah
4107000	4109000	To which Rama follows up with
4109000	4111000	Brad yep they play Super Mormon Brothers 2
4111000	4113000	Oh I'm sure Utah listeners appreciate that one
4113000	4115000	Alright
4115000	4117000	I just like that idea for a game
4117000	4119000	Super Mormon Brothers 2
4119000	4121000	There's a ROM hack somewhere
4121000	4123000	Surely there's a ROM hack somewhere
4123000	4125000	Well hey I like cheaper games
4125000	4127000	No matter how it happens
4127000	4129000	But let's not count out what GameStop might be doing
4129000	4131000	Not necessarily in retaliation
4131000	4133000	But certainly all the companies are trying to think
4133000	4135000	Of ways to one up each other
4135000	4137000	And GameStop is apparently looking for a new
4137000	4139000	Rewards program
4139000	4141000	Because you know the way it is right now
4141000	4143000	Is that they have what you get their little card
4143000	4145000	You get the 10% discount or whatever
4145000	4147000	10% more on trades
4147000	4149000	You get some magazine I've never read in my life
4149000	4151000	Game Informer is actually not bad
4151000	4153000	Yeah it's not a bad magazine
4153000	4155000	And the subscription price is cheaper than
4155000	4157000	Whatever
4157000	4159000	Honestly I couldn't tell you
4159000	4161000	I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine
4161000	4163000	Actually it was a couple weeks ago
4163000	4165000	I actually picked up a Barnes and Noble
4165000	4167000	It's a magazine out of the UK
4167000	4169000	Retro Gamer I think it's called
4169000	4171000	Oh that's good we have an issue with Retro Gamer
4171000	4173000	That was a pretty good one
4173000	4175000	But other than that I mean thanks to the internet
4175000	4177000	For the magazines
4177000	4179000	The reason I buy their card each year
4179000	4181000	One because the magazine subscription gives me something to do
4181000	4183000	Like to stare off in the space
4183000	4185000	At work sometimes
4185000	4187000	And because the extra
4187000	4189000	Trade in value that you get
4189000	4191000	It pays for the card
4191000	4193000	Within a few uses for me
4193000	4195000	That's the only reason I do it
4195000	4197000	It's basically a cost advantage for myself
4197000	4199000	Granted I could probably
4199000	4201000	Sell my games on eBay
4201000	4203000	Or whatever
4203000	4205000	I don't want to go through the fucking hassle
4205000	4207000	So that's my own choice
4207000	4209000	Whatever
4209000	4211000	Alright well apparently here's two versions
4211000	4213000	They're testing some different
4213000	4215000	Rewards versions
4215000	4217000	I'm not sure let's see where did this come from
4217000	4219000	It was a survey I see
4219000	4221000	They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in
4221000	4223000	And here was one
4223000	4225000	Take your game to the next level
4225000	4227000	With GameStop Rewards
4227000	4229000	So apparently if you sign up for this new
4229000	4231000	Free program
4231000	4233000	Sign up with your email address and so forth
4233000	4235000	If you do one purchase or trade in a year
4235000	4237000	You would get a birthday surprise
4237000	4239000	Meaning discounts on your birthday
4239000	4241000	Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas
4241000	4243000	Level two would be
4243000	4245000	Make any combination of five purchases
4245000	4247000	Or trades per year
4247000	4249000	You would get 20% bonus
4249000	4251000	Trade in credit because you're a power trader
4251000	4253000	I guess and you get early access
4253000	4255000	To purchase collector's editions of games
4255000	4257000	That's kind of interesting
4257000	4259000	And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release
4259000	4261000	That's retarded
4261000	4263000	Because you know what the early access
4263000	4265000	Collector's editions is?
4265000	4267000	You get the pre-order before everybody else
4267000	4269000	And then level three is
4269000	4271000	10 purchases or trade-ins a year
4271000	4273000	To get you know 25%
4273000	4275000	Bonus on trade-ins
4275000	4277000	Guaranteed access to exclusive in-game
4277000	4279000	Accessories and so forth
4279000	4281000	Let's see
4281000	4283000	And then there's another one that is just like a two
4283000	4285000	Level thing where if you do one purchase
4285000	4287000	Or trade in a year you get the birthday
4287000	4289000	Surprise but if you do 20 purchases
4289000	4291000	Or trade-ins a year you get the
4291000	4293000	Subscription to Game Informer you get the power
4293000	4295000	Trades you get guaranteed
4295000	4297000	In stock new games or free
4297000	4299000	Shipping that's kind of interesting too
4299000	4301000	So if they're out of your game they'll ship to your house for free
4301000	4303000	That's interesting early access to purchase
4303000	4305000	Collector's editions of games $5
4305000	4307000	Shipping of new titles shipped on day of release
4307000	4309000	And guaranteed access to
4309000	4311000	Exclusive in-game accessories etc.
4311000	4313000	So you know more incentive programs which I'm
4313000	4315000	Sure make some people excited but again it's
4315000	4317000	About building customer loyalty
4317000	4319000	Is huge you know
4319000	4321000	And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of
4321000	4323000	Making 20 trades because
4323000	4325000	You know
4325000	4327000	Once again it's cheap enough to where
4327000	4329000	$25 that will pay for
4329000	4331000	Itself especially with the extra 10%
4331000	4333000	On top of all that probably in
4333000	4335000	One use so
4335000	4337000	Why not why wouldn't you do that
4337000	4339000	Especially if you're buying games on a regular basis
4339000	4341000	You know why I've never signed up for their
4341000	4343000	Program and why I don't pre-order games
4343000	4345000	And I still stand by this I don't
4345000	4347000	Pre-order games because
4347000	4349000	I find that when the
4349000	4351000	Games are released because the companies
4351000	4353000	Are trying to one up each other if I pre-order
4353000	4355000	The game at GameStop or whatever put $5
4355000	4357000	Down it's going to come out and Best Buy is
4357000	4359000	Going to have a sale where you get a
4359000	4361000	$10 gift card if you buy the game or something
4361000	4363000	That's why I don't like to pre-order games because
4363000	4365000	I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see
4365000	4367000	What the competition is the day of release
4367000	4369000	And plus sometimes you see these really interesting things
4369000	4371000	Where GameStop gets
4371000	4373000	One little incentive game crazy gets
4373000	4375000	Another Best Buy gets another you know
4375000	4377000	Like all the companies get their own little
4377000	4379000	Free weapon or whatever
4379000	4381000	And I want to pick the one I like the best
4381000	4383000	I don't know I just that's my whole thing
4383000	4385000	I'm pre-ordering and joining these
4385000	4387000	Incentive programs and stuff I just really like to shop around
4387000	4389000	I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order
4389000	4391000	Collector's editions and that's if I'm buying
4391000	4393000	A collector's edition
4393000	4395000	Like Grand Theft Auto
4395000	4397000	Which we've got sitting right over there
4397000	4399000	Yeah
4399000	4401000	But that's it
4401000	4403000	I mean that's all I really would pre-order
4403000	4405000	I order most of my stuff through my work
4405000	4407000	Just because you know
4407000	4409000	I tend to get them early
4409000	4411000	D5T1 in chat says
4411000	4413000	Rob must be a Pepsi fan need to stick to a brand
4413000	4415000	Actually I am Pepsi is way better than Coke
4415000	4417000	Pepsi is way better than Coke
4417000	4419000	Only
4419000	4421000	And I've said this before
4421000	4423000	It's weird because Pepsi
4423000	4425000	It's better out of like
4425000	4427000	The can is good
4427000	4429000	And the bottle is okay
4429000	4431000	The tap is alright
4431000	4433000	Coke on the other hand tastes like shit
4433000	4435000	Out of a can
4435000	4437000	Tastes alright out of the bottle
4437000	4439000	Actually pretty good out of the tap
4439000	4441000	It's so weird
4441000	4443000	I can agree with that
4443000	4445000	I can agree with the tap changing
4445000	4447000	Like A&W out of the tap is so good
4447000	4449000	Yes
4449000	4451000	Can's alright if it's cold enough
4451000	4453000	But I will say this because
4453000	4455000	Before the Coke lovers start hating on me
4455000	4457000	Vanilla Coke was superior to
4457000	4459000	Vanilla Pepsi
4459000	4461000	They're both disgusting I'm sorry
4461000	4463000	Whatever I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap
4463000	4465000	The other day still
4465000	4467000	In the year 2009 at Rubio's
4467000	4469000	Yes I was floored
4469000	4471000	They were also one of the first places to have it in town
4471000	4473000	You know what else is good with A&W
4473000	4475000	Out of the jug
4475000	4477000	Like they actually sell it in milk
4477000	4479000	Jugs
4479000	4481000	Yes out of their stores
4481000	4483000	That's best
4483000	4485000	Let's go ahead and move on
4485000	4487000	And Dark Sakura
4487000	4489000	With some more news and we'll get into release dates
4489000	4491000	Well there's
4491000	4493000	A channel in the UK called Bravo
4493000	4495000	Which is completely has nothing to do
4495000	4497000	With our Bravo
4497000	4499000	That has a show out
4499000	4501000	Called Game Face
4501000	4503000	For casual gamers
4503000	4505000	Pretty much
4505000	4507000	You just watch
4507000	4509000	These guys play TV
4509000	4511000	Play video games
4511000	4513000	And they'll have some
4513000	4515000	Girl come out and be stupid
4515000	4517000	And then you get to see
4517000	4519000	Some game footage and then you hear
4519000	4521000	The people reviewing the games
4521000	4523000	Over the footage basically
4523000	4525000	What we've already had
4525000	4527000	Better people doing on
4527000	4529000	YouTube for free
4529000	4531000	You know
4531000	4533000	And
4533000	4535000	It just really seems like
4535000	4537000	It would be really boring to watch
4537000	4539000	Because
4539000	4541000	Usually anything that's got
4541000	4543000	Some type of corporate design behind it
4543000	4545000	Tends to get the imagination
4545000	4547000	Sucked out of whatever it could have been
4547000	4549000	Yeah I mean
4549000	4551000	True there's people that'll sit there
4551000	4553000	And watch other people play video games for a long time
4553000	4555000	I do when they're at my house
4555000	4557000	My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey
4557000	4559000	Even though he doesn't really play the game himself
4559000	4561000	He loves to just watch me kind of play through it
4561000	4563000	And see all the cinematic scenes and stuff
4563000	4565000	So it's kind of interesting that they're
4565000	4567000	Kind of making that a TV show
4567000	4569000	You know that they'll just kind of show
4569000	4571000	Five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff
4571000	4573000	Also you know this kind of tangent
4573000	4575000	Sorry but they have these interesting things on the
4575000	4577000	Comcast on demand
4577000	4579000	Where you can actually go in and they have these things
4579000	4581000	Called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something
4581000	4583000	And it's actually I don't know if it's G4
4583000	4585000	One of the other networks puts them on there
4585000	4587000	Because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right
4587000	4589000	But you can actually watch
4589000	4591000	In HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay
4591000	4593000	Of certain games
4593000	4595000	Around release time
4595000	4597000	To help you decide if you want to buy it
4597000	4599000	Or not I guess
4599000	4601000	Really get to see what it looks like
4601000	4603000	That's kind of interesting
4603000	4605000	I actually think that's a good idea
4605000	4607000	I think that's a really good idea to have that
4607000	4609000	Well my question is you know
4609000	4611000	We kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows
4611000	4613000	Come out and they're stupid
4613000	4615000	What video game TV show should they make
4615000	4617000	Do you think
4617000	4619000	How could they make a video game TV show
4619000	4621000	That's cool
4621000	4623000	They need to bring back the old school stuff
4623000	4625000	Where you have the person talking about the new games
4625000	4627000	That are coming out well I guess we're already
4627000	4629000	Doing that but you know
4629000	4631000	I think that
4631000	4633000	That's really what I'd like to
4633000	4635000	More see because it was really cool back in the day
4635000	4637000	Or you know like the
4637000	4639000	Video game related game shows
4639000	4641000	Not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of
4641000	4643000	But like the ones where the people had the Velcro best
4643000	4645000	And ran around that was kind of cool
4645000	4647000	StarCade and all that stuff
4647000	4649000	And I would like to see something like the
4649000	4651000	Screen Savers used to be
4651000	4653000	But more about video games
4653000	4655000	Which I know you might be thinking well isn't that Attack of the Show
4655000	4657000	I'm not really because that's kind of got that
4657000	4659000	Maxim Magazine spin on it basically
4659000	4661000	And you know that's not
4661000	4663000	All inclusive really of all the gamers
4663000	4665000	It's also annoying
4665000	4667000	I don't know I'm just
4667000	4669000	I'm a much bigger fan of what that
4669000	4671000	Show used to be than what it is now that's for sure
4671000	4673000	So I don't know
4673000	4675000	I kind of like the idea of a
4675000	4677000	Gaming kind of TV show by gamers
4677000	4679000	Who somewhat know what they're doing
4679000	4681000	I also would like to see kind of current
4681000	4683000	More current things I like the idea of
4683000	4685000	A daily show that you know
4685000	4687000	Is kind of current
4687000	4689000	Yeah
4689000	4691000	And really if you want to
4691000	4693000	Get reviews and everything
4693000	4695000	There's more amusing things to watch online
4695000	4697000	Like the Angry Video Game Nerd
4697000	4699000	And the one that
4699000	4701000	Oh god I can't remember what it is
4701000	4703000	The one that my husband watches all the time
4703000	4705000	That's kind of like that only older
4705000	4707000	And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched
4707000	4709000	He was drinking New Castle
4709000	4711000	It was pretty good
4711000	4713000	And somebody in chat says Orange Lounge TV maybe?
4713000	4715000	No
4715000	4717000	I don't know I think we might be
4717000	4719000	Getting too old it's a sad thing
4719000	4721000	Not too old he doesn't have enough time
4721000	4723000	Yeah it's true
4723000	4725000	I'd have to be getting paid for this
4725000	4727000	Exactly we'd have to all quit our jobs to do it
4727000	4729000	Yeah I would like to get paid
4729000	4731000	So I don't know
4731000	4733000	I honestly
4733000	4735000	Wouldn't even know where to begin with that
4735000	4737000	I'm not even going to think about it
4737000	4739000	Let's move on with some release dates
4739000	4741000	Low key
4741000	4743000	Well there's not a whole lot coming out in the US
4743000	4745000	Unfortunately it's a little bit of a slow time
4745000	4747000	But there is some big stuff this week
4747000	4749000	Including Madden NFL 10
4749000	4751000	Coming out this Friday
4751000	4753000	Pretty much can't expect that on
4753000	4755000	Every single system out there
4755000	4757000	Except for the DS I don't think it's on the DS this year
4757000	4759000	Fossil Fighter is on the DS
4759000	4761000	Actually today
4761000	4763000	Or tomorrow
4763000	4765000	I don't know I thought it was supposed to be today
4765000	4767000	Anyways tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo
4767000	4769000	Imagine Soccer Captain
4769000	4771000	Another crappy game from Ubisoft
4771000	4773000	That's on the DS
4773000	4775000	Active Life Extreme Challenge
4775000	4777000	It's the game that has
4777000	4779000	I don't know
4779000	4781000	Like a two player DDR mat or I guess
4781000	4783000	Kind of like a power pad
4783000	4785000	But it's for the Wii and it's
4785000	4787000	All the mini games you could possibly want
4787000	4789000	And that's available
4789000	4791000	Or not want is the case
4791000	4793000	We have a budget Fire Fighter sim
4793000	4795000	Real Heroes Fire Fighter
4795000	4797000	That's on the Wii
4797000	4799000	Also this week Core on the DS
4799000	4801000	From Graffiti Entertainment
4801000	4803000	Hopefully actually coming out this time
4803000	4805000	Because it's been delayed forever
4805000	4807000	ATV Quad Kings
4807000	4809000	On the Wii
4809000	4811000	It's a game from Zoo Games
4811000	4813000	And I can tell you this much it's gonna suck
4813000	4815000	Because it's just like all those other Destiny games
4815000	4817000	And they all suck
4817000	4819000	Let's see
4819000	4821000	Five Two coming out on PC
4821000	4823000	I don't know if that's a re-release or not
4823000	4827000	Phantom Brave Wii Meet Again on the Wii
4827000	4829000	That's actually pretty cool
4829000	4831000	If you're a Japanese RPG fan
4831000	4835000	And if you possibly want one
4835000	4837000	Even though you don't own Lips
4837000	4839000	They are selling the Lips Microphone
4839000	4841000	Separately now
4841000	4843000	You can purchase that this week
4843000	4845000	For the Xbox 360
4845000	4849000	And that's it
4849000	4851000	It's like I said
4851000	4853000	Slow week
4853000	4855000	It's also a slow week over in Japan
4855000	4857000	As we go take a look at the Japanese release dates
4857000	4859000	Really on the big systems
4859000	4861000	There's only one new game coming out
4861000	4863000	But it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game
4863000	4865000	And some folks may get a kick out of that
4865000	4867000	It's coming out on the Wii
4867000	4869000	Hagane no Reckon Jutsuji
4869000	4871000	Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsuki no Oji
4871000	4873000	Comes out
4873000	4875000	It's a game based off
4875000	4877000	Clearly the series Fullmetal Alchemist
4877000	4879000	Not sure what type of game it is
4879000	4881000	It looks to be like kind of an adventure-y
4881000	4883000	Not quite a role playing game
4883000	4885000	But a little more adventure-y with some little mini games
4885000	4887000	Built in like I see one where you're like shooting guys
4887000	4889000	With the buttons and stuff
4889000	4891000	So fans of that series may be into that
4891000	4893000	Otherwise that's really it on the big systems
4893000	4895000	If you go to the handhelds
4895000	4897000	You have a little bit coming out on the Nintendo DS
4897000	4899000	The localized version of Bolt comes out
4899000	4901000	From Disney Interactive
4901000	4903000	So Obuncha Derojun
4903000	4905000	Rikishi DS and Rika DS
4905000	4907000	Both come out this week
4907000	4909000	Sounds like a wrestling game
4909000	4911000	Or sumo game
4911000	4913000	Could be
4913000	4915000	But there's two different versions of it
4915000	4917000	And then lastly on the PSP there is a new game
4917000	4919000	Infinity Plus Portable comes out
4919000	4921000	And this is
4921000	4923000	I think a bunch of games
4923000	4925000	It's produced by Cyber Front
4925000	4927000	With different scenarios written by
4927000	4929000	Utsukoshi Kotaro
4929000	4931000	It's done scripts for famous adventure games
4931000	4933000	Like Memory Off
4933000	4935000	And it's part Danish simulation and part adventure
4935000	4937000	You have to rack your brains
4937000	4939000	To work your way out of pressing situations
4939000	4941000	Time leaps and messed up dimensions
4941000	4943000	Are just a few of your troubles
4943000	4945000	There on the PSP
4945000	4947000	That's really it for this week in Japan
4947000	4949000	Well for our friends in the UK
4949000	4951000	There's a few releases
4951000	4953000	On the 12th is Trials HD
4953000	4955000	On Xbox 360
4955000	4957000	Marvel vs Capcom 2
4957000	4959000	Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands
4959000	4961000	Both of those on the 13th
4961000	4963000	And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3
4963000	4965000	For PC and
4965000	4967000	Madden 10, whatever
4967000	4969000	That's it
4969000	4971000	And
4971000	4973000	Madden BLEH
4973000	4975000	Not your cup of tea, huh?
4975000	4977000	BLEH, barf
4977000	4979000	Um
4979000	4981000	So this is interesting
4981000	4983000	Sony has trademarked a new
4983000	4985000	Um
4985000	4987000	I guess a new logo
4987000	4989000	For something called PlayStation Thanks
4989000	4991000	Um, no word on what this is yet
4991000	4993000	However, if you were to ask me
4993000	4995000	I would say that it's probably gonna be some sort of
4995000	4997000	Um, incentive program
4997000	4999000	Very similar like, you know, the
4999000	5001000	Club Nintendo stuff
5001000	5003000	Very interesting tonight, we have a lot of
5003000	5005000	Discount and reward stories
5005000	5007000	I guess a sign of the times, I don't know
5007000	5009000	To help in the economy
5009000	5011000	Yeah, I mean, maybe
5011000	5013000	I mean, that's the only thing I can think of
5013000	5015000	Unless they're gonna come out with a new system named
5015000	5017000	Thanks, which would be retarded
5017000	5019000	I mean, I'm sorry, that would be absolutely retarded
5019000	5021000	Thanks for giving me your money
5021000	5023000	But then again, you know, hey, we said the same thing about the Wii
5023000	5025000	When that was named, but uh
5025000	5027000	I hope not
5027000	5029000	Um, yeah
5029000	5031000	So
5031000	5033000	No word on what that is, but I'm sure we'll find out about it
5033000	5035000	Soon enough
5035000	5037000	Dude, let's go play Thanks
5037000	5039000	Nice
5041000	5043000	I don't know, that would be awful
5043000	5045000	PlayStation Thanks
5045000	5047000	Uh, any type of speculation what it is?
5047000	5049000	Do you think it's just to compete with Club Nintendo
5049000	5051000	Or do you think this is just gonna unlock shit and home?
5051000	5053000	I think it's just a redemption program
5053000	5055000	Just basically to incentivize people to buy stuff
5057000	5059000	S2100Matt in chat says
5059000	5061000	I approve of these discount stories
5061000	5063000	Yeah, I mean, there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories
5063000	5065000	It's just kinda interesting, it all seems to be hitting the same week
5065000	5067000	And you know, we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed
5067000	5069000	This is all for work this week
5069000	5071000	Perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP
5071000	5073000	You know, they get you to buy stuff
5073000	5075000	And you get codes and then you can like redeem points
5075000	5077000	And get crap
5077000	5079000	Maybe that's what they're doing
5079000	5081000	That would make more sense to me
5081000	5083000	PlayStation 3, since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3
5083000	5085000	Um
5085000	5087000	I don't know
5087000	5089000	It'd be a nice bonus
5089000	5091000	Tigerclaw says perhaps this thanks thing could be a reward system
5091000	5093000	Where they offer you discounts on any games purchased in PlayStation Network
5093000	5095000	Who knows, $5 off or something
5095000	5097000	I don't know
5097000	5099000	I don't know
5099000	5101000	But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this
5101000	5103000	Just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing
5103000	5105000	Well I say thanks to Square Enix
5105000	5107000	Because this week we got some more details on Final Fantasy 14
5107000	5109000	A more full website has opened up for the game by the way
5109000	5111000	If you want to check that out
5111000	5113000	And I guess some more information was released on an 8 minute video
5113000	5115000	That came out from Famitsu Wave
5115000	5117000	I guess which is available on YouTube
5117000	5119000	But boy oh boy
5119000	5121000	If you want to check that out
5121000	5123000	It didn't really end there
5123000	5125000	A lot of new information came out
5125000	5127000	On Final Fantasy 14
5127000	5129000	What's kind of interesting is that
5129000	5131000	Some of the jobs from 11
5131000	5133000	And I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs
5133000	5135000	Is going to be somewhat similar
5135000	5137000	But the focus is going to be on the weapons
5137000	5139000	And they're saying that okay
5139000	5141000	What's also interesting
5141000	5143000	They're not using any of the Final Fantasy
5143000	5145000	Very typical names for classes
5145000	5147000	Like you have swordsman and sorcerer
5147000	5149000	Like all these new type of jobs
5149000	5151000	That you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before
5151000	5153000	But apparently the way it works is that like let's say you have a sword
5153000	5155000	Okay well that makes you a swordsman
5155000	5157000	But then let's say you're going to go off on an adventure
5157000	5159000	Where you need to go heal
5159000	5161000	Well you switch from your sword to your staff
5161000	5163000	And now you're a healer
5163000	5165000	And that's why you see in the Final Fantasy 14 logo
5165000	5167000	Out of the trailer that there was a lot of weapons poking out of it
5167000	5169000	Because the weapon system is kind of the central part of that game
5169000	5171000	And they say
5171000	5173000	That experience points and leveling
5173000	5175000	Doesn't even work like a normal game
5175000	5177000	Like there are no experience points in leveling
5177000	5179000	It's all based on the weapons
5179000	5181000	So it sounds kind of interesting
5181000	5183000	But more importantly they've also talked about
5183000	5185000	They are building this game so you can play it
5185000	5187000	If you have only an hour of time to spare
5187000	5189000	Or if you have all day to spare
5189000	5191000	They are looking at certain features that are only
5191000	5193000	15-30 minutes in length
5193000	5195000	Also some other things released about the game this week
5195000	5197000	Is that the classes have been revealed
5197000	5199000	And what's really interesting is that
5199000	5201000	They call them completely different names
5201000	5203000	They're not all even the
5203000	5205000	Same names that you might be used to
5205000	5207000	Like Taru Taru
5207000	5209000	Is now called a Lalafel
5209000	5211000	Which I keep saying a falafel
5211000	5213000	But their name is a Lalafel
5213000	5215000	Or something like that
5215000	5217000	I know they changed all the names
5217000	5219000	Because it's a new world
5219000	5221000	Oh it's not a new world, they're the exact same races
5221000	5223000	Come on
5223000	5225000	The characters do look slightly different
5225000	5227000	But they're also saying that the difference between the races
5227000	5229000	Is not going to be that great
5229000	5231000	But that the differences between the genders
5231000	5233000	There's some translation I read
5233000	5235000	Which some people are thinking might be a throwback
5235000	5237000	To the old D&D
5237000	5239000	Where men were typically more strength
5239000	5241000	Women were typically more mind intelligence
5241000	5243000	Kind of interesting
5243000	5245000	That's not true at all
5245000	5251000	I don't think it's funny to call them falafels
5251000	5253000	Do you also have Hummus as another class?
5253000	5255000	Probably
5255000	5257000	There's a Humaya or something like that
5257000	5259000	Is what they call a human
5259000	5261000	Why can't they just use Hummus?
5261000	5263000	Seriously
5263000	5265000	They're elven
5265000	5267000	Just call them elves
5267000	5269000	They're not elven
5269000	5271000	Or elephanten
5271000	5273000	Or whatever the hell they're calling them
5273000	5275000	I think my friend Shane was calling them Lalafels
5275000	5277000	They don't look as cute as Taros do
5277000	5279000	They look bigger now
5279000	5281000	They don't look like Taros did
5281000	5283000	Apparently they're more customizable
5283000	5285000	Are they going to have male Mithras
5285000	5287000	And female Galkas
5287000	5289000	Or whatever the fuck they're calling them
5289000	5291000	These guys are unisex though
5291000	5293000	Not yet, we haven't seen anything yet
5293000	5295000	But the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them
5295000	5297000	That they might come out later
5297000	5299000	That we'll see male Mithras later on
5299000	5301000	Or whatever they're calling them now
5301000	5303000	Cat people
5303000	5305000	You say that and I have thought this ever since
5305000	5307000	I always think of Mithril
5307000	5309000	I will say this though
5309000	5311000	Some screenshots have come out from the game
5311000	5313000	It looks really nice
5313000	5315000	Not really a lot from in-game
5315000	5317000	But just of some of the scenery and things
5317000	5319000	I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics
5319000	5321000	To look a lot more like Oblivion
5321000	5323000	But very colorful
5323000	5325000	Oblivion started to look very monotone after a while
5325000	5327000	Don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics
5327000	5329000	But Final Fantasy 14
5329000	5331000	They've shown some landscapes
5331000	5333000	That are just very lush and colorful
5333000	5335000	And I'm very excited to see
5335000	5337000	How the game looks when it comes out
5337000	5339000	Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year
5339000	5341000	Because the game's coming out in 2010
5341000	5343000	I don't know how they're going to do that
5343000	5345000	When Final Fantasy 13 hasn't even dated yet
5345000	5347000	I think people are getting their hopes up
5347000	5349000	I don't think this game's coming out until 2011
5349000	5351000	I realize Squeenix is saying 2010
5351000	5353000	But come on, how many games get delayed?
5353000	5355000	Do we trust them?
5355000	5357000	Do we really trust them?
5357000	5359000	So best case scenario
5359000	5361000	Like Christmas 2010
5361000	5363000	Is when you'll see this game, I think
5365000	5367000	But hey, don't get me wrong
5367000	5369000	I'm kind of excited about this game
5369000	5371000	Because I'm really excited at the notion that they have
5371000	5373000	Fixed a lot of the problems
5373000	5375000	Big problems that Final Fantasy 11 had
5375000	5377000	Especially in regards to
5377000	5379000	How long of an investment you have to make
5379000	5381000	With the game each time you play it
5381000	5383000	I mean like a month at a time
5383000	5385000	Right?
5385000	5387000	So anyway
5387000	5389000	We're going to go into now another segment
5389000	5391000	We like to do here
5391000	5393000	It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane
5393000	5395000	And recap a
5395000	5397000	Favorite game that we love
5397000	5399000	In a segment called the classic game of the week
5399000	5401000	So Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault
5401000	5403000	And find the game
5403000	5405000	That she thinks you all ought to be playing this week
5405000	5407000	In Dark Soccer's classic game of the week
5407000	5409000	Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?
5409000	5411000	The game of the week is
5411000	5413000	Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn
5413000	5415000	In Japan it came out
5415000	5417000	As a Zell Panzer Dragoon RPG
5417000	5419000	It is
5419000	5421000	Like I said, a role play game
5421000	5423000	Came out in 1988
5423000	5425000	For the Saturn
5425000	5427000	And it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series
5427000	5429000	Not including
5429000	5431000	Panzer Dragoon Mini
5431000	5433000	That came out on Game Gear in Japan
5433000	5435000	And also it's also the only one
5435000	5437000	That's not a rail shooter
5437000	5439000	It's
5439000	5441000	It was done by
5441000	5443000	Team Andromeda
5443000	5445000	And this was
5445000	5447000	Their last game as
5447000	5449000	Team Andromeda
5449000	5451000	So you're playing a boy named Edge
5451000	5453000	Who is looking
5453000	5455000	Who's actually trying
5455000	5457000	To save the world
5457000	5459000	And has his own dragon and everything
5459000	5461000	And so you play through the game
5461000	5463000	With real time
5463000	5465000	Well sort of real time
5465000	5467000	Combat
5467000	5469000	And
5469000	5471000	Your different interactions
5471000	5473000	With the characters
5473000	5475000	The really really cool thing about this
5475000	5477000	Is that
5477000	5479000	You actually
5479000	5481000	Don't
5481000	5483000	Stay on the dragon all the time
5483000	5485000	You can go around
5485000	5487000	And explore different areas on foot
5487000	5489000	And then you can fly around the world
5489000	5491000	You know different places that you can get to
5491000	5493000	You
5493000	5495000	Control your dragon
5495000	5497000	Pretty much completely
5497000	5499000	Instead of it being predetermined
5499000	5501000	Like it was in the other games
5501000	5503000	You actually tell the dragon where to go
5503000	5505000	And can go anywhere you want to
5509000	5511000	You also have other commands for the dragon
5511000	5513000	Like breaking things and accessing
5513000	5515000	Lovers and switches and things like that
5515000	5517000	And your dragon has different
5517000	5519000	You know weapons
5521000	5523000	It's
5523000	5525000	Like you have lasers for your dragon
5525000	5527000	Dragon with lasers that's pretty cool
5527000	5529000	Dragons with lasers awesome
5529000	5531000	Why didn't they just call the game
5531000	5533000	Laser Dragons? I probably would have checked it out
5533000	5535000	When it was first out
5535000	5537000	Well it actually was really good
5537000	5539000	It used a lot of dramatic camera angles
5539000	5543000	It really
5543000	5545000	Had just
5545000	5547000	It was really really a
5547000	5549000	Traditional RPG with some
5549000	5551000	Really unconventional aspects to it
5553000	5555000	Like for example you're in air combat
5555000	5557000	And it wasn't necessarily
5557000	5559000	Turn based it was
5559000	5561000	Real time based
5563000	5565000	And you know you have your attack
5565000	5567000	You can use items and then you have your berserks
5567000	5569000	Which are like your spells
5569000	5571000	And then you know you've also got
5571000	5573000	Your gauges that determine
5573000	5575000	You know where you are for your initiative
5575000	5577000	You know sort of like that
5577000	5579000	The other
5579000	5581000	Now this is what I really liked is that
5581000	5583000	You can get different abilities
5583000	5585000	You can equip your dragon
5585000	5587000	Well it's technically called
5587000	5589000	Morphing they also put this in
5589000	5591000	In Panzer Dragons VI and
5591000	5593000	Orda which came out on Dreamcast
5593000	5597000	You can change
5597000	5599000	The dragon into all these different forms
5599000	5601000	Which actually the specific
5601000	5603000	Thing about Saga is that
5603000	5605000	You literally had hundreds
5605000	5607000	Of different forms that you could do
5607000	5609000	You would affect different attributes
5609000	5611000	By sort of upgrading
5611000	5613000	Parts of your dragon and it would
5613000	5615000	Take a different appearance
5615000	5617000	Have different abilities, do different things
5617000	5621000	And it would actually
5621000	5623000	Change physical form
5623000	5625000	As you did everything
5625000	5627000	There were
5627000	5629000	Really different extreme forms
5629000	5631000	Based off of agility, spirit, attack
5631000	5633000	Or defense
5633000	5635000	And then it would change something within
5635000	5637000	Those four extremes
5637000	5639000	You would
5639000	5641000	Also be able to make some
5641000	5643000	Unique forms by getting D units
5643000	5647000	And then
5647000	5649000	There were hidden forms one of them is called
5649000	5651000	The light wing where if you get all 12
5651000	5653000	Of the D units in the game
5653000	5655000	You get the ultimate dragon
5655000	5657000	Pretty much the light wing has
5657000	5659000	All of the special berserks
5659000	5661000	And
5661000	5665000	When you charge all of your action gauges
5665000	5667000	Then all of your status
5667000	5669000	Your health points and your berserk points
5669000	5671000	All go to normal
5671000	5673000	Then there's another one called the solo wing
5673000	5675000	Which really didn't do crap for you
5675000	5677000	But it was harder to get so
5677000	5679000	It bothered
5679000	5681000	But it is considered one of the
5681000	5683000	Pinnacles of
5683000	5685000	The Saturn RPGs
5685000	5687000	And Saturn RPGs are
5687000	5689000	Barely
5689000	5691000	You know, at least for the ones
5691000	5693000	That we got out over here
5693000	5695000	Few and far between
5695000	5697000	And we actually have
5697000	5699000	An American copy of this game
5699000	5701000	And we paid
5701000	5703000	Quite a bit for it
5703000	5705000	Good luck finding it
5705000	5707000	It's really really difficult
5707000	5709000	But it is considered
5709000	5711000	One of the best RPGs
5711000	5713000	On the Saturn
5713000	5715000	Especially the few that came out in the US
5715000	5717000	So
5717000	5719000	There it is
5719000	5721000	Your classic game of the week
5721000	5723000	Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn
5723000	5725000	And I've never really seen this game before
5725000	5727000	But especially for that era
5727000	5729000	I like the backgrounds, they're very pretty
5729000	5731000	It's all these dragons shooting their lasers
5731000	5733000	And pretty sunsets and so forth
5733000	5735000	Really good music and not a lot of talking
5735000	5737000	Was one of the dragon battles
5737000	5739000	Yeah, it's kind of fun
5739000	5741000	The game has some
5741000	5743000	Gorgeous music and also it's in
5743000	5745000	Japanese
5745000	5747000	With subtitles
5747000	5749000	So the voice acting was actually
5749000	5751000	Pretty good in it too
5751000	5753000	There's a few familiar voices
5753000	5755000	For at least those who were onomie
5755000	5757000	Nuts
5757000	5759000	Well if you actually have a Sega Saturn
5759000	5761000	Still around the house and kicking and working
5761000	5763000	You can kind of copy that and check it out
5763000	5765000	Or I guess you can always try to emulate it somehow
5765000	5767000	But do they have Saturn?
5767000	5769000	They have Saturn emulators, you usually have to have a good working BIOS
5769000	5771000	But other than that
5771000	5773000	Yeah, they work
5773000	5775000	They work fine on your PC at home
5775000	5777000	I have one because
5777000	5779000	I just wanted to try it and it actually works on my
5779000	5781000	Disc games that I have a few Saturn games
5781000	5783000	Because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out
5783000	5785000	It works great
5785000	5787000	Alright, well we're going to take a break here on
5787000	5789000	Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet
5789000	5791000	We've got plenty more to come
5791000	5793000	We've got our rapid fire news when we come back with Part B tonight
5793000	5795000	As well as some more discussion
5795000	5797000	We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up
5797000	5799000	We're going to talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSI
5799000	5801000	And Pax 09 news
5801000	5803000	We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break
5803000	5805000	Here on Orange Lounge Radio
5805000	5807000	So don't go anywhere, stay tuned
5807000	5813000	Music
5813000	5815000	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio
5815000	5817000	On this lovely Sunday evening
5817000	5819000	Of 2009, of course we do tape live
5819000	5821000	On all games radio every Sunday night
5821000	5823000	At 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
5823000	5825000	9 o'clock Eastern Time
5825000	5827000	Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus
5827000	5829000	If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that
5829000	5831000	In Part A, but you will just have to download
5831000	5833000	The podcast at this point, which I know
5833000	5835000	Is very slow in updating during our podcast
5835000	5837000	But should be back on a more regular schedule
5837000	5839000	This week
5839000	5841000	So anyhow, let's jump right back into some more gaming news
5841000	5843000	We have some rapid fire news
5843000	5845000	News that we're probably not going to talk a lot about
5845000	5847000	But we wanted to get it out there anyway
5847000	5849000	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight
5849000	5851000	Yes, Pearl Jam's next album is actually
5851000	5853000	Becoming simultaneously to
5853000	5855000	Rock Band as well as retail
5855000	5857000	And of course
5857000	5859000	Their new album, which
5859000	5861000	I believe is called Backspacer
5861000	5863000	Which is kind of a weird name, but okay
5863000	5865000	It'll be available
5865000	5867000	The same day
5867000	5869000	On both Playstation Network and Xbox Live
5869000	5871000	Marketplace, September 20th
5871000	5873000	Is going to be the
5873000	5875000	Date for that
5875000	5877000	Pac-Man Championship Edition is now
5877000	5879000	Also being ported to
5879000	5881000	The iPhone
5881000	5883000	And it makes perfect sense that they would be
5883000	5885000	Putting that out there
5885000	5887000	Definitely worth checking out
5887000	5889000	I believe it's actually coming out as
5889000	5891000	Pac-Man Remix
5891000	5893000	Oh no
5893000	5895000	They had one called Pac-Man Remix
5895000	5897000	My mistake, it is Championship Edition
5897000	5899000	That'd be kind of cool
5899000	5901000	And then a new
5901000	5903000	It's going to suck on the iPhone because the music
5903000	5905000	Was awesome in the Xbox one
5905000	5907000	I don't know if they're, well I guess you know
5907000	5909000	iPhone is an MP3 player, but
5909000	5911000	And they've got some kickass tunes, but I don't know
5911000	5913000	I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360
5913000	5915000	One being reproduced on the iPhone
5915000	5917000	Sorry, had to get that out there
5917000	5919000	We'll see
5919000	5921000	Champions Online is actually doing something
5921000	5923000	Interesting with their subscription service
5923000	5925000	They're actually, besides the monthly
5925000	5927000	subscription that you could do
5927000	5929000	Which would be
5929000	5931000	$15 a month
5931000	5933000	I guess
5933000	5935000	You can actually purchase
5935000	5937000	A six month plan
5937000	5939000	At a slightly discounted rate for
5939000	5941000	$59.99
5941000	5943000	Or if you want to
5943000	5945000	If you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game
5945000	5947000	You can get a lifetime subscription
5947000	5949000	For $199.99
5949000	5951000	$200
5951000	5953000	And I know for a lot of people that are
5953000	5955000	Playing WoW, if you get a lifetime
5955000	5957000	Subscription for $200, that probably would've been
5957000	5959000	Worth it when it launched
5959000	5961000	I don't know, if you're really into
5961000	5963000	Champions Online, that might be the way to go
5963000	5965000	But aren't you
5965000	5967000	Getting also something about Star Trek Online
5967000	5969000	With that too? That was the part that caught my eye
5969000	5971000	Yes, if you pre-order
5971000	5973000	One of the subscription plans
5973000	5975000	You will also get
5975000	5977000	Access to the closed beta for
5977000	5979000	Star Trek Online
5979000	5981000	Which is coming out later this year
5981000	5983000	See, I really want to play
5983000	5985000	Star Trek Online, but not $200
5985000	5987000	Sadly, especially when I don't really know anything
5987000	5989000	About Champions Online, except that
5989000	5991000	The series has a cult following to it
5991000	5993000	I play Champions offline
5993000	5995000	With books and paper and dice
5995000	5997000	Does the prospect of an online one
5997000	5999000	Because, you know, that wasn't really my thing
5999000	6001000	Is the prospect of an online version of that
6001000	6003000	Appeal to you?
6003000	6005000	Maybe? Could be hit and miss, I guess
6005000	6007000	But, dude, Star Trek Online
6007000	6009000	Early, that's cool
6009000	6011000	But, man, that's a mean thing to do
6011000	6013000	I mean, you gotta pay, what
6013000	6015000	$200, or what's the other subscription plan
6015000	6017000	Like $50 or something? $60 for six months
6017000	6019000	You gotta pay upfront
6019000	6021000	Just to get into a beta, it's not worth it for that
6021000	6023000	I bet you, though, there's some people
6023000	6025000	That'll pay that $60 just to get in that beta
6025000	6027000	I am positive of that
6027000	6029000	You're gonna pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO
6029000	6031000	To play a beta for another MMO
6031000	6033000	That you're possibly gonna go to
6033000	6035000	Kind of a waste of money if you ask me
6035000	6037000	Well, you know what? People can spend their money
6037000	6039000	However they want, right?
6039000	6041000	Alright, sorry, I didn't mean to go off and talk about that
6041000	6043000	But I just thought that was too interesting
6043000	6045000	Anyhow, let's- I think it's funny
6045000	6047000	Let me dive into some more news, we'll start off with
6047000	6049000	This actually is a little bit of old news
6049000	6051000	It did come out a couple weeks ago, but
6051000	6053000	We have some staffers at Orange Launch Radio that love
6053000	6055000	Love, love a little indie game called La Mulana
6055000	6057000	And that was a game that came out
6057000	6059000	It actually came out in like 2005
6059000	6061000	But it has extremely retro graphics
6061000	6063000	It's kind of like
6063000	6065000	Metroid-ish style kind of game
6065000	6067000	And it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game
6067000	6069000	I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX
6069000	6071000	If you've never seen this game before
6071000	6073000	Well, if you've never seen the game before
6073000	6075000	You will get to see it soon
6075000	6077000	La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare
6077000	6079000	Which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit, surprise
6079000	6081000	Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades
6081000	6083000	It won't really look 8-bit
6083000	6085000	But it'll look kind of more 16-bit
6085000	6087000	With a little bit more hand-drawn art
6087000	6089000	Is what the look they're going for
6089000	6091000	Should be kind of fun
6091000	6093000	The WiiWare version will also have downloadable content
6093000	6095000	New stages and game modes
6095000	6097000	Such as Boss Rush
6097000	6099000	The game is very, very difficult
6099000	6101000	So I'm not sure if the level of difficulty will still be there
6101000	6103000	Or what they plan to do
6103000	6105000	But that is all part of it
6105000	6107000	Moving on to talking about Rockband
6107000	6109000	I thought this was interesting
6109000	6111000	Rockband.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart
6111000	6113000	This is interesting because
6113000	6115000	You've seen some blogs and some websites
6115000	6117000	Do instrument compatibility charts of their own
6117000	6119000	But this is coming right from the source
6119000	6121000	Harmonics meaning
6121000	6123000	And includes games such as Beatles Rockband
6123000	6125000	What I think is interesting about this
6125000	6127000	They make no shame about listing
6127000	6129000	Guitar Hero games on here as well
6129000	6131000	And Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting
6131000	6133000	They also put in their compatibility chart
6133000	6137000	As well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth
6137000	6139000	If you're curious, just briefly
6139000	6141000	You can look at this at Rockband.com slash compatibility
6141000	6143000	You get the whole chart
6143000	6145000	But it actually looks like most of the instruments
6145000	6147000	Are compatible with all the games at this point
6147000	6149000	The only things you're going to run into is
6149000	6151000	You're going to run into problems with some of the Rockband paraphernalia
6151000	6153000	In Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3
6153000	6155000	On the Xbox 360
6155000	6157000	And drums are all pretty cross compatible
6157000	6159000	Unless you own the Rock Revolution drums
6159000	6161000	They just don't work with Rockband games
6161000	6163000	But if you want the confidence that your instruments
6163000	6165000	Will work with the Beatles Rockband
6165000	6167000	Here's some good news for you
6167000	6169000	Beatles Rockband will run on
6169000	6171000	Every single instrument will run with
6171000	6173000	Beatles Rockband as well as
6173000	6175000	Rockband 2
6175000	6177000	The only thing that doesn't work with Rockband 2
6177000	6179000	Rock Revolution drums
6179000	6181000	Same thing with Beatles Rockband
6181000	6183000	No one bought Rock Revolution anyway
6183000	6185000	They might, it's cheap now even with the drums
6185000	6187000	I guess it's true
6187000	6189000	Find an unloaded one
6189000	6191000	Anyhow, one other one
6191000	6193000	Quick follow up to a story previously talked about on Orange Launch Radio
6193000	6195000	Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled
6195000	6197000	And the game will be released in October
6197000	6199000	Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game
6199000	6201000	Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal
6201000	6203000	But details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed
6203000	6205000	But the game will be coming out in October
6205000	6215000	So get ready to rock those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend
6215000	6217000	That was a really messy situation
6217000	6219000	Because there was counter suits and all this other garbage
6219000	6221000	Yuck
6221000	6225000	Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news
6225000	6229000	What actually was going to be coming out is
6229000	6231000	Revenge of Shinobi
6231000	6233000	For Mega Drive for the Genesis
6233000	6235000	Over here will be coming out for
6235000	6237000	800 Nintendo points
6237000	6239000	And on WiiWare there's Bonsai Barber
6239000	6241000	Which is a tree sculpting and painting game
6241000	6243000	It's actually running a business
6243000	6245000	Doing both of those
6245000	6247000	And that's a thousand points
6247000	6249000	And then there will be a bunch of city maps
6249000	6251000	For DS city transport
6251000	6253000	For DS city transport map volumes 1 and 2
6253000	6255000	There will be
6255000	6257000	Parasite
6257000	6259000	And then there will be
6259000	6261000	And then there will be
6261000	6263000	Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon
6263000	6265000	And then there will be
6265000	6267000	London, Amsterdam
6267000	6269000	Moscow, Berlin, and Prague
6269000	6271000	So that's pretty cool
6271000	6273000	And that will be for 500
6273000	6275000	Also in other news
6275000	6277000	And this makes me a happy fangirl
6277000	6279000	Is we will have gorillas in rock band
6279000	6281000	Yay
6281000	6283000	Where's the yay?
6283000	6285000	Yay
6285000	6287000	That's right
6287000	6289000	Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are
6289000	6291000	But I'll download them for sure
6291000	6293000	Definitely
6293000	6295000	Heck yeah
6295000	6297000	Well there's going to be Feel Good Inc, Clint Eastwood
6297000	6299000	And Rehash
6299000	6301000	For pack 1
6301000	6303000	And that's going to be pretty cool
6303000	6305000	It's supposed to be out
6305000	6307000	For
6307000	6309000	Excuse me
6309000	6311000	On the rock band music store
6311000	6313000	This week
6313000	6315000	I believe
6315000	6317000	Tuesdays are usually the day those come out right?
6317000	6319000	Exactly
6319000	6321000	There's also going to be some other
6321000	6323000	Download tracks
6323000	6325000	We get some Janis Joplin
6325000	6327000	We get Piece of My Heart
6327000	6329000	That's awesome
6329000	6331000	This is going to be the best week ever for rock band
6331000	6333000	We get White Rabbit
6333000	6335000	Dude! Jefferson fucking airplane
6335000	6337000	This is the greatest week ever for rock band
6337000	6339000	We get Magic Bus
6339000	6341000	Nice
6341000	6343000	But also for the Wii
6343000	6345000	There will be a number of songs
6345000	6347000	Yeah
6347000	6349000	Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer
6349000	6351000	Thin Lizzy
6351000	6353000	You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas
6353000	6355000	Or no, my birthday?
6355000	6357000	I still haven't spent it
6357000	6359000	I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week
6359000	6361000	I have to get the gorilla stuff
6361000	6363000	I have to get Jefferson airplane
6363000	6365000	So
6365000	6367000	Look forward to that at my next rock band party
6367000	6369000	The other thing
6369000	6371000	Sega is teasing us
6371000	6373000	With the new RPG
6373000	6375000	We will be able to see
6375000	6377000	What it is on August 20th
6377000	6379000	But
6379000	6381000	There are a few clues though
6381000	6383000	Saying that there's going to be
6383000	6385000	It's a wooden ship wheel
6385000	6387000	And a silhouette of a woman
6387000	6389000	In a weird pose
6389000	6391000	So
6391000	6393000	There's a few people who think
6393000	6395000	That there's going to be
6395000	6397000	A
6397000	6399000	PSO
6399000	6401000	But
6401000	6403000	PSO
6403000	6405000	Like
6405000	6407000	A new fantasy czar
6407000	6409000	Fantasy star roleplay game
6409000	6411000	Fantasy czar
6411000	6413000	That's set in the
6413000	6415000	Future Russia
6415000	6417000	In outer space
6417000	6419000	No
6419000	6421000	But
6421000	6423000	This to speculation they really pulled it out
6423000	6425000	Of some HTML code
6425000	6427000	AKA their ass
6427000	6429000	So that's it
6429000	6431000	Now Kyria Chronicles 2 or something
6431000	6433000	But I guess we already know about that
6433000	6435000	Or I'm thinking if they've got
6435000	6437000	A big captains wheel
6437000	6439000	What about Eternal Arcadia
6439000	6441000	That was out on Dreamcast
6441000	6443000	Where you had the air pirate ships
6443000	6445000	Wow that's obscure
6445000	6447000	That's not obscure I haven't
6447000	6449000	I never
6449000	6451000	Doesn't mean anything
6451000	6453000	Look folks go look at the
6453000	6455000	Video of the vault on YouTube
6455000	6457000	And tell me she does not have some obscure shit
6457000	6459000	The lady pulls out a dish
6459000	6461000	That came with a video game at some point I kid you not
6461000	6463000	Or perhaps
6463000	6465000	That's obscure
6465000	6467000	It's a new party game collection
6467000	6469000	Sonic vs the Somalia pirates
6469000	6471000	No
6471000	6473000	Good times
6473000	6475000	No
6475000	6477000	Very cool
6477000	6479000	Alright
6479000	6481000	I hate you Spyler
6481000	6483000	Oh yeah that's right it came out as Skies of Arcadia
6483000	6485000	Over here or whatever
6485000	6487000	I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name
6487000	6489000	Oh now Skies of Arcadia
6489000	6491000	I've heard of that okay
6491000	6493000	I get it now
6493000	6495000	Not obscure
6495000	6497000	Alright let's get back to some more gaming news Loki
6497000	6499000	Alright
6499000	6501000	Well
6501000	6503000	There's some interesting stuff that they were
6503000	6505000	Showing off this week for Guitar Hero 5
6505000	6507000	Including
6507000	6509000	That much like the Wii version
6509000	6511000	Where you can throw in your own Miis
6511000	6513000	Although that version kinda
6513000	6515000	Eh the Miis thing's kinda lame
6515000	6517000	The Xbox
6517000	6519000	Avatars will now be able to be featured
6519000	6521000	In your Xbox 360 version
6521000	6523000	Of Guitar Hero 5
6523000	6525000	To rock out I guess on stage
6525000	6527000	Which is
6527000	6529000	Interesting
6529000	6531000	And on top of that
6531000	6533000	Also Guitar Hero
6533000	6535000	Van Halen this week got its full
6535000	6537000	Track list
6537000	6539000	Some people
6539000	6541000	Are less excited about it
6541000	6543000	Um
6543000	6545000	Eh
6545000	6547000	Anyways
6547000	6549000	Some of the tracks feature
6549000	6551000	Are featured
6551000	6553000	In the game I guess
6553000	6555000	Jump, Hot for Teacher
6555000	6557000	Let's see
6557000	6559000	Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls
6559000	6561000	Panama
6561000	6563000	That's gonna be awesome
6563000	6565000	Pretty Woman
6565000	6567000	So This is Love
6567000	6569000	Unchained and You Really Got Me
6569000	6571000	Of course those are all Van Halen tracks
6571000	6573000	Other artists featured in the game
6573000	6575000	As well
6575000	6577000	Billy Idol, White Wedding
6577000	6579000	Um
6579000	6581000	Foreigner with Devil Vision
6581000	6583000	Third Eye Blind, Semi Charmed Life
6583000	6585000	The Offspring, Pretty Fly
6585000	6587000	For A White Guy
6587000	6589000	Do do do do do do do do
6589000	6591000	Queen, I Want It All
6591000	6593000	Lain Cravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead
6593000	6595000	Man just when I think
6595000	6597000	Like a song list kinda blows
6597000	6599000	I'm not really interested. They have to go in and throw in a Queen track
6599000	6601000	That suddenly takes it from Suck to
6601000	6603000	Awesome. Which by the way
6603000	6605000	Sing Star Queen is apparently out now
6605000	6607000	And I'm surprised I don't already own it
6607000	6609000	It's not out yet. I thought it came out this week
6609000	6611000	Oh yeah that's right they changed the date I forgot about that
6611000	6613000	It like got bumped up or something
6613000	6615000	I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin though
6615000	6617000	Cause Sing Star games usually end up in the discount bin
6617000	6619000	In about a month
6619000	6621000	Yeah
6621000	6623000	So yeah
6623000	6625000	All those tracks and you know
6625000	6627000	Of course those two stories just
6627000	6629000	Happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games
6629000	6631000	And not for any other reason at all
6631000	6633000	Of course not
6633000	6635000	Cause that would be purely hypothetical
6635000	6637000	Now I was
6637000	6639000	In South Lake Tahoe this weekend
6639000	6641000	And at the basement of one of their
6641000	6643000	Casinos there, Harvey's
6643000	6645000	They have a Cabo Wabo
6645000	6647000	And that was kind of a fun place to go
6647000	6649000	Cause you get good drinks and so forth
6649000	6651000	You know who started that?
6651000	6653000	Somebody that's missing from Guitar Hero
6653000	6655000	Exactly
6655000	6657000	So I was gonna say I saw some
6657000	6659000	Well I didn't see him there but I saw someone this week
6659000	6661000	That I'm not gonna see in this game
6661000	6663000	Sammy Hagar
6663000	6665000	I was gonna
6665000	6667000	I was gonna also say though
6667000	6669000	That
6669000	6671000	The game is scheduled
6671000	6673000	To come out
6673000	6675000	Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd
6675000	6677000	For most people
6677000	6679000	That seems way pushed back from what we were originally
6679000	6681000	It is way pushed back
6681000	6683000	Interesting
6683000	6685000	It is interesting now isn't it
6685000	6687000	Hypothetically speaking
6687000	6689000	Very interesting
6689000	6691000	Just before Christmas
6691000	6693000	Just before Christmas
6693000	6695000	The Christmas will come early for some
6695000	6697000	Guitar Hero faithful
6697000	6699000	Hypothetically
6699000	6701000	Anyhow hey one thing that's not hypothetical
6701000	6703000	This is fact ladies and gentlemen
6703000	6705000	Facebook is now integrated with the DSI
6705000	6707000	The whole switch happened on
6707000	6709000	I think it was the 3rd of August
6709000	6711000	When this all went down
6711000	6713000	But I know I've been seeing it show up on my
6713000	6715000	Friend feed on Facebook
6715000	6717000	None of my real life friends
6717000	6719000	Have it but some of the OLR listeners
6719000	6721000	Have me friended on Facebook and some of them are using it
6721000	6723000	So you know here's the thing
6723000	6725000	The DSI Facebook functionality
6725000	6727000	Is pretty much the same thing with your cell phone
6727000	6729000	Because when I was on my Tahoe trip
6729000	6731000	This weekend for anybody that has me friended on Facebook
6731000	6733000	I was uploading pics for my cell phone
6733000	6735000	The whole way like I uploaded
6735000	6737000	Some things and we were stopped in this
6737000	6739000	This town I can't even remember what it was called
6739000	6741000	It had a hilarious name it was like
6741000	6743000	It wasn't pond scum but like pond spring
6743000	6745000	It was something really silly
6745000	6747000	We uploaded pictures from there and you know just as we were
6747000	6749000	On the way there and actually there's some pictures from
6749000	6751000	Cabo Wabo in there
6751000	6753000	It's the same thing but with your DSI
6753000	6755000	You basically just you know instead of your cell phone
6755000	6757000	It's your DSI but since
6757000	6759000	The DSI has all the picture
6759000	6761000	Altering modes on it where you can draw
6761000	6763000	And have the borders and all the
6763000	6765000	You know weird distortion pictures
6765000	6767000	You can upload those
6767000	6769000	Pictures too which I guess you can't really
6769000	6771000	Yeah I know
6771000	6773000	Honestly it's the same functionality
6773000	6775000	You'd find in a cell phone which
6775000	6777000	You know whatever okay
6777000	6779000	More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing
6779000	6781000	On my Facebook I guess
6781000	6783000	Not something that has me bouncing off the walls
6783000	6785000	But I can see where some people find this cool
6785000	6787000	Especially if you don't have a decent camera
6787000	6789000	On your cell phone or you like to
6789000	6791000	Edit pictures as somebody
6791000	6793000	On my Facebook loves to do because all the pictures
6793000	6795000	He's posted of himself are all like
6795000	6797000	Drawn on and mirrored imaged
6797000	6799000	And all just distorted
6799000	6801000	But hey
6801000	6803000	Have fun with it that's what DSI is about
6803000	6805000	Having fun right? Is there anything else
6805000	6807000	They could really do with Facebook integration and the
6807000	6809000	DSI I mean I'm kind of glad it's just this
6809000	6811000	I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying
6811000	6813000	So and so is now playing Pokemon
6813000	6815000	So and so just stop playing
6815000	6817000	Pokemon because I would block
6817000	6819000	Those posts from Facebook so fast I mean is there
6819000	6821000	A lot of other integration the only other
6821000	6823000	Possibly cool thing I can think of is like an
6823000	6825000	Interactive high score board like you see this
6825000	6827000	With like Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games like
6827000	6829000	So and so just beat your high score
6829000	6831000	Click here to try and beat it
6831000	6833000	You know one thing I do like about
6833000	6835000	Facebook is if you find that shit annoying
6835000	6837000	There's always a hide button and you can block
6837000	6839000	Any application and all that stuff
6839000	6841000	You know Facebook used to be a lot worse but it got a lot
6841000	6843000	Better so
6843000	6845000	Anyhow
6845000	6847000	Just curious if anyone else thinks
6847000	6849000	That there might be something cool they can add to Facebook
6849000	6851000	Nope, nope, alright
6851000	6853000	How about fewer
6853000	6855000	Invites to
6855000	6857000	Sorority girl or whatever the
6857000	6859000	Fuck that is I love sorority life
6859000	6861000	I quit that so fast
6861000	6863000	Did you block it? Yes I did
6863000	6865000	I was going to say because I try not to send like
6865000	6867000	I try not to let those things go out but sometimes they do
6867000	6869000	And I only send gifts to people that I know play regularly
6869000	6871000	I blocked it, I blocked
6871000	6873000	Farm town, the only thing that I
6873000	6875000	Play on there are the retarded quizzes
6875000	6877000	And
6877000	6879000	The
6879000	6881000	Pet thing, pet society
6881000	6883000	I will admit I play Bejeweled Blitz
6883000	6885000	I play sorority life, I'm level 47
6885000	6887000	Thank you very much and I play
6887000	6889000	Farm town now, my boyfriend got me addicted to
6889000	6891000	Farm town which in reality is
6891000	6893000	It really is kind of one of the
6893000	6895000	Dumbest fucking games but
6895000	6897000	You know what it's something that Jeff really enjoys
6897000	6899000	To do so I play it to kind of have a friendly
6899000	6901000	Competition with him although he's so much more addicted than
6901000	6903000	I am so
6903000	6905000	But I told him if he likes farm town he really needs to play
6905000	6907000	Animal Crossing sometime because I think that would be right up his alley
6907000	6909000	Anyhow
6909000	6911000	Enough about casual Facebook games
6911000	6913000	Let's talk more about more video games
6913000	6915000	Dark Sakura
6915000	6917000	Well we might have some other
6917000	6919000	Video game news
6919000	6921000	How about Braid?
6921000	6923000	Braid is actually going to
6923000	6925000	PlayStation Network finally
6925000	6927000	It's supposed to be
6927000	6929000	Actually looking for
6929000	6931000	No they don't have a
6931000	6933000	Date on it yet
6933000	6935000	But
6935000	6937000	They are saying though that
6937000	6939000	Hopefully
6939000	6941000	It will be out soon I guess
6941000	6943000	It seems like a little late
6943000	6945000	I mean didn't this game come out
6945000	6947000	Like a year and a half ago or something
6947000	6949000	Maybe it wasn't that long ago but at least a year ago
6949000	6951000	Right?
6951000	6953000	It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network
6953000	6955000	I mean I guess
6955000	6957000	You know
6957000	6959000	Wherever people want to play the game
6959000	6961000	Let them
6961000	6963000	The designers make their money however
6963000	6965000	But it just seems like this game's on
6965000	6967000	Xbox
6967000	6969000	This game's on PC
6969000	6971000	Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN
6971000	6973000	I have no interest in rebuying the game that's for sure
6973000	6975000	Yeah but there's people who have PS3s
6975000	6977000	That don't have an Xbox 360
6977000	6979000	Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since
6979000	6981000	Or have a PC
6981000	6983000	That they could download the game on
6983000	6985000	But I guess not everybody likes to game on PC
6985000	6987000	I would be more interested in this if there was like
6987000	6989000	More levels or something
6989000	6991000	But I just, to be honest
6991000	6993000	I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid
6993000	6995000	Without kind of dumbing it up
6995000	6997000	Because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool
6997000	6999000	Is the storyline
6999000	7001000	Which is very finely contained to those episodes
7001000	7003000	I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage
7003000	7005000	Or anything like that
7005000	7007000	I think it is what it is
7007000	7009000	And new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough
7009000	7011000	That's for sure
7011000	7013000	Frisbee brings up an interesting point
7013000	7015000	Talking about Facebook in our chatroom
7015000	7017000	chat.orangestory.com
7017000	7019000	I'm sorry, not Facebook, but the DSi
7019000	7021000	Remember when the DS was going to have
7021000	7023000	VoIP at hotspots?
7023000	7025000	Whatever happened to that?
7025000	7027000	That's a good question. Remember they demoed that at E3 one year?
7027000	7029000	The Skype type thing on the DS?
7029000	7031000	Why did that suddenly go away?
7031000	7033000	Anyone know?
7033000	7035000	I think they just integrated it into some games
7035000	7037000	To know how they have voice chat
7037000	7039000	And like certain games
7039000	7041000	Like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that
7041000	7043000	You can do voice chat with the DS
7043000	7045000	I think that's what it came down to
7045000	7047000	Hmm
7047000	7049000	That's what some folks in chat are saying
7049000	7051000	EasyHP in chat says it's called
7051000	7053000	Pokemon voice chat
7053000	7055000	Probably because the DS isn't that powerful
7055000	7057000	Shit, it can't really run a web browser
7057000	7059000	That well without an expansion card
7059000	7061000	It has no real RAM in it
7061000	7063000	It has a few megs of RAM
7063000	7065000	But that's about it
7065000	7067000	I would think it would be very tough for it to
7067000	7069000	Process that kind of stuff
7069000	7071000	I don't know
7071000	7073000	I'm very interested to see
7073000	7075000	What Nintendo's next handheld
7075000	7077000	Is going to be like
7077000	7079000	And I bet we see it in about three years
7079000	7081000	I'm very curious to see
7081000	7083000	Maybe even two
7083000	7085000	I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit
7085000	7087000	It'll be GameCube graphics
7087000	7089000	We'll see
7089000	7091000	It makes sense, it's the progression
7091000	7093000	That's true
7093000	7095000	I wouldn't mind a portable type F0 though
7095000	7097000	That's for sure
7097000	7099000	And yeah, I agree with Frisbee in chat
7099000	7101000	I'll just use Skype
7101000	7103000	Alright, a few more stories
7103000	7105000	And we're going to get to the mailbag tonight
7105000	7107000	Loki
7107000	7109000	Yes, well unfortunately
7109000	7111000	For Starcraft fans
7111000	7113000	You're going to have to wait a bit longer
7113000	7115000	Yes, Starcraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010
7115000	7117000	And that makes a lot of people sad
7119000	7121000	And you won't be able to buy the trilogy
7121000	7123000	Or at least the first entry in the trilogy
7123000	7125000	That's still annoying
7125000	7127000	The fact that they got rid of LAN
7127000	7129000	And it's still being sold as a trilogy
7129000	7133000	Instead of all three things being part of one game
7133000	7137000	Huh, that sounds like an Activision move to me
7137000	7139000	I'll get you to buy the game three times
7139000	7141000	Well what's also kind of sucky about this
7141000	7143000	Is the fact that everything is fucking getting delayed to 2010
7143000	7145000	There's tons of games
7145000	7147000	Bioshock 2 got delayed to 2010, right?
7147000	7149000	There's been other games
7149000	7151000	It seems like what's left this year?
7151000	7153000	Well they want to announce a lot of games
7153000	7155000	It's just not already
7155000	7159000	Well they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter
7159000	7163000	First off they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines in 2
7163000	7165000	It just gets buried under everything that comes out
7165000	7169000	And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2
7169000	7173000	Because they don't want to release a game out around the same time
7173000	7175000	Because they'll just get ignored
7175000	7177000	And
7177000	7179000	I don't know, I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out
7179000	7181000	But at the same time
7181000	7183000	I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff
7183000	7185000	Like Kane & Lynch 2
7185000	7187000	Stuff like that
7187000	7189000	I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year
7189000	7191000	Because
7191000	7193000	I don't know, they just weren't ready yet
7193000	7195000	Hmm
7195000	7197000	Alright
7197000	7199000	Well hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009
7199000	7201000	You're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet
7201000	7205000	But only if you were one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omega-Thon
7205000	7207000	The game Halo 3 ODST
7207000	7209000	Is going to show up in round 3
7209000	7211000	Of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omega-Thon
7211000	7213000	The other games
7213000	7215000	Mario Kart Wii is round 1's game
7215000	7217000	Round 2 is Bookworm Adventures
7217000	7219000	Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game
7219000	7221000	They don't know what game it is yet
7221000	7223000	But speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet
7223000	7225000	Like Rock Band Beatles
7225000	7227000	Or DJ Hero
7227000	7229000	And round 5 will be Connect 4
7229000	7231000	The final round, as always, is a mystery game
7231000	7233000	That will probably be either something new
7233000	7235000	Or something really old
7235000	7237000	So
7237000	7239000	Like Epic Pong type of thing
7239000	7241000	They've already done that
7241000	7243000	What were the games they did last year?
7243000	7245000	I don't even remember
7245000	7247000	The Omega-Thon stuff from past
7247000	7249000	I think Combat was one year, I remember that
7249000	7251000	Combat was one year, Pong was one year
7251000	7253000	They did Halo 3 one year
7253000	7255000	Um
7255000	7257000	I don't remember what was last year
7257000	7259000	I think we were broadcasting
7259000	7261000	Versus Excitebike was the last game last year
7261000	7263000	That's right
7263000	7265000	I remember now
7265000	7267000	So by the way
7267000	7269000	Speaking of Penny Arcade Expo
7269000	7271000	Sadly, it looks like no one from OLR is going
7271000	7273000	Loki, obviously, is not going to be able to go
7273000	7275000	Dark Sakura
7275000	7277000	Has not been planning on going
7277000	7279000	I was kind of on the fence
7279000	7281000	Right now, I'm a real heavy no on PAX
7281000	7283000	If something comes up
7283000	7285000	Like a really great opportunity in the next few days
7285000	7287000	Um
7287000	7289000	Then I'll change my mind
7289000	7291000	But right now, there's just so much other stuff going on
7291000	7293000	I just think there's other stuff I can do
7293000	7295000	Besides Penny Arcade Expo
7295000	7297000	There's others up there and so forth
7297000	7299000	But I'll just have to try again next year
7299000	7301000	Someone must pay for me, I'll go
7301000	7303000	Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen
7303000	7305000	And here's the other thing
7305000	7307000	I am still aiming for
7307000	7309000	And this should be clear
7309000	7311000	The one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year
7311000	7313000	Is because I am still definitely
7313000	7315000	Set on going with that
7315000	7317000	Unless something happens to PAX Boston next year
7317000	7319000	Which I know is weird
7319000	7321000	Because I'm on the West Coast
7321000	7323000	But I do want to go visit the East Coast
7323000	7325000	With all the appointments and time off
7325000	7327000	I've been taking during the pregnancy
7327000	7329000	And last week and stuff
7329000	7331000	I've just run out of
7331000	7333000	Oh, and this week, I've taken the whole week off
7333000	7335000	I've run out of my paid time off
7335000	7337000	Sure, sure
7337000	7339000	New trips for a few years
7339000	7341000	So
7341000	7343000	Yeah, that's my plan
7343000	7345000	Again, if there's this huge opportunity
7345000	7347000	For OLR, all games that I've heard
7347000	7349000	I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting
7349000	7351000	Again this year or anything
7351000	7353000	I think Bobby was heading all that up last year
7353000	7355000	And I think he's trying to do something
7355000	7357000	For at least his show this year
7357000	7359000	But I don't know if it's going to be as big as last year
7359000	7361000	And you have to remember guys
7361000	7363000	As I think some of us thought might happen
7363000	7365000	E3 did pull some of us away
7365000	7367000	And our money and time
7367000	7371000	That we were able to spend on PAX last year
7371000	7373000	There it is
7373000	7375000	Alright, but I am still hoping for PAX Boston
7375000	7377000	We'll see
7377000	7379000	But if you're going to PAX online, don't get me wrong
7379000	7381000	PAX is a fun con
7381000	7383000	Just because we're not going
7383000	7385000	I don't want people to get the wrong impression
7385000	7387000	It's just economy and so forth
7387000	7389000	The reasons why we're not going
7389000	7391000	But PAX is a fun con
7391000	7393000	If you just want to sit around and geek out
7393000	7397000	That's the best way I could describe PAX
7397000	7399000	Just geek out all weekend long
7399000	7402000	It's like an anime convention with a whole lot of games
7402000	7404000	Yeah, it's cool
7404000	7406000	I do want to go again
7406000	7408000	That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston
7408000	7410000	Because then it won't only be like
7410000	7412000	OMG PAX, but OMG
7412000	7414000	I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before
7414000	7416000	And I have friends there, so
7416000	7418000	Cool
7418000	7420000	What we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our
7420000	7422000	Email bag, and I'm sure the mail bag
7422000	7424000	Is busting at the seams this week
7424000	7426000	Because we haven't been on in a little while
7426000	7428000	I don't know, I think it's just average size
7428000	7430000	What are you doing over there?
7430000	7432000	You got a dude standing in his underwear
7432000	7434000	On The Sims, what are you doing?
7434000	7436000	It's a bathing suit, he's in a Speedo
7436000	7438000	Look, just the one problem
7438000	7440000	It looks like tighty whities from back here
7440000	7442000	Well, I think that they were based off
7442000	7444000	The same model, but
7444000	7446000	Wait, this doesn't answer the question
7446000	7448000	What are you doing
7448000	7450000	Designing a naked dude?
7450000	7452000	He's not naked
7452000	7454000	Half naked
7454000	7456000	I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in
7456000	7458000	You should have seen what I had him in
7458000	7460000	Here, here's what I had him in before
7460000	7462000	Yes
7462000	7464000	This makes for great radio, it's alright
7464000	7466000	I've seen these little short things before
7468000	7470000	That's what he was in before
7470000	7472000	He can stay in those, fine
7472000	7474000	No, I don't care, I just think it's funny
7474000	7476000	That I look over there and then suddenly
7476000	7478000	Yes, this is Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock
7480000	7482000	But the problem is that I
7482000	7484000	Changed out the default skin
7484000	7486000	So he's like extra buff now
7486000	7488000	And besides that, the underwear is better
7488000	7490000	Alright, let's
7490000	7492000	Go to the mail bag
7492000	7494000	You can go to orangeonsradio.com if you want to send us some emails
7496000	7498000	So, the first email
7498000	7500000	Duh duh duh
7500000	7502000	I'm trying to go in chronological order
7502000	7504000	But, um, this comes from
7508000	7510000	Okay, I'm really not gonna read the explanation
7510000	7512000	Of the guy's name
7512000	7514000	So, um, I apologize for fucking up your last show
7514000	7516000	I accidentally sent all my
7516000	7518000	Contacts that message
7518000	7520000	Do not hate me, I hate spam too
7520000	7522000	My email is filled with spam
7522000	7524000	As for the Skype shit, I was
7524000	7526000	Using my PSP on a horrible connection
7526000	7528000	I am in the market for a computer
7528000	7530000	This is one, isn't it? I remember reading this
7530000	7532000	Okay, that's who it is
7532000	7534000	Fuck Windows Vista
7534000	7536000	Do you know any good operating systems?
7536000	7538000	Yes, Linux Mint, it's free
7538000	7540000	Windows 7 is gonna be better than Vista
7540000	7542000	Linux Mint is better than it all
7544000	7546000	Um, next
7546000	7548000	And he sent a couple by accident
7548000	7550000	So I am just going to read the one
7550000	7552000	That looked like it made the most sense
7552000	7554000	Um, hey, O.L.R.
7554000	7556000	All I wanted to say
7556000	7558000	That almost all the game purchases I've made
7558000	7560000	I've recently made have either been
7560000	7562000	Talked about or recommended on your show
7562000	7564000	And I love them all
7564000	7566000	So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose
7566000	7568000	And it is this
7568000	7570000	Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well
7570000	7572000	Alive for the
7572000	7574000	Now old school gaming
7574000	7576000	And I would like to expand my gaming horizon
7576000	7578000	To include some old school stuff
7578000	7580000	So I was just wondering if you guys had
7580000	7582000	A good starter console for someone like me
7582000	7584000	Thanks guys, Mike V
7584000	7586000	13 years old?
7586000	7588000	13 Dude, I think
7588000	7590000	We had a listener that claims to be our youngest
7590000	7592000	Listener at 14, I think he just got beat
7592000	7594000	Sorry dude
7594000	7596000	Just pick up one of those, um
7596000	7598000	You know, used
7598000	7600000	I would say, like, if I have the Famicom
7600000	7602000	Um, NES
7602000	7604000	Systems that are kind of third party now
7604000	7606000	You can pick up, pick up one of those
7606000	7608000	Go to, like, one of your youth game shops
7608000	7610000	Or even, I was reading
7610000	7612000	There's a lot of people that found pretty good deals
7612000	7614000	At thrift stores and stuff, you can find some old consoles
7614000	7616000	I actually found
7616000	7618000	Discontinued games at thrift stores, like I found
7618000	7620000	Of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase
7620000	7622000	And Casey Munchkin
7622000	7624000	For the, uh, Odyssey 2
7624000	7626000	Wow
7626000	7628000	Or, you know, Dark Tetsuya makes a good point
7628000	7630000	Get the Wii
7630000	7632000	Or the Virtual Console
7632000	7634000	It's a pretty faithful recreation
7634000	7636000	Of the original stuff
7636000	7638000	Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13
7638000	7640000	I feel so old because that means I would have been
7640000	7642000	18 when he was born, oh my god
7642000	7644000	But, uh, Super Nintendo
7644000	7646000	If you missed out, I mean
7646000	7648000	Honestly, Super Nintendo, I don't think has ever
7648000	7650000	Been beaten in terms of great consoles
7650000	7652000	Super Nintendo was the best
7652000	7654000	Gaming console, purely 100%
7654000	7656000	Game console, Super Nintendo
7656000	7658000	Was the best gaming console they ever made
7658000	7660000	If you're gonna start anywhere, I say start there
7660000	7662000	Actually...
7662000	7664000	If you wanna start where we started, go to Atari 2600
7664000	7666000	But if you wanna just jump to the good shit
7666000	7668000	The Genesis, though, did have better versions
7668000	7670000	Of some games, like the copy of Mortal Combat
7670000	7672000	Well, Mortal Combat 2
7672000	7674000	And, um, Samurai Shodown
7674000	7676000	That was on Genesis for better
7676000	7678000	Super Nintendo did have a few better
7678000	7680000	Versions, like, um, Super Street Fighter 2
7680000	7682000	I thought was better on Super Nintendo
7682000	7684000	Um, the other, and this is
7684000	7686000	Of course, just for sampling purposes
7686000	7688000	You know, disclaimer, disclaimer
7688000	7690000	Disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try
7690000	7692000	Um, GameTap, or
7692000	7694000	You know, Zofar's Domain
7694000	7696000	But, I actually
7696000	7698000	The Wii's gonna be your best bet
7698000	7700000	You know, you can sample the
7700000	7702000	Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world
7702000	7704000	Neo Geo, you know
7704000	7706000	Go that way
7706000	7708000	That's actually not a bad recommendation
7708000	7710000	If you do wanna go all the way back to some of the
7710000	7712000	2600 games that we grew up on
7712000	7714000	Things like Adventure, Kaboom, uh
7714000	7716000	Keystone Kingdom, Kangaroo
7716000	7718000	Popeye, you know, you wanna go back to the
7718000	7720000	Really old school stuff, um, GameTap
7720000	7722000	Does actually have a lot of Atari 2600 in their
7722000	7724000	Library, I was actually playing, believe it or not
7724000	7726000	A couple weeks ago, I was playing Sword Quest
7726000	7728000	Cool, well, another thing too
7728000	7730000	Valve
7730000	7732000	The Steam Clan, you know, if you're
7732000	7734000	They don't have a lot of old
7734000	7736000	School stuff, but they have the old PC
7736000	7738000	Stuff that we played
7738000	7740000	Some of it, some of the old LucasArt stuff
7740000	7742000	Oh, yeah, I'll give you that, like, I just downloaded
7742000	7744000	Loom for five bucks, I'll give you that
7744000	7746000	I still wanna go buy
7746000	7748000	The TurboGrafx version that's 35
7748000	7750000	At a local store, but, hey
7750000	7752000	But, um
7752000	7754000	You know, and if you want a
7754000	7756000	List of actual games
7756000	7758000	Um
7758000	7760000	Go ahead and, go ahead and
7760000	7762000	Sample the different systems, see what you think
7762000	7764000	It would help to know what kind of games you're into
7764000	7766000	Like, are you liking the old school RPGs?
7766000	7768000	Are you liking the very simple things
7768000	7770000	On the Atari, cause you have the older
7770000	7772000	RPGs, you're gonna wanna go with the SNES
7772000	7774000	These arcade games were very much
7774000	7776000	All about repetition
7776000	7778000	Look at some of the greatest video games of all time
7778000	7780000	They came out of the 80s, Pac-Man
7780000	7782000	That board never frickin' changed
7782000	7784000	The whole time
7784000	7786000	Until it degraded
7786000	7788000	Donkey Kong, basically a loop of the same
7788000	7790000	What, three screens, right?
7790000	7792000	Three with the, um, the Pie Factory
7792000	7794000	The Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one
7794000	7796000	Yeah, play the one with the Pie Factory
7796000	7798000	You're not really playing Donkey Kong
7798000	7800000	Play the Kill Screen
7800000	7802000	Yeah
7802000	7804000	Beat What's-His-Face, Billy What's-His-Face
7804000	7806000	Yeah
7806000	7808000	You know what, that's what I'd like to see
7808000	7810000	Our young 13 year old listener accomplish
7810000	7812000	Make it a life goal to
7812000	7814000	Beat some of these scores on these 80s games
7816000	7818000	But if you're into repetition games, go for the
7818000	7820000	Old games from the Atari 2600
7820000	7822000	I know repetition often sounds like a bad thing
7822000	7824000	But it's not, I mean, Bejeweled is kind of
7824000	7826000	A repetitive game, you know, you realize
7826000	7828000	A game like Bejeweled could've been made on the Atari
7828000	7830000	2600, there's no reason that
7830000	7832000	Game could not have been made on the Atari 2600
7832000	7834000	Um, seriously, it wouldn't be as pretty, but hey
7834000	7836000	No, it wouldn't be as nice looking, it probably wouldn't have
7836000	7838000	Caught on back then, but
7838000	7840000	That's totally a game that I could've seen back in the day
7840000	7842000	Okay
7844000	7846000	Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay
7846000	7848000	Um,
7848000	7850000	Hi all, as per usual, I thought
7850000	7852000	That I'd write in with a few topics
7852000	7854000	First off, I'd like to get some opinions
7854000	7856000	On an ongoing debate that I've been having
7856000	7858000	With a neighbor. You see, my neighbor
7858000	7860000	Is a rabid, no, not in the literal sense
7860000	7862000	If not fanatical Beatles fan
7862000	7864000	I don't know anyone like that, do I?
7864000	7866000	Tease, tease, tease
7866000	7868000	I mean, it's to the point that I'm
7868000	7870000	Surprised he hasn't already built an
7870000	7872000	Altar enshrined to them and started a Beatles
7872000	7874000	Cult. The debate specifically
7874000	7876000	Centers around whether or not the Beatles
7876000	7878000	Right band game should be made or not
7878000	7880000	My neighbor's attitude or position, if you
7880000	7882000	Will, is that it shouldn't be made at all
7882000	7884000	To do so would essentially
7884000	7886000	Be sacrilege. He believes that the band
7886000	7888000	Is something special and not a game
7888000	7890000	And he further continually states
7890000	7892000	That you had to be there
7892000	7894000	I, I
7894000	7896000	I assume this is an older neighbor
7896000	7898000	Then, um, I continually remind
7898000	7900000	Him that the Beatles are a band, not the
7900000	7902000	Second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it
7902000	7904000	Ultimately, the decision of whether or not
7904000	7906000	The game gets made
7906000	7908000	Lies with the band, the copyright
7908000	7910000	Owners of their music and
7910000	7912000	EA, and really, he has
7912000	7914000	A very rare say. All he can do is decide
7914000	7916000	Whether or not to buy the game. I tell him that
7916000	7918000	Even though the band may enjoy
7918000	7920000	Uh, enjoy playing music
7920000	7922000	Ultimately, they, as well as
7922000	7924000	Just about any band out there, have three goals
7924000	7926000	Become famous, become rich, and get laid
7926000	7928000	I don't think so
7928000	7930000	You need to remember this, too, is that
7930000	7932000	And this is something to tell your neighbor, is that
7932000	7934000	At E3, let's not forget
7934000	7936000	Paul McCartney
7936000	7938000	Ringo Starr
7938000	7940000	Yoko Ono
7940000	7942000	To Harrison's wife, sorry, I forget her name
7942000	7944000	They all came out on stage
7944000	7946000	In support of this game
7946000	7948000	Yeah, so
7948000	7950000	The end, sorry
7950000	7952000	Yeah, tell your neighbor that
7952000	7954000	Um, I ask him that if he were in the Beatles
7954000	7956000	Would he have turned down buttloads of money
7956000	7958000	That EA was shelling out to make the game
7958000	7960000	Every time he tries to say he would have
7960000	7962000	I outright call on the bullshit answer
7962000	7964000	Well, you know
7964000	7966000	There are people who
7966000	7968000	Um
7968000	7970000	Who actually
7970000	7972000	Are really talented
7972000	7974000	Musicians who are
7974000	7976000	In bands for the purpose
7976000	7978000	Of enjoying their music
7978000	7980000	That they play
7980000	7982000	These are, now maybe they don't all become
7982000	7984000	Famous, maybe they have a small
7984000	7986000	Following, but the first reason
7986000	7988000	That I think anyone
7988000	7990000	If anyone has any integrity
7990000	7992000	And wants to get into music
7992000	7994000	Is because they love it
7994000	7996000	You know
7996000	7998000	Can I read these real quick?
7998000	8000000	Marissa Cungusto has a great comment
8000000	8002000	My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent
8002000	8004000	With their image or message
8004000	8006000	But if it creates new fans, cool
8006000	8008000	And yeah, especially when we talk about generation
8008000	8010000	And this whole thing, you know
8010000	8012000	Certainly the 13 year old who emailed us before
8012000	8014000	Wasn't around when the Beatles
8014000	8016000	Were big, but you know
8016000	8018000	I wasn't around when the Beatles were big
8018000	8020000	But I can appreciate their music through things like this
8020000	8022000	But I like this too
8022000	8024000	Geekboy2424 says
8024000	8026000	Yoko the neighbor will go crazy
8026000	8028000	Good point, leave Yoko out of that story
8028000	8030000	Don't say Yoko came out on stage
8032000	8034000	At any rate though
8034000	8036000	I don't think that
8036000	8038000	I think it's a generalization to say
8038000	8040000	That people
8040000	8042000	Get in a band to be famous
8042000	8044000	Rich and get laid
8044000	8046000	Seriously, I think that
8046000	8048000	The first thing
8048000	8050000	And this is honestly
8050000	8052000	Because I've done things
8052000	8054000	With groups before, like I was in a jazz band
8054000	8056000	And I played in a jazz band
8056000	8058000	We didn't get paid for shit
8058000	8060000	I mean, they maybe gave us some gas money
8060000	8062000	But we did it because it was something that we loved to do
8062000	8064000	That you know
8064000	8066000	You like getting the crowd into it
8066000	8068000	Knowing that you're sort of evoking
8068000	8070000	That emotional response
8070000	8072000	And you know, the people that you're performing for
8072000	8074000	I think that's a big thing
8074000	8076000	It's a massive adrenaline rush
8076000	8078000	You know, I think that the
8078000	8080000	The people who I think
8080000	8082000	They've had staying power
8082000	8084000	The people that love what they do
8084000	8086000	In the end, that's honestly what I think
8086000	8088000	Yeah, usually these bands
8088000	8090000	That are created to get laid
8090000	8092000	Are the ones that break up after one album
8092000	8094000	Yeah
8094000	8096000	Next area here
8096000	8098000	This may be old news to the three of you
8098000	8100000	But for the sake of other listeners
8100000	8102000	I thought I'd throw this out there especially
8102000	8104000	For those who own both the 360
8104000	8106000	As well as the PS3
8106000	8108000	Apparently if you have an external
8108000	8110000	32 with miscellaneous media on it
8110000	8112000	Music Fodios, whatever
8112000	8114000	The HDD will work
8114000	8116000	On both systems
8116000	8118000	This does not mean you can play system specific
8118000	8120000	DLC or downloadable games
8120000	8122000	On the other system, it just means that you can
8122000	8124000	Use the other media on both systems
8124000	8126000	I discovered that my external hard drive
8126000	8128000	Worked on my 360 last week
8128000	8130000	Last weekend, shortly after the last show
8130000	8132000	Typically I use them on my PS3
8132000	8134000	Finally
8134000	8136000	As per usual
8136000	8138000	I hear that as per usual
8138000	8140000	It makes me think of Eddie Izzard
8140000	8142000	We've left you a huge fuck off horse
8142000	8144000	As per usual
8144000	8146000	Sorry
8146000	8148000	I thought I'd end this email with some of my
8148000	8150000	Visual recommendations from the video section
8150000	8152000	Of the PSN store
8152000	8154000	This week I have three recommendations
8154000	8156000	Season 1 of the original Transformer series from the 80s
8156000	8158000	Woohoo!
8158000	8160000	Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan
8160000	8162000	And centers around two warring clans
8162000	8164000	Of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8
8164000	8166000	Okay
8166000	8168000	The rest 4, 5, and 6
8168000	8170000	In limbo
8170000	8172000	With these selections, you can't go wrong
8172000	8174000	Zarkon ate them
8174000	8176000	As they are all pretty good
8176000	8178000	Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email
8178000	8180000	It's appreciated, this email is brought to you by Florida
8180000	8182000	The Lemp Wengus of America
8182000	8184000	Who's that from?
8184000	8186000	MrSpazzinator
8186000	8188000	Is that it, or we got more?
8188000	8190000	Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me
8190000	8192000	Huh
8192000	8194000	The band that was formed mostly to get laid
8194000	8196000	Was poisoned
8196000	8198000	And they were very successful
8198000	8200000	That guy's still getting laid
8200000	8202000	Seriously
8202000	8204000	Good point
8204000	8206000	He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid
8206000	8208000	This comes
8208000	8210000	Okay
8210000	8212000	I originally intended this message to be
8212000	8214000	A Rob I miss you
8214000	8216000	And wow type of thing
8216000	8218000	And then I came to the website to see the
8218000	8220000	OLR's template
8220000	8222000	I hope on hiatus
8222000	8224000	Say I think so
8224000	8226000	I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things
8226000	8228000	Are well with everyone
8228000	8230000	Guess I'll have to wait and see
8230000	8232000	Oh and Rob, I do miss seeing you and well
8232000	8234000	Maybe we can play together again sometime
8234000	8236000	Your old pally
8236000	8238000	Ghoulie
8238000	8240000	Nintinctus
8240000	8242000	99
8242000	8244000	Oh I see
8244000	8246000	It's 99 cents without vowels
8246000	8248000	Yep
8248000	8250000	You know I have my reasons
8250000	8252000	For leaving wow and
8252000	8254000	I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO
8254000	8256000	I'll be in Final Fantasy 14 for sure
8256000	8258000	For sure, no doubt
8258000	8260000	At least when it first comes out
8260000	8262000	I'm gonna have to play it for the first month
8262000	8264000	Just to see
8264000	8266000	Whether it goes beyond that I don't know
8266000	8268000	Just you know wow I think I just finally
8268000	8270000	You know you play something for so long
8270000	8272000	You just finally like I just don't have it in me anymore
8272000	8274000	Rob with two B's
8274000	8276000	Our dear friend who always links me to informative
8276000	8278000	Articles
8278000	8280000	Linked a couple that were on
8280000	8282000	Game politics
8282000	8284000	One of them saying that video games
8286000	8288000	Are blamed for low vitamin D
8288000	8290000	In children
8290000	8292000	Because they're not going out in the sun enough
8292000	8294000	I would suppose so
8294000	8296000	And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure
8296000	8298000	I
8298000	8300000	Think that really it's more
8300000	8302000	For the high blood pressure I would really think that it's
8302000	8304000	More of the
8304000	8306000	Not getting out and getting enough exercise
8306000	8308000	Sort of thing
8308000	8310000	And also low vitamin D
8310000	8312000	Exactly you said kids aren't getting enough sunlight
8312000	8314000	But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things
8314000	8316000	And I don't watch Oprah but it was on in the waiting room
8316000	8318000	Of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed
8318000	8320000	Is that
8320000	8322000	Most people
8322000	8324000	Especially in America
8324000	8326000	And in big cities
8326000	8328000	Are very vitamin D deficient
8328000	8330000	Because of sunblock
8330000	8332000	I actually
8332000	8334000	I'm not allowed to use sunblock because I
8334000	8336000	Am very vitamin D deficient myself
8336000	8338000	I have to use sunblock
8338000	8340000	Or I'll have to take supplements or something
8340000	8342000	If I'm lacking it
8342000	8344000	What they say is that everyone should have
8344000	8346000	15 minutes of
8346000	8348000	Unfiltered sunlight
8348000	8350000	15 minutes a day
8350000	8352000	I can handle that if I wear a hat
8352000	8354000	Well you can put it on your face
8354000	8356000	I still use my makeup past sunblock
8356000	8358000	In and on my face
8358000	8360000	But I um
8360000	8362000	I can be outside for like
8362000	8364000	Intense periods of time
8364000	8366000	And even then I only really wear an SPF 15
8366000	8368000	Because I'm that
8368000	8370000	I was pretty on the dangerous side of low
8370000	8372000	I always wear like an SPF 70
8372000	8374000	But that's only when I'm going to be out all day
8374000	8376000	Disneyland
8376000	8378000	Or Great America
8378000	8380000	It's just dumb not to do that
8380000	8382000	Well the way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies
8382000	8384000	Is the synthesis is made with vitamin A
8384000	8386000	And UV radiation
8386000	8388000	Sunlight
8388000	8390000	Not
8390000	8392000	I'm kidding
8392000	8394000	What are we talking about I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention
8394000	8396000	Like breakfast cereal
8396000	8398000	That's why you eat special K because you get lots of vitamins in it remember
8398000	8400000	Drink fortified milk
8400000	8402000	Eat your Wheaties
8402000	8404000	I would love to drink the vitamin D milk
8404000	8406000	You can't by the way supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish
8406000	8408000	What are the vitamins
8408000	8410000	Since I'm going to ask
8410000	8412000	Totally tangent that you can get too much of
8412000	8414000	Like C you can never get enough vitamin C
8414000	8416000	Like you know if you get too much you go
8416000	8418000	You peep it out
8418000	8420000	Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones
8420000	8422000	Or is there a limit
8422000	8424000	I know zinc has a danger
8424000	8426000	Your minerals will have a limit
8426000	8428000	Iron, zinc and all that
8428000	8430000	With vitamins actually you can have an overdose
8430000	8432000	Of niacin but it takes a long time
8432000	8434000	To build up
8434000	8436000	Beta carotene turns your skin orange
8436000	8438000	I did that when I was 2 true story
8438000	8440000	When I was 2 years old I had my parents I dated in the ER
8440000	8442000	What was your name on the Partridge Family
8442000	8444000	Susan Day
8444000	8446000	The Partridge Family
8446000	8448000	Come on get happy
8448000	8450000	She ate so many carrots
8450000	8452000	Because that's all she ate
8452000	8454000	That she had a build up of beta carotene in her system
8454000	8456000	But you know the yellow rice
8456000	8458000	That they passed out internationally
8458000	8460000	Is actually beta carotene fortified
8460000	8462000	Because of deficiencies in those areas
8462000	8464000	I'm just saying
8464000	8466000	There's just certain
8466000	8468000	You know me
8468000	8470000	She's not a doctor
8470000	8472000	I'm a big nutrition nerd
8472000	8474000	You know even if I don't even follow my own advice
8474000	8476000	All the time I still know it
8476000	8478000	Because I worked at GNC like freaking forever
8478000	8480000	So I had to be able to warn people
8480000	8482000	You know because I'm not one of those idiots
8482000	8484000	Who just says oh you can take it you're fine
8484000	8486000	Have some ephedra with your hypertension
8486000	8488000	No you won't have a heart attack
8488000	8490000	Anyway
8490000	8492000	So to go ahead and back to the rest of the email
8492000	8494000	Two back to back articles on game politics
8494000	8496000	Link two different studies blaming
8496000	8498000	The health of defects of children on video games
8498000	8500000	We all know how ridiculous that is
8500000	8502000	To put it in perspective
8502000	8504000	To a non-game player
8504000	8506000	The claims are also stating
8506000	8508000	These two things are also caused by video games
8508000	8510000	One playing video games reduces
8510000	8512000	Incidence of skin cancer
8512000	8514000	That's back to the sun
8514000	8516000	Two playing video games reduces
8516000	8518000	Bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries
8518000	8520000	Well duh
8520000	8522000	It sounds even worse
8522000	8524000	When you talk about the benefits
8524000	8526000	Of video games benefits in quotes
8526000	8528000	It points out that the events
8528000	8530000	Playing video games and ailments
8530000	8532000	Very independently of each other
8532000	8534000	Silly pseudo-scientists
8536000	8538000	It's just a bunch of ridiculousness
8540000	8542000	Also
8542000	8544000	Playing video games gives you
8544000	8546000	A rash
8546000	8548000	Kidding. Itchy
8548000	8550000	Last email
8550000	8552000	Hey O.L.R. Crew
8552000	8554000	Hey
8554000	8556000	Hey
8556000	8558000	A.C.H.P here
8558000	8560000	I got a joke for you
8560000	8562000	Was it Kelly? Hey
8562000	8564000	No what do gay horses eat?
8564000	8566000	Hey
8566000	8568000	We are the Supreme Court
8568000	8570000	Alright read the damn email
8570000	8572000	I'll put the mic down I promise
8572000	8574000	Okay
8574000	8576000	See you heard it. That was Rob putting down the mic
8576000	8578000	A.C.H.P here
8578000	8580000	First of all I'm glad that
8580000	8582000	Where's the duct tape? Let's just tape his hands together
8582000	8584000	First of all I'm glad that my last email
8584000	8586000	Was a gold star
8586000	8588000	Now I doubt this one
8588000	8590000	Will earn similar acclaim
8590000	8592000	But I want to relate to you all briefly
8592000	8594000	A synopsis of the way
8594000	8596000	Way off broadway DDR musical I came across
8596000	8598000	On the internet. What?
8598000	8600000	And hopefully it will distribute you all as much as it did me
8600000	8602000	Well it got a let from me
8602000	8604000	Stop me if you've heard this one
8604000	8606000	Long story short there's a guy named
8606000	8608000	Moonbeam Funk which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first
8608000	8610000	Who carries around
8610000	8612000	A fetus in a jar on his belt
8612000	8614000	And starts a dance revolution in the city
8614000	8616000	Where dancing is prohibited
8616000	8618000	Wasn't that Footloose?
8618000	8620000	Anyway
8620000	8622000	He is joined by a small child named
8622000	8624000	Small Child
8624000	8626000	And Small Child's
8626000	8628000	Prostitute Sister Trampoline Sally
8628000	8630000	Moonbeam is about to
8630000	8632000	Unleash a dance move called
8632000	8634000	The Flaming Rooster
8634000	8636000	But it is stopped by a policeman who
8636000	8638000	Wears kilts
8638000	8640000	The revolution disbands Moonbeam Funk
8640000	8642000	Leaves and comes back later to have
8642000	8644000	Sex with Trampoline Sally after performing
8644000	8646000	The Flaming Rooster
8646000	8648000	Kills her during sex and ends up in a
8648000	8650000	Catastrophic level 9 dance off
8650000	8652000	See what they did there?
8652000	8654000	Ordered by a judge where he faces off against
8654000	8656000	Jacquece who loved Trampoline Sally
8656000	8658000	That had his legs broken by the police
8658000	8660000	However Trampoline Sally's ghost gives
8660000	8662000	Jacquece dancer juice
8662000	8664000	And he wins despite having broken legs
8664000	8666000	Okay I can't take it
8666000	8668000	I picked the mic up
8668000	8670000	Moonbeam Funk returns to his home
8670000	8672000	Planet using gravity shoes
8672000	8674000	You can't make this stuff up
8674000	8676000	This is somewhere between
8676000	8678000	Camp that they know as
8678000	8680000	Camp and the most pretentious
8680000	8682000	Goddamn modern art bullshit
8682000	8684000	I've ever heard of in my life
8684000	8686000	Remember they made a DDR movie
8686000	8688000	One time in Japan
8688000	8690000	Whatever, stop trying to make a movie
8690000	8692000	Out of DDR, they are all stupid
8692000	8694000	Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan
8694000	8696000	No it wasn't
8696000	8698000	There's more
8698000	8700000	I remember that, sorry I just remembered how hilarious
8700000	8702000	That movie was
8702000	8704000	Now while this may still seem
8704000	8706000	Still sound like the best musical ever
8706000	8708000	Bullshit
8708000	8710000	The one thing
8710000	8712000	It could do to ruin itself
8712000	8714000	More than it already had it did
8714000	8716000	They didn't use Tack
8716000	8718000	They didn't use B4U
8718000	8720000	They didn't use Oh just name of the money artists
8720000	8722000	They didn't use them
8722000	8724000	No they used DDR, Disney's rave music
8724000	8726000	Yes, Zippity Doo Da and Chim Chim Cheree
8726000	8728000	And Night of Fire
8728000	8730000	I left out a lot of things but you can check out the article
8730000	8732000	At vjarmy.com
8732000	8734000	I'll go ahead and read it
8734000	8736000	I'm actually going to put it in the chatroom
8736000	8738000	But it's vjarmy.com
8738000	8740000	Slash archive slash 2008
8740000	8742000	Slash 12 slash bucket of
8742000	8744000	Tears dot PHP
8744000	8746000	And that's all
8746000	8748000	Separated by an underscore
8748000	8750000	For details
8750000	8752000	The best word I can think of to describe this play
8752000	8754000	Sounds like is gay-tarded
8754000	8756000	I mean that's really what it sounds like
8756000	8758000	Like you know you don't want to say that's gay
8758000	8760000	Because that's offensive, you don't want to say that's retarded
8760000	8762000	Because that's actually really offensive too
8762000	8764000	So I'm going to make up a new word
8764000	8766000	So when it's a new word it wouldn't be offensive to either group
8766000	8768000	I still like my word, but-tard
8768000	8770000	But-tard?
8770000	8772000	I've been using that for years
8772000	8774000	So this play sounds completely gay-tarded
8774000	8776000	Is what it sounds like
8776000	8778000	I can't fathom
8778000	8780000	Paying money
8780000	8782000	New York City theater can sometimes be expensive
8782000	8784000	Like how much money do they want for this?
8784000	8786000	I don't know
8786000	8788000	Wow, I mean anybody can do theater
8788000	8792000	It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make
8792000	8794000	That's pretty nasty
8794000	8796000	Hopefully this email isn't too long
8796000	8798000	To make it to the show
8798000	8800000	Because I think a lot of old fans of DDR
8800000	8802000	Will get a laugh
8802000	8804000	Or at least a facepalm out of this
8804000	8806000	I got both
8806000	8808000	Long live DDR EZHP
8808000	8810000	That's for $20 says Rama
8810000	8812000	No thank you
8812000	8814000	That's $20 I could spend on like
8814000	8816000	Cocaine or something
8816000	8818000	You know, like
8818000	8820000	And I could probably see the same things
8820000	8822000	We did get a couple more emails
8822000	8824000	Don't do drugs kids
8824000	8826000	We also did get a couple more emails
8826000	8828000	But one's for Loki and one of them we just got
8828000	8830000	So I'll read it next week
8830000	8832000	Winners don't use drugs folks
8832000	8834000	Unless you're on steroids
8834000	8836000	And are on the Chinese swim team
8836000	8838000	If you would like to send us an email
8838000	8840000	And the folks in chat are pointing out
8840000	8842000	It's way off Broadway
8842000	8844000	As in way way way off Broadway
8844000	8846000	Like it's in Staten Island
8846000	8848000	That's how far off Broadway it is
8848000	8850000	I don't know if that's true or not
8850000	8852000	A couple more stories for you guys
8852000	8854000	And then your calls on the skype line
8854000	8856000	At 877-GAME-OLR
8856000	8858000	Loki
8858000	8860000	So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion
8860000	8862000	That's gonna actually
8862000	8864000	Build upon
8864000	8866000	Some new modes here
8866000	8868000	Wrecking Crew mode
8868000	8870000	Which features different challenges
8870000	8872000	Including
8872000	8874000	I guess different combinations of
8874000	8876000	Weapons
8876000	8878000	Backpack settings
8878000	8880000	And sub modes
8880000	8882000	Basically you just destroy as much crap as possible
8882000	8884000	And then you get put on leaderboards and whatnot
8884000	8886000	They've added some more levels
8886000	8888000	For that
8888000	8890000	I guess the 4 pre-order bonus levels
8890000	8892000	That everybody got
8892000	8894000	That are pre-ordered in game
8894000	8896000	Now are unlocked for everybody
8896000	8898000	Including 10 more levels as well
8898000	8900000	And they've added
8900000	8902000	Weapon and backpack disabling in multiplayer
8902000	8904000	If you feel like doing that
8904000	8906000	XP multiplayer for matchmaking
8906000	8908000	Playlists
8908000	8910000	Double XP playlists are now possible
8910000	8912000	Or deposits
8912000	8914000	On the mini-map
8914000	8916000	And support for upcoming
8916000	8918000	Download content as well
8918000	8920000	And then other fixes
8920000	8922000	They've done
8922000	8924000	Just some other glitches
8924000	8926000	That they were running into
8926000	8928000	Drops in multiplayer
8928000	8930000	Certain ties not being recorded
8930000	8932000	In leaderboards and whatnot
8932000	8934000	So overall
8934000	8936000	A pretty nice update
8936000	8938000	But
8938000	8940000	I still haven't played this game yet
8940000	8942000	And that makes me really sad
8942000	8944000	Is this a game that's very popular?
8944000	8946000	Are there a lot of people playing this?
8946000	8948000	This isn't usually the type of game that's up my alley
8948000	8950000	It's kind of popular
8950000	8952000	It's like Saints Row set on Mars
8952000	8954000	But you can blow up everything
8954000	8956000	Sounds good to me
8956000	8958000	I always like blowing things up
8958000	8960000	Saints Row set on Mars
8960000	8962000	That's a really good way of describing it
8962000	8964000	Well I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row
8964000	8966000	But it's the same developer
8966000	8968000	And it's that open world kind of feel to it
8968000	8970000	I think it's a little bit more linear
8970000	8972000	This game
8972000	8974000	But it looks fun
8974000	8976000	Interesting
8976000	8978000	And of course when I hear Wrecking Crew mode
8978000	8980000	I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew
8980000	8982000	Remember that?
8982000	8984000	It was crap
8984000	8986000	Woot explosion says Missy in chat
8986000	8988000	Absolutely
8988000	8992000	Alright let's go on to one more story here tonight
8992000	8996000	And then we're going to open up our skypelines at 877-GAME-OLR
8996000	9000000	And this story has to do with porn
9000000	9002000	That's right
9002000	9004000	DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan
9004000	9006000	They are going to be bringing on demand
9006000	9008000	Blu-ray quality
9008000	9010000	HD adult movies to the Playstation 3
9010000	9012000	Woohoo
9012000	9014000	Console wars over
9014000	9016000	That's right
9016000	9018000	Didn't I say that
9018000	9020000	The system that gets porn first would win?
9020000	9022000	No that was HD DVD
9022000	9024000	And Blu-ray wasn't it?
9024000	9026000	I don't remember
9026000	9028000	Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show
9028000	9030000	The problem with that is they adopted both
9030000	9032000	Anyway
9032000	9034000	You do have to have a broadband connection
9034000	9036000	An HDMI cable of course if you want the high def
9036000	9038000	And of course a Playstation 3
9038000	9040000	You will download the movies for a fee
9040000	9044000	You go onto this dmm.tv Blu-ray website
9044000	9046000	And then you can search for titles by
9046000	9048000	Actress, keyword, what have you
9048000	9050000	So if you've ever wanted to see
9050000	9052000	Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators
9052000	9054000	There you go, you can watch that on
9054000	9056000	Playstation 3 in full
9056000	9058000	High definition, congratulations
9058000	9060000	Now what's kind of interesting about that
9060000	9062000	It's kind of bypassed Sony somehow
9062000	9064000	It sounds like you're logging into their website
9064000	9066000	And downloading them to your PS3 or something
9066000	9068000	Isn't that what it sounds like to you?
9068000	9070000	This can't be sponsored by Sony
9070000	9072000	This must be using the web browser
9072000	9074000	And some type of backdoor or something
9074000	9076000	Pun intended
9076000	9078000	It might be downloading
9078000	9080000	Video files to your PS3 or something like that
9080000	9082000	Or downloading them to your PC
9082000	9084000	So you can watch them on your PS3
9084000	9086000	I don't know
9086000	9088000	Maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there
9088000	9090000	Who knows
9090000	9094000	Vidpower calls this 1080p-ness
9094000	9098000	Ba-dum-bum
9098000	9100000	God I love the listeners
9100000	9102000	Don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?
9102000	9104000	At least all the ones I've ever seen
9104000	9106000	Of course I always saw the funny ones
9106000	9108000	Like Final Fuck X and all that
9108000	9110000	Where they did blur it out
9110000	9112000	Yeah they're all blurred out
9112000	9114000	Unless it's softcore
9114000	9116000	It's just all the Vash P and stuff gets blurred out
9116000	9118000	SSJ100Matt says
9118000	9122000	All we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples
9122000	9124000	We got a bunch of comedians
9124000	9126000	Tonight
9126000	9128000	Oh god this is awful I'm reading that article by the way
9128000	9130000	D5T is calling
9130000	9132000	Dot fuck apparently
9132000	9134000	Instead of dot hack there's a
9134000	9136000	Porn called dot fuck
9136000	9138000	That's funny
9140000	9142000	Oh my gosh
9142000	9144000	You know what?
9144000	9146000	Whatever
9146000	9148000	Something I think
9148000	9150000	I don't know do I want to go on a tangent?
9150000	9152000	Why not? We have plenty of time
9152000	9154000	We're going to be opening up the skype line soon anyway
9154000	9156000	Something to remember
9156000	9158000	Everybody has sex
9158000	9160000	That's how we get here
9160000	9162000	Granted I realize that some people define themselves
9162000	9164000	As asexual
9164000	9166000	Which means you don't really
9166000	9168000	Care for sex
9168000	9170000	But I'm still assuming that at one point or another
9170000	9172000	You've tried it
9172000	9174000	Everybody has sex
9174000	9176000	So what's the big deal at some point
9176000	9178000	I mean if you're the 13 year old listening
9178000	9180000	You should not be having sex yet
9180000	9182000	According to Oprah
9182000	9184000	You probably already are
9184000	9186000	You know what?
9186000	9188000	I don't have
9188000	9190000	That same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week
9190000	9192000	For better health
9192000	9194000	I don't have a problem admitting
9194000	9196000	I was 20 so you know
9196000	9198000	By Oprah I would be a late bloomer
9198000	9200000	And I know there's people that wait even longer than that
9200000	9202000	I was 30, 35, 40
9202000	9204000	That's fine
9204000	9206000	But I'm saying at some point
9206000	9208000	This is not a spiel about virginity
9208000	9210000	My spiel is about everybody
9210000	9212000	Has sex
9212000	9214000	Or thinks about having sex
9214000	9216000	So why is porn
9216000	9218000	Such a big taboo, big deal thing
9218000	9220000	I mean you know
9220000	9222000	They should just get over it and put porn there
9222000	9224000	We're in a country that was founded by Puritans
9224000	9226000	Because they have 100 masturbators
9226000	9228000	In that film
9228000	9230000	That's just way too much
9230000	9232000	Masturbating
9232000	9234000	And besides
9234000	9236000	You own a PS3
9236000	9238000	If you're interested in this
9238000	9240000	Therefore you have access to the internet
9240000	9242000	Therefore you have access to U-Porn
9242000	9244000	And many other porn alternatives
9244000	9246000	That are free
9246000	9248000	Why would you pay for porn
9248000	9250000	When you can get it for free
9250000	9252000	Do you have a day on chat that says
9252000	9254000	I was 21
9254000	9256000	My cousin is almost 25
9256000	9258000	And she's still a virgin
9258000	9260000	Nothing wrong with that, but she probably thinks about it
9260000	9262000	I mean she probably still thinks
9262000	9264000	That doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex
9264000	9266000	Doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn
9266000	9268000	In fact
9268000	9270000	The other day we were
9270000	9272000	For the hell of it, just for fun
9272000	9274000	Shits and giggles I guess
9274000	9276000	We decided to watch the triple x parody of
9276000	9278000	Friends
9278000	9280000	And I can tell you it was awful
9280000	9282000	What was it called, fucks?
9282000	9284000	No, frenzy triple x parody
9284000	9286000	It's ridiculous, none of the characters look like
9286000	9288000	The other characters from the show
9288000	9290000	And they're really exaggerated
9290000	9292000	As far as how they act
9292000	9294000	It's just so ridiculous, but it was funny
9294000	9296000	Did somebody at some point
9296000	9298000	Look at one of the girls and go
9298000	9300000	How you doin?
9300000	9302000	No, unfortunately no they didn't
9302000	9304000	But the woman's name was Monika instead of Monica
9304000	9306000	Cause of course they have to do that
9306000	9308000	I love porn parodies so much
9308000	9310000	They're so funny
9310000	9312000	I still like the Ali McFeel one
9312000	9314000	I liked Beaver and Buttface
9314000	9316000	I haven't seen that one
9316000	9318000	They have Office
9318000	9320000	Seriously, all the TV shows now
9320000	9322000	Are parodies, Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek
9322000	9324000	The best line I've ever heard
9324000	9326000	In a porno was in Beaver and Buttface
9326000	9328000	Huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something
9328000	9330000	Laughing
9330000	9332000	That's awful
9332000	9334000	Laughing
9334000	9336000	And on that note, let's open up the phone lines
9336000	9338000	1877-GAME-OLR
9338000	9340000	Our username on skype
9340000	9342000	Orange Lounge Radio
9342000	9344000	There we go, we're off the Do Not Disturb mode now
9344000	9346000	Laughing
9346000	9348000	1877-GAME-OLR
9348000	9350000	Our username on skype
9350000	9352000	We will take calls here tonight
9352000	9354000	And look, we're already ringing
9354000	9356000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9356000	9358000	This is Ronman, I wanna know
9358000	9360000	When did this become Porn Lounge Radio?
9360000	9362000	You know what, it's been a few weeks
9362000	9364000	We have a lot of pent up energy
9364000	9366000	What can we say, what's on your mind tonight?
9366000	9368000	Yeah, I can see that
9368000	9370000	Before I start
9370000	9372000	Loki, just because the porn is free
9372000	9374000	Doesn't mean it's that good
9374000	9376000	Just so you know
9376000	9378000	You're just not looking hard enough
9378000	9380000	I look more to my fair share
9380000	9382000	Okay, I look more than anybody else
9382000	9384000	In the chat room, okay?
9384000	9386000	Laughing
9386000	9388000	But um, the reason why I called
9388000	9390000	Is to make a comment about the whole
9390000	9392000	Best Buy price matching
9392000	9394000	Thingamabobber here
9394000	9396000	Yeah, pretty
9396000	9398000	It pretty much did still make their money
9400000	9402000	How so?
9402000	9404000	Alright, I used to work for Best Buy
9404000	9406000	And the discounts at the time were great
9406000	9408000	5% above retail core
9408000	9410000	They paid for it
9410000	9412000	I bought a cable for my PS2
9412000	9414000	That retailed for $9.99
9414000	9416000	I paid $1.72 for it
9420000	9422000	Interesting
9422000	9424000	I mean
9424000	9426000	Even if they take a $5 loss off the games
9426000	9428000	They're still going to make the money back
9428000	9430000	Off of the accessories on the games
9430000	9432000	Accessories for the consoles
9432000	9434000	Accessories for home theater
9434000	9436000	The electronics, everything
9436000	9438000	That's absolutely not true
9438000	9440000	I mean, yes, it's true in the long run
9440000	9442000	They're going to cost average that stuff
9442000	9444000	Across all the different lines
9444000	9446000	That they carry
9446000	9448000	That's why they can take a loss on games
9448000	9450000	And still be fine because they mark up everything else
9450000	9452000	And it just averages out
9452000	9454000	But if you're looking at strictly games
9454000	9456000	I mean, okay, let's say
9456000	9458000	The average Xbox 360 game
9458000	9460000	Is $48
9460000	9462000	Their cost
9462000	9464000	And they may get it cheaper
9464000	9466000	It's roughly the high 40's though
9466000	9468000	Is what they're paying for
9468000	9470000	And yes, there is a markup there
9470000	9472000	And yeah, if they drop it down $5
9472000	9474000	They're not really losing a lot of money
9474000	9476000	So, I mean, they could do it
9476000	9478000	And it's definitely possible
9478000	9480000	That the margin on accessories is about 20%
9480000	9482000	On average, if not more than that
9482000	9484000	But, um
9484000	9486000	Yeah, I mean, I guess there is
9486000	9488000	They won't really be losing
9488000	9490000	Out a lot
9490000	9492000	But it could get ridiculous
9492000	9494000	Especially if they're dropping the prices
9494000	9496000	Of used games at GameStop or whatever
9496000	9498000	And they continually do this
9498000	9500000	I don't know, I don't see this program being very successful
9500000	9502000	I mean, it's going to be successful
9502000	9504000	But not their benefit, I guess
9504000	9506000	Well, it depends
9506000	9508000	I mean, if they do this
9508000	9510000	They probably won't be having to do their
9510000	9512000	Fire sales that they have on games
9512000	9514000	Like every 8 or 9 months, give or take
9514000	9516000	Hmm
9516000	9518000	I guess we'll see
9518000	9520000	Do you really think, though
9520000	9522000	They're going to expand it past this Utah store
9522000	9524000	I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking
9524000	9526000	Honestly
9526000	9528000	I don't think so
9528000	9530000	And if they do
9530000	9532000	It probably won't hit New York City
9532000	9534000	Case in point, like back in March
9534000	9536000	The blowout sale on anime
9536000	9538000	50% off
9538000	9540000	First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City
9540000	9542000	To see if I can find it
9542000	9544000	None of the stores in the five boroughs
9544000	9546000	Were participating
9546000	9548000	I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for
9548000	9550000	Out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth
9550000	9552000	That's right, something we sometimes forget
9552000	9554000	Is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions
9554000	9556000	That they don't necessarily have to participate
9556000	9558000	Mmhmm
9558000	9560000	Very interesting
9560000	9562000	Alright, well any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Rama
9562000	9564000	Um
9564000	9566000	The Screensavers rocked
9566000	9568000	The Off-Broadway DDR musical
9568000	9570000	Was way, way off-Broadway
9570000	9572000	It was around the corner from where you saw the Rocky Horror
9572000	9574000	Picture show when you came to New York that time
9574000	9576000	And according to Japanese porn laws
9576000	9578000	They're not allowed to show that type of stuff
9578000	9580000	But you can still find uncensored
9580000	9582000	Stuff
9582000	9584000	Interesting, huh? Yep
9584000	9586000	Alright, well thank you very much for the call, Rama
9586000	9588000	No problem, take care fellas
9588000	9590000	Love you, Jamie
9590000	9592000	Bye-bye
9592000	9594000	1877 game OLR
9594000	9596000	username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
9596000	9598000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio
9598000	9600000	Who's this?
9600000	9602000	Hello?
9602000	9604000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9604000	9606000	Uh, Deathwishing
9606000	9608000	Hi, Deathwishing, we can hear the speakers a little bit
9608000	9610000	Matt, I want to turn them down, what's on your mind?
9610000	9612000	Yeah, sorry
9612000	9614000	It's okay, we'll forgive you this once, what's up?
9614000	9616000	Well, thanks for making me not be able to sleep tonight
9616000	9618000	With all the porn talk
9618000	9620000	That's what we do here
9620000	9622000	Scarring listeners for life
9622000	9624000	Hey, look, we've got like three weeks to make up for it
9624000	9626000	I don't know, but did you guys hear about
9626000	9628000	How they're raising prices on like
9628000	9630000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
9630000	9632000	And like Britain and stuff, from what I heard
9632000	9634000	I haven't heard about this
9634000	9636000	I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus
9636000	9638000	I heard about it
9638000	9640000	Are they doing it here also? Because I think they did
9640000	9642000	No, it's still 60 bucks
9642000	9644000	Because I felt like with the
9644000	9646000	I pre-ordered normally collector's editions
9646000	9648000	Like 70 bucks and this time it was like 80
9648000	9650000	Well, not all collector's editions
9650000	9652000	Are 70 dollars either
9652000	9654000	Yeah, because I saw like they're raising the price
9654000	9656000	Way up and it's just like
9656000	9658000	I don't know, kind of not right
9658000	9660000	People care about this, but no one gave a crap about
9660000	9662000	The Wii version of Guitar Hero
9662000	9664000	Being 10 dollars more here
9664000	9666000	Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like 40 or 50 dollars
9666000	9668000	More than the regular?
9668000	9670000	The legendary one, the one that came with the cat suit
9670000	9672000	Well yeah, but this is all
9672000	9674000	Look at the collector's editions
9674000	9676000	For Modern Warfare, I mean that's like 200 bucks
9676000	9678000	Yeah, this is true
9680000	9682000	And also
9682000	9684000	I also
9684000	9686000	I picked up
9686000	9688000	ChromeHounds
9688000	9690000	Ah yes
9690000	9692000	The old school met game that dates back to
9692000	9694000	When the 360 first came out
9694000	9696000	And Loki was a big fan of this game
9696000	9698000	Everyone should pick it up
9698000	9700000	What do you like about ChromeHounds?
9700000	9702000	It's like
9702000	9704000	I've been seeing like
9704000	9706000	There's these ingenious designs people make
9706000	9708000	Like of mechs
9708000	9710000	Like so far
9710000	9712000	I made one where now I can't like be hit
9712000	9714000	Like directly
9714000	9716000	Kind of cheap I guess
9716000	9718000	Remember when we always talked about how we were gonna have this big blowout
9718000	9720000	ChromeHounds tournament between us and the Bobby Black Wolf show
9720000	9722000	And we were never able to do it
9722000	9724000	Because we couldn't get enough people
9724000	9726000	Here we are 3 years later, we could have recruited Deathwishing
9726000	9728000	For our team and now just
9728000	9730000	A distant memory
9730000	9732000	Before I
9732000	9734000	It's not crap, shut up
9734000	9736000	I wanted to get it because it was like
9736000	9738000	Armored Core
9738000	9740000	And then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether
9740000	9742000	The problem with the game was
9742000	9744000	It was too slow
9744000	9746000	Armored Core is very quick
9746000	9748000	And it's a mech fighting game very similar to
9748000	9750000	ChromeHounds, but it's a lot faster
9750000	9752000	It's a lot more faster paced
9752000	9754000	ChromeHounds is just slow
9754000	9756000	Slow, slow
9756000	9758000	What type of person did you play?
9758000	9760000	I played a four legged mech
9760000	9762000	That's why
9762000	9764000	Four legs are slow
9764000	9766000	Well I wanted a lot of weapons on there
9766000	9768000	You could have used chicken legs
9768000	9770000	The most important thing to Loki
9770000	9772000	Is firepower
9772000	9774000	Clearly, I mean I've never even watched him play
9774000	9776000	ChromeHounds, but I could just tell
9776000	9778000	Not necessarily
9778000	9780000	It was trying to be more all around
9780000	9782000	That's what I was trying to do
9782000	9784000	You can't be all around, you gotta specialize either
9784000	9786000	Close up or far away
9786000	9788000	That's the strategy before you build
9788000	9790000	Well, Deathwishing
9790000	9792000	Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
9792000	9794000	Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2
9794000	9796000	Please?
9796000	9798000	No, we're broke, I don't even own it myself
9798000	9800000	You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast
9800000	9802000	No, Xbox
9802000	9804000	Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast
9804000	9806000	These days
9806000	9808000	But no online play
9808000	9810000	You kids and your online play
9810000	9812000	I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us
9812000	9814000	Redemption codes for the game
9814000	9816000	We will send you the first one we get
9816000	9818000	How's that sound?
9818000	9820000	There you go, have a good one Deathwishing
9820000	9822000	Bye bye
9822000	9824000	Capcom, if you're listening
9824000	9826000	You can send those to
9826000	9828000	Rob Roberts
9828000	9830000	Hey, I haven't even reduced those into the calm line
9830000	9832000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9832000	9834000	Legend of Zaku
9834000	9836000	Hey, Legend of Zaku
9836000	9838000	Have you checked out the DDR play yet?
9838000	9840000	Which one?
9840000	9842000	The one that aired last winter?
9842000	9844000	No, the one with...
9844000	9846000	What the hell is this?
9846000	9848000	The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever
9848000	9850000	That sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit
9850000	9852000	The one with Moonbeam Punk
9852000	9854000	DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly
9854000	9856000	Yeah, that's the one I was referring to
9856000	9858000	Because that one was actually late last year
9858000	9860000	Did you see it?
9860000	9862000	Unfortunately, no
9862000	9864000	I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets
9864000	9866000	I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected
9866000	9868000	So
9868000	9870000	I mean, it was shocking
9870000	9872000	To say the least, the fact that it sold out
9872000	9874000	You know, for the first few days
9874000	9876000	It was really hard to get
9876000	9878000	Even will call for that matter
9878000	9880000	Was Tom Cruise in it or something?
9880000	9882000	Like, why did so many people want to see this?
9882000	9884000	I don't understand
9884000	9886000	I guess it's because of DDR
9886000	9888000	That's the only thing I could pretty much boil down
9888000	9890000	From the fact that it's DDR
9890000	9892000	Or people thought it was DDR
9892000	9894000	In a musical
9894000	9896000	Which is far-fetched
9896000	9898000	To say the least
9898000	9900000	Anyways
9900000	9902000	Where was I about to get to?
9902000	9904000	I think I mentioned this earlier
9904000	9906000	But yeah
9906000	9908000	Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5
9908000	9910000	From the looks of it
9910000	9912000	It looks like the
9912000	9914000	Activation is in a pissing match
9914000	9916000	Between Konami and seeing
9916000	9918000	Who can whore out the franchise
9918000	9920000	Who can whore out their top franchises
9920000	9922000	The farthest
9922000	9926000	Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?
9926000	9928000	Well, many people
9928000	9930000	I mean, I'm referring to the fact that
9930000	9932000	There's a lot of hostility towards the fact that
9932000	9934000	They're just doing it
9934000	9936000	For the sake of just milking
9936000	9938000	The franchise even further
9938000	9940000	That's what I've gotten
9940000	9942000	In terms of all the comments that I've read
9942000	9944000	So far regarding this story
9944000	9946000	Yeah, but you know
9946000	9948000	It's not like there's a Guitar Hero
9948000	9950000	Johnny Cash game coming out
9950000	9952000	This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5
9952000	9954000	And I mean, ever since the third one
9954000	9956000	You would have just random
9956000	9958000	Band characters show up in the game
9958000	9960000	And I've got to say, you know
9960000	9962000	It doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash
9962000	9964000	I think you hit it on the nail right there
9964000	9966000	After the third one
9966000	9968000	The series pretty much went downhill
9968000	9970000	Because by then
9970000	9972000	Rock Band came out
9972000	9974000	And the rest was history
9974000	9976000	The fact that you could add as many
9976000	9978000	Guest appearances
9978000	9980000	Many guest stars
9980000	9982000	Famous people in that game
9982000	9984000	And make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise
9984000	9986000	Loki asked a good question
9986000	9988000	Did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?
9988000	9990000	Um, I heard
9990000	9992000	I heard of that game
9992000	9994000	Is that the one coming out for the DS?
9994000	9996000	No, it's exactly Guitar Hero
9996000	9998000	Now it's with more family friendly songs
9998000	10000000	In other words, it's just another excuse to put out
10000000	10002000	Another fucking Guitar Hero game
10002000	10004000	There you go, there you go, Loki, see
10004000	10006000	Exactly, that's the milking
10006000	10008000	Of the franchise
10008000	10010000	Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero main game
10010000	10012000	Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?
10012000	10014000	When you have
10014000	10016000	When you basically have all your clothes
10016000	10018000	Strewing around in Hot Topic
10018000	10020000	When you're basically on cereal boxes
10020000	10022000	When it has nothing, you know
10022000	10024000	When you have those little minigames
10024000	10026000	That you find right there
10026000	10028000	You know, inside the cereal boxes
10028000	10030000	Right there
10030000	10032000	I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR
10032000	10034000	The way Konami has hoarded out with the toys
10034000	10036000	In both Subway, Burger King
10036000	10038000	And to an extent
10038000	10040000	No, milking the franchise is not about merchandising
10040000	10042000	Milking the franchise is about having
10042000	10044000	Five releases for the damn series in one year
10044000	10046000	That is milking
10046000	10048000	No, I'm sorry, six releases
10048000	10050000	I can see what Zaku is saying though
10050000	10052000	Because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games
10052000	10054000	That have the Guitar Hero name on it
10054000	10056000	Such as little portable things
10056000	10058000	You see in Hot Topic or whatever
10058000	10060000	Well yeah, that sucks too
10060000	10062000	It gets to the point of prevalence
10062000	10064000	Where it's just ad nauseam
10064000	10066000	Rock band keeps the whole thing
10066000	10068000	Consistent on the fact that
10068000	10070000	You hear a diverse set of music
10070000	10072000	In rock band, you don't just hear like
10072000	10074000	Nothing but, you don't hear
10074000	10076000	All number one hits
10076000	10078000	All you hear is just like some schmuck band
10078000	10080000	From nowhere getting into rock band
10080000	10082000	Versus a lot of
10082000	10084000	A lot of A listers on Guitar Hero
10084000	10086000	Mostly A listers
10086000	10088000	You know, it's just, Zaku
10088000	10090000	It's not that I disagree with you
10090000	10092000	That Activision is milking the shit out of their franchise
10092000	10094000	I just
10094000	10096000	But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash
10096000	10098000	In the game, that's actually the first thing in a long
10098000	10100000	Time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise
10100000	10102000	Where I'm like, that's kinda cool
10102000	10104000	I'm the devil's advocate, alright
10104000	10106000	Johnny Cash's inclusion into Guitar Hero 5
10106000	10108000	Would pretty much introduce
10108000	10110000	Him to a new generation
10110000	10112000	Of fans, that's one way
10112000	10114000	That's one argument
10114000	10116000	That could be made to defend
10116000	10118000	The milking of the franchise
10118000	10120000	But then again, with the Beatles
10120000	10122000	At least it has its own game
10122000	10124000	And it's done within the
10124000	10126000	It's done in a way that actually
10126000	10128000	Brings out the
10128000	10130000	Culture and the history of the
10130000	10132000	Beatles
10132000	10134000	And it actually does a good
10134000	10136000	Chronology of the whole
10136000	10138000	Band's history
10138000	10140000	Through their music
10140000	10142000	Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5
10142000	10144000	Packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists
10144000	10146000	So you don't
10146000	10148000	Like this because you don't
10148000	10150000	Think it's respectful enough
10150000	10152000	They just kinda threw him in there
10152000	10154000	Yeah, that's pretty much
10154000	10156000	The case, they just threw him in there to make more
10156000	10158000	Cash, no pun intended
10158000	10160000	Now I'm following you
10160000	10162000	A little better, I get it
10162000	10164000	You think the milking is coming from the fact
10164000	10166000	That you're just kinda like, let's just
10166000	10168000	Reskin, let's just slap
10168000	10170000	A face of a popular rock star
10170000	10172000	On this and put it in our game
10172000	10174000	When somebody like Johnny Cash
10174000	10176000	Deserves epic
10176000	10178000	Style treatment
10178000	10180000	With Guitar Hero
10180000	10182000	Metallica
10182000	10184000	They did it differently
10184000	10186000	It came out to be a good game
10186000	10188000	Not only had Metallica's music
10188000	10190000	But it had a whole bunch of other
10190000	10192000	Metal bands that were probably
10192000	10194000	Personally picked by the band
10194000	10196000	For all we know
10196000	10198000	It's almost the same as
10198000	10200000	Beatles Rock Band
10200000	10202000	It wouldn't
10202000	10204000	Do any
10204000	10206000	Chronology to the band
10206000	10208000	It put it to a level where it's
10208000	10210000	Respectful, it has its own game
10210000	10212000	It has the
10212000	10214000	Entire catalog right there of Metallica's
10214000	10216000	Music, that would be the only
10216000	10218000	Exception to the
10218000	10220000	To Activision's milking of the franchise
10220000	10222000	I guess it'll get worse
10222000	10224000	Once Van Halen gets their own game
10224000	10226000	Obviously with the whole Aerosmith thing
10226000	10228000	It's gonna be very interesting to see
10228000	10230000	What develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into
10230000	10232000	2010, but Zaku, I understand
10232000	10234000	Where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time
10234000	10236000	I'll let you go
10236000	10238000	Have a great one, okay Zaku?
10238000	10240000	Alright, later dude
10240000	10242000	1877 Game OLR, we can probably squeeze in one more phone call
10242000	10244000	Oransons Radio is our username on
10244000	10246000	Skype, we'll go ahead and take one more
10246000	10248000	Call if you want to give us a call
10248000	10250000	Do we have any last minute stories tonight?
10250000	10252000	I think I forgot to put it on the show roll
10252000	10254000	We have a call coming in
10254000	10256000	Hi, you're on Oransons Radio, who's this?
10256000	10258000	Hi, this is Fazinator
10258000	10260000	Hi Fazinator, what's on your mind tonight?
10260000	10262000	Two things
10262000	10264000	Unfortunately that email
10264000	10266000	That I sent you
10266000	10268000	Was a couple of weeks old
10268000	10270000	And I just wanted to update a couple of things
10270000	10272000	Yeah, first and foremost
10272000	10274000	It's probably
10274000	10276000	More directed to Loki
10276000	10278000	But I just wanted to
10278000	10280000	Send my condolences
10280000	10282000	To you and your wife over what happened
10282000	10284000	Thank you
10284000	10286000	Yeah, believe it or not
10286000	10288000	I'm not gonna go into too many
10288000	10290000	Details
10290000	10292000	Because they're running late right now
10292000	10294000	But I definitely know exactly
10294000	10296000	Where you're coming from
10296000	10298000	So I can't totally relate
10298000	10300000	So
10300000	10302000	Now
10302000	10304000	As for the second topic
10304000	10306000	I'm kind of
10306000	10308000	Surprised you didn't mention it already
10308000	10310000	But
10310000	10312000	I don't know if you guys are into
10312000	10314000	Sports games at all
10314000	10316000	Or at least the arcade style ones
10316000	10318000	But
10318000	10320000	Recently there was an announcement
10320000	10322000	That EA's
10322000	10324000	Could be making
10324000	10326000	I'm sorry, did you start
10326000	10328000	Something?
10328000	10330000	Did we lose him?
10330000	10332000	Oh, I'm still
10332000	10334000	Here
10334000	10336000	Echoing
10336000	10338000	Oh, sorry, I'm not following you
10338000	10340000	So what type of games were you asking
10340000	10342000	If we were into? Sports
10342000	10344000	Sports games?
10344000	10346000	Yeah, recently
10346000	10348000	We announced that they're gonna be making
10348000	10350000	A
10350000	10352000	Madden arcade
10352000	10354000	Which is
10354000	10356000	Could be kind of like
10356000	10358000	A Maddenized
10358000	10360000	Version of 3 on 3
10360000	10362000	NHL arcade which came out
10362000	10364000	Earlier in the year
10364000	10366000	So, you know, if you like
10366000	10368000	Arcade style games
10368000	10370000	You know, sports games
10370000	10372000	They may be up really
10372000	10374000	If not, then
10374000	10376000	But
10376000	10378000	Let me explain
10378000	10380000	My kind of thing with sports games
10380000	10382000	I've kind of been wanting to try and define
10382000	10384000	This on the show for a long time because
10384000	10386000	The interesting thing is that
10386000	10388000	We're a show that we're not really big on sports games
10388000	10390000	We don't really talk a lot about them and that's kind of our audience
10390000	10392000	But I do enjoy
10392000	10394000	Casual sports
10394000	10396000	Games, if that makes sense
10396000	10398000	You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?
10398000	10400000	I like casual sports games
10400000	10402000	I don't mind them at all
10402000	10404000	I kind of
10404000	10406000	Desire those old school sports games
10406000	10408000	Like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl
10408000	10410000	The Blades of Steel
10410000	10412000	Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into
10412000	10414000	Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one
10414000	10416000	The ones today, I have a really hard time
10416000	10418000	Just kind of pick up and running with
10418000	10420000	Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them
10420000	10422000	Like, you know, and hey
10422000	10424000	For the hardcore sports fan
10424000	10426000	Cool, you know, more for you
10426000	10428000	They don't play role playing games that I play, probably
10428000	10430000	They play their sports games and that's cool
10430000	10432000	You know, there's a lot for you
10432000	10434000	But like, I actually think
10434000	10436000	Probably one good way to define the type of sports game
10436000	10438000	That I can get into is an arcade
10438000	10440000	Type of game, insert, quarter, play game
10440000	10442000	You know, it's just very, very easy
10442000	10444000	Like NBA Jam, that was one of my
10444000	10446000	Like, favorite video games like years ago
10446000	10448000	And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show
10448000	10450000	That I was ever into a sports game at some point
10450000	10452000	But some of them, I can get into
10452000	10454000	But we, yeah, we haven't had
10454000	10456000	A lot in a long, long time
10456000	10458000	So EA's trying to
10458000	10460000	Bring out more casual sports gaming, is what you're saying?
10460000	10462000	Yeah, basically
10462000	10464000	Yeah, it's
10464000	10466000	Well, I
10466000	10468000	I don't know if you've ever
10468000	10470000	Tried to release a demo on
10470000	10472000	Either the 360 or
10472000	10474000	The PlayStation 3
10474000	10476000	But last year they, you know, earlier this year
10476000	10478000	They came out with
10478000	10480000	An arcade style
10480000	10482000	Hockey game
10482000	10484000	Basically, you think NBA Jam
10484000	10486000	To hockey
10486000	10488000	Have you ever played that? Do you know the name of it?
10488000	10490000	It's called
10490000	10492000	NHL, or, you know, 3-on-3
10492000	10494000	NHL Arcade
10494000	10496000	It's basically NBA Jam with hockey
10496000	10498000	I will have to check that out
10498000	10500000	I don't think I ever played it
10500000	10502000	You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kinda like
10502000	10504000	Ah, sports game pass, sports game pass
10504000	10506000	But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully
10506000	10508000	I check it out, I mean, Wii Sports
10508000	10510000	And Wii Sports Resort, aren't these kind of
10510000	10512000	Casual sports games in a way, too?
10512000	10514000	Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking
10514000	10516000	Video game of the past
10516000	10518000	10-15 years
10518000	10520000	Oh yeah, yeah
10520000	10522000	I can't say I really know much
10522000	10524000	About the Wii games
10524000	10526000	Because I really haven't been following them
10526000	10528000	I don't even
10528000	10530000	Know what it's like
10530000	10532000	Most of my knowledge
10532000	10534000	About video games are about dollar
10534000	10536000	Two systems
10536000	10538000	One less
10538000	10540000	Touch
10540000	10542000	Before I do, you know, hang up
10542000	10544000	Yeah
10544000	10546000	I know if it's something
10546000	10548000	The 3 of you would be interested in
10548000	10550000	But there's a free download
10550000	10552000	On the video section
10552000	10554000	Of the PlayStation
10554000	10556000	Network store
10556000	10558000	It's a
10558000	10560000	1980s enemy
10560000	10562000	Pilot
10562000	10564000	Called Zebra Rider
10564000	10566000	I can do
10566000	10568000	Free?
10568000	10570000	I don't know if that's going to cut you off
10570000	10572000	Oh no, I can do free
10572000	10574000	I always like free things
10574000	10576000	They probably put this up on there to get people to
10576000	10578000	Check it out because they're probably going to sell the series
10578000	10580000	Yeah, probably
10580000	10582000	I haven't seen it yet
10582000	10584000	But I did download it
10584000	10586000	So I can't really give an opinion
10586000	10588000	All right, well
10588000	10590000	Maybe in a future week
10590000	10592000	But for now we're going to let you go
10592000	10594000	Thank you so much for your phone call
10594000	10596000	And we're going to wrap up
10596000	10598000	Later, buddy
10598000	10600000	Casual sports gamer
10600000	10602000	That would be me
10602000	10604000	I can't do these harder to get into
10604000	10606000	With the playbooks and all that stuff
10606000	10608000	The most playbook I could get into was
10608000	10610000	Tecmo Bowl
10610000	10612000	Run, run 2, pass, and pass 2
10612000	10614000	That's as playbook as I get
10614000	10616000	All right, anyhow
10616000	10618000	I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight
10618000	10620000	Let's get any last minute stories, Loki
10620000	10622000	Yes, this is interesting
10622000	10624000	Apparently Konami is relaunching
10624000	10626000	The Drummania and Guitar Freak series
10626000	10628000	With Guitar Freak's Drummania
10628000	10630000	XG
10630000	10632000	It's going to be in HD
10632000	10634000	And it's also adding more fret buttons
10634000	10636000	To the guitar controller
10636000	10638000	Now with five fret buttons with adding
10638000	10640000	Yellow and purple
10640000	10642000	They're also going to have hold notes
10642000	10644000	Or longer notes just like you'd see in
10644000	10646000	Other rhythm music games
10646000	10648000	And also
10648000	10650000	The open
10650000	10652000	Open strums are actually going to be
10652000	10654000	Part of the normal guitar charts
10654000	10656000	And vibration is added when you're wailing
10656000	10658000	Drummania
10658000	10660000	They're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom
10660000	10662000	And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal
10662000	10664000	And a second bass pedal
10664000	10666000	As well
10666000	10668000	Apparently the new machines
10668000	10670000	Are going on testing very soon
10670000	10672000	Some of the new songs include
10672000	10674000	Hyperjetland
10674000	10676000	Kaiser Phoenix
10676000	10678000	Blue Planet and Piranha
10678000	10680000	All those of course
10680000	10682000	Looks like in-house artists
10682000	10684000	And some of the old songs
10684000	10686000	Returning Vampire Killer
10686000	10688000	Over the Limit
10688000	10690000	Highway Star
10690000	10692000	And some others
10692000	10694000	Let's see here
10694000	10696000	They're going to have a new interface
10696000	10698000	Also beginner mode
10698000	10700000	And
10700000	10702000	I guess
10702000	10704000	There's also
10704000	10706000	Gameplay being shown in the background
10706000	10708000	I guess with your note link
10708000	10710000	Over the top
10710000	10712000	The machine looks really cool
10712000	10714000	I don't know, but a little too late
10714000	10716000	I think
10716000	10718000	That rumor that the
10718000	10720000	Xbox Pro system is going away has a little bit
10720000	10722000	More to back
10722000	10724000	It up, apparently the new
10724000	10726000	Arcade packaging that's making
10726000	10728000	It's way out to stores right now
10728000	10730000	Seems to be missing the Pro system on
10730000	10732000	There, so it's just the Pro and the
10732000	10734000	Arcade and the
10734000	10736000	Elite system
10736000	10738000	The rumor is that they're going to be dropping
10738000	10740000	The price of the Elite system to match
10740000	10742000	The Pro system and just get rid of
10742000	10744000	The Pro altogether
10744000	10746000	Hmm, probably going to happen soon
10746000	10748000	If it's already on the packaging
10748000	10750000	Apparently some very
10750000	10752000	I don't know
10752000	10754000	Special people have decided
10754000	10756000	To modify a version
10756000	10758000	Of Pong that will
10758000	10760000	Kind of inject a little bit of
10760000	10762000	Fetish stuff in there
10762000	10764000	Including a controller that's made
10764000	10766000	Out of a boot that you would slide your hands
10766000	10768000	Up and down, and apparently
10768000	10770000	If you miss
10770000	10772000	The ball going across the screen
10772000	10774000	You get whipped
10774000	10776000	And that's
10776000	10778000	Thanks to some people in Britain there
10778000	10780000	Um
10780000	10782000	Let's see
10782000	10784000	Ben Heck, the
10784000	10786000	Creator of such wonderful
10786000	10788000	Portable systems, has a new project
10788000	10790000	Now he is blogging about
10790000	10792000	Including creating his very own
10792000	10794000	Custom pinball machine
10794000	10796000	Which he for some reason decided to
10796000	10798000	Choose Bill Paxton as the
10798000	10800000	Theme of the pinball machine
10800000	10802000	But it is kind of neat if you want to
10802000	10804000	Check it out on how you can
10804000	10806000	Make your own very
10806000	10808000	Unique pinball machine
10808000	10810000	From scratch, so that's kind of neat
10810000	10812000	That is kind of cool
10812000	10814000	There's a game on Commodore 64
10814000	10816000	I used to play back in the day that I loved
10816000	10818000	Pinball construction set by ECA
10818000	10820000	Which back in the day was
10820000	10822000	What EA turned into
10822000	10824000	You know what I mean?
10824000	10826000	Modern Warfare
10826000	10828000	They have their really ridiculous
10828000	10830000	Prestige collector's edition
10830000	10832000	Well, not to be outdone
10832000	10834000	But Codemasters
10834000	10836000	They're releasing Operation
10836000	10838000	Flashpoint Dragon Rising
10838000	10840000	In the UK
10840000	10842000	With a really ridiculous
10842000	10844000	Collector's edition as well
10844000	10846000	It will feature a
10846000	10848000	Full
10848000	10850000	I guess
10850000	10852000	Full size army helmet
10852000	10854000	That's made from metal
10854000	10856000	Plus a dog tag
10856000	10858000	And the box is huge
10858000	10860000	Apparently the size of a rock band
10860000	10862000	Bundle box
10862000	10864000	Which makes sense because the helmet is kind of big
10866000	10868000	And then lastly
10868000	10870000	Something that kind of pissed people off
10870000	10872000	We were talking about Activision raising prices
10872000	10874000	Well apparently
10874000	10876000	And once again this goes to show you
10876000	10878000	That CEOs should never speak
10878000	10880000	Ever when it comes to video games
10880000	10882000	Apparently CEO Bobby Kotex
10882000	10884000	Says that he's
10884000	10886000	He hopes that the price of
10886000	10888000	Games will actually go higher
10888000	10890000	It says
10890000	10892000	And Tony, you know if it was left
10892000	10894000	To me, I would raise the prices even further
10894000	10896000	Yes, thank you
10896000	10898000	Mr. Douchebag
10900000	10902000	And then two last things here
10902000	10904000	Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone
10904000	10906000	Actually, can we back it up a little bit
10906000	10908000	And remind me, we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight
10908000	10910000	We got to do that at some point
10910000	10912000	What was this dude's name?
10912000	10914000	Bobby Kotek
10914000	10916000	The FUs of the Week tonight are for you
10930000	10932000	My FU
10932000	10934000	Really just goes to the suture in my hand
10934000	10936000	It pretty freaking hurts
10936000	10938000	Yeah
10938000	10940000	My FU goes to being sore
10940000	10942000	Like I feel like I'm getting so old
10942000	10944000	But my legs are so sore
10944000	10946000	I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday
10946000	10948000	Which wasn't really that much
10948000	10950000	I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe
10950000	10952000	Logie
10952000	10954000	As I mentioned in part A, most of the nurses that we had
10954000	10956000	While we were in the hospital for a very
10956000	10958000	Traumatic and sad event were very nice
10958000	10960000	However, the last nurse that we had
10960000	10962000	Was a total idiot
10962000	10964000	And the reason I say this
10964000	10966000	She apparently had her own
10966000	10968000	Stillborn baby
10968000	10970000	At full term
10970000	10972000	And so
10972000	10974000	Dying babies were her thing
10974000	10976000	As she puts it
10976000	10978000	So she comes in, basically when they're doing all the pictures
10978000	10980000	And doing the footprints
10980000	10982000	And all the impressions and stuff
10982000	10984000	The nurse beforehand
10984000	10986000	They're treating them, even though the babies are dead
10986000	10988000	They're treating them with respect
10988000	10990000	Like actual babies supporting their head
10990000	10992000	And stuff like that
10992000	10994000	Well a woman decides she's gonna come in
10994000	10996000	And she says, okay we're gonna start taking pictures
10996000	10998000	Oh this is the fun part
10998000	11000000	I'm sorry, what part of dead babies
11000000	11002000	Is fun to you, stupid
11002000	11004000	And then she treats them
11004000	11006000	Like, you know, basically dolls
11006000	11008000	Just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact
11008000	11010000	You know, that their
11010000	11012000	Heads should be supported and all that stuff
11012000	11014000	Because they can't feel pain anymore, she says
11014000	11016000	So thank you
11016000	11018000	Nurse Douchebag
11018000	11020000	For being totally insensitive
11020000	11022000	And just an absolute
11022000	11024000	Horrible human being
11024000	11026000	But you know what though
11026000	11028000	You know, in the end we do laugh
11028000	11030000	About it because she's
11030000	11032000	It just, how do people like this actually exist
11032000	11034000	They're so stupid
11034000	11036000	See, only you and Nelly
11036000	11038000	Can find the humor in something like that, honestly
11040000	11042000	Alright, that's gonna do it for the FUs of the week
11042000	11044000	Sorry, last minute stories
11044000	11046000	And the last one I have, which you'll probably like
11046000	11048000	Mark's obvious saying they are gonna raise
11048000	11050000	The cap of your friends list
11050000	11052000	I actually have a few open
11052000	11054000	Slots right now, I think I'm down to like 98
11054000	11056000	And the reason why I, if somebody
11056000	11058000	Hasn't shown up on my friends list
11058000	11060000	In like 30 days or more
11060000	11062000	I just delete them because I knew they cancelled their
11062000	11064000	Xbox, unless it's somebody I know
11064000	11066000	In real life, that's pretty much
11066000	11068000	That's what I've been doing too
11068000	11070000	Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it
11070000	11072000	If you wanna add me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots
11072000	11074000	You're not gonna see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey
11074000	11076000	But there's always something
11076000	11078000	There'll be something I'm playing after
11078000	11080000	I'm sick of the games I'm playing now
11080000	11082000	It's not the way it works
11082000	11084000	Alright
11084000	11086000	I guess that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio
11086000	11088000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight
11088000	11090000	And supporting independent podcasting
11090000	11092000	You guys are awesome, especially
11092000	11094000	Downloading and listening to this entire show
11094000	11096000	After a three week hiatus
11096000	11098000	If you got all the way to the end
11098000	11100000	You rock, thank you so much for listening to us
11100000	11102000	I don't know what else to say
11102000	11104000	We say tell two people you know about the show
11104000	11106000	But honestly, by listening to the whole thing
11106000	11108000	You've already made us feel good
11108000	11110000	And live listeners
11110000	11112000	Where would we be without you guys?
11112000	11114000	Thank you so much for showing up
11114000	11116000	And especially the fact that we just said at like noon today
11116000	11118000	That we'd be back tonight, because I just didn't know
11118000	11120000	I didn't want to announce anything premature
11120000	11122000	But the fact that so many people showed up
11122000	11124000	We actually had a really good listener count tonight
11124000	11126000	And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting
11126000	11128000	From all games
11128000	11130000	That some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff
11130000	11132000	But just thank you
11132000	11134000	So much
11134000	11136000	DarkSakari, your final thought
11136000	11138000	My final thought is
11138000	11140000	Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud
11140000	11142000	Smells sick
11142000	11144000	Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?
11144000	11146000	I am, I just autographed it
11146000	11148000	Awesome, I'll sign it too
11148000	11150000	Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too
11150000	11152000	Loki, your final thought
11152000	11154000	My final thought is
11154000	11156000	I don't know, I've
11156000	11158000	Hopefully there will be some new video coming up this week
11158000	11160000	Of the Grand Theft Auto plane
11160000	11162000	Good, because those two videos
11162000	11164000	That are up there now, that's all we shot
11164000	11166000	That one day, and now DarkSakari's
11166000	11168000	Afraid to do it again, especially if Victoria
11168000	11170000	Is the camera woman, because it'll be boob shots
11170000	11172000	So we might have to fire Victoria
11172000	11174000	And get a new camera lady
11174000	11176000	It was really good that she did it
11176000	11178000	No it is, you know
11178000	11180000	You'll just get more, you'll get a different kalanto
11180000	11182000	We'll figure it out, we're going to keep that
11182000	11184000	YouTube channel alive this time
11184000	11186000	My final thought is, I have a TurboGrafx
11186000	11188000	In my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to
11188000	11190000	Steal this, so you may not
11190000	11192000	Be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say
11192000	11194000	Anyhow, that's going to do it for this
11194000	11196000	Week here on Orange Lounge Radio
11196000	11198000	You know, I pretty much said it all, thanks so much
11198000	11200000	We'll be back here to do it all again
11200000	11202000	Next week, so
11202000	11204000	Myself, Rob Roberts, she's
11204000	11206000	DarkSakra, he's Loki
11206000	11208000	Thank you guys, we will see you
