14070	18738	Tonight, August 9th, 2009, Sony pulls advertising from one of their games.
19139	21723	Details are revealed on Final Fantasy XIV.
22104	24809	Could you soon get a new game for the price of a used one?
32550	39293	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 9th of 2009.
39693	44655	We're here to talk about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys.
45156	46736	And we're a little broken tonight.
47056	50778	I know we've been gone for a couple weeks, but boy, we're kind of borked on our return here.
51078	52219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
70507	70787	I see.
71468	72968	Isn't that nice hair?
73489	74489	It's very pretty.
74969	75330	There you go.
75630	78131	And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki.
78491	78711	Hi.
78932	79732	How are you doing, Loki?
80012	81073	I'm doing well, I guess.
81253	86495	I know a lot of the listeners have been very concerned about you and everything that's been going on.
86596	90518	So anything you wanted to say to the listeners before we get started tonight?
90918	91818	I don't know.
91838	93759	I guess I could explain everything that happened.
94140	94400	I mean...
95140	95941	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
125120	126201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
150240	152842	and DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
178109	194670	Yeah, so basically, um, last Friday, yeah, uh, last Friday, uh, well actually, let me start, the week before that, um, the week before Friday, um, or before last Friday, so two Fridays ago, uh
196016	201938	Nellie had been getting what she thought were false labor pains.
202058	208059	Basically, during labor you get, or I should say during pregnancy, you get false labor pains.
208079	210000	They're called Braxton Hicks contractions.
210560	214761	Basically, kind of going through the whole contraction cycle.
214981	216102	They're not supposed to hurt.
216162	219302	They're basically, you feel a tightening and then that's it.
219423	221203	And you get them all throughout the entire pregnancy.
221583	222183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
251131	253134	Everything was basically looked to be normal.
253234	254936	So we went home.
254976	258220	She was basically taking it easy, laying on the couch and stuff like that.
259201	265608	Monday, she went into her normal doctor because she had an appointment and she actually had her looked over again.
266189	267951	And once again, everything seemed fine.
268932	277997	So then, you know, Tuesday rolls around and she was getting a little bit more crampy and stuff, but she wasn't worried about it because, you know, she's going to the doctor on Wednesday.
278478	284081	So Wednesday she decided, you know, she was going to go into labor and delivery again to have her...
284462	285683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
302862	311234	So she finally insisted, listen, give me an internal ultrasound, and I want you to make sure everything's correct, because you guys have been telling me everything's been fine.
311875	318304	So sure enough, they give her an internal ultrasound, and they realize that now, within the time frame of Friday to...
319986	320707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
341986	345688	Wednesday, they call me down to the hospital, so I have to go down there.
346488	352592	And basically, she let me know what was going on, and we... They tried, basically, to reverse the process.
352612	362717	They gave her drugs to stop contractions, and they basically tilted her on a bed, you know, towards her head, to hopefully, you know, the sack would, you know, go back up into...
364938	365998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
392878	393539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
420481	421662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
447415	448255	and Deliver the Baby.
469483	479945	And then they checked her again at about 5 in the morning to see if she was dilated enough, and they saw feet hanging out of her.
480266	482446	So they're like, well, looks like you're ready to go.
483086	487287	So they went ahead, delivered the first baby.
487907	492929	It came really quick, and my boy Michael was delivered first.
493109	494069	He had...
495376	501562	Died before he was delivered, basically, probably from all the trauma.
501602	514295	His sack had been broken for 15 hours, and he basically had to facilitate the entire labor process because he's being contracted on, and he was breached.
514335	515897	Just all that combined together.
517038	518139	He died before he got...
519460	523424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
543154	549136	Her water basically broke and then Sarah was born right after that.
549176	550216	She was born alive.
550537	551957	Everything was okay with her.
552657	557639	But because it's only 21 weeks, she doesn't have any lungs yet.
558599	563701	Luckily, they're oxygenated really well in the womb in case the mother dies or something like that.
563741	565042	The babies can survive a little bit.
565442	569643	But because she has no lungs, she only lived for two hours.
570244	570524	So...
572554	573134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
591550	593693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
603567	604047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
627162	627862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
651704	679132	but I don't know it's just it's sad and you know wish it hadn't happened but it's not really much you can do that's why I'm here this week because you know everything's kind of getting back to normal and I don't know just gotta go on you know so yeah that's basically everything that happened and we you know took care of all the funeral because they are actually considered you know
680072	680612	Thanks for watching!
700422	727867	but you know we had them cremated sometime this week I think they're supposed to be doing but we went and took care of all that so we get their ashes back this coming week sometime and you know we got basically they took pictures and everything because I mean you don't have anything to take you know to remember them by basically so they take pictures to do footprints handprints
729647	731749	Measurments, all that stuff.
731809	738996	But yeah, they were 10 inches long and under a pound each.
739016	742419	14 ounces I think was the largest one.
743460	744741	But yeah.
745495	746956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
767552	786338	And I know that you've kind of said a lot, Loki, and kind of given everything, which might come as a surprise to folks who are ready to tune into a video game show, but I admire that you can be so kind of comfortable with everything that happened now that you can talk about it very professionally.
787058	787418	I don't know.
787478	789039	It's still kind of upsetting.
789259	792580	I mean, I'm a little upset right now, but it's just like...
793979	795579	It's not as bad as the first day.
795759	796400	Oh my god.
797300	799520	It was just... It was tiring.
799560	800860	The whole process was tiring.
801261	804201	You know, just got no sleep for like two days.
805041	807902	And just the emotional rollercoaster.
808102	812963	I mean, the first day you're like, okay, well, we may be able to reverse this, you know.
813463	816504	And it just means that you'll have to be on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy.
816524	818184	We're like, okay, well, that sucks.
818284	820745	But, you know, hey, we can do that, you know.
820905	821545	And then...
822986	824147	No, there's nothing we can do.
824468	832960	And then one of the nurses comes in, hey, well maybe they can save one of the babies and deliver one and the other one will be saved.
833161	835124	Just keep the other one in or whatever.
836245	837908	You can't do that because, I mean...
838889	852633	Let's say, for example, the what-ifs, basically, if you were able to keep the other fetus in, even for like three weeks, which would make it a viable pregnancy, even though it's a viable pregnancy, does not mean that they're going to come out normal.
853133	860495	I mean, their lungs are not developed all the way, they're going to have developmental, mental issues.
861894	862455	You never know.
862515	869260	It's just, this was the easiest way, and thankfully, you know, the whole birthing process took like five minutes.
869501	871282	Once you gave birth to them, it was just done.
872083	872643	Super quick.
872884	880030	And everything came out because, you know, if the placentas didn't detach or whatever, they had to go and scrape that out, and just, it's just not fun.
881151	881431	So...
883766	889390	Yeah, I mean, and Brad PodCulture saying that I posted something on LiveJournal.
889410	890010	Yeah, I did.
890290	904779	Because the whole process, especially getting down to when we were waiting for her to give birth and stuff, I kept thinking of how I wanted to, I don't know, kind of get everything out.
905099	906180	And that was the way to do it.
906200	907521	I just kind of wrote a letter to them.
909222	909342	So.
911022	912163	We'll see you next time.
936394	939196	It was more that it wasn't necessarily our place to say anything.
939276	940697	Exactly.
940997	947901	I thought the letter obviously was very touching and some folks are saying they got a little teary-eyed reading it.
949963	957527	I guess the next thing to ask, and I apologize for continuing to drag this out, but I know it's probably good for you to talk about it and stuff.
958328	962210	I think the question a lot of people's minds may be too afraid to ask is, what next?
962330	963131	What do you do next now?
963351	970594	Well, now, the next... Obviously, we still won't have children.
973295	978898	You're not supposed to try right afterwards because there's a higher risk of preterm labor.
978978	982719	In fact, having preterm labor is a higher risk of preterm labor the next time.
983660	985881	So, basically, now...
987791	988792	And this is unfortunate.
988852	995259	The whole medical thing is it's like they want you to fail once and then they'll take everything seriously.
995339	1000284	It's just they're not as cautious with the first pregnancy, I guess, or whatever.
1000464	1000764	I don't know.
1003546	1012210	Basically, we go in for a follow-up appointment, or she goes in for a follow-up on Tuesday to make sure she's okay, just healing and everything.
1012991	1020054	Later on, we'll meet with somebody on the high-risk clinic to see what we need to do.
1020815	1024777	She has her own theories of why it happened.
1024797	1028879	She thinks that her progesterone level has dropped because she has PCOS.
1030023	1035667	which basically her body interprets insulin as testosterone or something like that.
1035907	1039930	It throws off her hormone levels and that can also cause preterm labor.
1040730	1049656	And so she's thinking that maybe she needs to get progesterone doses or whatever to keep an eye on that.
1050056	1057141	The other thing they can do is the cerclage, which basically is sewing the cervix shut with a stitch.
1057742	1058962	They couldn't do that this time.
1060323	1061164	Thank you for watching!
1078517	1092871	and you know pretty much we'll try again next year at some point but just right now we have to give it at least six to nine months before we can try again you know just to you know be extremely cautious and even then
1094318	1098200	Hopefully this time what we're going to do is we're going to do one round of Clomid first.
1098401	1102783	Usually the first time Clomid, when we used it, it overstimulates her ovaries.
1102803	1103824	That's why we got twins.
1105305	1111108	But we're going to try one round of Clomid first and then not try an insemination at all.
1111229	1114451	And then another round of Clomid so we get one baby and not two.
1114491	1116452	Because one baby is a lot easier to do than two.
1117048	1119409	Okay.
1119509	1135178	This question might sound kind of weird, but this is kind of the last thing I want to ask you, and then certainly I'll stop grilling you on this, but I think a lot of people out there when they were reading about this on Twitter and even hearing about it now and seeing this on LiveJournal and so forth, they're kind of wondering, what can I do?
1135518	1136878	Is there something I can do to help?
1137259	1138759	Is there anything I can do?
1139240	1142001	Is there any charity?
1142101	1144182	Is there something I can do to help?
1145243	1145363	Um,
1146238	1146818	Not really.
1146898	1148960	I mean, I don't know.
1149140	1158545	If you want to do a charity, I guess March of Dimes is, you know, they research, you know, pregnancy loss or I don't know.
1159465	1160306	There's that, I guess.
1160426	1160766	I don't know.
1160786	1165129	Nellie talked about getting in a group together for when they do the next March of Dimes walk or whatever.
1165289	1165609	I don't know.
1165629	1171232	I've actually done that quite a few times and it's a really great charity and I think would be very perfect.
1171252	1171632	I don't know.
1171892	1172953	I would definitely go in on that.
1172993	1173253	Yeah.
1173533	1174374	We don't, I don't know.
1174394	1174474	Yeah.
1175334	1176375	Do whatever you guys need to do.
1177415	1178936	See, that's the thing too.
1178956	1181457	When we got home, everyone wants to help out.
1181477	1184878	I totally understand what's there to do.
1185058	1185458	I don't know.
1185638	1186859	It's like people want to come over.
1186899	1188720	They want to bring you food and stuff.
1189600	1193061	It's fine because at first we did not want to go out of the house.
1193322	1194402	My mom would come over.
1194442	1197123	She'd bring us groceries that we needed and stuff like that.
1197483	1200064	I'd have friends come over and they'd bring food and stuff.
1200364	1200945	That was fine.
1201325	1203926	But now we've got a fridge full of food and we're just like...
1204326	1205788	They're like, well, what do you want us to do?
1205908	1207369	You need us to do something around the house?
1207429	1208971	I'm like, I don't know.
1209351	1211233	It's like, I don't know.
1212194	1214657	So, there's nothing really you can do, unfortunately.
1214777	1219381	I mean, it's nice to know that you guys care.
1220843	1221163	I don't know.
1221404	1225027	It's just, right now, I can't really think of anything.
1225327	1227550	There's nothing really we can do, I guess.
1227918	1238849	Well, maybe, you know, if we decide to go the charity route later on, I know we've always been kind of toying with the idea of doing a marathon of some sort on some weekend, so that might be something we'll have to look into for the future.
1238869	1239590	It might be a lot of fun.
1239790	1240291	Yeah, we'll see.
1240611	1241492	For a good cause.
1241732	1242053	I don't know.
1243794	1245676	That's pretty much it right now.
1245756	1247598	We've got a lot of stuff taken care of, so...
1250751	1251071	I don't know.
1251651	1255113	See, I feel so guilty right now.
1255313	1256073	I really shouldn't be.
1256113	1260555	I should be glad that I'm kind of over everything.
1261675	1265077	This whole week, I mean, I was perfectly fine.
1265297	1268138	I was sitting at home.
1269879	1275521	First, I wanted to sit at home because I wasn't ready to go back to work, but I was ready to go back to work probably Tuesday.
1276521	1279743	Mainly just staying home to keep Nelly company because she's got to be...
1280783	1281424	Thank you for watching!
1295854	1304001	But, like, I've been editing Grand Theft Auto for, like, the last few days, so I've been just doing the same- Getting back to normal.
1304062	1311048	I've been, yeah, just pretty much getting back to normal, and it's just, you know, I feel so guilty because she's, you know, still upset about stuff, and I just-
1312386	1314147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1335258	1356253	you're supposed to let it reabsorb back into your body and it's cramping after she gives birth and everything her uterus has to shrink down and you get contractions and cramping based on that and you have to give yourself massages in your stomach to force it to cramp so that it will shrink back down and it's just all the fun stuff about pregnancy that a lot of people don't know about but uh
1358499	1358839	I don't know.
1359179	1363442	I mean, it's like, I have pictures of them.
1365723	1371846	They give you these little layouts, they're little outfits that they basically dress them up in and take pictures and stuff.
1372326	1375148	As morbid as that sounds, but I mean, that's all you got, so...
1375808	1389655	I actually have pictures, but it's hard for people to look at, especially the boy, because their skin's still transparent a little bit, and he was really bruised coming out, and he's all red and stuff.
1390836	1395258	Let me read this from Kitsune, because I think this is really good advice, and we'll try to move on from here.
1396079	1399801	Kitsune in chat says, it would probably be worse if you didn't get back to normal.
1399861	1401742	I mean, if you stay in a good spirit, it would help her.
1401762	1402482	Yeah.
1402722	1403522	Yeah, exactly.
1403742	1405103	I think that's what it is.
1407163	1410164	I know we spent a lot of time talking about that, but it's important.
1410284	1414985	And I think Brad makes a good point in our chat room again, chat.orangelandryday.com.
1415385	1418826	After listening to OLR for so long, we feel like you guys are kind of like family.
1419026	1422326	So I think you definitely have a lot of support from everybody.
1422366	1424767	We're just hoping that the next one goes a lot better than this.
1426547	1429108	You know, because I don't want to go through this again.
1429960	1431201	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1448496	1456020	Well, not very busy, just given that I can't hold the controllers for very long before my hand starts to hurt.
1458181	1464524	We got in, we're borrowing a couple pinball tables that we actually got after we did the video.
1467005	1471427	Attack from Mars, which I really love, and Medieval Madness, which I love, but I really like Attack from Mars better.
1471567	1472808	Dude, you got an attack from Mars?
1472828	1473388	That's awesome.
1473508	1474649	Yeah, it's a play after the show.
1474669	1475129	That's the pinball.
1475149	1476931	It has the holograms and all that stuff in it.
1476971	1477611	Play after the show.
1477651	1477931	Fun.
1480253	1487077	And so I've been playing a little bit of that off and on, but like I said, my hand starts hurting me real bad, so I can't play for very long.
1487978	1491620	And I'm playing Sims 3 just off and on.
1491941	1492401	Some of the...
1495003	1505349	Newness has fallen for me, but I go back every so often and now I'm actually going to pick up one of my old families and play them some more now that better hair has come out.
1507470	1508350	I've been playing Peggle.
1508731	1511152	I beat Peggle, so now I'm playing through it again.
1512153	1513373	It's pretty fun.
1514814	1517736	Some Cooking Mama last night on my iPhone.
1519497	1520718	Played Light Cycles on my iPhone.
1521358	1522599	Played Lost Solitaire on my iPhone.
1523851	1524392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1545533	1556940	Um, I've also, um, been playing some of the little games on Gaia Online, because my account is still there, including Booty Grab, just because I think it's funny.
1558001	1563864	It's where you go into the aquariums, and if you manage to get one that's active, they'll throw gold everywhere, and you grab booty.
1564584	1566405	I just laugh because I'm grabbing booty.
1566826	1567106	Nice.
1567986	1568827	Do you shake booty, too?
1568867	1570048	Because I'm five years old that way.
1571388	1571468	Um...
1572891	1575292	And we picked up a couple of games.
1575332	1581095	We actually picked up some Tengen games that were in the regular Nintendo cartridges.
1581755	1587978	We got Gauntlet and I don't think we picked up RBI Baseball because hello, it's RBI Baseball.
1588958	1592780	And one other that I can't remember.
1593800	1595241	And here comes the husband.
1596402	1597062	What was the other game?
1598530	1598930	We didn't?
1600531	1601292	Oh, I thought you bought the games.
1601532	1602672	Okay, well, we didn't get the games then.
1602712	1603153	We saw them.
1603373	1604233	You just saw them.
1605114	1605894	I thought he got them.
1605914	1608075	You had a daydream where you were going to buy them and leave.
1608095	1610156	No, because I went back and I bought movies.
1610236	1613678	I bought the Doctor Who movie that just came out.
1613718	1614779	I found it brand new for like $10.
1614939	1615599	Oh, nice.
1615959	1618261	And then I got this movie, which I love, Saved.
1618941	1619461	Oh, that's funny.
1619601	1620922	That movie is cracked out.
1621022	1621522	And I got Elf.
1623680	1645329	Because, you know, I normally, Will Ferrell actually used to really annoy the crap out of me until I saw that movie And then I thought that movie was pretty darn funny Especially when you smell like beef and cheese But also, for other games, Dan got me this that I haven't opened yet, but I will be This is the game that we are in
1647764	1649865	Actually, you got the 360 version.
1649905	1652026	That's the arcade stuff.
1652687	1653727	We're in the PS3 version.
1653747	1654508	We're in the PS3 one.
1654668	1655729	Yes, we're in the PS3 one.
1655749	1657130	The Namco Museum Essentials.
1658250	1659311	Thank you for reminding me, though.
1659331	1661652	We didn't tell the show or we didn't tell the listeners about this.
1662533	1664394	We actually have a cameo in a video game.
1664694	1667676	We're in the PlayStation 3 version of Namco Museum Essentials.
1668957	1670298	It's a PlayStation Network title.
1670518	1671559	Yeah, it's a download title.
1672349	1674750	You have to get it on... It's a download title on PlayStation Network.
1675310	1676211	You have to get it online.
1676291	1677551	The one that we're in is the one online.
1677691	1678852	You don't have a PS3 game with that.
1680013	1680333	I'll get one.
1680373	1680973	So, anyway.
1682254	1682994	Now they're talking about that.
1683014	1684675	But yeah, if you... Here's the thing.
1685115	1690237	It's just a little cameo, but when you start the game, not the demo, but the retail version of the game, you're not going to see it in the demo.
1690497	1696860	When you start the retail version of the game, there's a little splash screen that comes up, and it shows like, hey, now you can see this high scoreboard with your friends.
1697200	1699982	And it actually, on the high scoreboard, it says Sky...
1700802	1708644	DarkSakura, Loki is 1, 2, 3, and then there's some initials thing on the side too, where OLR is some of the top initials on the high scoreboard.
1708924	1710504	So it's really cool and awesome.
1710524	1712164	But it still has a lot of good games on it.
1712284	1713885	Oh yeah, I mean that's still a good collection.
1713945	1716765	That's mostly a collection of the various arcade games they've released.
1717265	1723427	Championship Edition, Galaga Legions, Mr. Driller Online, Galaxian, Pole Position.
1723767	1724567	So yeah, um...
1726391	1730272	As soon as my hand, because my hand is actually still pretty crappy.
1731812	1737873	I actually heard it yesterday holding my friend's son, and she is listening right now.
1737893	1740414	And sorry, your son killed me.
1741614	1749055	But no, I actually ended up hyperextending my middle finger way too far.
1751236	1751936	Oh, come on.
1751976	1753176	I know, it just sounds funny.
1753236	1753556	Sorry.
1754312	1756774	The technical term is hyperextension.
1757294	1759875	I was using my middle finger too much.
1761036	1762237	Hey, hey.
1762857	1763618	I was showing you.
1763658	1764518	See, look at my finger.
1765138	1768100	No, and the suture is still in my palm.
1768660	1771882	So I'm actually going to call my doctor and tell him to get it the hell out of my hand.
1772363	1776825	Because it's really... I pretty much think that it's what's slowing up my healing.
1776945	1777245	Because...
1778426	1780187	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1795115	1823309	and that looks hot that is just oh my god and it's got Mark Hamill as Mr. J and I think it pretty much has all the animated series voice cast except for I think Dan said the commissioner's voice is different but other than that hey I mean it actually I have a feeling that we're going to pick this one up and I'm really looking forward to giving that one a try if I take enough Vicodin maybe I can play the demo
1824510	1825611	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1825731	1825931	Yes.
1826391	1830594	And I came this close, really tiny close, to playing Beatmania.
1830715	1832236	And then I was like, nah, let's just go home.
1832536	1833497	Probably not good for your hand, though.
1833817	1834978	Nah, really not good for my hand.
1835118	1837260	I mean, I'm a right-side scratcher, but nah.
1837280	1838841	You know what's funny?
1838881	1841543	I actually saw a Hip Hop Mania Complete Mix 2 machine yesterday.
1841683	1841883	What?
1842063	1842324	Where?
1842584	1843044	At Tahoe.
1843565	1844445	South Lake Tahoe.
1844525	1845706	It was either Harvey's or Harrah's.
1845726	1846127	I can't remember.
1846147	1846807	One of those two had it.
1847328	1851611	And yeah, I almost played it, but then I was like, dude, it's five key.
1851971	1852552	This is old.
1852572	1852892	Okay.
1853078	1857880	Oh, and I released a ringtone pack for iPhone owners.
1858700	1859600	I think I sent it to you.
1860101	1861081	I don't think I saw it.
1861681	1869164	I did a limited giveaway, just a random giveaway, to give away 10 video game ringtones that I made for iPhone.
1870044	1871845	And I'm going to do it again.
1872425	1874826	This time, instead of doing it on...
1877182	1880704	On Twitter, I'm going to do it on Facebook.
1881804	1893810	So the first five people to send me a message to my inbox on Facebook with your email address... Actually, I'll be better than that.
1893870	1897952	I'll say ten will be able to download the pack.
1898892	1900693	It's just ten different ringtones.
1901233	1901473	Nice.
1901974	1902094	And...
1903797	1932773	I can tell everybody what's in them later alright well let's move on with our gaming weeks and Loki I know you said you did some Grand Theft Auto yeah I was playing well not so much playing Grand Theft Auto as I was editing Grand Theft Auto still it's almost done actually I think it's probably done now I think I've edited pretty much everything I could possibly edit in it now and I am going to record some stuff for it I finally got my video capture thing for doing HD video and
1934662	1938967	Assuming everything works on it, we should be able to record some stuff.
1939327	1944312	I've been having issues with the program that came with it to get it to work.
1944613	1946354	For some reason, it's just crashing randomly.
1947876	1951740	Hopefully, we'll be able to record everything and it will be awesome.
1952020	1954503	So you can finally see what the hell I've done to Grand Theft Auto.
1955891	1956692	It's insane now.
1956792	1958913	Now the jets fly around at street level.
1959493	1962975	And it's just kind of crazy because you're fighting and all of a sudden this jumbo jet comes by.
1962995	1965297	It's just like, what the hell is going on?
1966357	1968819	Other than that, I didn't really play a whole lot this week.
1968859	1971480	I brought my DS with me to the hospital so I had something to do.
1972561	1976763	So I played a little bit of LEGO Battles, which that game's kind of boring.
1976963	1979065	I mean, it's an okay RTS game, but...
1980353	1988356	The AI is retarded, and like I would tell, you have these, you can harvest, you know, wood and stuff like that, or it gives you bricks or whatever.
1988876	1993698	So, you know, I'm telling them to go chop down these trees, and they just stand there.
1993818	1994578	They're like, huh?
1994918	1995519	You want me to do what?
1995959	1998400	Or like I say, chop down these trees, and they run the opposite direction.
1998500	1998780	It's just...
1999720	2003062	Absolutely Retarded, so that got really frustrating and boring.
2004302	2014166	Then I went back to playing some Space Invaders Extreme, which was fun, and also some Planet Puzzle League, which was pretty fun.
2014647	2016407	Those games are good standby puzzle games.
2021430	2021890	Let me think...
2023953	2025413	I think that's pretty much it.
2025933	2027754	Really, you know, not a good week for games.
2028034	2033295	Even though I was home all week, I was just pretty occupied with just doing Grand Theft Auto stuff.
2033615	2038356	And then before that, you know, putting away boxes and cleaning up the house.
2040037	2046278	But I have my giant HDTV now in my room to do video capture on, so it'll be awesome.
2047202	2047502	Alright.
2048503	2053664	As far as my gaming week, I didn't play a lot of, you know, even the fact that we've been gone a little while, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
2054005	2055205	I've still been playing Lost Odyssey.
2055245	2060667	I made my way to disc 3 now, which is way past where I was before, so that's pretty cool, and I'm still enjoying that little RPG.
2061307	2062768	I play Blackjack for real.
2063428	2063868	and DarkSakura.com
2087737	2088538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2110532	2113333	Yeah, I mean, I was down to about 20 at one point.
2113373	2114573	I was like, ah, fuck my life.
2114613	2116074	I'm going to be losing all my money.
2116394	2118535	But I did okay.
2118595	2119535	It was very nerve-wracking.
2119855	2121215	It's a lot of pressure, but it was fun.
2121475	2121856	I had fun.
2122676	2124636	But please gamble responsibly if you're over 21.
2126437	2127417	Let's see, what else did I do?
2127877	2134398	I did play one new game, but I can't really review it because it's a beta, and it's actually one that I know somebody emailed us on before.
2134818	2137579	And I did actually end up getting a beta into the game to check it out.
2138319	2144540	Ion Online is the name of the game, and it's from NCSoft, and it's a new MMO that's coming out.
2145020	2148401	It's actually, if I understand right, it's been out in Korea for some time.
2148741	2152902	It's just finally getting its localization over here, so it's finally in beta, and so forth.
2153362	2153762	And, um...
2154782	2158225	I didn't really play the game enough to get a real sense, you know, to review it fairly.
2158365	2159405	I will say it's pretty.
2160446	2165069	It definitely had some things in common with WoW, but I actually found a lot to be in common with Warhammer as well.
2165129	2171634	I don't know if that's just the way it looked or what have you, but as far as, like, you know, I'm just talking the way the game looks on a purely superficial level.
2172014	2177938	I'm not talking about, like, how the insides of the game work, because there's all these things I did not have enough time to get into, such as...
2179079	2179840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2199199	2199980	God, that is Final Fantasy XI.
2215813	2220895	But I don't want to make you think it's like Final Fantasy XI because it definitely felt a lot more like a WoW or Warhammer did.
2221855	2223816	Apparently there's another beta weekend next weekend.
2223876	2224697	I'm going to check it out.
2225117	2231839	I don't want to review a game based on a beta, but I will say the game kept me interested enough to want to play it again next weekend.
2232159	2233060	And that's what I plan to do.
2234860	2235641	It sounds like fun.
2235941	2238222	Yeah, I'll have to talk to my source, see if I can get you another code.
2238662	2239342	It'll be kind of fun.
2239882	2241823	I like a good MMO, but you know which one I'm waiting for.
2243496	2244478	Final Fantasy XIV?
2244498	2245099	Heck no!
2246881	2247182	Alright.
2248163	2251468	What was that line from Chasing Amy?
2252089	2253331	Bitch, you almost made me laugh.
2255413	2257015	Bobby Blackwolf, The Bobby Blackwolf Show
2275291	2276892	at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
2277373	2282537	Before we were on, he was making fun of us tonight, calling it the Mark of the Beast and so forth.
2282737	2283718	Or half the Mark of the Beast.
2283838	2284058	Sorry, 666.
2284158	2286239	I was saying it's our holy show.
2286259	2287060	It's a holy show.
2287280	2287861	Holy moly.
2288301	2289102	So, all right.
2289882	2291223	And of course, we have a new YouTube up.
2291283	2294025	So check that out on the channel, www.youtube.com.
2294406	2296107	And we are channel Orange Lounge Radio.
2296167	2297388	Or you just search for OLR.
2297768	2298869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2318490	2320251	by EA at Comic-Con.
2320571	2323833	The whole take a picture with our booth babes thing.
2325314	2325874	It was dumb.
2325894	2327195	I don't know if you heard about this.
2327335	2327735	Yeah.
2328176	2329877	It actually didn't.
2330217	2332618	It was some lame brain in the marketing department.
2332658	2333799	Their scheme gone way wrong.
2333859	2335520	I don't want to get too far into it because it's weeks old.
2335960	2355241	It was basically you take a picture with a booth babe and you send it on your Twitter or something like that and you'll get entered in a drawing to win a date on the town with two women and basically the star treatment where you get paparazzi
2355791	2358272	or basically a chaperone, a limo, and that kind of stuff.
2358653	2364876	But the way that it was phrased, it made it sound like you get two prostitutes that you get to go have sex with on a tent.
2364896	2369178	Right, right, because the whole thing was around, you know, the seven deadly sins, and what was this, lust?
2369358	2370119	Was that probably the thing?
2370499	2377443	So, you know, the whole thing was built around lust, and it made it kind of sound like it was encouraged, like, you know, go harass booth babes and take pictures of them.
2377463	2380484	It didn't even have to be EA's booth babes, from what I understood from their thing.
2380504	2381425	Yeah, I think... Or was it supposed to be?
2381485	2381805	I don't know.
2382345	2383206	It didn't have to be.
2383506	2383827	I don't know.
2384047	2387270	This is why you need parameters set, you know?
2387970	2388371	Here's the thing.
2388411	2389391	I'm sorry to get far into this.
2389412	2391593	I was just going to mention it, but that's okay.
2391633	2392134	Here's the thing.
2392514	2397078	I actually don't think they're the biggest criminals in the world.
2397238	2398760	They thought outside the box.
2399100	2400782	They came up with a new competition.
2401202	2402643	Was it a very limiting competition?
2402743	2407888	Did they kind of close this off to a lot of people by only thinking of the horny straight male?
2408228	2408749	Yes, they did.
2409369	2414017	Did somebody in marketing fuck this up big time by taking it from idea to fruition?
2414137	2414458	Oh yeah.
2414979	2415239	Oh yeah.
2415299	2416802	Like, where was the quality check on this?
2416882	2417182	Come on.
2417343	2418965	And seriously, you gotta think about this.
2419206	2420889	You don't do that...
2421912	2423693	At Comic-Con, you do that at Vegas.
2424353	2429795	Where you can actually fulfill your contractual obligation to get those guys laid.
2430555	2441299	I just don't like, the only thing I really didn't like about it is it just reinforces the stereotype that gamers are a bunch of desperate, horny male folks who can't get laid.
2441719	2442219	You know what I mean?
2443070	2447851	And not that I think – see, but at the same time, I don't want to go to that other extreme where they have to write all these rules.
2448231	2449731	Well, you get on a date with two women.
2450012	2451732	But if you're women, you can get guys.
2451832	2454152	Or if you're a gay guy, you can get pretty guys.
2454252	2458513	Or if you're a lesbian – I wouldn't want to have to see them go to that extreme.
2459214	2462894	Well, I mean just let me cash out the damn prize.
2463014	2463574	How about that?
2464535	2465395	You also won –
2466974	2468737	Oh yeah, you won booty as well.
2469017	2470860	You know, but that's funny.
2471381	2471842	I don't know.
2472463	2474366	Like I said, I think they should have done it in Vegas.
2474806	2477811	And people just need to get over this shit.
2478031	2478732	It's a contest.
2478752	2480014	If you don't like it, don't enter it.
2480796	2482658	Don't get offended by it, it's a contest.
2482998	2483539	My god.
2484440	2485761	Do we need to take it seriously?
2485861	2488924	I'm not offended, but I'm just like, stupid.
2489284	2490145	This is stupid.
2490285	2491947	This is so, so stupid.
2492087	2496751	And that's probably not what people want us to be saying about their upcoming game, Dante's Inferno.
2497252	2497532	Stupid.
2497973	2498453	I'm just kidding.
2498713	2499914	I don't know about the game itself.
2501256	2503698	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news from the now.
2504259	2505460	Loki, please, start us off.
2505856	2516522	Yes, so Sony decided it was an awesome idea to go ahead and add some ads to their game Wipeout HD.
2517482	2522025	And these would be little commercials that would play before your races and whatnot.
2523205	2533591	What's interesting though is the ads that they have actually increase the load time from basically like 8 seconds to 19 seconds.
2535612	2547625	Now, that doesn't seem like a whole lot, but that's still annoying that you have to wait 19 seconds to get into a race because they want you to watch an ad for a game that you paid for already.
2548506	2549026	Kind of annoying.
2549587	2556374	Thankfully, enough people bitched, and so they went ahead and got rid of those ads, or at least that one ad that was that long.
2558919	2560099	But still though, I mean, come on.
2560660	2563681	Adding ads after the fact because they want some more money?
2564081	2570504	I'm sorry, I can understand if you want to do that for like a free version of the game that maybe adds supported, but if I bought this game...
2571758	2583601	I don't want to have to wait extra seconds or whatever to play my levels just because you want to make a few extra bucks running a State Farm ad or something like that.
2583781	2584901	That's the thing that gets me.
2584981	2587422	The ad had nothing to do.
2587902	2588482	You know what's funny?
2588522	2590943	I actually own Wipeout HD, but I haven't played it in so long.
2590983	2591703	I totally missed this.
2592123	2594283	But State Farm?
2594823	2595144	Really?
2595864	2600665	What gamer is going to be sitting there playing Wipeout HD going, Damn, I was just thinking I need life insurance.
2601584	2602084	I mean, really?
2631556	2632796	Thanks for watching!
2648422	2651867	I see that kind of crap on TV, although I don't like the fact that I pay for it.
2652228	2657877	I don't get as bothered by that as I do by this, because this is very in-your-face, captive audience.
2658217	2658898	That's the problem.
2658958	2660781	It makes you a captive audience to these commercials.
2660841	2662644	It's like those ads in the bathroom stall.
2664349	2668510	It's just that they do it after the fact.
2668710	2670390	That kind of devalues your game.
2670630	2677832	People might not purchase this game because it has a 20 second load time or you have to watch an ad for State Farm.
2678052	2688494	DarkSakura, unlike you, I don't get mad at the ads in the bathroom because, again, unlike you, if I don't like the ad, I can always piss on it.
2690714	2693296	Well, no, it's not necessarily ads in the bathroom that I don't like.
2693376	2699920	It's this thing that they do at my work with these little security posters that they put in the bathroom stall, which I'm glad I haven't had to look.
2699940	2700300	The hell is that?
2700340	2701701	Big Brother is watching you poo?
2701861	2702602	What is that?
2702862	2706384	It's like, don't give out confidential information at work, blah, blah, blah.
2706404	2707925	Don't talk about this, blah, blah.
2708185	2710167	Security risk, blah, blah, blah.
2710327	2713109	And they look like stupid motivational posters, but not really.
2713909	2714950	And I hate that more.
2716448	2718891	Can I tell this stupid random tangent story real quick?
2718911	2720013	Yay, tangents!
2720033	2721315	The dates back to high school.
2721355	2722356	You love my tangents.
2722436	2722737	Admit it.
2722757	2723097	I do.
2723418	2723778	Admit it.
2724279	2725561	Chat room, you love my tangents.
2726041	2732030	There was once this kid that ran for student government when I was in high school, and I think he was running for like, I don't know, like they...
2732370	2735271	They used to, like, a king of the pep rally or whatever the hell they called it.
2735331	2737072	He would basically be the host of all the pep rallies in the school.
2737092	2737832	Biggest loser.
2738312	2739973	Okay, biggest loser was what he was running for.
2740553	2744074	And his campaign, you know, he put up a bunch of posters and stuff.
2744094	2749516	But in the men's bathroom, he actually put up posters in the urinals and what have you.
2749556	2752337	And it actually said, you hold the future in your hands.
2752517	2754178	Remember to vote next Friday.
2759022	2760904	I actually thought that was kind of creative.
2760924	2762266	That's brilliant, actually.
2762747	2763468	Oh my god.
2764168	2769134	And now he works for EA creating failed, you know, advertisements.
2769154	2772539	Oh, I don't keep in touch with the assholes from high school except the ones I liked.
2772999	2776663	Who knows what that asshole's doing, but, you know, I just thought that was funny.
2777525	2778506	That actually is pretty funny.
2779172	2779773	Thanks for watching!
2791502	2798464	For example, like, you know, the movie Running Man or, you know... Fast and Furious on DVD and Blu-ray or something.
2798784	2799844	Not even necessarily that.
2799884	2802485	Like, okay, wipe out, you know, HD.
2802585	2808167	Let's make it... It can be a State Farm ad, but have them, like, insuring, like, these space vehicles or something like that.
2808607	2810647	It still fits in, like, the universe.
2810707	2814588	It fits in everything, but it's actually still an ad for State Farm.
2815189	2816049	It's just like, you know...
2818620	2820241	Demolition Man, Taco Bell,
2839935	2840556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2857452	2858333	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2878194	2879155	What the hell is this?
2879896	2880576	Really?
2881517	2885760	What's to say they're not going to go back and patch other games to suddenly throw in advertising?
2885820	2886401	Surprise!
2887061	2889243	It's just low.
2889883	2897189	Because then when the game is reviewed and all the previews go out, this has to be breaking a law of some sort.
2897249	2897769	I don't know how.
2898049	2898650	It has to be.
2899450	2900151	It's just shady.
2900191	2901432	You're raping my eyes!
2901712	2903113	You are raping my eyes!
2903333	2904254	And I am unwilling...
2905848	2906468	It's just weird.
2907009	2907849	Unconsensual.
2908290	2910211	Yes, this is unconsensual eye-fucking.
2910251	2911172	That's what this is.
2911912	2912633	Thank you, Sony.
2914874	2915555	Here's the thing, though.
2915615	2916495	Poor State Farm.
2916535	2919497	Because you know they probably just buy out of some company.
2919958	2920158	It is.
2920278	2922760	It's not even State Farm's fault.
2922800	2924241	Don't blame State Farm for this.
2924621	2926642	Because remember, State Farm is there.
2927763	2930865	State Farm is everywhere, apparently, even in Wipeout HD.
2930945	2931526	So there you go.
2933510	2937669	Hey, at least it's not another fucking Axe commercial or something like that.
2939159	2939259	Yeah.
2939979	2942100	Uh, comments from chat, chat.orange.com.
2942581	2947103	Uh, Gangru says, if ads are in my game, it needs to be either flavor or cheaper.
2947803	2957268	Uh, TigerClaw says, I think the ads came after the Fury add-on pack for Wipeout HD and continues to say, maybe if you buy the regular Wipeout HD without the add-ons, it doesn't have the ads.
2957748	2958748	Um, I never noticed them.
2958808	2963251	I do have Wipeout HD and I've never noticed the ads, but I didn't play it in the last three weeks.
2963351	2966552	I didn't, and just to be clear, the ads are gone now, right?
2966892	2967773	They were patched out, right?
2967833	2968233	Um, they're,
2968593	2971315	Well, they're not patched out, but they're working with the company now.
2971415	2979821	I think that that ad is gone, but they're working with them now so that basically the ads are shorter and they don't interfere with the load time or something like that is what they're saying.
2980282	2981703	They're not saying that the ads are going away.
2981723	2987707	They're just saying, oh, we're working with this company because we fucked up or they fucked up by making the ad too long or something.
2989423	2996660	So basically they're saying, hey, it's not that we're getting rid of the advertising, we're just trying to find a way to keep it into the 8 second window, basically.
2996920	2998865	It's just, I don't know, it's shady.
3000881	3006323	I mean, I expect those types of ads on, let's say, a Pogo.com type of website.
3006824	3009605	If you've never visited this website, it's just a ton of casual games.
3009705	3013266	It's all middle-aged crisis women games, and I love them.
3014066	3016747	You've got Boggle and Scrabble and all this stuff on there.
3016987	3019468	I have no problem with them doing a free version of this game.
3019488	3026931	Yeah, but they're all free, and you expect that you're going to have to sit there and look at an ad for Metamucil in between games or what have you, but...
3027671	3029773	or Special K. That's the big one.
3030193	3031534	Special K is delicious.
3032575	3037159	Special K is like food of the Lifetime Network.
3037199	3041703	I'm very pissed off that they really focused the demographic to chicks.
3043204	3044185	Fuck games for a minute.
3044225	3048028	This is more important than any other revelation that's come out about ads and games.
3048068	3049189	Fuck that whole thing for a minute.
3049909	3051751	Loki loves...
3052472	3054972	I like Total, I used to eat that when I was 5
3078857	3082600	or like, I don't even know if you remember this, Product 19.
3082840	3083820	Yes, I remember that.
3084361	3089004	Yeah, that's almost like Special K. Because if you even say mini-wheats or old people food, I'm going to come over there and beat you.
3089264	3091265	Mini-wheats are freaking amazing.
3091706	3092766	I like Crispix, too.
3092986	3094247	Crispix is pretty damn good.
3094267	3098270	Then again, I'm the person with all brands sitting up there in my cabinet.
3099176	3099998	Thanks for watching!
3114780	3116621	You know, that could be hit or miss.
3117882	3121804	I am amazed at the vast of knowledge some of our listeners have of the show.
3122144	3125226	Alpha Cananogram in chat says, to quote from guys on a show.
3125466	3128408	Now that's a show we used to do on Orange Lounge Radio when it was a station.
3128808	3130429	Like it was like on Thursday nights or something.
3130689	3132310	I did that with my old roommate, Xfer.
3132370	3133811	It's been off the air for like four years.
3134191	3139134	But says this quote, Sky thinks Special K's secret ingredient is possibly pussy juice.
3140394	3141235	Did I say that?
3141295	3142035	You made that up.
3142155	3143136	I did not say that.
3144141	3144821	Did I really?
3146122	3153185	From experience, I can tell you that I don't think Pussy Juice is in Special K. Well, how would that attract women, too?
3153505	3155546	Well, lesbians, maybe.
3156827	3157627	It's not bad.
3157707	3167752	It's just the thing is, the only thing I don't like about Special K, because first off, they don't have mazes and little stupid dumb puzzles on the back of them like Fruity Pebbles and, you know.
3168667	3196803	Captain Crunch does but they have like you know all this breast health awareness crap and like you can lose you know four you know inches off your waistline or something like that if you do the special K diet and crap I'm like I'm sorry I eat your cereal and I lose no weight whatsoever but then again they want you to like make nuggets don't help well yes but they also want you to like have it with skim milk that's like disgusting you know I like skim milk cardboard or something I don't know
3199282	3206874	I'm sorry to get off topic, but we had to have the Special K chat on this show because I think we've never had it on the main show and it's been like seven years.
3207155	3209138	And Loki's been eating Special K at least that long.
3210560	3211041	It's good.
3211101	3212042	I mean, it's...
3213010	3213310	I don't know.
3213330	3217233	I go back to Captain Crunch every now and then, but Captain Crunch is sharp.
3217453	3221496	I mean, it's seriously like... For the record, I hate Special K. For the record, I hate Captain Crunch.
3221576	3222356	It's disgusting.
3222416	3225478	I can't stand Special K. I love Special K. I like fiber cereals.
3225518	3229301	Okay, I grew up on Grape Nuts and Total and Cracklin' Oat Bran.
3230061	3231102	I hate marshmallows.
3231322	3233344	And you have a smooth bowel movement every day.
3233564	3234144	Shut up.
3234865	3242790	The only kid cereal that I ever liked was Frosted Mini Wheats, and I still to this day, it's my favorite cereal in the universe, and Rice Krispies.
3243650	3244851	Cinnamon Toast Crunch for me.
3245071	3247813	I'll eat that stuff dry, out of the box.
3247833	3249634	And for the record, I hate Cheerios.
3249654	3253556	You know what else is good, too, that I can't stop eating once I get some?
3254037	3255518	Golden Grahams.
3256038	3256458	I love it.
3256558	3258239	You can still get Golden Grahams.
3258279	3259080	I just had some the other day.
3259220	3260961	I know, they're awesome.
3261501	3262122	Here's the thing, though.
3262382	3264163	It's funny you say I can actually eat it dry.
3264623	3265724	I only eat cereal dry.
3265984	3267125	I hate milk that much.
3267145	3268345	I don't eat cereal with milk.
3268806	3270587	See, Special K, that would taste awful dry.
3270687	3272268	I can't stand Special K. It won't...
3274894	3278136	Maybe I did say that because it does taste like pussy juice to me.
3278196	3279156	It is that disgusting.
3279516	3280037	It's gross.
3280477	3280877	Okay.
3281137	3281397	Anyhow.
3284278	3285439	Oh yeah, so the ads in games.
3286039	3286499	That idea.
3286779	3289200	Unless you run an ad for Special K, then Loki won't mind anymore.
3290141	3290421	Alright.
3291301	3291741	Let's see.
3291841	3294943	Let's move on with some more news and talking about Netflix a little bit.
3295483	3298104	And Netflix, of course, streaming has been huge on the Xbox 360.
3298144	3298304	It's...
3300485	3320577	Rumored once again, and it seems like this rumor comes up every few months or so ever since Netflix set the Xbox 360, but apparently an industry executive familiar with Netflix plans has talked to the website Multichannel that the company's streaming service is soon coming to the iPhone or iPod Touch as well as the Wii.
3321658	3324379	By the way, that doesn't mean you're going to get to watch Netflix on 3G.
3324419	3326901	That would be way too much of a strain on AT&T's bandwidth.
3327381	3328242	And, you know...
3329192	3338357	Boy oh boy, AT&T, I gotta think of some horrible name for AT&T because they are just like, they're putting the clamp down on everything.
3338377	3348143	That was the other big news that came up, even though it's not game related, but the whole thing like Google Apps are getting shut down by assholes, twats, and turds.
3349943	3350423	There you go.
3351304	3363390	So asshole twat and turd isn't going to let you use their 3G network because it's way too much of their precious bandwidth so you'd only be able to use Netflix over the streaming over Wi-Fi.
3365431	3366091	Which makes sense.
3366151	3368373	I mean, it would be a horrible quality over 3G anyway.
3368413	3370073	I mean, YouTube takes forever as it is.
3370714	3375136	But the part about the Wii is interesting because they've been hinting at that for a long, long, long, long time.
3376437	3376717	But
3378152	3379994	Nothing about Sony PlayStation 3.
3380775	3387663	And I think the iPhone stuff is interesting because Apple, if I'm not mistaking, kind of has their own thing.
3387703	3397775	I mean, you can't see they don't have a Netflix type service per se, but they do have the movie rental that you can do on on the Apple and you can play that on your phone.
3398235	3405739	So I would see something like this getting shot down just the same way the Google Latitude app got shot down.
3405859	3411022	Google Voice, that was the big one that got shot down by Apple as well, by Asselsturch and Twatts.
3413964	3416265	There's other phones out there that do, you know.
3416805	3422669	Yes, but realize whether you like it or not, the iPhone is the one everybody seems to have right now.
3422769	3424009	It is the most popular phone.
3424410	3426911	And I think what's second behind it is the BlackBerry iPhone.
3427711	3431973	Probably, yeah, probably BlackBerry, which is also an AT&T name, too.
3433314	3434434	Or AT&T brand, too.
3434694	3437596	I'm trying to read some comments in the chat room.
3437636	3440337	Let's see, Decipher says, Atrocious telephones and technology.
3440737	3442678	Frisbee says, All twats talking.
3444219	3444939	So there you go.
3446380	3448181	And Misty says it's a fucking sheep phone.
3448261	3450282	We were just calling... Hey, I love my iPhone.
3450302	3451622	I know, bad, bad, bad.
3453223	3456365	Well, I mean, I'm just saying that it actually is...
3457418	3458060	Really good.
3458080	3459684	I mean, seriously.
3459945	3462713	It's a really good technology.
3463555	3464016	So whatever.
3464177	3464437	Nah.
3465185	3470788	Yes, and Tiger Klaus says, let's not forget there is an All Games app on the iPhone and it lets you let OLR on it.
3470808	3471728	Yeah, I downloaded it too.
3471868	3473069	Did that come out in the past couple weeks?
3473109	3473589	I guess it did.
3473969	3475870	If you haven't checked out the All Games app, search for that.
3476090	3479652	Because it lets you, it's free, and you can tune in to All Games Radio anywhere.
3479972	3480132	Yeah.
3480152	3483294	And plug in your ears and plug in the headphones and go.
3483314	3484574	I always plug in my ears.
3484634	3486035	Plug it in a car transmitter and go.
3486055	3486775	Wait, Mr. Potato Head.
3487536	3487856	Shush.
3488945	3492748	Alright, so there you go, Netflix streaming possibly coming to the Wii and iPhone.
3493508	3503235	I think it's inevitable, it's probably going to come to, probably, if AT&T will let it, it'll come to the iPhone and Apple also.
3503596	3505517	But I don't know about the Wii, I don't know.
3505837	3508139	For some reason this always comes up and I'm just kind of like, I don't know.
3508599	3511441	The Wii doesn't seem like a strong enough system to be able to support something like Netflix.
3511462	3511962	They could do it.
3512504	3513446	I think you could do it.
3513586	3517391	I mean, especially with all the functionality they're giving it in Japan.
3517551	3517871	Why not?
3517911	3519093	Get the Netflix channel.
3519534	3520094	Have you really?
3520315	3523839	I mean, honestly, though, do you watch that much on your streaming Netflix?
3523979	3525441	I mean, granted, there is some stuff I watch.
3525501	3526663	It's mostly TV shows.
3526683	3528065	We actually canceled ours.
3528325	3528746	DarkSakura.com
3546949	3548189	They're still behind on a few things.
3575819	3576763	Alright, well let's move on.
3576843	3581019	Obviously, Netflix will maybe hear something later in the year, but nothing now.
3581099	3581540	DarkSakura.
3582190	3592837	Well, something that's actually really good for people who have an Xbox in the United States is that Xbox Live will be getting PayPal support.
3593858	3599541	The option is you can buy your Xbox points using PayPal.
3600362	3606026	You'd go onto your account summary page on Xbox.com.
3607647	3610309	There's a little option to associate your PayPal and Live accounts.
3611449	3617374	And then, but it really only works through the website, not through the console.
3618215	3619656	And it's right now only in America.
3620697	3623199	In other words, any way you want to give us your money, we'll take it.
3624880	3627082	Hey, it's convenient.
3628120	3628701	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3649540	3650961	I don't mind.
3651021	3652781	I mean, we're talking about Microsoft.
3652842	3653982	They're not going to give out my information.
3654102	3657303	My bank protects me from any violation of information, so I'm fine.
3657864	3659284	But I'm not really worried about that.
3659404	3663266	I know it's tempting to buy them all at a push of a button and so forth, and I haven't been.
3663286	3667468	Especially in the early days of Xbox Live Arcade, I was buying everything, and it was very tempting.
3667508	3668808	But I've gotten a lot better at that.
3671075	3671835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3689804	3695986	You might be able to use your credit card, but it's really easy to sit everything through PayPal.
3696506	3698927	Especially since a lot of the Buy It Now stuff is set that way.
3699367	3701548	But it's really just giving people another option.
3701728	3703168	And I don't see any harm in it.
3703548	3707509	Especially if people do a lot of stuff through their PayPal account.
3707829	3711010	And you can use it to track your purchases that way too.
3711671	3712471	So, why not?
3713291	3718154	I use PayPal a lot when I'm paying for stuff online just because it's like an escrow service and that kind of stuff.
3718234	3719674	They have ripped me off in the past.
3719834	3722576	Like, there was an error one time where I paid for something that was...
3723413	3724273	Thanks for watching!
3745720	3747802	Dude, go to the store and go buy a card.
3748062	3756088	I mean, seriously, if you want the points that badly, just go to the store, pay the tax on it, and just go buy a card.
3756108	3758770	You know, and just redeem it online.
3758991	3762053	You can even get one of those prepaid Visa cards, right?
3762513	3769459	You can get a prepaid Visa card, but there's no reason to go through PayPal for all this crap because if you don't have a credit card...
3770836	3773617	You're gonna have to tie your bank account to PayPal.
3774477	3777639	And I'm not even sure if you can do that if you're under 18 anyways.
3777999	3781380	I mean, it's been a while since I did that.
3781920	3788383	But it's just easier if you're under 18, just go buy a card at the store.
3788463	3794825	Hell, you can go to your favorite game store or whatever, trade in some games or trade in crap, and then get...
3795205	3795846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3807831	3808952	Good that they're supporting it.
3808972	3811112	They give someone another option, but I don't think it's a good option.
3811453	3812033	Good for them.
3812233	3814174	I mean, I guess the more ways the better.
3814194	3820937	I guess there are some people out there that really trust PayPal or that build up money in PayPal from eBay auctions or whatever, but I don't know.
3821197	3822357	Not something I really plan on using.
3822377	3828500	But see, even with that, though, I mean, yeah, you can build up money from PayPal, but it's really simple to just deposit that into your bank account.
3828640	3830021	One click of a button, it takes like two days.
3830121	3830381	Done.
3830981	3835343	I mean, so that's kind of a lame excuse if that's, oh, I got all this money built up in PayPal.
3836617	3839039	Plus there's got to be all these fees and crap too, you know?
3839219	3848026	Yeah, they would love it for you just to spend that PayPal money on stuff that their company is selling or transactions through them because I bet they get kicked back for every little transaction.
3848787	3850068	And are they going to be charging you tax?
3850488	3851989	Because that would be something interesting too.
3852670	3852970	I don't know.
3853090	3854351	I guess it depends on what state you live in.
3854832	3854992	True.
3855012	3858334	I don't know.
3858354	3858394	Um...
3859767	3867328	So other interesting stuff that Best Buy is actually going to be testing this new program that they've got.
3867848	3870169	I'm assuming this is only going to last as a test.
3870309	3872429	I can't imagine this working full-time.
3872889	3875730	But their new thing is, why buy used when you can buy new?
3876110	3882771	Best Buy will now match prices of new video games at used prices from GameStop or GameCrazy.
3883171	3885972	So basically, you go to GameStop, you say, okay...
3887652	3889895	I see this used game for $5 cheaper.
3890916	3898204	Somehow you then decide to go to Best Buy, get a new game, tell them to call this GameStop to check the price, and done.
3898244	3899945	You get the new game for the price of the used game.
3900646	3905431	Awesome plan, but I can't imagine that they're going to make any money off of this because they're going to be losing money left and right.
3906272	3913841	Especially if somebody at a GameStop or something like that is a real dick and says, Oh yeah, we're charging $20 for that game.
3914742	3918286	Redeem, get a bunch of the game and go sell it back to GameStop for more than $20.
3920031	3920331	DarkSakura.com
3942737	3945641	But at the same time, you kind of said it yourself, Loki.
3945981	3949986	The price of a used game, a GameStop, is typically only $5 under that of a new game.
3950307	3954112	So in other words, Best Buy is basically giving you $5 off on all their new games.
3954172	3954432	Is that...
3955789	3957229	is that really that bad of a loss?
3957289	3965231	If they can create loyalty, because that's a big, big thing, is that I think a lot of people kind of build up loyalty to one certain place to buy their games, right?
3965271	3968272	And here's the other thing, too, about that.
3968612	3985255	You see, retailers like this, basically, they can sell a game at cost, and it's still beneficial for them if they're able to sell enough units, because they get back-end rebates, meaning if they buy X amount of pieces or whatever, a company like, say, Activision or EA or whatever will give them
3985734	3986815	Thanks for watching!
4009331	4010292	Basically the same price.
4010352	4016097	Now the question is, are they going to also count the discounts that you get with your GameStop card?
4016757	4019620	Are you going to be able to get the extra 10% off?
4019900	4020561	Probably not.
4020641	4022442	I would say just assume no on that.
4022622	4027206	And store credit, because Best Buy is not really taking trades in right now.
4027226	4029068	But isn't that something else they're testing?
4029108	4030589	Yeah, the kiosks are testing that.
4030909	4032130	But right now they're not.
4032330	4033371	I mean, so...
4034552	4035013	Thanks for watching!
4049990	4050571	Thanks for watching!
4069321	4069781	Thanks for watching!
4090364	4099049	If, on top of all that, if you're cautious, then yeah, I don't see why this would be a bad deal if you're just interested in getting a used game and you don't give a crap about the extra 10% off.
4101070	4102971	I gotta read this comment from chat because it's really funny.
4103191	4109275	Brad from PodCulture says they play video games in Utah, to which Rama follows up with, Brad, yep, they play Super Mormon Brothers 2.
4110616	4113497	Oh, I'm sure our Utah listeners appreciate that one.
4114238	4114598	Alright.
4115575	4116980	I just like that idea for a game.
4117020	4117923	Super Mormon Brothers 2.
4118224	4119769	Surely that's a ROM hack somewhere.
4121730	4123070	Surely that is a ROM hack somewhere.
4123391	4129353	Well, hey, I like cheaper games no matter how it happens, but let's not count out what GameStop might be doing.
4130113	4134174	Not necessarily in retaliation, but certainly all the companies are trying to think of ways to one-up each other.
4134594	4138616	And GameStop is apparently looking for a new rewards program.
4138816	4140876	Because, you know, the way it is right now is that they have what?
4140916	4144057	You get their little card, you get the 10% discount or whatever.
4144077	4144578	10% more on trades, 10%...
4146198	4147479	More off of Accessory.
4147639	4149581	You get some magazine I've never read in my life.
4149601	4150361	Game Informer is actually not bad.
4150381	4151362	Game Informer is a good magazine.
4151402	4155525	Yeah, it's not a bad magazine and the subscription price is cheaper than whatever.
4156425	4157526	Honestly, I couldn't tell you.
4157546	4161409	I will tell you the last time I read a video game magazine actually was a couple weeks ago.
4161909	4164191	I actually picked up a Barnes & Noble.
4164451	4165972	It's a magazine out of the UK.
4166492	4167813	Retro Gamer, I think it's called.
4167833	4168454	Oh, that's good.
4168494	4169755	We have an issue of Retro Gamer.
4169835	4170956	That was a pretty good one.
4170996	4175519	But other than that, I mean, thanks to the internet, I don't really read video game magazines.
4175539	4175859	But here's...
4176383	4192132	The reason I buy their card each year, one, because the magazine subscription gives me something to do, like to stare off in the space at work sometimes, and because the extra trade-in value that you get, it pays for the card within a few uses for me.
4193333	4194214	That's the only reason I do it.
4194394	4196795	Basically, it's a cost advantage for myself.
4198096	4199377	Granted, I could probably...
4200575	4202580	Sell my games on eBay or whatever.
4202640	4204945	But, you know, I don't want to go through the fucking hassle to do that.
4205186	4207010	So, that's my own choice.
4207912	4208192	Whatever.
4209594	4211495	All right, well, apparently here's two versions.
4211515	4214257	They're testing some different rewards versions.
4214918	4215518	I'm not sure.
4215558	4215858	Let's see.
4215898	4216499	Where did this come from?
4216559	4217259	It was a survey.
4217619	4218540	A survey, I see.
4218560	4221322	They were trying to survey some folks to see what they were interested in.
4222042	4226445	And here was one, take your game to the next level with GameStop Rewards.
4226485	4232589	So apparently if you sign up for this new free program, you would sign up with your email address and so forth.
4233090	4239334	If you do one purchase or trade in a year, you would get a birthday surprise, meaning discounts on your birthday.
4239834	4241395	Sucks to be you if your birthday is Christmas.
4242335	4246697	Level two would be make any combination of five purchases or trades per year.
4247137	4251679	You would get 20% bonus trade-in credit because you're a power trader, I guess.
4252059	4254960	And you get early access to purchase collector's editions of games.
4255180	4256041	That's kind of interesting.
4256481	4259442	And $5 shipping on new titles shipped the day of release.
4260463	4260983	That's retarded.
4261303	4264144	Because you know what the early access to collector's editions is?
4264624	4265985	You get the pre-order before everybody else.
4267829	4280091	and then level 3 is 10 purchases or trade-ins a year to get 25% bonus on trade-ins, guaranteed access to exclusive in-game accessories, and so forth.
4280151	4294134	Let's see, and then there's another one that is just like a two-level thing, where if you do one purchase or trade-in a year, you get the birthday surprise, but if you do 20 purchases or trade-ins a year, you get the subscription to Game Informer, you get the power trades, you get...
4294654	4297455	Guaranteed in-stock new games or free shipping.
4298055	4298995	That's kind of interesting, too.
4299015	4301115	So if they're out of your game, they'll ship to your house for free.
4301155	4301696	That's interesting.
4302116	4310957	Early access to purchase collector's editions of games, $5 shipping of new titles shipped on day of release, and guaranteed access to exclusive in-game accessories, etc., etc.
4311378	4314418	So, you know, more incentive programs, which I'm sure makes some people excited.
4314458	4317499	But again, it's about building customer loyalty is huge.
4318179	4318439	You know?
4318679	4323020	And it makes sense that you would pay the $25 instead of making 20 trades because...
4324710	4338913	you know once again it's cheap enough to where $25 that will pay for itself especially with the extra 10% on top of all that probably in one use so why not why wouldn't you do that especially if you're buying games on a regular basis
4339349	4342950	You know why I've never signed up for their program and why I don't pre-order games?
4342990	4344030	And I still stand by this.
4344330	4360974	I don't pre-order games because I find that when the games are released, because the companies are trying to one-up each other, if I pre-order the game at GameStop or whatever, put $5 down, it's going to come out and Best Buy is going to have a sale where you get a $10 gift card if you buy the game or something.
4361295	4366616	That's why I don't like to pre-order games because I don't like to lock myself in because I kind of like to see what the competition is the day of release.
4367136	4396370	and plus sometimes you see these really interesting things where GameStop gets one little incentive, GameCrazy gets another Best Buy gets another, you know like all the companies get their own little free weapon or whatever and I want to pick the one I like the best I don't know, that's my whole thing on pre-ordering and joining these incentive programs and stuff, I just really like to shop around I don't really ever go to one place I only pre-order collector's editions and that's if I'm buying a collector's edition like Grand Theft Auto which we've got sitting right over there
4398089	4398990	Yeah.
4400371	4400912	But that's it.
4400992	4402533	I mean, that's all I really would pre-order.
4402914	4408579	I order most of my stuff through my work just because, you know, I tend to get them early.
4409700	4412643	D5T1 in chat says, Rob must be a Pepsi fan.
4412703	4413643	Need to stick to a brand.
4413744	4414384	Actually, I am.
4414444	4415705	Pepsi's way better than Coke.
4415725	4416987	Pepsi is way better than Coke.
4417987	4422291	Only, and I've said this before, it's weird because Pepsi...
4423479	4424019	Thanks for watching!
4439310	4440452	I can agree with that.
4440852	4443335	I can agree with the tap changing.
4443415	4447039	A&W out of the tap is so good, but out of the can cannot be duplicated.
4447059	4449722	Can's alright if it's cold enough, but yeah.
4449943	4457692	But I will say this, because Dark Tits of Year reminds me, before the Coke lovers start hating on me, I will say this, vanilla Coke was superior to vanilla Pepsi.
4459053	4460014	They're both disgusting.
4460034	4460554	I'm sorry.
4460955	4461355	Whatever.
4461735	4463957	I found Vanilla Coke out of a tap the other day.
4464277	4464597	Still.
4464858	4465738	In the year 2009.
4465858	4466419	At Rubio's.
4466859	4467240	Yes.
4467740	4468400	I was floored.
4468420	4470142	They were also one of the first places to have it in town.
4470442	4473084	You know what else is good with A&W Ruber?
4473765	4474585	Out of the jug.
4474725	4477788	Like, they actually sell it in milk jugs.
4478509	4478809	Nice.
4479269	4479469	Yes.
4479649	4480490	Out of their stores.
4480730	4481391	Oh, that's best.
4481951	4482251	Alright.
4483824	4489254	Let's go ahead and move on and DarkSakura with some more news and we'll get into release dates.
4490507	4502518	Well, there's a channel in the UK called Bravo, which completely has nothing to do with our Bravo, that has a show out called Game Face that's for casual gamers.
4504560	4515670	Pretty much, you just watch these guys play video games, and they'll have some girl come out and be stupid, and then
4516311	4516912	and DarkSakura.com
4532958	4546683	It just really seems like it'd be really boring to watch because usually anything that's got some type of corporate design behind it tends to get the imagination sucked out of whatever it could have been.
4548499	4553182	Yeah, I mean, Drew, there's people that'll sit there and watch other people play video games for a long time.
4553242	4554423	I do when they're at my house.
4554483	4557866	My roommate loves to watch me play Lost Odyssey, even though he doesn't really play the game himself.
4557906	4560888	He loves to just watch me kind of play through it and see all the cinematic scenes and stuff.
4561308	4564130	So it's kind of interesting that they're kind of making that a TV show.
4564190	4570215	I don't think that it sounds like they're doing RPGs and stuff, but, you know, that they'll just kind of show five minutes worth of gameplay and stuff.
4570735	4575879	Also, you know this kind of tangent, sorry, but they have these interesting things on the Comcast On Demand.
4576099	4576239	Mm-hmm.
4576859	4603881	where you can actually go in and they have these things called like I think it's called like the first 15 or something and it's actually I don't know if it's G4 one of the other networks puts them on there because G4 is owned by Comcast if I remember right but you can actually watch in HD like the first 15 minutes of gameplay of certain games like that around release time so to help you decide if you want to buy it or not I guess you know really get to see what it looks like that's kind of interesting I actually think that's a good idea I think that's a really good idea to have that
4604195	4609439	Well, my question is, you know, we kind of talk about how a lot of these TV shows come out and they're stupid.
4609959	4613741	What video game TV show should they make, do you think?
4614142	4617064	How could they make a video game TV show that's cool?
4617844	4625809	They need to bring back the old school stuff like GamePro TV, you know, where you have the person talking about the new games that are coming up.
4625930	4627951	Well, I guess we're already doing that, but, you know.
4629419	4634704	I think that's really what I'd like to more see because it was really cool back in the day.
4634904	4643071	Or, you know, like the video game related game shows, not like Nick Arcade because that was kind of ass, but like the ones where people had the Velcro vest and ran around.
4643491	4644592	Starcade and all that stuff.
4644612	4645193	Starcade, yeah.
4645533	4649755	and I would like to see something like the Screensavers used to be.
4649855	4655197	That was a really cool show, but more about video games, which I know you might be thinking, well, isn't that Attack of the Show?
4655538	4663201	Not really, because that's kind of got that Maxim Magazine spin on it, basically, and that's not all-inclusive, really, of all the gamers.
4664662	4665382	It's also annoying.
4666082	4667083	I don't know.
4667883	4670464	I'm a much bigger fan of what that show used to be than what it is now.
4670584	4671104	That's for sure.
4671684	4672485	So I don't know.
4673045	4678567	I kind of like the idea of a gaming kind of TV show by gamers who somewhat know what they're doing.
4678927	4681448	I also would like to see kind of more current things.
4681908	4685650	I like the idea of a daily show that is kind of current.
4686410	4686570	Yeah.
4687677	4705049	No, I feel, you know, and really, if you want to get reviews and everything, there's more amusing things to watch online, like the Angry Video Game Nerd, and the one that, oh god, I can't remember what it is, the one that my husband watches all the time that's kind of like that, only older.
4705409	4707270	And the guy reviewed beer last time we watched.
4708171	4709432	He was drinking Newcastle, it was pretty good.
4709872	4712514	And somebody in chat says, Orange Lounge TV, maybe?
4713194	4713555	No!
4713575	4713615	No!
4715310	4715691	I don't know.
4716151	4717634	I think we might be getting too old.
4718034	4718856	That's the sad thing.
4719136	4719597	Not too old.
4719637	4720759	We just don't have enough time.
4721199	4721700	Yeah, that's true.
4721720	4722722	Do a daily show?
4723182	4725105	I'd have to be getting paid for this.
4725246	4726467	We'd have to all quit our jobs to do it.
4726487	4727529	Yeah, I would like to get paid.
4727850	4728070	Yeah.
4728711	4730534	So, I don't know.
4732757	4736638	I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin with that, so I'm not even going to think about it.
4737098	4738619	Let's move on with some release dates.
4739359	4740639	Loki, start us off.
4741379	4743860	Well, there's not a whole lot coming out in the U.S., unfortunately.
4744460	4747941	It's a little bit of a slow time, but there is some big stuff this week, including Madden NFL 10.
4748021	4755763	We're coming out this Friday, so you pretty much can expect that on every single system out there, except for the DS.
4755803	4756844	I don't think it's on the DS this year.
4758024	4759905	Fossil Fighter is on the DS actually today.
4762170	4762751	or Tomorrow.
4763131	4763472	I don't know.
4763492	4765294	I thought it was supposed to be today.
4765334	4767336	Anyways, Tomorrow on the DS from Nintendo.
4768218	4773344	Imagine Soccer Captain, another crappy game from Ubisoft that's on the DS.
4774465	4776007	Active Life Extreme Challenge.
4776087	4777088	It's the game that has...
4778770	4781711	I don't know, like a two-player DDR mat, or I guess kind of like a power pad.
4782251	4787232	But it's for the Wii, and it's all the mini-games you could possibly want, and that's available.
4788092	4789313	Or not want, as the case may be.
4789333	4790533	Or not want, yes, that's on the Wii.
4791173	4795494	We have a budget Firefighter sim, Real Heroes Firefighter, that's on the Wii.
4796654	4804216	Also this week, Core on the DS from Graffiti Entertainment, hopefully actually coming out this time because it's been delayed forever.
4805290	4807774	ATV Quad Kings on the Wii.
4807794	4809838	It's a game from Zoo Games.
4809938	4811721	And I can tell you this much, it's going to suck.
4812402	4815367	Because it's just like all those other Destiny games and they all suck.
4817333	4844126	uh let's see Still Life 2 coming out on PC I don't know if that's a re-release or not um Phantom Brave we meet again on the Wii that's actually pretty cool if you're a Japanese RPG fan and if you possibly want one even though you don't own Lips they are selling the Lips microphone separately now you can purchase that this week for the Xbox 360 and
4847625	4869459	and that's it it's like I said slow week it's also slow week over in Japan as we go take a look at the Japanese release dates really on the big systems there's only one new game coming out but it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game and some folks may get a kick out of that it's coming out on the Wii Hagane no Rekken Jutsushi Fullmetal Alchemist Akatsu I'm sorry
4869819	4871300	Akatsuki no Ouji
4889126	4890227	And I'll see you next time.
4906938	4909999	Sounds like a wrestling game or sumo game.
4910259	4910619	Could be.
4911260	4912360	But there's two different versions of it.
4912420	4914641	And then lastly, on the PSP, there is a new game.
4915081	4917242	Infinity Plus Portable comes out.
4917822	4922123	And this is, I think, a bunch of games.
4923204	4928025	It's produced by Cyberfront with different scenarios written by Utsukoshi Kotaro.
4928626	4931527	And he's done scripts for famous adventure games like Memory Off.
4932087	4935088	And it's part dating simulation and part adventure.
4936323	4937305	That's really it for this week in Japan.
4946172	4949533	Well, for our friends in the UK, there's a few releases.
4949613	4961015	On the 12th is Trials HD on Xbox 360, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Red Faction Guerrilla, Demons of the Badlands, both of those on the 13th.
4961735	4967036	And on the 14th is Hearts of Iron 3 for PC and Madden 10, whatever.
4968316	4968636	That's it.
4970957	4971417	And Madden...
4973703	4974585	Not your cup of tea, huh?
4974785	4975206	Bleh.
4975787	4976148	Barf.
4980035	4980937	This is interesting.
4981618	4983422	Sony has trademarked a new...
4985407	4989611	I guess a new logo for something called PlayStation Thanks.
4989791	4991152	No word on what this is yet.
4991433	4997318	However, if you were to ask me, I would say that it's probably going to be some sort of incentive program.
4997338	5000701	Very similar to the Club Nintendo stuff.
5001142	5002203	Very interesting tonight.
5002243	5004304	We have a lot of discount and reward stories.
5004945	5006146	I guess it's a sign of the times.
5006186	5006567	I don't know.
5006847	5007968	To help in the economy.
5008328	5009309	Dude, let's go play Thanks.
5041198	5043121	PlayStation Thanks Redemption
5058207	5084405	S2100 Matt in chat says I approve of these discount stories yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of discount stories it's just kind of interesting it all seems to be hitting the same week and you know we're not dipping back in the weeks we missed this is all perhaps to battle piracy on the PSP you know they get you to buy stuff and you get codes and then you can like redeem points and get crap and maybe that's what they're doing that would make more sense to me PlayStation 3 since there really isn't any piracy on the PlayStation 3 um
5086792	5087112	I don't know.
5087473	5088193	It'd be a nice bonus.
5088213	5088634	I don't know.
5088654	5093558	But I am going to speculate that they're going to probably botch this just like they botch everything else that they seem to be doing.
5105788	5106888	Thanks for watching!
5129173	5137635	Some of the jobs from XI, and I guess the way the game works in regards to the jobs is going to be somewhat similar, but the focus is going to be on the weapons.
5139115	5144617	What's also interesting, they're not using any of the Final Fantasy very typical names for classes.
5144997	5150698	Like you have Swordsman and Sorcerer, all these new types of jobs that you haven't really seen in Final Fantasy before.
5151058	5151678	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5180836	5182037	Daru Daru is now called a Lalafell
5209969	5213891	which I keep saying a falafel but their name is a lalafel or something like that.
5213911	5214512	That's retarded.
5214732	5216393	I know they changed all the names which is so weird.
5216413	5217434	Just keep them the same.
5217454	5217514	Why?
5217534	5218594	Because it's a new world.
5218954	5219895	Oh, it's not a new world.
5219915	5221516	They're the exact same races.
5221616	5222196	Come on.
5222216	5232543	The characters do look slightly different but they're also saying that the difference between the races is not going to be that great but that the differences between the genders in some translation I read there'll be a lot of difference in genders.
5233323	5240465	which some people are thinking might be a throwback to the old D&D where men were typically more strength, women were typically more mind intelligence.
5241346	5242066	Kind of interesting.
5242446	5244126	That's not true at all, but okay.
5247327	5249848	I don't think it's funny to call them falafel.
5251269	5253209	Do you also have hummus as another class?
5253369	5253869	Probably.
5253889	5254830	Actually, yes.
5254850	5256990	There's a humaya or something like that is what they call human.
5258391	5259891	Why can't they just use human?
5259911	5260311	Seriously,
5262512	5264074	They're Elven, okay?
5264134	5265656	Just call them Elves.
5265776	5271383	They're not, you know, Elfen or Elefenton or whatever the hell they're calling them.
5271423	5273325	I think my friend Shane was calling them Lola Fails.
5273986	5274527	Something like that.
5274547	5276950	Because he says they don't look as cute as Taros do.
5277310	5278372	They look bigger now.
5278412	5279433	They don't look like Taros did.
5279713	5281796	Apparently they're more customizable, which would be fun.
5282156	5287699	Are they going to have male Mithras and female Galkas or whatever the fuck they're calling them?
5287719	5288140	Not yet.
5288680	5290161	Galkas are unisex, though.
5290681	5290981	Not yet.
5291021	5294964	We haven't seen anything yet, but the thought is that maybe they're just hiding them, that they might come out later.
5295544	5298165	We'll see male Mithras later on or whatever they're calling them now.
5299686	5300407	Cat people.
5301708	5304369	You say that, and I have thought this ever since.
5304789	5305630	I always think of Mithril.
5307256	5311978	I will say this though, some screenshots have come out from the game, and it looks really nice.
5312398	5316540	Like, not really a lot from in-game, but just some of the scenery and things.
5316861	5321143	And I gotta say, they've kicked up the graphics to look a lot more like Oblivion, but very colorful.
5321623	5324744	Oblivion kind of started to look very monotone after a while.
5325065	5336150	I mean, don't get me wrong, Oblivion had some beautiful graphics, but Final Fantasy XIV, they've shown some landscapes that are just very lush and colorful, and I'm very excited to see how the game looks when it comes out.
5336690	5340613	Rumor is it's going to go into beta later this year because the game's coming out 2010.
5342154	5345596	I don't know how they're going to do that when Final Fantasy XIII hasn't even been dated yet.
5346057	5347337	I think people are getting their hopes up.
5347357	5349039	I don't think this game's coming out until 2011.
5349459	5352201	I realize Squeenix is saying 2010, but come on.
5352501	5353722	How many games get delayed?
5354042	5354983	Do we trust them?
5355083	5356043	Do we really trust them?
5356163	5356764	No, I don't.
5357184	5362368	So, best case scenario, like Christmas 2010 is when you'll see this game, I think.
5363669	5363769	So...
5365370	5380275	But hey, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of excited about this game because I'm really excited at the notion that they have fixed a lot of the problems that, you know, big problems that Final Fantasy XI had, especially in regards to, you know, how long of an investment you have to make with the game each time you play it.
5381753	5382394	DarkSakura.com
5402288	5406634	and find a game that she thinks you all ought to be playing this week in DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
5406794	5408637	DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week?
5409017	5413163	The game of the week is Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn.
5414064	5417849	In Japan it came out as a Zelda Panzer Dragoon RPG.
5418750	5432488	It is a role-play game that came out in 1988 for the Saturn, and it's the third game in the Panzer Dragoon series, not including Panzer Dragoon Mini that came out on Game Gear in Japan.
5433128	5436473	And it's also the only one that's not a rail shooter.
5440227	5447797	It was done by Team Andromeda and this was their last game as Team Andromeda.
5448939	5452764	So you're playing a boy named Edge who is looking...
5454326	5458969	Who's actually trying to, you know, save the world and has his own dragon and everything.
5459449	5466614	And so you play the game with real-time, with a sword, a real-time combat.
5469316	5472197	And your different interactions with the characters.
5472418	5476920	The really, really cool thing about this, though, is that...
5478732	5483294	You actually don't stay on the dragon all the time.
5483414	5486656	You can go around and explore different areas on foot.
5487376	5490938	And then you can fly around the world, you know, different places that you can get to.
5492578	5496480	You control your dragon pretty much completely.
5496700	5504063	Instead of it being predetermined like it was in the other games, you actually tell the dragon where to go and can go anywhere you want to.
5505044	5505144	Um...
5508132	5515056	You also have other commands for the dragon like breaking things and accessing doors and switches and things like that.
5515597	5518218	And your dragon has different, you know, weapons.
5521120	5524922	It's like you have lasers for your dragon.
5525102	5526403	Dragon with lasers, that's pretty cool.
5526423	5527484	Dragons with lasers?
5527784	5528284	Awesome!
5530185	5532026	Why didn't they just call the game Laser Dragons?
5532087	5534188	I probably would have checked it out when it was first out.
5535086	5536666	Well, it actually was really good.
5536726	5539127	It used a lot of dramatic camera angles.
5539207	5551250	It really had just... It was really, really a traditional RPG with some really unconventional aspects to it.
5553311	5558272	Like, for example, your in-air combat, and it wasn't necessarily turn-based.
5558452	5560213	It was real-time based.
5561213	5561273	Um...
5563164	5568033	And you have your attack, you can use items, and then you have your berserks, which are like your spells.
5568835	5576067	And then you've also got your gauges that determine where you are for your initiative, sort of like that.
5577114	5583299	Um, the other, now this is what I really liked is that, um, you could get different, um, abilities.
5583339	5584840	You could equip your dragon.
5585401	5587482	Well, it's technically, it's called morphing.
5587662	5592886	Um, they also put this in, in Panzer Dragoons, Vi, and, uh, Orda, the witch came out on Dreamcast.
5593907	5593967	Um.
5595288	5606453	You can change the dragon into all these different forms, which actually the specific thing about Saga is that you literally had hundreds of different forms that you could do.
5607093	5617338	You would affect different attributes by sort of upgrading parts of your dragon, and it would take a different appearance, have different abilities, do different things.
5619078	5624401	And it would actually change physical form as you did everything.
5625321	5632103	There were really different extreme forms based off of agility, spirit, attack, or defense.
5632983	5636324	And then it would change something within those four extremes.
5638225	5643347	You would also be able to make some unique forms by getting D units.
5644427	5644527	Um...
5646445	5648187	And then there were hidden forms.
5648267	5655536	One of them is called the Lightwing, where if you get all 12 of the D units in the game, you get the ultimate dragon pretty much.
5655656	5659481	The Lightwing has all of the special berserks and...
5662728	5663468	Saturn RPGs are...
5688254	5690176	Thank you for watching!
5716531	5717512	So, there it is.
5718073	5719194	Your classic game of the week.
5719594	5722237	Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn.
5722878	5727323	And I've never really seen this game before, but especially for that era, I like the background.
5727423	5728043	It's very pretty.
5728083	5731447	It's all these dragons shooting their lasers in pretty sunsets and so forth.
5731467	5736733	The only one I could find with really good music and not a lot of talking was one of the dragon battles.
5736953	5737734	Yeah, it's kind of fun.
5738674	5745580	The game has some gorgeous music and also it's in Japanese with subtitles.
5746761	5749503	So the voice acting was actually pretty good in it too.
5749563	5750704	There's a few familiar voices.
5751805	5754207	For at least those who were anime nuts.
5755987	5756988	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5772785	5774686	They'll work fine on your PC at home.
5774726	5775086	Oh, cool.
5775346	5779388	I have one because I just wanted to try it, and it actually works with my disc games.
5780108	5783649	I have a few Saturn games because I just didn't feel like getting my Saturn out.
5783829	5784289	It works great.
5784750	5784930	Nice.
5785670	5788511	All right, well, we're going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
5788551	5789611	We've got plenty more to come.
5789631	5793153	We've got our rapid-fire news when we come back with Part B tonight, as well as some more discussion.
5793493	5795554	We've got some Guitar Hero news coming up, as well as...
5796334	5798458	Talk about that new Facebook integration with the DSi.
5799039	5800241	And PAX 09 news.
5800281	5804348	We're going to talk about all that when we come back from a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5804388	5805109	So don't go anywhere.
5805449	5806070	Stay tuned.
5812645	5817609	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 9th of 2009.
5818170	5824235	Of course we do tape live on All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.
5824555	5826416	Yes, we are back after a brief hiatus.
5826957	5837826	If you're just joining us, we talked a little bit more about that in Part A, but you will just have to download the podcast at this point, which I know was very slow in updating during our podcast, but should be back on a more regular schedule this week.
5838226	5840188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5856401	5863706	and of course their new album which I believe is called Backspacer which is kind of a weird name but okay.
5864087	5869631	It'll be available on the same day on both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.
5870031	5873894	September 20th is going to be the date for that.
5875125	5883521	Pac-Man Championship Edition is now also being ported to the iPhone and it makes perfect sense that they would be putting that out there.
5884302	5886086	So definitely worth checking out.
5887130	5889431	I believe it's actually coming out as Pac-Man Remix.
5889991	5893112	Oh, no.
5893252	5894632	They had one called Pac-Man Remix.
5894692	5895152	My mistake.
5895253	5896393	It is Championship Edition.
5897733	5898333	That'd be kind of cool.
5899114	5904515	That's going to suck on the iPhone because the music was awesome in the Xbox One.
5904915	5909157	I guess iPhone is an MP3 player and they've got some kick-ass tunes.
5910017	5914798	I just can't see the coolness of the Xbox 360 One being reproduced on the iPhone.
5915199	5915459	Sorry.
5915659	5916339	Had to get that out there.
5916479	5916759	We'll see.
5918019	5923401	Champions Online is actually doing something interesting with their subscription service.
5923961	5938765	Besides the monthly subscription that you can do, which would be $15 a month, I guess, you can actually purchase a six-month plan at a slightly discounted rate for $59.99.
5940926	5962872	or if you want to if you're really going to dedicate yourself to this game you can get a lifetime subscription for $199.99 so $200 $200 and I know for a lot of people that are like saying plain wow if you get a lifetime subscription for $200 that probably would have been well worth it you know when it launched so I don't know if you're really into champions online that might be the way to go
5964571	5967734	But aren't you getting also something about Star Trek Online with that too?
5967914	5968114	Yes.
5968134	5969195	That was the part that caught my eye.
5969275	5969496	Yes.
5969796	5980286	If you pre-order one of the subscription plans, you will also get access to the closed beta for Star Trek Online, which is coming out later this year.
5981593	5991339	See, I really want to play Star Trek Online, but not $200 badly, especially when I don't really know anything about Champions Online except that the series has a cult following to it.
5991439	5995281	I play Champions Offline with books and paper and dice.
5995641	6001584	Does the prospect of an online one, because that wasn't really my thing, does the prospect of an online version of that appeal to you?
6002065	6002205	Mm-hmm.
6002885	6003506	I am positive of that.
6003646	6005047	You're going to pay a lifetime subscription to one MMO.
6029884	6030885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6055377	6073318	and that was a game that came out actually came back back out in like 2005 but it has extremely retro graphics it's kind of like Metroid-ish style kind of game and it looks more like an 8-bit Nintendo game I think they say it actually is inspired by MSX if you've never seen this game before well if you've never seen the game before you will get to see it soon
6073658	6077643	La Mulana is on its way to WiiWare, which has a lot of the fans of the cult hit surprised.
6078624	6088094	Although the game will be getting some graphical upgrades, it won't really look 8-bit, but it'll look kind of more 16-bit with a little bit more hand-drawn art is the look they're going for.
6088114	6090056	So it should be kind of fun.
6091038	6093160	RockBand.com now runs an instrument compatibility chart.
6111400	6112161	Thank you for watching!
6129315	6146896	and Rock Revolution which I thought was interesting they also put in their compatibility chart as well with the Rock Revolution drums and so forth if you're curious just briefly well you can look at this at rockband.com slash compatibility you get the whole chart but it actually looks like most of the instruments are compatible with all the games at this point
6147176	6154538	The only things you're going to run into is you're going to run into problems with some of the rock band paraphernalia in Guitar Hero 2 and Guitar Hero 3 on the Xbox 360.
6155058	6158859	And drums are all pretty cross compatible unless you own the Rock Revolution drums.
6158879	6160479	They just don't work with rock band games.
6161039	6166201	But if you want the confidence that your instruments will work with the Beatles rock band, here's some good news for you.
6166501	6167421	Beatles rock band...
6168101	6173226	will run on every single instrument will run with Beatles Rock Band as well as Rock Band 2.
6174207	6177890	The only thing that doesn't work with Rock Band 2 Rock Revolution drums.
6178570	6179671	Same thing with Beatles Rock Band.
6180672	6182294	Like anyone bought Rock Revolution anyway.
6183219	6184821	It's cheap now, even with the drums.
6185221	6185902	I guess it's true.
6185962	6187243	You can find an unloaded one.
6188504	6189344	Anyhow, one other one.
6189965	6193187	Quick follow-up to a story previously talked about on Orange Lounge Radio.
6193327	6198211	Brutal Legend had its lawsuit settled, and the game will be released in October.
6198972	6201734	Double Fine Productions did reach a settlement with Activision over the game.
6202074	6209540	Rumors are saying that Activision got the shorter end of the stick in that deal, but details of the arrangement were not yet disclosed.
6209960	6211702	But the game will be coming out in October.
6212182	6216144	So get ready to rock, those of you that were looking forward to Brutal Legend.
6217345	6220667	That was a really messy situation because there was countersuits and all this other garbage.
6220927	6221187	Yuck.
6222628	6226370	Well, how about some UK Virtual Console news?
6228031	6235536	What actually was going to be coming out is Revenge of Shinobi for Mega Drive for the Genesis over here.
6235556	6236736	It will be coming out for...
6238357	6239378	800 Nintendo Points.
6239478	6244102	And on WiiWare, there's Bonsai Barber, which is a tree sculpting and painting game.
6245143	6248166	It's actually running a business doing both of those.
6248286	6250848	And that's 1,000 points.
6251089	6257754	And then there will be a bunch of city maps for DS City Transport Map Volumes 1 and 2.
6257995	6258956	There will be...
6262178	6272124	Um, Paris, Dublin, Rome, Madrid, and Lisbon, and then there will be London, Amsterdam, um, Moscow, Berlin, and Prague, so that's pretty cool.
6272264	6273084	And that will be for 500.
6275245	6281208	Also, in other news, and this makes me a happy fangirl, is we will have Gorillaz in Rock Band.
6281689	6282969	Yay!
6283590	6284330	Where's the yay?
6284350	6284410	Yay!
6284550	6284850	Yay!
6286431	6286991	That's right.
6287492	6291955	Actually, you know, I'm not the rabid fangirl you are, but I'll download them for sure.
6292195	6292595	Definitely.
6292655	6293075	Heck yeah.
6293516	6299680	Well, there's going to be Feel Good Inc., Clint Eastwood, and Rehash for Pack 1.
6301341	6303162	And that's going to be pretty cool.
6303182	6313769	It's supposed to be out on the Rock Band Music Store this week, I believe.
6314210	6316231	Yeah, Tuesdays are usually the day those come out, right?
6316671	6317112	Exactly.
6317752	6321235	There's also going to be some other download tracks.
6321836	6323297	We get some Janis Joplin.
6323337	6324558	We get Peace of My Heart.
6324698	6325199	That's awesome.
6325219	6328001	This is going to be the best week ever for Rock Band.
6328461	6329242	We get White Rabbit.
6329562	6330083	Dude!
6331184	6332605	Jefferson fucking Airplane.
6332645	6334867	This is the greatest week ever for Rock Band.
6334947	6335848	We get Magic Bus.
6336688	6337069	Nice.
6338513	6342495	But also, for the Wii, there will be a number of songs.
6342555	6344876	Some Blink-182, Kiss.
6345316	6346757	Yeah!
6346797	6349518	Lenny Kravitz, Steve Miller Band, Weezer, Thin Lizzy.
6350038	6352939	You know that 1600 point card you got me for Christmas, Loki?
6353019	6353720	Or no, my birthday?
6353900	6354080	Yeah.
6354200	6355160	I still haven't spent it.
6355320	6357401	I think it's getting spent on all rock band crap this week.
6358262	6359382	I have to get the Gorillaz stuff.
6359442	6360743	I have to get Jefferson Airplane.
6360783	6361123	I have to.
6363004	6365525	So, look forward to that at my next rock band party.
6367529	6374312	And the other thing is that Sega is teasing us with a new RPG.
6374972	6378534	We will be able to see what it is on August 20th.
6380314	6393120	But there are a few clues, though, saying that there is going to be... It's a wooden ship wheel and a silhouette of a woman in a weird pose.
6394557	6401912	So, there's a few people who think that there's going to be a PSO.
6404278	6405919	A new fantasy czar?
6406380	6406820	Fantasy czar.
6407120	6408882	Fantasy star roleplay game.
6409042	6409923	Fantasy czar?
6410063	6410964	Fantasy czar.
6411064	6416528	That's set in the future Russia in outer space.
6416728	6417009	Nice.
6417669	6417849	No.
6418470	6422213	But this is just speculation.
6422233	6424975	They really pulled it out of some HTML code, a.k.a.
6425055	6425496	their ass.
6427065	6427606	So that's it.
6428146	6430388	Couldn't it also be Valkyria Chronicles 2 or something?
6430568	6431789	But I guess we already know about that.
6432410	6437655	Or, I'm thinking if they've got a big captain's wheel, what about Eternal Arcadia?
6439457	6443180	That was out on Dreamcast where you had the air pirate ships.
6443520	6444922	Wow, that's obscure.
6445748	6447609	That's not obscure, I have it.
6449049	6450049	Doesn't mean anything.
6451990	6456691	Folks, go look at the video of the vault on YouTube and tell me she does not have some obscure shit.
6457011	6461013	The lady pulls out a dish that came with a video game at some point, I kid you not.
6462633	6464074	Or perhaps... That's obscure.
6464174	6467695	It's a new party game collection, Sonic vs. the Somalia Pirates.
6470656	6470856	No?
6471076	6472836	Good times, good times.
6473697	6473837	No?
6476601	6477081	Very cool.
6477801	6478101	Alright.
6478121	6480542	I hate you, Spyware.
6480622	6481242	Oh yeah, that's right.
6481282	6484083	It came out as Skies of Arcadia over here or whatever.
6485124	6486864	I thought Eternal Arcadia was a better name.
6488004	6489685	Oh, now Skies of Arcadia, I've heard of that.
6489765	6490065	Okay.
6490365	6490825	Oh, okay.
6491466	6491966	I get it now.
6493046	6493606	Not obscure.
6494967	6496887	Alright, let's get back to some more gaming news, Loki.
6497887	6498288	Alright.
6498748	6499288	Um, well...
6501144	6502265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6526089	6527571	Which is interesting.
6528672	6536740	And on top of that, also Guitar Hero Van Halen this week got its full track list.
6538742	6541004	Some people are less excited about it.
6546169	6548952	Anyways, some of the tracks feature...
6552308	6571293	Jump, Hot4Teacher, Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls, Panama, Pretty Woman, So This Is Love, Unchained, Other artists featured in the game as well, Billy Idol, White Wedding,
6579255	6593355	3rd Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life, The Offspring, Pretty Fly for a White Guy Queen, I Want It All, Lenny Kravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead
6594196	6601402	Man, just when I think a song list kind of blows and I'm not really interested, they have to go in and throw in a Queen track that suddenly takes it from suck to awesome.
6601682	6606646	Which, by the way, SingStar Queen is apparently out now, and I'm surprised I don't already own it.
6606946	6607547	It's not out yet.
6607987	6608928	I thought it came out this week.
6609308	6611310	Oh yeah, that's right, they changed the date, I forgot about that.
6611370	6612411	It got bumped up or something.
6612611	6613271	Yes, it did get bumped up.
6613291	6617695	I'm waiting for it to go to the discount bin, though, because SingStar games usually end up in the discount bin in about a month.
6618717	6620920	Yeah.
6621461	6631234	So yeah, all those tracks and, you know, of course those two stories just happen to go together just because they're both Guitar Hero games and not for any other reason at all.
6631614	6632115	Of course not.
6632135	6632636	Of course not.
6632976	6634298	That would be purely hypothetical.
6634538	6634819	Uh-huh.
6635880	6648391	Now, I was in South Lake Tahoe this weekend, and at the basement of one of their casinos there, Harvey's, they have a Cabo Wabo, and that was kind of a fun place to go, because good drinks and so forth.
6648471	6649251	You know who started that?
6650893	6652674	Somebody that's missing from Guitar of Van Halen.
6652694	6653415	Exactly!
6653515	6653775	Yes.
6654476	6660581	So I was going to say, I saw some, well, I didn't see him there, but I saw someone this week that I'm not going to see in this game.
6661302	6661782	Sammy Hagar.
6664520	6671445	I was going to also say, though, that the game is scheduled to come out.
6671865	6674507	Van Halen is actually scheduled to come out December 22nd.
6675407	6676308	For most people.
6676468	6679470	That seems way pushed back from what we were originally hearing.
6679490	6680651	It is way pushed back.
6681491	6681972	Interesting.
6682652	6684213	It is interesting now, isn't it?
6684613	6685794	Hypothetically speaking.
6686374	6687075	Very interesting.
6688717	6689797	Just before Christmas.
6690358	6691318	Just before Christmas.
6691338	6692699	But Christmas will come early for some.
6692919	6693359	For some.
6693419	6694339	Guitar Hero Faithful.
6694760	6694960	Yes.
6695160	6695520	Perhaps.
6696340	6696880	Hypothetically.
6697001	6698021	Hypothetically.
6710026	6710506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6725836	6727358	The same thing with your cell phone.
6750680	6752542	It's the same thing, but with your DSi.
6752882	6756045	You basically just, you know, instead of your cell phone, it's your DSi.
6756366	6769499	But since the DSi has all the picture altering modes on it where you can draw and have the borders and all the, you know, weird distortion pictures, you can upload those pictures too, which I guess you can't really do yourself.
6769919	6770300	Yeah, I know.
6770880	6776284	I mean, honestly, it's the same functionality you'd find in a cell phone, which, you know, whatever.
6776604	6776884	Okay.
6777385	6780507	More ways to upload pictures of what I'm doing on my Facebook, I guess.
6781267	6784709	Not something that has me bouncing off the walls, but I can see where some people find this cool.
6785310	6787771	Especially if you don't have a decent camera on your cell phone.
6788452	6789753	Or you like to edit pictures.
6790293	6798399	As somebody on my Facebook loves to do, because all the pictures he's posted of himself are all, like, drawn on and mirrored imaged and all just distorted.
6798419	6799019	Yeah.
6799588	6801589	But hey, have fun with it.
6802170	6803851	That's what DSI is about, having fun, right?
6804191	6807333	Is there anything else they could really do with Facebook integration and the DSI?
6807653	6809134	I mean, I'm kind of glad it's just this.
6809235	6813097	I wouldn't want to see Facebook saying, so-and-so is now playing Pokemon.
6813437	6815599	So-and-so just stopped playing Pokemon.
6815799	6818441	Because I would block those posts from Facebook so fast.
6818481	6820002	I mean, is there a lot of other integration?
6820442	6824064	The only other possibly cool thing I can think of is an interactive high score board.
6824645	6826966	You see this with Bejeweled Blitz and some of the other games.
6827407	6829048	So and so just beat your high score.
6829148	6830709	Click here to try and beat it.
6832110	6836132	One thing I do like about Facebook is if you find that shit annoying, there's always a hide button.
6836232	6839054	And you can block any application and all that stuff.
6839094	6841296	Facebook used to be a lot worse, but it got a lot better.
6844678	6848920	Just curious if anyone else thinks there might be something cool they can add to Facebook.
6850157	6850858	DarkSakura.com
6869813	6870474	I blocked it.
6870514	6871615	I blocked Farm Town.
6872035	6880223	The only thing that I play on there are these retarded quizzes and the pet thing, Pet Society.
6881013	6887795	I will admit, I play Bejeweled Blitz, I play Sorority Life, I'm level 47, thank you very much, and I play Farm Town now.
6887855	6901279	My boyfriend got me addicted to Farm Town, which in reality, it really is kind of one of the dumbest fucking games, but you know what, it's something that Jeff really enjoys to do, so I play it to kind of have a friendly competition with him, although he's so much more addicted than I am.
6902900	6907501	But I told him if he likes Farm Town, he really needs to play Animal Crossing sometime, because I think that would be right up his alley.
6908672	6911513	Anyhow, enough about casual Facebook games.
6911533	6913614	Let's talk about more video games, DarkSakura.
6914934	6917915	Well, we might have some other video game news.
6918736	6919376	How about Braid?
6920837	6924598	Braid is actually going to PlayStation Network, finally.
6926219	6931781	It's supposed to be... Actually looking for... No, they don't have a...
6933146	6941991	A date on it yet, but they are saying, though, that hopefully it will be out soon, I guess.
6943192	6944473	It seems like a little late.
6944653	6947855	I mean, didn't this game come out like a year and a half ago or something?
6947875	6950576	I mean, maybe it wasn't that long ago, but at least a year ago, right?
6950776	6951057	Yeah.
6951697	6954278	It seems like it's kind of late for this game to come on PlayStation Network.
6954639	6956220	I mean, I guess, you know...
6957168	6960150	Wherever people want to play the game, let them.
6960391	6963113	And let the designers make their money, however.
6963193	6967696	But it just seems like this game's on Xbox, this game's on PC.
6967796	6970298	Is there really going to be that big of a demand for it on PSN?
6970779	6973221	I have no interest in rebuying the game, that's for sure.
6973521	6976623	Yeah, but there's people who have PS3s that don't have an Xbox 360.
6977364	6979706	Although a good number of them have wised up and picked one up since.
6980226	7009754	or have a PC that they could download the game on but I guess not everybody likes to game on PC I would be more interested in this if there was like more levels or something but I just to be honest I don't see how you could do that in a game like Braid without kind of dumbing it up because one thing that makes Braid pretty cool is the storyline which is very finely contained to those episodes I don't see how you could have like a bonus stage or anything like that I think it is what it is and new costumes and stuff isn't going to be enough that's for sure
7012771	7013051	I don't know.
7031377	7041269	I think they just integrated it into some games, you know how they have voice chat in certain games, like I think Pokemon games and stuff like that, you can do voice chat with the DS.
7041550	7043653	I think that's what it came down to, because it was just a tech demo.
7045295	7045455	Hmm.
7047372	7049613	And that's what some folks in chat are saying.
7051214	7052435	It's called Pokemon Voice Chat.
7052715	7055817	Yeah, probably because the DS isn't that powerful.
7055837	7059599	I mean, shit, it can't really run a web browser that well without an expansion card in it.
7059619	7061160	It has no real RAM in it.
7061280	7063961	I mean, it has a few megs of RAM, but that's about it.
7064582	7068264	I would think it would be very tough for it to process that kind of stuff, but...
7070191	7070511	I don't know.
7071352	7075675	I'm very interested to see what Nintendo's next handheld is going to be like.
7075895	7078256	And I bet we see it in about three years.
7079457	7080338	I'm very curious to see.
7080358	7080998	Maybe even two.
7081218	7084340	I'm kind of curious to see if they power it up a little bit.
7084360	7085561	It'll be GameCube graphics.
7086441	7086842	We'll see.
7087342	7088042	It makes sense.
7088122	7089043	It's the progression.
7089363	7089804	That's true.
7090124	7090524	That's true.
7091785	7093606	I wouldn't mind like a portable type F-Zero.
7093826	7094306	That's for sure.
7094567	7095087	It'd be fun.
7096667	7101249	StarCraft 2 has been officially delayed to 2010 and that makes a lot of people sad and you won't be able to buy the trilogy
7122278	7122698	Bioshock 2 Delayed 2010
7152005	7153266	Well, they want to announce a lot of games.
7153306	7155368	It's just not already.
7155669	7162055	Well, they figured out that lumping everything into the fourth quarter, first off, they're going to have trouble meeting their deadlines.
7162135	7166059	And two, it just gets buried under everything that comes out.
7166219	7174607	And a lot of people are probably scared of Modern Warfare 2 because they don't want to release a game out around the same time because it'll just get ignored.
7175749	7175949	And...
7177227	7177487	I don't know.
7177507	7179408	I'm kind of glad that less stuff is coming out.
7179809	7191737	But at the same time, I think a lot of these games that they were announcing and stuff like Kane and Lynch 2 and stuff like that, I'm not surprised it's being moved to next year because I don't know.
7191757	7193017	They just weren't ready yet.
7194719	7194859	Hmm.
7196553	7196873	All right.
7197253	7206356	Well, hey, at Penny Arcade Expo 2009, you're going to get to play a game that's not ready yet, but only if you are one of the lucky ones selected to play in the Omegathon.
7206696	7212557	The game Halo 3 ODST is going to show up in round three of Penny Arcade Expo 2009's Omegathon.
7212897	7216098	The other games, Mario Kart Wii is round one's game.
7216778	7218899	Round two is Bookworm Adventures.
7219699	7222360	Round 4 will be an unnamed rhythm game.
7222400	7228502	They don't know what game it is yet, but speculation is that it could be something that's not out yet, like Rock Band Beatles or DJ Hero.
7229243	7231003	And round 5 will be Connect 4.
7231544	7237466	The final round, as always, is a mystery game that will probably be either something new or something really old.
7238286	7240667	So like Epic Pong type of thing.
7240967	7241768	They've already done that.
7241828	7243189	What were the games they did last year?
7243209	7246650	I don't even remember the Momagathon stuff from past.
7246690	7247931	I think Combat was one year.
7247951	7248511	I remember that.
7248611	7249652	Combat was one year.
7249732	7250833	Pong was one year.
7250913	7252494	They did Halo 3 one year.
7256296	7257996	I don't remember what was last year.
7259377	7263819	I think we were broadcasting versus Excitebike was the last game last year.
7264540	7264980	That's right.
7265861	7266421	I remember now.
7267577	7297223	so by the way speaking of Penny Arcade Expo sadly it looks like no one from OLR is going Loki obviously is not going to be able to go DarkSakura has not been planning on going I was kind of on the fence right now I'm a real heavy no on PAX if something comes up like a really great opportunity in the next few days then I'll change my mind but right now there's just so much other stuff going on I just think there's other stuff I can do besides Penny Arcade Expo which is kind of sad because I certainly would like to see the listeners up there and so forth but I'll just have to try again next year
7297876	7299057	Someone wants to pay for me, I'll go.
7299357	7301519	Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.
7301539	7302340	Actually, I'm starting school.
7302720	7303501	And here's the other thing.
7304182	7320617	I am still aiming for, and this should be clear, the one big reason I'm not going to PAX this year is because I am still definitely set on going unless something happens to PAX Boston next year, which I know is weird because I'm on the West Coast, but I do want to go visit the East Coast.
7320657	7321517	I've never been to Boston.
7321557	7321978	I want to go.
7322438	7323239	I'm looking at that.
7323359	7323879	Thanks for watching!
7340884	7356718	uh yeah that's that's my plan you know again if something developed like if if there's this huge opportunity for OLR all games that I've heard but I haven't even heard if they're going to be broadcasting again this year or anything I think Bobby was heading all that up last year and I think he's trying to do something for at least his show this year
7357338	7358339	I am still hoping for PAX Boston.
7358359	7358559	We'll see.
7377568	7378008	Thanks for watching!
7404652	7405673	I do want to go again.
7405713	7416142	That's part of the reason why I'm trying so hard to go in Boston, because then it won't only be like OMG PAX, but OMG I'm also in Boston, which I've never been to before, and I have friends there, so cool.
7417182	7425267	All right, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a trip to our e-mail bag, and I'm sure the mail bag is busting at the seams this week because we haven't been on in a little while.
7426248	7426568	I don't know.
7426608	7427729	I think it's just average size.
7428089	7430611	DarkSakura, what are you doing over there?
7430631	7432792	You've got a dude standing in his underwear on The Sims.
7432852	7433453	What are you doing?
7433573	7434453	It's a bathing suit.
7434513	7435394	He's in a Speedo.
7435714	7436175	Oh, I see.
7436195	7436615	See, look.
7437375	7439637	It looks like Tidy Whitey's from back here.
7440720	7444701	Well, I think that they were based off the same model, but I see.
7445142	7446442	Wait, this doesn't answer the question, though.
7446622	7447102	Another black.
7447142	7449663	What are you doing designing a naked dude?
7450363	7451184	He's not naked.
7452204	7452744	Half naked.
7453245	7456166	I'm just putting him in something to go swimming in.
7457486	7458426	You should have seen what I had him in.
7458526	7459947	Here, here's what I had him in before.
7461427	7462447	This makes for great radio.
7462888	7463108	Sorry.
7463148	7465308	I had him in these little short things before.
7467729	7468790	That's what he was in before.
7468810	7469370	Oh, okay.
7469630	7470970	He can stay in those fine.
7471170	7471751	No, I don't care.
7471791	7476992	I just think it's funny that I look over there and then suddenly, yes, it's Marisa Congusto in chat says banana hammock.
7479473	7483214	But the problem is, is that I changed out the default skin.
7483254	7484635	So he's like extra buff now.
7485995	7488056	So, and besides that, the underwear is better.
7488573	7491074	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
7491454	7494416	Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com if you want to send us some emails.
7496137	7498598	So, the first email.
7499799	7504381	I'm trying to go in chronological order, but this comes from...
7508143	7511024	Okay, I'm really not going to read the explanation of the guy's name.
7511745	7514466	So, I apologize for fucking up your last show.
7514526	7517928	I accidentally sent all my contacts that message.
7518008	7518768	Do not hate me.
7518848	7521029	I hate spam too and my email is filled with spam.
7522050	7526031	As for the Skype shit, I was using my PSP on a horrible connection.
7526071	7527552	I'm in the market for a computer.
7527572	7528613	This is Juan, isn't it?
7528793	7529053	Yes, it is.
7529073	7529953	I remember reading this.
7530033	7531154	Okay, that's who it is.
7531974	7532815	Fuck Windows Vista.
7534042	7535404	Do you know any good operating systems?
7536005	7541976	Yes, Linux Mint, it's free Windows 7 is going to be better than Vista Linux Mint is better than it all
7545557	7550902	Next, and he sent a couple by accident, so I am just going to read the one that looked like it made the most sense.
7551963	7562533	Hey, OLR, I wanted to say that almost all the game purchases I've made, I've recently made, have either been talked about or recommended on your show, and I love them all.
7563033	7566516	So thank you for that, but this email actually does have a purpose, and it is this.
7566957	7569899	Since I'm only 13, I wasn't exactly well alive...
7570720	7577843	for the now old school gaming and I would like to expand my gaming horizon and start to include some old school stuff.
7578223	7582424	So I was just wondering if you guys had a good starter console for someone like me.
7582564	7583685	Thanks guys, Mike V.
7585253	7585834	13 years old?
7586554	7585834	13.
7586734	7591136	Dude, I think we have a listener that claims to be our youngest listener at 14.
7591176	7592157	I think he just got beat.
7592357	7592937	Sorry, dude.
7593137	7604543	Just pick up one of those used, I would say, you have the Famicom NES systems that are kind of third-party now that you can pick up.
7604803	7605604	Pick up one of those.
7605664	7608105	Go to one of your used game shops.
7608545	7612707	Or even, I was reading, there's a lot of people that found pretty good deals at thrift stores and stuff.
7612727	7614188	You can find some old consoles.
7614648	7617209	I actually found discontinued games at thrift stores.
7617249	7623790	Like, I found, of all things, Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin for the Odyssey 2.
7624510	7624890	Wow.
7625010	7625650	At a thrift store.
7626071	7628151	Or, you know, DarkTetsuyu makes a good point.
7628771	7629251	Get the Wii.
7630011	7631272	Or the Virtual Console.
7632952	7635253	It's a pretty faithful recreation of the original stuff.
7635693	7637373	Honestly, and I can't believe this kid's 13.
7637893	7640934	I feel so old because that means I would have been 18 when he was born.
7641034	7641374	Oh my god.
7642574	7659743	but Super Nintendo if you missed out honestly Super Nintendo I don't think has ever been beaten in terms of great consoles Super Nintendo was the best gaming console purely 100% game console Super Nintendo was the best gaming console they ever made if you're going to start anywhere I say start there
7660323	7661444	Actdeft, Drew,
7676118	7682981	Super Nintendo did have a few better versions like Super Street Fighter 2 I thought was better on Super Nintendo.
7683021	7693985	The other, and this is of course just for sampling purposes, you know, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer, you can always try GameTap or, you know, Zofar's domain.
7695526	7698307	But I actually, the Wii's going to be your best bet.
7698387	7704890	You know, you can sample the Genesis world, the TurboGrafx world, Neo Geo, you know, go that way.
7705748	7705868	VALVe
7730272	7731393	The Steam Clan.
7731693	7734915	They don't have a lot of old school stuff.
7734935	7737376	But they have the old PC stuff that we played.
7737976	7738557	Some of it.
7738817	7740097	Some of the old LucasArts stuff.
7740698	7741158	I'll give you that.
7741418	7742919	I just downloaded Loom for $5.
7743539	7744040	I'll give you that.
7744920	7748842	I still want to go buy the TurboGrafx version that's $35 at a local store.
7749242	7749783	But, hey.
7751627	7761332	And if you want a list of actual games, go ahead and sample the different systems.
7761372	7762113	See what you think.
7762493	7764454	It would help to know what kind of games you're into.
7764574	7766255	Are you liking the old school RPGs?
7766355	7768356	Are you liking the very simple things?
7768576	7771418	The RPGs, you're going to want to go with the SNES.
7772058	7774940	80s arcade games were very much all about repetition.
7775260	7778642	Look at some of the greatest video games of all time that came out of the 80s.
7778702	7779203	Pac-Man.
7779443	7782125	That board never freaking changed the whole time.
7782665	7783966	Until it degraded.
7784686	7785487	Donkey Kong.
7785827	7789409	Basically a loop of the same, what, three screens, right?
7789429	7791470	Three with the Pie Factory.
7791490	7793812	With the Pie Factory that isn't in the Nintendo one.
7794833	7797494	Play the one with the Pie Factory or you're not really playing Donkey Kong.
7797514	7799495	Play to a kill screen.
7800016	7800176	Yeah.
7801902	7802863	Be what's-his-face.
7803244	7804184	Billy what's-his-face.
7805385	7805626	Yeah.
7805966	7806266	You know what?
7806286	7810710	That's what I'd like to see our young 13-year-old listener accomplish.
7811010	7813853	Make it a life goal to beat some of these scores on these 80s games.
7816038	7816478	Atari 2600 Atari 2600 Atari 2600
7844122	7846464	Next email, and this one is a bit long, okay?
7846484	7850587	I don't know anyone like that, do I?
7865185	7865906	Tease, tease, tease.
7894006	7896367	I assume this is an older neighbor then.
7897308	7902050	I continually remind him that the Beatles are a band, not the second coming of Christ, and that he needs to get over it.
7902510	7912475	Ultimately, the decision of whether or not the game gets made lies with the band, the copyright owners of their music and EA, and really, he has zero say.
7912875	7915156	All he can do is decide whether or not to buy the game.
7915276	7917397	I tell him that even though the band may enjoy...
7919298	7920118	Enjoy playing music.
7920178	7923940	Ultimately, they, as well as just about any band out there, have three goals.
7923960	7925320	Become famous, become rich, and get laid.
7925981	7926781	I don't think so.
7927621	7929122	You need to remember this, too.
7929742	7931163	And this is something to tell your neighbor.
7931343	7940828	Is that at E3, let's not forget, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, and George Harrison's wife.
7940848	7941668	Sorry, I forget her name.
7942028	7944950	They all came out on stage in support of this game.
7945470	7945690	Yeah.
7946846	7947927	So, the end.
7948387	7948708	Sorry.
7948828	7949989	Yeah, tell your neighbor that.
7951570	7957174	I asked him that if he were in the Beatles, would he have turned down buttloads of money the EA was shelling out to make the game?
7957575	7961218	Every time he tries to say he would have, I outright call on the bullshit answer.
7961738	7975829	Well, you know, there are people who actually are really talented musicians who are in bands for the purpose of
7976834	7977534	Thank you for watching!
7995330	7999494	Great comments from Shaq, and I read these real quick, because Marissa Congusto has a great comment.
7999855	8005420	My opinion being, the Beatles rock band is not consistent with their image or message, but if it creates new fans, cool.
8006121	8012027	And, yeah, especially when we talk about, you know, generation and, you know, this whole thing, you know, certainly the 13-year-old who emailed us before was...
8012307	8014189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8032579	8042903	At any rate, though, I don't think that... I think it's a generalization to say that people get in a band to be famous, rich, and get laid.
8043604	8044184	Seriously.
8044844	8049106	I think that the first thing, and this is honestly...
8051576	8053638	I've done things with groups before, like I was in a jazz band.
8054518	8055599	I played in a jazz band.
8055859	8057540	We didn't get paid for shit.
8057620	8062443	They maybe gave us some gas money, but we did it because it was something that we loved to do.
8063864	8072069	You like getting the crowd into it, knowing that you're evoking that emotional response and the people that you're performing for.
8072089	8073029	I think that's a big thing.
8073069	8075031	It's a massive adrenaline rush.
8076692	8083756	I think that the people who I think have had staying power are the people that love what they do in the end.
8083836	8084756	That's honestly what I think.
8086297	8090840	Yeah, usually these bands that are created to get laid are the ones that break up after one album.
8091320	8091581	Yeah.
8094652	8095993	Next area here.
8096354	8104102	This may be old news to the three of you, but for the sake of other listeners, I thought I'd throw this out there, especially for those who own both the 360 as well as the PS3.
8104542	8115494	Apparently, if you have an external HDD formatted in FAT32 with miscellaneous media on it, music photos, whatever, the HDD will work on both systems.
8115894	8120636	This does not mean you can play system specific DLC or downloadable games on the other system.
8121076	8123617	It just means that you can use the other media on both systems.
8123757	8130300	I discovered that my external hard drive worked on my 360 last weekend shortly after the last show.
8130660	8132141	Typically, I use them on my PS3.
8133809	8139295	Finally, as per usual, every time I hear that as per usual, it makes me think of Eddie Izzard.
8139675	8143099	We've left you a huge fuck-off horse, as per usual!
8143800	8144060	Sorry.
8145421	8151267	I thought I'd end this email with some of my visual recommendations from the video section of the PSN store.
8151628	8153470	This week, I have three recommendations.
8153510	8155772	Season 1 of the original Transformers series from the 80s.
8155832	8156173	Woohoo!
8156733	8164459	Basilisk, an anime series taking place in feudal Japan and centers around two warring clans of assassins and Voltron seasons 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
8165500	8165720	Okay.
8166541	8167182	That's 4, 5, and 6.
8167362	8169163	In limbo.
8169704	8171145	With these selections, you can't go wrong.
8171405	8172046	Zarkon ate them.
8173507	8174588	As they are all pretty good.
8175088	8177690	Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy email.
8177710	8178331	It's appreciated.
8178351	8181313	This email is brought to you by Florida, the limp wangus of America.
8182454	8183034	Who's that from?
8183095	8183595	Spazinator.
8187441	8188341	Is that it or we got more?
8189702	8191802	Actually, I have to point out something that Becky just told me.
8193282	8198484	The band that was formed mostly to get laid was Poison and they were very successful.
8201104	8202225	That guy's still getting laid.
8202885	8203545	Seriously.
8204485	8204765	Good point.
8204785	8207286	He has a whole VH1 reality show around getting laid.
8209304	8211585	This comes, um, okay.
8212246	8217608	I originally intended this message to be, um, a Rob, I miss you and wow type of thing.
8218129	8222011	And then I came to the website to see the OLRs temporarily, I hope, on hiatus.
8222071	8222771	Say it ain't so.
8223511	8226853	I guess there's just a good reason and I hope that things are well with everyone.
8227593	8228534	Guess I'll have to wait and see.
8228634	8230555	Oh, and Rob, I do miss seeing you and wow.
8230655	8232336	Maybe we can play together again sometime.
8232416	8238119	Your old pally, ghoulie, nin, nin tinctus?
8239419	8240522	99.
8239940	8240522	Oh.
8240562	8241564	Some of us called her for short.
8242046	8243590	Oh, I see.
8243650	8244873	It's 99 cents without vowels.
8245335	8245535	Yep.
8245936	8246157	Okay.
8247310	8254213	Um, yeah, you know, I have my reasons for leaving WoW, and I'm sure we'll all come across each other in the next MMO.
8254513	8256113	I'll be in Final Fantasy XIV for sure.
8256914	8257934	For sure, no doubt.
8258374	8262436	At least when it first comes out, I'm gonna have to play it for the first month, just to see.
8263296	8264576	Whether it goes beyond that, I don't know.
8265437	8270939	Just, you know, WoW, I think I just finally, you know, you play something for so long, you just finally, like, I just don't have it in me anymore.
8271859	8271959	So...
8272850	8280816	Rob with two B's, our dear friend who always links me to informative articles, linked a couple that were on game politics.
8281837	8288362	One of them saying that video games are blamed for low vitamin D in children.
8288382	8291764	Because they're not going out in the sun enough?
8292225	8293125	I would suppose so.
8293245	8293686	How funny.
8293706	8296247	And one is saying that screen time may lead to high blood pressure.
8297568	8303047	I think that really it's more, for the high blood pressure, I would really think that it's more of the
8304506	8306488	Not getting out and getting enough exercise sort of thing.
8306828	8310592	And also low vitamin D. It's exactly like you said, kids aren't getting enough sunlight.
8310612	8313014	But I was actually watching on Oprah of all things.
8313614	8317978	And I don't watch Oprah, but it was on in the waiting room of the hospital when I was going to get my stitches removed.
8318819	8330229	Is that most people, especially in America and in big cities, are very vitamin D deficient because of sunblock.
8331696	8336539	I actually am not allowed to use sunblock because I am very vitamin D deficient myself.
8336739	8338080	I have to use sunblock.
8338981	8341402	I'll have to take supplements or something if I'm lacking it.
8341502	8347906	What they say is that everyone should have 15 minutes of unfiltered sunlight.
8350008	8350528	15 minutes a day.
8350808	8352049	I can handle that if I wear a hat.
8352708	8353028	DarkSakura.com
8372591	8376714	But that's only when I'm going to be out all day, like Disneyland or Great America.
8377154	8378455	It's just dumb not to do that.
8378535	8385360	The way that vitamin D is formed in our bodies is the synthesis is made with vitamin A and UV radiation.
8385820	8386140	Sunlight.
8386901	8388161	Wow, this is incredibly interesting.
8388502	8388922	Not.
8389843	8390363	I'm kidding.
8391344	8392024	What are we talking about?
8392064	8392364	I'm sorry.
8392384	8393245	I wasn't paying attention.
8393285	8393785	Vitamins.
8394085	8395006	Like breakfast cereal.
8395426	8398448	That's why you eat Special K because you get lots of vitamins in it, remember?
8398608	8399369	Drink fortified milk.
8399629	8400290	Eat your Wheaties.
8401724	8403466	I would love to drink the vitamin D milk.
8403486	8405868	You can, by the way, supplement with vitamin D and eat more fish.
8406889	8411773	Wait, what are the vitamins, since I'm going to ask totally tangentially, that you can get too much of?
8411834	8416118	Like C, you can never get enough vitamin C. Like, you know, if you get too much, you go peep.
8416138	8416718	You peep it out.
8416798	8417439	You pee it out.
8417959	8420181	Does that work with B12 and D and some of these other ones?
8420402	8421663	Or is there a limit?
8422443	8424044	I know zinc has a dangerous limit.
8424064	8426085	Your minerals will have a limit.
8426505	8427285	Iron, zinc, and all that.
8427305	8432587	With vitamins, actually, you can have an overdose of niacin, but it takes a long time to build up.
8433428	8434888	Beta carotene turns your skin orange.
8435268	8436349	I did that when I was two.
8436729	8437229	True story.
8437469	8439810	When I was two years old, my parents had me to the ER because I was orange.
8439830	8440971	What was your name in the Partridge family?
8441011	8441591	Susan Day?
8442351	8445633	I was watching a special about the Partridge family that...
8446073	8447855	Come on, get happy.
8447915	8454323	She ate so many carrots because that's all she ate that she had a buildup of beta-carotene in her system.
8454664	8461412	But you know the yellow rice that they pass out internationally is actually beta-carotene fortified because of deficiencies in those areas, so...
8461892	8470116	I'm just saying, there's just certain, you know me, even though I may not always She's not a doctor, don't take her advice.
8470136	8472256	I'm a big nutrition nerd.
8472356	8476058	Even if I don't even follow my own advice all the time, I still know it.
8476578	8478219	I worked at GNC like freaking forever.
8478840	8479761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8501519	8507847	To put it in perspective to a non-game player, the claims are also stating these two things are also caused by video games.
8508187	8510850	One, playing video games reduces incidence of skin cancer.
8511932	8513073	That's back to the sun.
8514726	8518888	Playing video games reduces bike, skateboard, and pedestrian injuries.
8519368	8520328	Well, duh.
8521309	8524350	It sounds even worse when you talk about the benefits of video games.
8524390	8525170	Benefits in quotes.
8525890	8532153	It points out that the events, playing video games, and ailments vary independently of each other.
8532653	8534033	Silly pseudoscientists.
8535794	8537195	It's just a bunch of ridiculousness.
8540992	8544636	Also, playing video games gives you a rash.
8545957	8546237	Kidding.
8546618	8546878	Itchy.
8548800	8549320	Last email.
8549480	8550501	Hey, OLR crew.
8550521	8550762	Hey!
8550882	8554045	I was just saying hey.
8554485	8554986	Hey!
8556687	8557808	AZHP here.
8557929	8558649	I got a joke for you.
8559750	8560551	What does a cow eat?
8560631	8561092	Hey!
8561312	8562573	No, what do gay horses eat?
8562853	8563214	Hey!
8568777	8569957	Alright, read the damn email.
8569977	8571238	I'll put the mic down, I promise.
8572358	8572578	Okay.
8572978	8573699	See, you heard it.
8574059	8575539	That was Rob putting down the mic.
8576780	8577720	ACHP here.
8577860	8579680	First of all, I'm glad that... Where's the duct tape?
8579700	8580781	Let's just tape his hands together.
8581701	8584922	First of all, I'm glad that my last email warranted a gold star.
8586883	8596486	Now, I doubt this one will earn similar acclaim, but I want to relate to you all briefly a synopsis of the way way off-Broadway DDR musical I came across on the internet.
8596686	8596926	What? !
8597586	8600108	and hopefully it will distribute all as much as it did me.
8600428	8601909	Well, it got a let from me.
8602389	8603490	Stop me if you've heard this one.
8603830	8615258	Long story short, there's a guy named Moonbeam Funk, which I actually misread as Moonbeam Fuck first, who carries around a fetus in a jar on his belt and starts a dance revolution in a city where dancing is prohibited.
8619980	8627966	He is joined by a small child named Small Child and Small Child's prostitute sister Trampling Sally.
8629086	8636772	Moonbeam is about to unleash a dance move called the Flaming Rooster, but it is stopped by policemen who wear kilts.
8637532	8645057	The Revolution disbands, Moonbeam Funk leaves, and comes back later to have sex with Trampoline Sally after performing The Flaming Rooster.
8645357	8649440	Kills her during sex, and ends up in a catastrophic level 9 dance-off.
8649880	8650621	See what they did there?
8651581	8657746	Ordered by a judge where he faces off against Jacquees, who loved Trampoline Sally but had his legs broken by the police.
8658226	8663609	However, Trampoline Sally's ghost gives Jacquees dancer juice, and he wins despite having broken legs.
8664630	8665591	Okay, I can't take it.
8665611	8666912	There's one sentence left.
8667732	8671475	Then Moonbeam Funk returns to his home planet using gravity shoes.
8671895	8673016	You can't make this stuff up.
8673516	8683203	This is somewhere between camp that they know is camp and the most pretentious goddamn modern art bullshit I've ever heard of in my life.
8683223	8687205	Remember they made a DDR movie one time in Japan?
8688386	8688906	Whatever.
8689106	8690848	Stop trying to make a movie out of DDR.
8690888	8691848	They are all stupid.
8691868	8694510	Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck was the movie they made in Japan.
8694570	8695591	No, it wasn't.
8695611	8696732	There's more.
8697752	8698393	I remember that.
8698613	8700554	Sorry, I just remembered how hilarious that movie was.
8700674	8713722	Now, while this may still sound like the best musical ever, bullshit, the one thing it could do to ruin itself more than it already had, it did.
8713863	8716264	They didn't use Taku.
8716304	8717285	They didn't use B4U.
8717645	8719586	They didn't use, oh, just name the Bumani artists.
8719606	8720207	They didn't use them.
8721347	8723909	No, they used DDR Disney's rave music.
8724049	8726571	Yes, Zippity-Doo-Dah and Chim-Chim-Cherry and Night of Fire.
8727884	8742421	I left out a lot of things, but you can check out the article at vjarmy.com I'm actually going to put it in the chat room, but it's vjarmy.com slash archives slash 2008 slash 12 slash bucketoftears.php
8745644	8747465	And that's all separated by an underscore.
8747885	8748926	For details.
8749086	8753407	The best word I can think of to describe this play, or at least what it sounds like, is gay-tarded.
8753668	8755668	I mean, that's really what it sounds like.
8756089	8758850	Like, you know, you don't want to say that's gay because that's offensive.
8758870	8761511	You don't want to say that's retarded because that's actually really offensive too.
8761851	8766233	So I'm going to make up a new word that, so when it's a new word, it wouldn't be offensive to either group.
8766253	8766993	I still like my word.
8767253	8767433	What?
8767473	8767933	Butt-tard.
8768194	8768654	Butt-tard?
8768774	8769154	Butt-tard.
8769174	8769975	I've been using that for years.
8769995	8770855	I'm going to say gay-tarded.
8771175	8774357	So this play sounds completely gay-tarded is what it sounds like.
8774537	8778580	I just – I can't fathom paying money.
8778660	8782002	Like how much – like New York City Theater can sometimes be expensive.
8782062	8783663	Like how much money do they want for this?
8784683	8785203	I don't know.
8785483	8785823	Wow.
8785944	8787404	I mean, anybody can do theater.
8787424	8791305	It looks like the farts that bugs that live in poop make.
8793366	8794186	That's pretty nasty.
8795166	8802989	Hopefully this email isn't too long to make it to the show because I think a lot of old fans of DDR will get a laugh or at least a facepalm out of this.
8803209	8803809	I got both.
8804389	8806150	Long live DDR EZHP.
8806850	8807550	Thank you, Ranma.
8807630	8809751	The tickets were $20, says Ranma.
8810731	8811271	No thank you.
8811532	8812872	That's $20 I could spend on like
8814568	8815388	Don't do drugs, kids.
8827657	8828698	Winners don't use drugs, folks.
8830118	8834140	Unless you're on steroids and are on the Chinese swim team.
8834400	8838621	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to send us an email.
8838921	8843203	And the folks in chat are pointing out it's way off-Broadway, as in way, way, way off-Broadway.
8843403	8844503	Like, it's in Staten Island.
8844543	8846124	That's how far off-Broadway it is, okay?
8846924	8848245	I don't know if that's true or not.
8848645	8852666	All right, a couple more stories for you guys, and then your calls on the Skype line at 877-GAME-OLR.
8852706	8852926	Loki.
8855390	8855590	Yes.
8857452	8862378	So Red Faction Grill is getting a brand new expansion that's going to actually...
8863777	8864478	Wrecking Crew Mode
8888800	8889761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8911462	8917624	or deposits on the mini-map and support for upcoming download content as well.
8918824	8931728	And then other fixes they've done, just some other glitches that they were running into, you know, drops in multiplayer and certain ties not being recorded in leaderboards and whatnot.
8932168	8935790	So overall, just, you know, a pretty nice update.
8936470	8936870	But, um...
8938035	8938636	Thanks for watching!
8954936	8956297	I always like blowing things up.
8956337	8956977	That's kind of fun.
8957777	8959138	Saints Row set on Mars.
8959198	8960758	That's a really good way of describing it.
8960918	8967021	Well, I don't know if it's exactly like Saints Row, but it's the same developer and it's that open world kind of feel to it.
8968461	8972223	I think it's a little bit more linear, this game, but it looks fun.
8973752	8974132	Interesting.
8974493	8976435	I like the idea of just blowing things up.
8976715	8980199	But when I hear Wrecking Crew mode, I also can't help but think of the old school 8-bit game Wrecking Crew.
8980239	8980659	Remember that?
8981620	8984523	It was crap.
8984583	8986505	Woot Explosion, says Misty in chat.
8986625	8987146	Absolutely.
8988387	8988888	Alright, let's...
8990249	8995491	Go on to one more story here tonight, and then we're going to open up our Skype lines at 877-GAME-OLR.
8996091	8999613	And this story has to do with porn.
8999833	9000393	That's right.
9001193	9003834	DDM.TV, it's a company out of Japan.
9004215	9009997	They are going to be bringing on-demand, Blu-ray quality HD adult movies to the PlayStation 3.
9011117	9011838	Woo-hoo!
9013558	9014959	Console war's over.
9016499	9020280	That's right, didn't I say that the system that gets porn first would win?
9020761	9023342	No, that was HD DVD and Blu-ray, wasn't it?
9023902	9024442	I don't remember.
9025382	9027983	Even I don't remember what I said on this damn show like two or three years ago.
9028003	9029024	The problem with that is they adopted both.
9029044	9029404	That's true.
9031075	9037361	Anyway, you do have to have a broadband connection, an HDMI cable, of course, if you want the high def, and, of course, a PlayStation 3.
9038162	9040123	You will download the movies for a fee.
9040444	9047750	You go onto this DMM.TV Blu-ray website, and then you can search for titles by actress, keyword, what have you.
9048631	9053155	So if you've ever wanted to see Yuma Asami and the 100 Masturbators, there you go.
9053215	9055858	You can watch that on PlayStation 3 in full.
9056158	9057519	High Definition, congratulations.
9057839	9061442	Now, what's kind of interesting about that, it sounds like they kind of bypassed Sony somehow.
9061682	9065225	It sounds like you're logging into their website and downloading them to your PS3 or something.
9065706	9066686	Isn't that what it sounds like to you?
9068048	9069849	This can't be sponsored by Sony.
9070149	9073152	This must be using the web browser and some type of backdoor or something.
9074192	9076314	Pun intended.
9076554	9080397	It might be downloading video files to your PS3 or something like that.
9081318	9083920	Or downloading them to your PC so you can watch them on your PS3.
9084100	9084441	I don't know.
9085543	9088164	Maybe, I don't know, maybe they're more liberal about that stuff over there, though.
9089785	9090166	Who knows?
9092007	9094688	VidPower calls this 1080p-ness.
9098870	9099811	God, I love the listeners.
9100151	9102392	But don't they blur it out in Japanese porn?
9102432	9104293	At least all the ones I've ever seen.
9104653	9109396	Of course, I always saw the funny ones, like Final Fuck X and all that, where they did blur it out.
9109836	9110817	Yeah, they're all blurred out.
9111876	9138239	Unless it's softcore, it's just all the VagP and stuff gets blurred out SSJ100 Matt says, all we get on the Xbox 360 are three flashing red nipples We got a bunch of comedians tonight Oh god, this is awful, I'm reading that article by the way D5T is calling dot fuck, apparently Instead of dot hack, there's a porn called dot fuck That's funny
9140618	9141219	Oh my gosh.
9141359	9141659	All right.
9142379	9142860	You know what?
9144121	9144541	Whatever.
9147043	9149745	Something I think... I don't know.
9149765	9150605	Do I want to go on a tangent?
9150625	9150906	Why not?
9150946	9151626	We have plenty of time.
9151646	9153187	We're going to be opening up the Skype line soon anyway.
9153908	9154809	Something to remember...
9155811	9157352	Everybody has sex.
9157752	9159232	That's how we get here, okay?
9159713	9169976	Granted, I realize that some people define themselves as asexual, which means you don't really care for sex, but I'm still assuming that at one point or another, you've tried it.
9170317	9173598	So, everybody has sex.
9174038	9175238	So, what's the big deal?
9175298	9178820	At some point, I mean, if you're the 13-year-old listening, you should not be having sex yet.
9179400	9183021	Although, according to Oprah, you probably already are.
9183642	9184062	You know what?
9184762	9186243	And why am I watching Oprah?
9186283	9190644	Actually, that same episode that I watched says that people should get laid three times a week for better health.
9190944	9191205	You know what?
9191885	9193946	I don't have a problem admitting on the show I was 20.
9194546	9197327	So, you know, by Oprah, I would be a late bloomer.
9197407	9199328	And I know there's people that wait even longer than that.
9199608	9200008	Some people 30, 35, 40.
9200088	9200208	I was 32.
9203309	9207872	That's fine, but I'm saying at some point, this is not a spiel about virginity.
9207932	9212974	My spiel is about everybody has sex or thinks about having sex.
9214335	9217876	So, why is porn such a big taboo, big deal thing?
9218016	9221538	I mean, you know, they should just get over it and put porn there.
9221558	9223499	We're in a country that was founded by Puritans.
9224279	9227081	Because they have a hundred masturbators in that film.
9227841	9231182	And that's just way too much masturbating.
9232811	9237436	And besides, you own a PS3 if you're interested in this.
9237877	9240660	Therefore, you have access to the internet.
9240920	9246045	Therefore, you have access to YouPorn and many other porn alternatives that are free.
9246786	9251111	Why would you pay for porn when you can get it for free?
9253207	9265778	Giovedea in chat says I was 21 my cousin is almost 25 and she's still a virgin nothing wrong with that but she probably thinks about it I mean she probably still thinks that doesn't mean she doesn't think about having sex doesn't mean she hasn't never seen a porn
9267356	9269197	And I can tell you it was awful
9294767	9298431	Did somebody at some point look at one of the girls and go, How you doing?
9299131	9300552	No, unfortunately, no, they didn't.
9300873	9303735	But the woman's name was Monica instead of Monica.
9303755	9305958	Because, of course, they have to do that.
9306098	9308059	I love porn parodies so much.
9308100	9308960	They're so funny.
9309120	9312964	I still like the one, the Ally McFeel one.
9312984	9314305	I liked Beaver and Buttface.
9314405	9314726	That was...
9315066	9316967	I haven't seen that one.
9316987	9318487	They have Office.
9318827	9320548	Seriously, all the TV shows now are parodies.
9320568	9322848	Scrubs, The Office, Star Trek.
9322968	9325629	Best line I've ever heard in a porno was in Beaver and Buttface.
9326870	9328190	I think I'm going to cum or something.
9330631	9331171	That's awful.
9333686	9334447	Porn Lounge Radio
9359656	9360256	You know what?
9360376	9361277	It's been a few weeks.
9361337	9362678	We have a lot of pissed up energy.
9362758	9363418	What can we say?
9363959	9364859	What's on your mind tonight?
9365500	9367241	Yeah, I can see that.
9367801	9373985	Before I start, Loki, just because the porn is free doesn't mean it's that good.
9374485	9375145	Just so you know.
9375365	9376506	You're just not looking hard enough.
9377767	9380349	I look more than my fair share, okay?
9380369	9383190	I look more than anybody else in the chat room, okay?
9385512	9386012	But, um...
9386886	9394671	The reason why I called is to make a comment about the whole Best Buy price matching thingamabobber here.
9396612	9400254	Yeah, pretty much deals don't make their money.
9402755	9403176	How so?
9403196	9409960	Alright, I used to work for Best Buy and the discounts at the time were great.
9409980	9411961	5% above retail cost.
9411981	9412661	They paid for it.
9413602	9413962	I bought
9415045	9420667	A cable for my PS2 that retailed for $9.99, I paid $1.72 for it.
9422808	9423449	Interesting.
9424769	9434533	I mean, even if they take a $5 loss off the games, they're still going to make the money back off of the accessories on the games, accessories for the consoles.
9434924	9437666	Accessories for Home Theater, Electronics
9457461	9461343	Xbox 360 game is $48 their cost.
9461503	9462703	And they may get it cheaper.
9462904	9466245	It's roughly the high 40s, though, is what they're paying for.
9466365	9467766	And, yes, there is a markup there.
9467806	9471167	And, yeah, if they drop it down $5, they're not really losing a lot of money.
9472228	9473728	So, I mean, they could do it.
9474049	9475689	And it's definitely possible.
9475709	9482452	And accessories also, yes, there's a higher margin on accessories, about 20% on average, if not more than that.
9483053	9483213	But...
9485100	9489821	Yeah, I mean, I guess there is, they won't really be losing out a lot.
9489881	9497023	But it could get ridiculous, especially if they're dropping the prices, you know, of used games at GameStop or whatever, and they continually do this.
9498003	9498383	I don't know.
9498643	9500403	I don't see this program being very successful.
9500443	9502964	I mean, it's going to be successful, but not their benefit, I guess.
9504824	9505904	Well, it depends.
9505964	9513546	I mean, if they do this, they probably won't be having to do their fire sales that they have on games like every eight or nine months, give or take.
9517878	9518418	I guess we'll see.
9518658	9522060	Do you really think, though, they're going to expand it past this Utah store?
9522080	9524121	I mean, part of me just kind of thinks it's wishful thinking.
9525562	9527403	Honestly, I don't think so.
9527443	9530585	And if they do, it probably won't hit New York City.
9530705	9536528	Case in point, back in March, they had this massive blowout sale on anime.
9536548	9536748	50% off.
9537049	9541311	First thing I did was I hit all the stores in New York City to see if I can find it.
9542210	9544851	None of the stores in the five boroughs were participating.
9544871	9549613	I had to have friends go find the titles I was looking for out in Jersey, Connecticut, and so forth.
9550074	9550474	That's right.
9550514	9556557	Something we sometimes forget is that stores can usually opt out of these types of promotions that they don't necessarily have to participate.
9558497	9558978	Very interesting.
9559878	9561779	Any other thoughts to share with our listeners tonight, Ranma?
9563257	9565039	Thank you very much for the call, Ranma.
9565059	9565439	No problem.
9565519	9566380	Take care, fellas.
9566700	9567320	Love you, Jamie.
9567340	9567541	You too.
9567561	9567761	Bye-bye.
9592995	9598459	1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9601280	9601601	Hello?
9601841	9603282	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9604328	9605149	Uh, Deathwishing.
9605329	9605970	Hi, Deathwishing.
9606010	9607191	We can hear the speakers a little bit.
9607231	9608011	Might want to turn them down.
9608052	9608532	What's on your mind?
9608592	9609213	Yeah, sorry.
9609673	9610474	It's okay.
9610494	9611354	We'll forgive you this once.
9611394	9611695	What's up?
9612575	9616579	Um, well, thanks for, like, making me not be able to sleep tonight with all the porn talk.
9617139	9617800	Hey, you're welcome.
9617840	9618541	That's what we do here.
9619361	9620883	Scarring listeners for life.
9621843	9623785	Hey, look, we've got, like, three weeks to make up for it.
9624386	9631532	I don't know, but did you guys hear about how they're raising prices on, like, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and, like, Britain and stuff from what I heard?
9632908	9634029	I haven't heard about this.
9634069	9636610	I've been a little bit out of the loop since our hiatus.
9636650	9639112	I think they're doing it here also because I think they did.
9639392	9642854	No, it's still $60.
9643034	9647497	I pre-ordered normally collector's editions for like $70 and this time it was like $80.
9649418	9651680	Not all collector's editions are $70 either.
9652940	9655622	I saw they're raising the price way up and it's just like
9656567	9657688	I don't know, kind of not right.
9657708	9663290	And people care about this, but no one gave a crap about the Wii version of Guitar Hero being $10 more here.
9663411	9667032	Wasn't one of the Halo limited editions like $40 or $50 more than the regular?
9667453	9668013	It was way up there.
9668033	9668893	The legendary one.
9668913	9670114	The one that came with the cat suit.
9670294	9675337	Well, yeah, but this is all... Look at the collector's edition for Modern Warfare.
9675357	9675937	I mean, that's like $200.
9676037	9677358	Yeah, this is true.
9677378	9679959	And also...
9682924	9687667	Also, I picked up Chromehounds.
9689889	9695393	Ah yes, the old school mech game that dates back to when the 360 first came out and Loki was a big fan of this game.
9696133	9697875	Everyone should pick it up.
9698655	9699676	What do you like about Chromehounds?
9701217	9706901	I've been seeing these ingenious designs people make of mechs.
9709483	9712585	So far I made one where now I can't be hit directly.
9714215	9714616	It's not crap.
9714636	9714776	Shut up.
9732478	9739482	I wanted to get it because it was like, you know, Armored Core, and then I just got tired of Armored Core altogether, so I don't know.
9740142	9742243	The problem with the game was it was too slow.
9742323	9748707	It was just like, you know, Armored Core is very quick and it's a mech fighting game very similar to Chromehounds, but it's a lot faster.
9748747	9749827	It's a lot more faster paced.
9750048	9753790	Chromehounds is just slow, slow, slow.
9754430	9756131	What type of person did you play, huh?
9757672	9760013	Well, I played a four-legged mech.
9760660	9761281	That's why.
9761861	9762962	Four legs are slow.
9764223	9765664	Well, I wanted a lot of weapons on there.
9766765	9767946	You could have used chicken legs.
9768607	9770789	The most important thing to Loki is firepower.
9771690	9772150	Clearly.
9772250	9775853	I mean, I've never even watched him play Chromehounds, but I could just tell from knowing Loki.
9775873	9776614	Not necessarily.
9777354	9780097	It was trying to be more all-around.
9780137	9782239	That's what I was trying to do, but you can't be all-around.
9782259	9784801	You've got to specialize either close-up or far away.
9784821	9786883	You've just got to kind of figure out your strategy before you build.
9788304	9788444	Okay.
9789588	9791750	WellDeathWishing, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
9791970	9794692	Will you guys buy me Marvel vs. Capcom 2, please?
9795272	9796173	Uh, no, we're broke.
9796193	9797173	I don't even own it myself.
9797514	9799275	You can come to my house and play it on Dreamcast.
9800336	9801436	No, Xbox.
9801656	9804819	Yeah, you could probably get it cheaper on Dreamcast these days.
9804839	9805859	But no online play.
9808221	9809962	You kids and your online play!
9810022	9815726	I'll tell you what, when Capcom sends us redemption codes for the game, we will send you the first one we get.
9815786	9816307	How's that sound?
9817406	9817806	Yay?
9818247	9818687	There you go.
9818787	9819748	Have a good one, Deathwishing.
9820228	9820748	Bye-bye.
9822789	9826832	Capcom, if you're listening, you can send those to care of Rob Roberts.
9827192	9828473	Hey, Rob.
9828733	9829914	Hey, I haven't even reduced it.
9829934	9830735	There's another call online.
9830775	9831695	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9831715	9832155	Who's this?
9833196	9833877	Legend of Zaku.
9834337	9835998	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
9836018	9837479	Have you checked out the DDR play yet?
9839077	9839958	Um, which one?
9839978	9841580	The one that aired last winter?
9842000	9844924	No, the one with, what the hell is this?
9845744	9849168	The one that made no fucking sense whatsoever that sounded like a bunch of pretentious bullshit.
9849188	9850369	The one with Moonbeam Punk.
9850389	9853172	Where DDR really has nothing to do with it, honestly.
9853192	9858358	Yeah, that's the one I was referring to because that one was actually late last year.
9858478	9859058	Did you see it?
9860572	9861652	Unfortunately, no.
9861733	9863774	I actually didn't get the chance to buy tickets.
9863834	9866377	I actually sold out a lot quickly than I expected.
9868398	9870841	I mean, it was shocking to say the least.
9870861	9876986	The fact that it sold out for the first few days, it was really hard to get even Will Call for that matter.
9877847	9879709	Was Tom Cruise in it or something?
9879789	9881870	Why did so many people want to see this?
9881930	9882811	I don't understand.
9882831	9884433	I guess it's because DDR.
9884473	9884673	That's
9884793	9885153	DarkSakura,
9905410	9907152	Johnny Cash, Guitar Hero 5.
9909634	9921486	From the looks of it, it looks like Activision is in a pissing match between Konami and seeing who can whore out their top franchises the farthest.
9923008	9926731	Am I hearing that you think the Johnny Cash inclusion is a bad thing?
9927642	9938378	well, many people, I mean, I'm referring to the fact that there's a lot of hostility towards the fact that they're just doing it for the sake of just milking the franchise even further
9940253	9944836	That's what I've gotten in terms of all the comments that I've read so far regarding this story.
9945096	9950700	Yeah, but it's not like there's a Guitar Hero Johnny Cash game coming out.
9950900	9952941	This is just a part of Guitar Hero 5.
9953161	9958085	Ever since the third one, you would have just random band characters show up in the game.
9958165	9961287	I've got to say, it doesn't get much cooler than Johnny Cash.
9961887	9965429	Yeah, but I think you hit it on the nail right there.
9965550	9968772	After the third one, the series pretty much went downhill.
9970433	9987382	by then Rock Band came out and the rest was history you could add as many guest appearances as many guest stars or any famous people in that game and it still wouldn't make up the fact that it's still milking the franchise Loki asked a good question did you see that Taylor Swift is in Band Hero?
9989026	9993028	Um, I heard of that game, is that the one coming out for the DS?
9993488	9997729	No, it's exactly Guitar Hero, it's just now it's with more family-friendly songs.
9998029	10001170	In other words, it's just another excuse to put out another fucking Guitar Hero game.
10001190	10002671	There you go, there you go, Loki, see?
10002871	10006832	Okay, but that's, Zaku, that's the milking of the franchise.
10007393	10009553	Putting Johnny Cash in the Guitar Hero game.
10009613	10012554	Alright, you know what I define milking the franchise?
10013035	10013775	When you have...
10014315	10017698	When you basically have all your clothes strewn around in Hot Topic.
10018058	10020000	When you're basically on cereal boxes.
10020500	10028847	When you have those little mini-games that you find right there inside the cereal boxes.
10028947	10036854	I mean, you could say the same thing for DDR, the way Konami is hoarded out with the toys in both Subway, Burger King, and to an extent...
10038856	10040717	Milk in the Franchise is not about merchandising.
10040757	10044520	Milk in the Franchise is about having five releases for the damn series in one year.
10045821	10048303	No, I'm sorry, six releases for the franchise in one year.
10048323	10057830	I can see what Zaku is saying, though, because when you play these crappy Guitar Hero games that have the Guitar Hero name on it, such as little portable things you see in Hot Topic or whatever, I don't know.
10057930	10058950	Oh yeah, that sucks too.
10058990	10060711	That kind of devalues the franchise.
10060731	10063292	It gets to the point of prevalence where it's just ad nauseum.
10063352	10070514	I mean, Rock Band keeps the whole thing consistent on the fact that you hear a diverse set of music in Rock Band.
10070534	10074935	You don't just hear nothing but all number one hits.
10075655	10084078	All you hear is just some schmuck band from nowhere getting into Rock Band versus a lot of A-listers on Guitar Hero.
10084178	10085138	Mostly A-listers.
10085518	10093643	You know, Zaku, it's not that I disagree with you that Activision's milking the shit out of their franchise.
10094063	10096545	But I don't think it's because they put Johnny Cash in the game.
10096605	10101368	That's actually the first thing in a long time I've heard out of the Guitar Hero franchise where I'm like, that's kind of cool.
10101388	10102829	I'm the devil's advocate, alright?
10103389	10107772	I mean, Johnny Cash's inclusion to Guitar Hero 5 would pretty much introduce...
10108292	10108652	and so on.
10130757	10136922	The Beatles, and it actually does a good chronology of the whole band's history.
10137503	10138544	And through their music.
10139284	10144028	Whereas Johnny Cash is just there in Guitar Hero 5, packed in together with a whole bunch of other artists.
10144369	10149873	So you don't like this because you don't think it's respectful enough.
10150294	10151715	They just kind of threw him in there.
10152275	10154337	Yeah, that's pretty much the case.
10154357	10156399	They just threw him in there to make more cash.
10156619	10160563	Now I'm following you a little better.
10160643	10161063	I get it.
10161123	10176817	So you think the milking is coming from the fact that you're just kind of like, hey, let's just reskin, let's just slap a face of a popular rock star on this and put it in our game when somebody like Johnny Cash deserves epic-style treatment.
10177518	10194182	Right, I mean, with Guitar Hero Metallica, they did it differently in that it came out to be a good game because it not only had Metallica's music, but it had a whole bunch of other metal bands that were probably personally picked by the band, for all we know.
10195026	10208717	I think it's almost the same as Beatles Rock Band in the sense that it wouldn't do any chronology to the band, but it put it to a level where it's respectful.
10208777	10214382	It has its own game, it has the entire catalog right there of Metallica's music.
10215202	10217524	That would be the only exception to the fact that
10218385	10220267	to Activision's milking of the franchise.
10220767	10226093	I guess it'll get worse once Van Halen gets their own game and then, you know, obviously with that whole Aerosmith thing.
10226633	10230397	It's going to be very interesting to see what develops of the Guitar Hero franchise moving into 2010.
10230657	10233720	But, Zaku, I understand where you're coming from now, but we're running out of time.
10233740	10234401	I've got to let you go.
10235462	10236342	Have a great one, okay, Zaku?
10237003	10238384	Alright, later dude Later
10261504	10262145	Two things.
10262385	10269249	Unfortunately, the email that I sent you was like a couple weeks old, and I just wanted to update a couple things.
10269789	10270490	Oh, sure.
10271330	10281957	Yeah, first and foremost, this is probably more directed to Loki, but I just wanted to say my condolences to you and your wife over what happened.
10282297	10282637	Thank you.
10283758	10286920	Yeah, believe it or not, I'm not going to go into details,
10287492	10301262	Now, as for the second topic, I'm kind of surprised you didn't mention it already, but I don't know if you guys are into sports games at all, or at least the arcade style ones.
10317355	10329719	But recently there was an announcement that EA is going to be making... I'm sorry, did you start... Do we lose him?
10331239	10332560	Oh, I'm still here.
10332700	10336001	I heard there was some echoing, so... Oh, sorry.
10336101	10337541	Okay, I'm not following you.
10337681	10340582	So what type of games were you asking if we were into?
10340602	10340942	Sports.
10341142	10342082	Oh, sports games.
10343383	10344183	Yeah, um...
10344993	10363158	Recently, EA announced that they're going to be making Madden Arcade, which is going to be kind of like a Maddenized version of 3-on-3 NHL Arcade, which came out earlier in the year.
10363178	10371000	So, you know, it'd be like arcade-style games, you know, or sports games, you know, they may be up and ailing.
10371420	10372300	If not, then...
10373039	10374816	Just to disregard that, so...
10377560	10379981	Let me explain my thing with sports games.
10380021	10383643	I've been wanting to try and define this on the show for a long time.
10384404	10387846	The interesting thing is that we're a show that we're not really big on sports games.
10387866	10390107	We don't really talk a lot about them, and that's our audience.
10390167	10395690	But I do enjoy casual sports games, if that makes sense.
10395730	10397872	You know how we talk about the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer?
10398332	10399913	I like casual sports games.
10400013	10400753	I don't mind them at all.
10401114	10402414	I think that's why I kind of...
10403895	10408658	Desire, those old school sports games like, you know, the Tecmo Bowl, the Blades of Steel.
10408898	10411379	Those games were very easy to just pick up and get into.
10411479	10413040	Baseball Stars, that was another really cool one.
10413400	10417603	The ones today, I have a really hard time just kind of pick up and running with.
10417843	10419604	Like, they're just so intricate and so much into them.
10419924	10425027	Like, you know, and hey, for the hardcore sports fan, cool, you know, more for you.
10425167	10427808	Like, they don't play role-playing games that I play probably.
10428169	10431370	They play their sports games and that's cool, you know, there's a lot for you.
10431691	10432031	But like, I
10432691	10438655	I actually think probably one good way to define the type of sports games I can get into is an arcade type of game.
10438815	10440516	Insert, quarter, play game.
10440776	10442097	You know, it's just very, very easy.
10442157	10445959	Like NBA Jam, that was one of my favorite video games years ago.
10445999	10449521	And you probably wouldn't think listening to this show that I was ever into a sports game at some point.
10449921	10451923	But some of them I can get into.
10452243	10455565	But yeah, we haven't had a lot in a long, long time.
10455665	10460268	So EA's trying to bring out more casual sports gaming is what you're saying?
10461488	10462289	Yeah, basically.
10463206	10485014	Yeah, it's, well, I don't know if you ever tried their latest demo on either the 360 or the PlayStation 3, but last year they, you know, earlier this year they came out with an arcade-style hockey game, basically, I think, NBA Jam for Hockey.
10485694	10486535	No, I never played that.
10486655	10487335	Do you know the name of it?
10489042	10493244	It's called NHL, or, you know, 3 on 3 NHL Arcade.
10493924	10496205	It's basically NBA Jam with Hockey.
10496465	10497485	I will have to check that out.
10497525	10498465	I don't think I ever played it.
10498926	10503187	You know, I will admit, I have gotten to the point where I'm kind of like, eh, sports game, pass, sports game, pass.
10503447	10505868	But if somebody tells me to go back and check something carefully, I check it out.
10506268	10511510	I mean, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort aren't these kind of casual sports games in a way, too?
10511670	10516032	And Wii Sports is like the biggest freaking video game of the past 10, 15 years.
10518251	10518652	Oh, yeah.
10518772	10527080	Yeah, I can't say I really know much about the Wii games, because I really haven't been following them.
10527460	10529802	I don't even own a Wii, at least not yet.
10531304	10536309	Most of my knowledge about video games are about the Dota 2 system.
10537430	10541273	One last touch before I do hang up.
10541293	10541454	Yeah.
10544535	10555460	I know if it's something the three of you would be interested in, but there's a free download on the video section of the PlayStation Network Store.
10555700	10563783	It's 1980s enemy pilots called Saber Rider.
10565704	10566224	I can do free.
10566304	10569766	I want to ask you a minute to cut you off.
10570461	10571862	Oh no, I can do free.
10571962	10572902	I always like free things.
10573162	10577404	They probably put this up on there to get people to check it out because they're probably going to sell the series.
10578745	10579365	Yeah, probably.
10579805	10588089	I haven't seen it yet, but I did download it, so I can't really give an opinion.
10588509	10591311	Maybe in a future week than Spazinator, but for now we're going to let you go.
10591571	10594052	Thank you so much for your phone call, and we're going to wrap up.
10595252	10596013	Alright, have a good one.
10596133	10596493	Later, buddy.
10597830	10598130	Alright.
10598831	10600232	Casual Sports Gamer.
10600312	10600913	That would be me.
10601594	10603496	I can't do these harder to get into.
10603616	10605758	With the playbooks and all that stuff.
10605798	10608180	The most playbook I could get into was Tecmo Bowl.
10608641	10611243	Run, Run 2, Pass, and Pass 2.
10611703	10611924	That's...
10613035	10614376	That's as playbook as I get.
10615257	10617438	Alright, anyhow, I think that's going to do it for the Skyblind tonight.
10617478	10619459	Let's get any last minute stories, Loki.
10619659	10619880	Yes.
10621040	10622001	This is interesting.
10622081	10629206	Apparently, Konami is relaunching the Drum Mania and Guitar Freak series with Guitar Freak's Drum Mania XG.
10629726	10635770	It's going to be in HD and it's also adding more fret buttons to the guitar controller.
10635850	10638452	Now with five fret buttons with adding yellow and purple.
10638912	10642675	They're also going to have hold notes or longer notes just like you'd see in
10643215	10644776	Other rhythm music games.
10645577	10654064	And also the open strums are actually going to be part of the normal guitar charts as well.
10654484	10656146	And vibration is added when you're wailing.
10657127	10660549	Drumania, they're adding a left hi-hat and a floor tom.
10660710	10665073	And they're also adding a hi-hat pedal and a second bass pedal as well.
10665894	10666034	And...
10667535	10670716	Apparently the new machines are going on testing very soon.
10671016	10678038	Some of the new songs include Hyper Jetland, Kaiser Phoenix, Blue Planet, and Piranha.
10678078	10681299	All those, of course, looks like in-house artists.
10682459	10690121	And some of the old songs, Returning, Vampire Killer, Over the Limit, Highway Star, and some others.
10690842	10692042	And let's see here.
10692062	10695103	They're going to have a new interface, also a beginner mode.
10696957	10707762	And I guess there's also gameplay being shown in the background, I guess with your note link over the top.
10708182	10709202	So that's kind of neat looking.
10709283	10711463	The machine looks really cool.
10711483	10712964	I don't know.
10713104	10714305	But a little too late, I think.
10714325	10715065	I don't know.
10715768	10717229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10744059	10745520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10774125	10777713	And that's thanks to some people in Britain there.
10781180	10781661	Let's see...
10782651	10799858	Ben Heck, the creator of such wonderful portable systems, has a new project now he is blogging about, including creating his very own custom pinball machine, which he, for some reason, decided to choose Bill Paxton as the theme of the pinball machine.
10800218	10808482	But it is kind of neat if you want to check it out on how you can make your own very unique pinball machine from scratch.
10808742	10809542	So that's kind of neat.
10809902	10810543	That is kind of cool.
10812019	10815684	Um, there's a game on Commodore 64 I used to play back in the day that I loved.
10815764	10820911	Pinball Construction Set by ECA, which back in the day was what EA turned into.
10820931	10823014	Or what, you know what I mean?
10823094	10823214	Yeah.
10824509	10829814	Modern Warfare, they have their really ridiculous Prestige Collector's Edition.
10829874	10843527	Well, not to be outdone, but Codemasters, they're releasing Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising in the UK with a really ridiculous Collector's Edition as well.
10844107	10846169	It will feature a full...
10847955	10849257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10866727	10871389	And then lastly, something that kind of pissed people off, we were talking about Activision raising prices.
10871769	10880052	Well, apparently, and once again, this goes to show you that CEOs should never speak ever when it comes to video games.
10880452	10887814	Apparently, CEO Bobby Kotick says that he hopes that the price of games will actually go higher.
10888455	10888715	It says...
10889955	10894259	And Tony, you know, if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further.
10894899	10896941	Yes, thank you, Mr. Douchebag.
10898102	10901004	And then two last things here.
10901044	10902726	Rise of Triad is coming to the iPhone.
10902826	10904467	Actually, can we back it up a little bit?
10904507	10908030	Because you getting into that reminded me we didn't do the FUs of the Week tonight.
10908210	10909351	We got to do that at some point.
10909451	10911213	So what was this dude's name?
10911633	10912274	Bobby Kotick.
10912414	10914916	Bobby Kotick, the FUs of the Week tonight are for you.
10930529	10931830	My F.U.
10931890	10933932	really just goes to the suture in my hand.
10934413	10935754	It pretty freaking hurts.
10936675	10938036	Yeah.
10938196	10938716	My F.U.
10938757	10939978	goes to being sore.
10940118	10943621	Like, I feel like I'm getting so old, but my legs are so sore.
10943641	10947184	I don't know if that's just from all the walking I did yesterday, which wasn't really that much.
10948145	10950487	I guess I should have stretched out before going to Tahoe.
10950847	10951108	Loki.
10951128	10951208	Loki.
10951798	10952679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10971755	10974856	Dying babies were her thing, as she puts it.
10975137	10990884	So she comes in, you know, basically when they're doing all the pictures and doing the, you know, the footprints and all the impressions and stuff, you know, the nurse beforehand, they're treating them, you know, even though the babies are dead, they're treating them, you know, with respect, like actual babies, you know, supporting their head and stuff like that.
10991704	10996005	Well, the woman decides she's gonna come in and she says, okay, we're gonna start taking pictures.
10996305	10997766	Oh, this is the fun part!
10998326	11001447	I'm sorry, what part of Dead Babies is fun to you?
11001707	11002127	Stupid.
11003148	11014291	And then she treats them like, you know, basically dolls, just flipping them over, totally ignoring the fact, you know, that their heads should be supported and all that stuff, because they can't feel pain anymore, she says.
11014971	11020753	So, thank you, Nurse Douchebag, for being totally insensitive and just
11021328	11023090	An absolute horrible human being.
11024411	11025332	But you know what, though?
11026974	11032219	You know, in the end, we do laugh about it because she's... It just... How do people like this actually exist?
11032259	11033941	They're so stupid.
11034702	11038166	See, only you and Nelly can find the humor in something like that, honestly.
11040310	11041931	Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
11042251	11043432	Sorry, last minute stories.
11043572	11050596	And the last one I have, and which you'll probably like, is Microsoft is saying they are going to raise the cap of your friends list.
11050796	11052597	I actually have a few open slots right now.
11052617	11062363	I think I'm down to like 98, and the reason why I... If somebody hasn't shown up on my friends list in like 30 days or more, I just delete them because I hear they cancelled their Xbox.
11062883	11064664	Unless it's somebody I know in real life.
11064864	11066726	Yes, that's what I've been doing too.
11067026	11068427	Yeah, that's pretty much how I do it.
11068667	11071670	So if you want to have me on Xbox Live, I have a couple open spots.
11071690	11076013	You're not going to see me on there very much except playing Lost Odyssey, but there's always something.
11076113	11079576	There'll be something I'm playing after I'm sick of the games I'm playing now.
11079656	11080477	It's not the way it works.
11082481	11082741	All right.
11084162	11086443	I guess that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11086483	11089685	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting independent podcasting.
11090045	11096929	You guys are awesome, especially downloading and listening to this entire show after a three-week hiatus if you got all the way to the end.
11097249	11097869	You rock.
11097909	11099650	Thank you so much for listening to us.
11100230	11101011	I don't know what else to say.
11101571	11107654	As always, we say tell two people you know about the show, but honestly, by listening to the whole thing, you've already made us feel good.
11109335	11111577	And live listeners, where would we be without you guys?
11111617	11112657	Thank you so much for showing up.
11113078	11117801	And especially the fact that we just said at noon today that we'd be back tonight because I just didn't know.
11117861	11119202	I didn't want to announce anything premature.
11119702	11124566	But the fact that so many people showed up, we actually had a really good listener count tonight.
11124686	11130190	And I don't know if that's thanks to the retweeting from all games that some of you guys did on your retweets and stuff.
11130230	11132631	But just thank you so much.
11133972	11134993	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11136346	11141231	My final thought is... Wow, this Sharpie really smells loud.
11141611	11143153	Are you finally sending Rob his TurboGrafx?
11143313	11143593	I am.
11143673	11144494	I just autographed it.
11145054	11145355	Awesome.
11145535	11147397	I'll sign it too.
11147477	11148918	Don't forget to get Loki to sign it too.
11149258	11150099	Loki, your final thought.
11150880	11155124	My final thought is... I don't know.
11155184	11155304	I've
11156118	11156819	DarkSakura.com
11174919	11175860	It was really good that she did it.
11175920	11176280	No, it is.
11176601	11179525	You'll just get a different Klanto.
11180986	11181547	We'll figure it out.
11181567	11183249	We're going to keep that YouTube channel alive this time.
11183950	11188436	My final thought is I have a TurboGrafx in my lap, and Rob, I kind of want to steal this.
11189017	11191540	So you may not be getting this after all, I'm sorry to say.
11192541	11195363	Anyhow, that's going to do it for this week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
11196103	11197224	You know, I pretty much said it all.
11197264	11197905	Thanks so much.
11198325	11200586	We'll be back here to do it all again next week.
11201047	11205530	So myself, Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki.
11206010	11206670	Thank you guys.
11206810	11208952	We will see you next week.
11210692	11211332	See you next week!
