00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
Tonight, August 30th, 2009, is yet another novelty controller on the way for the Wii.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.160
Could your local Walmart's arcade soon be expanding?

00:22.160 --> 00:29.760
And we talk about new details on the Rock Band Network.

00:29.760 --> 00:38.600
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:38.600 --> 00:39.600
Radio.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.840
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
lifestyle.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.080
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely co-hosts, Dark Sakura, Jamie

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Summers.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
Hi.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
And Techmaster Loki.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.080
Hello.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.720
How are you guys doing tonight?

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
Good.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
I'm full.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
Full of what?

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
Oh, crap.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
Haha.

01:01.720 --> 01:06.040
Leftover pasta from Olive Garden because right now the Never Ending Pasta Bowl is going on.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
Oh, damn.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
We need to go there.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.680
I had whole wheat linguine with Alfredo sauce.

01:10.680 --> 01:16.920
You know, apparently, we had some type of unannounced contest that was a win a night

01:16.920 --> 01:21.680
stay in the vault here at OLR Studios and Misty won it because she's actually on her

01:21.680 --> 01:24.080
way right now to hang out with us.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.600
She's not going to be on the show tonight because of the way the whole schedule works.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.520
She doesn't fly, so she took a bus.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.520
That's pretty brave.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.520
She's going to Reno tomorrow.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
Yeah.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
So that's pretty cool.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.440
But I guess she's going to be here and kind of staying in the vault, but I'm thinking

01:35.440 --> 01:39.560
Misty needs to be taken out for the full OLR Olive Garden experience.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.800
We might have to make that happen.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.820
How about, well, shoot, I'm trying to think because...

01:44.820 --> 01:45.820
How long is she here?

01:45.820 --> 01:46.820
Do we...

01:46.820 --> 01:47.820
I don't remember.

01:47.820 --> 01:48.820
I think she's going back Friday.

01:48.820 --> 01:49.820
Okay.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.240
But it would have to be like Thursday that we do this because Wednesday I have class

01:52.240 --> 01:53.240
until 10.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
Okay.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.240
That works.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
Yeah.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.460
That's why I've been enlisting aid to help keep her occupied while I'm in school and

01:59.460 --> 02:00.460
whatnot.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.840
And right now we have no idea what to do one of the days, but we'll work it out when she

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
gets here.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.080
Oh, I'll go ahead and say because it's a big deal for me.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.800
My wedding anniversary is on the second, not the second, Tuesday, I'm thinking Tuesday

02:12.800 --> 02:14.420
is second day.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.960
It's on Tuesday, the first.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.760
Dan and I will have been married for four years and the entire time I haven't killed

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
him.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
Congrats.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.760
Thanks.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
On both counts.

02:24.760 --> 02:32.040
We've been together for over 11 years, so yeah, I'm a married woman.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.600
You sound so excited about it.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.600
It's a little pasta, dude.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.120
I might have a little more.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.500
And Loki has a birthday coming up.

02:38.500 --> 02:42.360
You guys may not know, but Loki, Loki's birthday is the easiest to remember.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.200
You will never forget Loki's birthday.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.680
September 11th is Loki's birthday, so it's very easy to remember.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.760
So any plans for how to celebrate your birthday this year, Loki?

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
No.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
All right.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.080
Just a quiet home, a night at home with the wife?

02:58.080 --> 02:59.080
I don't know.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
At least go out to a nice dinner.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.840
You and the wife like Betty Hunter, right?

03:01.840 --> 03:05.760
Well, usually like the family will take me out and then her family will take me out and

03:05.760 --> 03:07.680
she'll take me out.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.640
So I get good dinners all weekend.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.560
Here, I have a present for you.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.600
It's a can of air missing the nozzle.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.400
I could use that because my other can of air is kind of out of air.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
Here, take it.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
Awesome.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
We're missing a nozzle.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.440
I can put the nozzle in there.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.000
You don't really need the nozzle actually.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Let's go to our chat room because our chat is always up and running.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
We love...

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Wait, wait, wait.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
What?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.680
Totally off topic, but since we were talking about food anyways.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.880
Yeah, sure.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.760
So the wife has been really looking...

03:37.760 --> 03:38.760
Sorry, chat room.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.920
You've been bumped in favor of food.

03:39.920 --> 03:45.200
This also ties in with possible birthday ideas.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.600
So my wife's been really interested in watching this new show that's on the Food Network called

03:49.600 --> 03:52.680
What Would Brian Boitano Make?

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
I kept hearing about it.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.840
I'm like, it's going to be very underwhelming.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.600
It can't possibly be...

03:59.600 --> 04:03.320
First off, there's no way that they're going to use the theme song from South Park.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
There's no way that's going to happen.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.080
And the show is probably just going to suck.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.680
So it came on today.

04:08.680 --> 04:13.360
Not only did they use the theme song from the South Park episode, which is fucking awesome

04:13.360 --> 04:19.200
already, but the episode was a bacon episode dedicated to all these different party foods

04:19.200 --> 04:20.280
using bacon.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.800
And it was just like sold.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.000
So that show is actually pretty funny, but he is very flamboyant.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.400
I'm serious.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.100
He's very flamboyant.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.200
But you can't go wrong with an episode dedicated to bacon.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.000
I mean, all sorts of awesome stuff.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.800
Bacon muffins.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.000
Bacon corn muffins would be really delicious.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.460
They are bacon corn muffins.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.460
That's what it was.

04:42.460 --> 04:45.640
So I guess in honor of this, the chat rooms tonight will...

04:45.640 --> 04:48.740
Their chat rooms name tonight will be bacon.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.320
So we're going to go to bacon right now.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.320
I think we should name them Kevin.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
Why?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.320
Kevin Bacon.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.320
Your name is Kevin.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.320
Fine.

04:55.320 --> 05:01.640
We will go to Kevin at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and read some of the comments.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.160
Dark Tetsuya says, Orange Lounge Fudio only on allsnacksradio.com.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.920
There you go.

05:06.920 --> 05:11.000
Because obviously we broadcast live every week at six o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.040
nine o'clock Eastern at allgamesradio.com.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.840
But all snacks radio.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.720
If that isn't up and running, somebody should register that.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.960
Let's see what else Kevin has to say tonight.

05:20.960 --> 05:26.080
Black Wolf, our old buddy who tapes live before us, who's not going to be live next week because

05:26.080 --> 05:27.360
he's traveling to PAX.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.360
We're not.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
We'll get into that in a minute.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.960
Black Wolf in chat says, She sounds as excited about being married as I am to going to PAX.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.880
Because if you listen to Bobby's show this week, he's kind of like, yeah, yeah, you know,

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
PAX.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.580
No, I'm really excited about being married.

05:40.580 --> 05:49.400
But my excitement gets spread out over, you know, 365 slash 356 days, you know, a year.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.340
I'm really happy to it's, it's kind of hard.

05:53.340 --> 05:59.140
It would be like being excited about my finger.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.620
It's a, it's a part of me.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.260
It's a useful part of me.

06:02.260 --> 06:06.840
You know, guys, I woke up today and I still had all 10 fingers.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
I'm so excited.

06:07.840 --> 06:14.480
I love this finger, I love this finger, this finger loves you.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.120
Some days I wish we were a TV show because I'll just leave it to your imagination which

06:17.120 --> 06:18.360
finger I was holding up.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
All right.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.600
Hey Rob, I like these two fingers.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.760
Tiger Claw in Kevin says, Good thing Dan knows the date, Dan knows the date of the anniversary.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.120
If he didn't, there's no telling what Dark Sakura would do.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.640
There you go.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.880
All right.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.640
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks.

06:36.640 --> 06:41.760
Jack Defs follows up the Orange Lounge Foodie on AllSnacksRadio.com with the right after

06:41.760 --> 06:47.480
the Bobby hot dog show.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.000
I almost feel like there ought to be a parody website or something.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.240
All right, forget it.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.480
Let's go and talk about your gaming week or I guess your food week if you want.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.500
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

06:56.500 --> 07:04.220
I actually really didn't play that much this week because my, the skin on my hand is kind

07:04.220 --> 07:09.640
of getting really sore in that stage of healing where it gets really sore.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.760
So I haven't done a lot of gaming except for playing some, a little bit of RO, a little

07:14.760 --> 07:23.280
bit of Sims, lots of that MMO on Gaia just, you know, because I was sitting here.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.160
But I went to, I started school, it's my first week of school.

07:27.160 --> 07:33.280
So really, oh yeah, I played a lot of Peggle, played a lot of Peggle before class.

07:33.280 --> 07:40.360
But my gaming weeks in the future are going to be rather dull coming up because the two

07:40.360 --> 07:43.600
classes I'm taking are going to be a lot of work and I go back to work in two weeks.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.760
So I'm trying to get ahead of my schoolwork.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.800
I'm being responsible.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.040
Busy, but no Sims 3 even?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.800
Oh, I need to boot that up right now.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.320
She's not even playing during the show.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.320
I'm surprised.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
She's breaking her street chair.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
It's customary.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.560
You know, it was like, what was it?

07:59.560 --> 08:02.600
Whenever Harry Potter book would come out, I would ignore the show in favor of reading

08:02.600 --> 08:04.400
the Harry Potter book.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
You know this.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
Yeah, I remember.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.680
I've never ignored the show to play games, I'll have you know.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.840
As you were playing Flash games during the show.

08:11.840 --> 08:16.000
I've seen he's been playing Flash games or hacking, downloading torrents while we're

08:16.000 --> 08:17.720
trying to progress the show.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.760
I wasn't really ignoring the show, by the way.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.400
I was just caught up in my book.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.320
And I do not ignore the show to play Sims.

08:25.320 --> 08:29.320
I am multi-talented and can multitask like a mofo.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.320
Fine.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.320
Rob.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
What?

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
Low key.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.320
How was your gaming week?

08:34.320 --> 08:35.480
My gaming week was alright.

08:35.480 --> 08:40.600
I played Grand Theft Auto because I do that every day anyways.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.880
So that's a given.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.280
Nothing really interesting happened there.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.680
And played more Earth Defense Force because I'm slowly getting back into that because

08:48.680 --> 08:51.420
I'm determined to finish the damn game.

08:51.420 --> 08:56.320
It's been like 80 hours already and it's so damn hard.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.940
But I'm going to finish it.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.640
And so I'm going to play more of that.

09:00.640 --> 09:06.640
And then I decided to once again try to broaden my horizon of video games I've been playing

09:06.640 --> 09:12.420
by testing out more indie games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Service.

09:12.420 --> 09:17.960
So I tried this week some Japanese game, which I don't even know what the name is because

09:17.960 --> 09:21.680
it was all in Katakana and I can't read Katakana.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.600
But apparently it's a ripoff of Zelda.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.200
Like extremely a ripoff of Zelda.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.380
It was fun.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.000
But the music was kind of blaring.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.520
I could not get it to sound right on my headphones that I had.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.840
And the trial was all in Japanese so I couldn't really figure out what I'm supposed to be

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
doing.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
But I don't know.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.120
It's a basic ripoff of Zelda.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.260
It looks like they made Zelda kind of flash looking.

09:44.260 --> 09:47.280
Don't the games have to go through some type of check where they make sure they're not

09:47.280 --> 09:49.080
ripping something else off?

09:49.080 --> 09:52.280
There were TurboGrafx games that were almost complete Zelda ripoffs.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.080
The Newtopia series.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.680
It's different enough to where it's not Zelda.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.160
But it's Zelda, okay?

09:58.160 --> 10:00.200
It's seriously a top-down Zelda game.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.200
Which is alright.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.200
And then she's got a point though.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.800
If you've ever played Newtopia, it's a lot like Zelda II and there were a lot of games

10:04.800 --> 10:06.840
in that era that were kind of like that.

10:06.840 --> 10:11.480
And then speaking of ripoffs of games, there was a Mario Kart ripoff on there as well called

10:11.480 --> 10:13.760
Wacky Karts that I tried playing.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.360
And it was less wacky, more bland.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.240
So I played that for a little bit and it was alright I guess.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.200
But the one game I did play a demo of that was really awesome and will be coming out

10:26.200 --> 10:29.080
in a few weeks here is Wet.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.160
That game is like kill build the game.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.320
It's basically very much a grindhouse feel to it.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.620
Lots of punk music in there.

10:37.620 --> 10:38.620
Lots of killing.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.680
It's like the way Stranglehold should have been.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.280
Lots of flying through the air, shooting stuff.

10:45.280 --> 10:52.080
There's one scene that you play in the demo where you're on cars on a freeway with traffic

10:52.080 --> 10:53.560
and everything.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.600
And there's just cars flying through the air and you're jumping from car to car and shooting

10:57.600 --> 10:59.920
people in slow motion.

10:59.920 --> 11:00.920
It's awesome.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.240
It's a real fun action-packed game.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.280
One that kind of wasn't really on my radar.

11:07.280 --> 11:12.000
I liked the poster for it, but now I'm actually thinking about picking it up because it was

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
pretty sweet.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.680
But yeah, definitely check out the demo.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.720
It's on live, so check it out.

11:16.720 --> 11:20.520
I think it might be on the Playstation 3 network yet.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.840
But it will be soon.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
And I think that's it.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.840
That's all I really played.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.920
I didn't play a lot of new games this week.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.360
I actually played Home.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.360
I know.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.360
Weird, right?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
I don't know why.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.920
I just kind of was just checking out what's new in Home.

11:35.920 --> 11:39.560
Actually, I know what possessed me to do it is that I was playing the Namco Arcade Collection

11:39.560 --> 11:40.680
again, trying to unlock some new stuff.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.320
Here's the really weird thing about the Namco Arcade Essentials on Playstation 3 is that

11:45.320 --> 11:50.800
if you want everything, you actually have to download and play the demo as well.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.140
Because the demo has completely different unlocks than the regular game.

11:54.140 --> 11:58.320
In fact, you unlock more Home stuff in the demo than you do the regular game, which is

11:58.320 --> 11:59.440
really weird.

11:59.440 --> 12:04.200
So if you download the demo, you can get like, I got a Dig Dug shirt that has a, what were

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
the fat guys called?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
The Pookas?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.600
I have a shirt that has a Pooka on it.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.360
And you can actually unlock the machines for your house, which I thought was kind of cool.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.920
So I have like a, I have a Dig Dug and a Pac-Man and a Galaga machine all in my house now.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.200
And you can obviously launch the games from Home.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.340
I think the game launching from Home right now is ridiculous though.

12:22.340 --> 12:27.420
It takes forever to get into the game, and even worse, to get out of the game.

12:27.420 --> 12:31.600
Takes forever, because once you come out of the game, then it has to reload Home, then

12:31.600 --> 12:34.800
it reconnects to the network, then it reloads the room you're in.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.000
I mean, it just, they need to find a way to make that faster, somehow using, like caching

12:39.000 --> 12:40.080
the data better.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.560
I don't know what they've got to do, but it's a little bit, you know, considering how much

12:43.560 --> 12:47.800
they talk about game launching from Home, this is really the first one I can think of

12:47.800 --> 12:51.520
that's really, well, I know they do it for Resident Evil 5, and I think there's another

12:51.520 --> 12:54.920
game in Home that they do it for too, but this is the first one that's really easy to

12:54.920 --> 12:56.880
test because you can do it with demos.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.080
And it just kind of stinks, I'm sorry.

12:59.080 --> 13:03.180
It's not that, you know, if this is supposed to compete with Xbox Live and launching games

13:03.180 --> 13:06.880
out of parties and stuff, no.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.560
It doesn't, it's very, very slow.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
You fail.

13:09.560 --> 13:15.040
But, I did have, you know, I finally decided to plop down the $5 and get an Orange Lounge

13:15.040 --> 13:16.040
Radio Clubhouse.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.120
I mean, what the hell, right?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.400
I was kind of curious.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.240
It's five bucks, whatever.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.120
I was pretty good with my money this week, so I figured, what the hell, I'll get one

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
of the Orange Lounge Radio Clubhouses.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.280
So, I've kind of been playing with that, and what is cool is that the Clubhouses are a

13:28.280 --> 13:33.400
new type of room that you don't see outside of a Clubhouse, so I did decorate it a little

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
bit.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.800
So, now I have to invite people to the Club.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.200
I put a call out on Twitter.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.360
I did see some responses, but I just haven't been back to home to invite people.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.000
And I don't think anybody gave me, when they said, oh, add me to the Club, they didn't

13:45.000 --> 13:47.280
give me their PlayStation names.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.320
So I'll put another tweet out when I'm home, either later tonight or tomorrow, and say,

13:51.320 --> 13:53.440
give me your names, and then you can come visit the OLR Club.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.520
I did do a little decorating.

13:54.520 --> 13:59.960
I actually plopped down some of the things that I got in the Namco games, like all the

13:59.960 --> 14:03.440
arcade machines are in our Club, and then I was putting messages on the bulletin board.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.540
I'm trying to make it not so plain, so that people will, like, actually want to visit

14:06.540 --> 14:07.540
it.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.840
And then, like, maybe during the show one night or something, we can have it up here

14:09.840 --> 14:11.600
in studio somehow and be kind of fun.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.520
You're being interior virtual decorator.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.320
Well, here's the thing, is that, you know, I think we here at Orange Launch Radio, you

14:17.320 --> 14:22.960
know, over the past seven years, we try to be on top of every new interactive technology.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.280
You know, one of our taglines we say here is where every gamer has a voice.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.740
So when Skype came out, we tried to get on Skype.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.480
When Twitter came out, we tried to get on Twitter.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.320
So you know, now that home's been out, you know, we're trying to just use that as well.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.160
It's just another way to interact with the show, so I figured, what the hell, it's only

14:38.160 --> 14:43.240
five bucks and the monthly fees aren't going to start until at least 2010, so we'll see.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.480
And home has been making improvements a little bit.

14:46.480 --> 14:51.680
It's still kind of, I don't know, but what I do like about it is that, you know, they

14:51.680 --> 14:53.560
are still adding a lot of stuff to explore.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.960
Like, if you haven't visited home in three months, seriously, if you go back now, you're

14:57.960 --> 15:01.520
going to be like, what the hell, there's like 60 different zones to visit now.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.440
I mean, there's a lot of stuff to check out.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.000
I just kind of wish they could make it a little faster.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.360
It does still feel a little clunky moving around home.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.480
That's the one problem I have with it still.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.180
Otherwise, I played the Arkham Asylum demo for a little bit, because obviously the internet's

15:16.180 --> 15:18.240
been all abuzz about Arkham Asylum.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.200
You know, it was a trending topic on Twitter this week.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.360
I haven't really heard a lot of bad things about it yet.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.480
I only played the demo.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.620
I don't want to review a game based off the demo.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.120
I liked what I saw so far.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.360
I haven't plopped down the money for the regular game, but maybe soon.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.040
Other than that, they didn't play a lot of new games.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.480
I'm still waiting for Ion this month.

15:34.480 --> 15:40.000
It's going to be a big game, and my Xbox 360 is still out of commission, but I got a really

15:40.000 --> 15:44.400
interesting email today that I need to follow up on, because apparently, OLR has listeners

15:44.400 --> 15:47.480
in all sorts of interesting places.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.480
That's what I found out today.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.480
Who knew?

15:49.480 --> 15:55.480
So, more on that next week, but hopefully I'll have an Xbox 360 back very soon.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.440
Going to chat rooms and comment.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.400
Going to the chat room for some comments.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.400
Let's see.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.560
Bochikawa in chat says, I checked out home when I got my PS3 and never went back.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.760
It's worth taking a peek.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.640
You know, again, if you haven't been there in months, you're going to find a lot of really

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
interesting stuff.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.760
Like, I think the Namco arcade is really cool looking too.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.600
They have a whole little zone for the Namco arcade, where they have all the different

16:17.600 --> 16:24.040
machines set up, and it kind of feels like an old 80s arcade, so it's kind of cute.

16:24.040 --> 16:28.760
I see Loki is pimping out his Loki arcade cabinet fund in chat.

16:28.760 --> 16:29.760
What is this all about, Loki?

16:29.760 --> 16:30.760
Tell us about it.

16:30.760 --> 16:36.760
It's just where people can donate money so I can finance the cabinet, because it's expensive.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
I see.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.760
So it's like, give me money.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.760
Yes, it's pretty much.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
PayPal me money.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.960
Alright, fair enough.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
Let's see.

16:43.960 --> 16:50.960
Also in chat, Ray Iannami says, I'm not sure if I want a PS3 Slim.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.920
I mean, $300 for a PS3?

16:52.920 --> 16:55.360
Hell yeah, but does it have enough good exclusives?

16:55.360 --> 16:59.720
Also, yeah, it has Blu-ray, but I see no point in it because I don't have an HDTV.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
Good point.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.320
I mean, if you don't have an HDTV, Blu-ray doesn't really give you a whole lot, but I

17:04.320 --> 17:08.560
would say plop down the $300 and get a decent HDTV.

17:08.560 --> 17:13.280
They're starting to come down in price, although be careful because a lot of these cheap HDTVs

17:13.280 --> 17:14.600
only are capable of 720p.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.600
You can actually get a good Blu-ray player now for about $100 instead then.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.680
Yeah, they're coming down, and I think especially in the holiday season this year, you're going

17:22.680 --> 17:27.560
to see these HDTVDs and Blu-ray players big time price reductions, so keep an eye out

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
for that.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.200
Just remember, the longer you wait, the cheaper they'll get.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
That's right.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.120
All right, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.800
Oh, there's one other thing I forgot to mention.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
Yeah, go ahead.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.840
It's not really anything I played, but I saw it on the indie games.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.800
Definitely check out all the Japanese named games because obviously they're from Japanese

17:47.800 --> 17:50.720
companies, but they had one on there that was a sequel to Dodgeball.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.760
Remember the old NES Dodgeball game?

17:52.760 --> 17:53.760
Yes.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.760
I saw one of those on the DS.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.120
We reviewed that as one of the Kunio games too.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
Yeah.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.880
I saw a copy of that on DS when I was at shopping this week.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.440
Yeah, they have something very similar to that on the indie games, and it was pretty

18:02.440 --> 18:03.440
cheap.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.640
Also, they have some good shmups on there.

18:07.640 --> 18:08.640
Just a bunch of stuff.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.200
Seriously, the indie games are worth checking out.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.360
I mean, there's new stuff coming on there every day, and the rating system works really

18:14.360 --> 18:16.960
well now, but I don't know.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.320
For some reason, I'm interested in the Japanese games because there's a lot of interesting

18:20.320 --> 18:21.800
stuff on there.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.960
All right.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.080
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we get into gaming news.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.880
Housekeeping, I actually do have something to pimp this week.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.640
Our friends at the podcast, The Ultimate Quest, located at ultimatequest.net, invited me on

18:34.640 --> 18:35.640
their show this week.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.920
They had a little bit of a roundtable talking about MMOs, so check it out.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.360
I think it's going to be episode 85.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.860
I might be wrong.

18:41.860 --> 18:43.720
Check that out, though, at ultimatequest.net.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.720
It was a roundtable.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.560
It wasn't just me, but somebody I run into at a lot of the industry shows I go to, Ninja

18:49.560 --> 18:55.000
Sista from Electric Sista Hood was on, and her co-host Panda was also on the show.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.680
I don't remember his online name, but I know his name was Wes, and he was from The Control

18:59.680 --> 19:01.880
Point, which is a Team Fortress 2 podcast.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.680
But it's part of a larger network that unfortunately I forgot the name of, but I know they had

19:05.680 --> 19:08.900
a WoW podcast and stuff because he knew his stuff when it came to MMOs.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.960
So we were talking a little bit about MMOs, but it also got into other subjects.

19:11.960 --> 19:16.520
I know we were talking about actually Sony Home for a little bit and some of the other

19:16.520 --> 19:17.520
console-related things.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.120
And of course, it's all hosted by Xenocore, who calls into this show once in a while.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.140
So check that out.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.560
That'll be out this week at some point.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.920
It's not there right now, but I'm sure it'll be out during the week.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.980
Also, of course, we always want to pimp the ways you can follow us online.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.560
We have our Twitter at OLR.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.720
We have our Facebook at OLRME.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.720
Just search for that.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.480
And of course, our Facebook at username OrangeLounge.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.760
And we do have a MySpace we check like once a month.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.160
So be on the lookout for that.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
Okay, let's get into-

19:42.160 --> 19:43.380
Oh, I forgot about MySpace.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.380
That's right.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.380
Most people did.

19:45.380 --> 19:50.520
All right, let's get into tonight's gaming news and some discussion tonight on what happened

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
this week.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
Loki, start us off tonight.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.320
Yeah, there was a few things happening this week.

19:55.320 --> 20:01.880
Not a lot of stuff we didn't know was coming, but we pretended to be shocked.

20:01.880 --> 20:06.440
But yes, Microsoft finally confirmed that the Xbox 360 was dropping in price, at least

20:06.440 --> 20:12.040
the Elite system and the Pro system while they last.

20:12.040 --> 20:17.600
And of course, this is the kind of bring it down to two skews now, just the Arcade and

20:17.600 --> 20:19.160
the Elite system.

20:19.160 --> 20:24.640
The Elite will be dropping down to $299 and of course, the Arcade is still going to be

20:24.640 --> 20:29.840
at $199 and the Pro to kind of clear it out, drop down to $249.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.720
But once they're gone, they're gone.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.740
So I don't know.

20:35.740 --> 20:41.280
It's always good to drop the prices of those and the Elite's not a bad system, but I guess

20:41.280 --> 20:46.520
if you don't want a black system, then-

20:46.520 --> 20:50.960
There's a slight bit of deception in this price drop though, is that they removed the

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
cables.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.280
The HDMI cable I think used to come with the Elite and I think it came with a component

20:57.280 --> 20:58.280
too.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
I could be wrong.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.080
But those component cables, dude, those are proprietary by Microsoft.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.680
You can get an HDMI cable cheap, but if your TV only has one HDMI port currently occupied

21:07.680 --> 21:12.440
by your PS3 like mine does or what have you and you want to hook up through component

21:12.440 --> 21:16.720
cables, those component cables are like $40 and they took those out.

21:16.720 --> 21:21.680
So they may have dropped the price by $100, but they also dropped the value by $40.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.000
But their excuse is that they're offering the same thing that Sony is and Sony in all

21:26.000 --> 21:30.520
their skews, no matter what, it's always been just the standard AV cables.

21:30.520 --> 21:35.320
And I suppose that's fair, but I mean, we do need to look at both sides of it.

21:35.320 --> 21:41.440
Is that, yeah, the Xbox 360 is dropping in price, but it's not quite what it was.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.080
I think they're both guilty of it.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.080
Look at Sony.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.080
Oh, they dropped the system price.

21:45.080 --> 21:49.000
Oh, but they removed backwards compatibility or, oh, we dropped the system price and now

21:49.000 --> 21:53.440
we removed some USB ports or we removed, you know, this or that.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
I don't know.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.600
It's, they're all guilty of it.

21:56.600 --> 22:03.720
And yeah, you can probably find cheap third party cables for a lot less than, you know,

22:03.720 --> 22:04.720
the 50 bucks.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.960
Maybe for PlayStation 3, but I don't know about Xbox 360.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.960
No, they've got them.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.960
They've got like universal cables.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.680
I thought they were proprietary on that.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.680
No.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.680
No?

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
No.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.880
The HDMI stuff, you can use just a straight HDMI cable, but if you want your audio to

22:17.880 --> 22:25.400
go out not over the HDMI and you want it to go out either optical or just stereo RCA,

22:25.400 --> 22:29.080
you've got to have their proprietary, you know, cable.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.240
Technically you have to have their proprietary cable just because if you were to plug in

22:34.240 --> 22:39.240
like another AV cable or whatever, it happens to block the, you know, HDMI port or something

22:39.240 --> 22:40.240
like that.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.420
They're a little fat.

22:42.420 --> 22:47.680
But yeah, I mean, if you're fine with it just going over HDMI, then you just buy an HDMI

22:47.680 --> 22:51.240
cable for a few bucks and you're good to go.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.840
But I don't know.

22:52.840 --> 22:57.840
It's interesting and, you know, definitely price drops can't hurt, especially coming

22:57.840 --> 22:59.560
to like the holiday and everything.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.880
Why do you think they waited so long to announce this price drop officially?

23:02.880 --> 23:06.720
I mean, we kind of knew this was coming for two weeks based on all the rumors and leaked

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
marketing.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.420
Is it timed to compete directly with the PS3 Slim?

23:11.420 --> 23:16.080
Probably to take some like, you know, thunder out of their announcement.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.400
You know, it's like, oh, the PlayStation's $299.

23:18.400 --> 23:23.640
Well, the Xbox has been $299 and now the better one's $299.

23:23.640 --> 23:29.520
So you can basically, you know, buy either system with very similar specs and now it's

23:29.520 --> 23:31.360
just the games that kind of decide it.

23:31.360 --> 23:37.000
And really with the games, you know, the 360 has a larger catalog anyways.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.680
And a Tigerclaw is linking us in chat to an Xbox 360 component cable for $6.75.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.760
So okay, I guess I'm wrong.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.760
I always thought you had to use the official cables when it came to the 360, but whatever.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.120
All right.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.000
Also kind of one thing I want to ask though, is the PS3 commercial, have you seen the new

23:53.000 --> 23:54.240
Slim TV commercial?

23:54.240 --> 23:55.240
Yeah.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.760
It's kind of like, it does everything.

23:56.760 --> 24:01.600
The guy that was in it, there was the one that was about the price drop or whatever.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.360
That guy, I recognize him from another commercial, but I can't think of what it was.

24:06.360 --> 24:10.120
But he's been like some other funny commercials like that, but that was pretty little tongue

24:10.120 --> 24:11.120
in cheek there.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.160
He looks like one of those dudes that would be in like a movie with Seth Rogen.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.200
That's kind of what it looked like to me.

24:18.200 --> 24:23.400
But yeah, just, you know, I like how they're like saying, you know, I heard a rumor that

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
it's going to drop the $299.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.440
What do you have to say about this?

24:26.440 --> 24:27.920
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:27.920 --> 24:32.560
Yeah, it was kind of funny the way they kind of did that with the, because this is that,

24:32.560 --> 24:36.400
you know, obviously the Slim rumor has been around forever and it only turned out to be

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
true.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.920
That's kind of, it was kind of a funny way they did it.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.720
Most console rumors end up turning out to be true.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.520
I'm sure we'll have more that go into that later.

24:44.520 --> 24:51.880
I like that Game Guru in chat says, PS3, it does everything except play PS2 games.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.400
But it plays PS1 games just fine.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.740
Does it print money?

24:54.740 --> 24:55.740
So I don't know.

24:55.740 --> 25:01.860
I have a real hard time buying the argument of, well, PS3s don't play PS2 games because

25:01.860 --> 25:04.400
you can just go get a PS2 to play them on.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.760
Well, then why do they play PS1 games?

25:07.760 --> 25:12.360
Because they sell PS1 games over their marketing service right now.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.880
And how long before they start selling the PS2 games over their service?

25:14.880 --> 25:17.680
Until they figure out a way to emulate it, it might just be too much.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
They do.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.920
The ones in Europe, don't they use, wasn't there a SKU that used a software emulation

25:22.920 --> 25:24.400
because not every game was playable?

25:24.400 --> 25:27.520
No, that was like the middle of your solid 80 gig systems.

25:27.520 --> 25:32.760
It was only a limited amount that were playable, but it had one of the two chips that were

25:32.760 --> 25:33.760
in there.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.280
It just emulated the other chip.

25:35.280 --> 25:39.540
So it can't do full emulation, but if they decided, hey, we're going to bring back that

25:39.540 --> 25:41.960
one chip again, then yeah, you could do it.

25:41.960 --> 25:46.080
But they're not going to because that cuts down the cost of their system.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.560
All right.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.840
Well, let's move on to talking about something with Xbox and, of course, one of the features

25:51.840 --> 25:57.080
that's coming to Xbox pretty soon, Twitter and, of course, Facebook.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.080
Also I guess it was a little like press release that came out about the price cut, and there

26:00.080 --> 26:03.640
was kind of a little footnote tucked away in it that mentioned that an Xbox Live Gold

26:03.640 --> 26:07.020
membership is going to be required for Twitter and Facebook.

26:07.020 --> 26:10.440
So apparently it is not going to be something that is going to be included as part of the

26:10.440 --> 26:12.440
basic silver package.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.440
But in an interview with Joystick, or I guess maybe a clarification to Joystick, that's

26:16.440 --> 26:20.360
with a Q, of course, the gaming blog, a Microsoft representative said to them that Facebook

26:20.360 --> 26:25.120
and Twitter on Xbox Live will be free to Gold members with a free trial period available

26:25.120 --> 26:26.840
for Silver members.

26:26.840 --> 26:32.400
Now, I'm not quite understanding what the point of Twitter and Facebook is on Xbox.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.200
I think I have to see it in action.

26:34.200 --> 26:39.080
But essentially if it's just me viewing Twitter updates on my Xbox 360, dude, that's just

26:39.080 --> 26:40.620
like using the web.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.280
And why do I need to pay for Gold to have that?

26:43.280 --> 26:44.280
It's a little silly.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.280
Same reason we have it on our phones.

26:45.280 --> 26:50.120
I mean, I think though if you've already got Gold access, it's really a moot point.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.960
But it's not something I would want to use on my Xbox.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.760
I mean, that's why I have my phone.

26:54.760 --> 26:55.760
That's why I have my computer.

26:55.760 --> 27:01.400
I mean, this just seems like more ammunition for the Sony fanboys about Twitter and Facebook,

27:01.400 --> 27:05.920
at least with Facebook, is that you can upload, well, starting soon with games supporting

27:05.920 --> 27:09.880
it, you can upload like screen caps of you, you know, beating certain levels or getting

27:09.880 --> 27:11.280
achievements or something like that.

27:11.280 --> 27:15.440
So, you know, more crap to spam your Facebook with, basically.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.920
Isn't that kind of what the DSI does?

27:16.920 --> 27:20.560
You can upload the photos from your DSI, just like it kind of interacts like a mobile phone

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
does with Facebook.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
Yeah.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.960
But this is going to be a little bit more game related though.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.280
I don't know why I would care what other people are playing.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.920
Like I, like even those, uh, what is it that you see on the Raptor?

27:32.920 --> 27:33.920
I hate those.

27:33.920 --> 27:38.720
Like, I really could care less what you're playing unless, you know, I'm actually playing

27:38.720 --> 27:42.800
it too or it's a game I'm interested in, but I really don't want to know what your achievements

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
are.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
That really is meaningless to me.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.520
Those, that has to be enabled by the user because I have a Raptor account, but it doesn't

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
publish my Twitter.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.220
I just don't give it my Twitter password.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.280
Everyone with Raptor.

27:52.280 --> 27:59.600
I don't care, but yeah, I, I don't really, I mean, I guess some people are interested

27:59.600 --> 28:03.360
or some people think what they're playing is so important that they have to show everybody

28:03.360 --> 28:05.080
every little thing that they've done.

28:05.080 --> 28:10.280
Like if I saw something funny happen in a game, then I might put a picture up.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.120
Like when would I put those blue dragon pictures up?

28:12.120 --> 28:16.840
Like two months ago when I was up all night bored.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
Yeah.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
That's, that's one thing.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.520
It's with people who are like, oh, I played this.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.240
Oh, I'm uploading every day, every day, every day.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
Um, who cares?

28:23.240 --> 28:28.560
Um, associate 100 Matt in chat says, uh, I, I'm just really worried that we are going

28:28.560 --> 28:32.920
to get nothing but spam tweets and Facebook status of what people are playing is so then

28:32.920 --> 28:34.200
that will be suck.

28:34.200 --> 28:39.160
And you know, I kind of agree because Twitter is already kind of ruined for me as it is

28:39.160 --> 28:41.240
like I don't really like to check Twitter.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.560
It's too much.

28:42.560 --> 28:49.600
I can't like, I don't know, I try to use tweet decks so that there's filters, but even then

28:49.600 --> 28:54.040
it will only go so far back and if I'm only able to check Twitter once a day, I feel like

28:54.040 --> 28:55.960
I kind of lose what everybody's up to.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.880
Like I just, I'm really starting to just not like Twitter.

28:58.880 --> 29:03.400
Like I just think it got too big too fast and I don't think they have the system.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.040
I think it's going, it's Friendster.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.280
It's going to go the way of Friendster where it just starts crapping out too much.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
Yeah.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.400
But do you remember Friendster?

29:10.400 --> 29:14.420
It was supposed to be Facebook and Myspace, but it started crashing every day and it was

29:14.420 --> 29:15.700
down for weeks at a time.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.460
So everybody abandoned it for Myspace.

29:17.460 --> 29:22.640
I think I looked at it and when it was kind of, I like Facebook really.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.640
I do like Facebook.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.640
It's easier to ignore shit on Facebook.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.640
Yeah.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.640
One thing I love about Facebook is that if there is an app that's publishing things that

29:28.640 --> 29:31.360
you don't want to see, ignore and you never see it again.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.400
It's great.

29:33.400 --> 29:38.080
I just hope with the 360 and the Wii, if it does start publishing those types of updates,

29:38.080 --> 29:42.120
you can block those as easily because unfortunately Facebook is turning into Twitter, but it's

29:42.120 --> 29:45.120
almost getting worse because of all these like quiz updates and things.

29:45.120 --> 29:50.120
You know, I may be just as guilty as the next guy, but I mean like if you don't check that

29:50.120 --> 29:56.960
stuff regularly and you have a lot of friends, you know, it's like rapid fire live journal

29:56.960 --> 29:59.000
is really what it is.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.960
Well, I was using Facebook for things, you know, like my, my, my family's on Facebook,

30:05.960 --> 30:11.520
so I actually more or less, it's how I, I put a little bit more important things there

30:11.520 --> 30:13.320
so I can keep in touch with my family.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.640
My Twitter is more like just how like it's more for networking now and a lot of the circles

30:18.640 --> 30:23.360
that I'm in, you know, for, uh, I use it as a communication tool for people who don't

30:23.360 --> 30:26.000
text, you know, because it comes to my phone.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I honestly, I only use Twitter for the networking aspect of it at this point.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.800
There's, I find that most of my personal status updates I'm putting on Facebook, you know.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.440
I'm using my live journal again.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Yeah.

30:37.440 --> 30:42.960
You know, I will, I think I can't get into the in depth thoughts on really, really deal

30:42.960 --> 30:47.160
with my day on Twitter and Facebook the way I can on live journal and I'm kind of sad

30:47.160 --> 30:51.440
to see lots of people abandoning live journal for, you know, Twitter and Facebook and all

30:51.440 --> 30:52.440
this stuff.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.280
I've got that permanent account and it was a gift and I'm going to damn well use it.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.280
Me too.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.400
I, and people warned me that live journal wouldn't be around forever, but at the same

30:59.400 --> 31:04.600
time I say, look, if it were not for live journal, the show probably would not exist.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.280
I think that's pretty much a given.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.320
Um, I would not have met some of the friends that I have in real life.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.080
My current roommate, some of one of my best friends and a couple of other of my best friends.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.600
Um, you know, I would never have met if it wasn't for live journal.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.120
I mean that website has had a profound impact on my life.

31:20.120 --> 31:24.480
I would be a different individual and call me a nerd, call me a dork, whatever you want

31:24.480 --> 31:26.940
to call me for saying that about a website.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
Fuck you.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.480
Um, but it's true.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.480
I would not be the same person if it was not for this website.

31:33.480 --> 31:38.640
And so it's just really sad to see it being abandoned, you know, and in favor of all this

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
other junk.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.160
The other thing I like live journal about though is that it actually is a good chance

31:42.160 --> 31:47.620
for me to look back a few years and see where I was, you know, it's a really good tool for

31:47.620 --> 31:54.760
personal inventory, but yeah, I, everyone's going to go to the, to the biggest, baddest,

31:54.760 --> 31:58.400
newest thing, but I think that there's, I honestly still think that live journal is

31:58.400 --> 32:00.480
remaining a staple for a lot of people.

32:00.480 --> 32:08.120
I think, you know, Facebook has enough in terms of diverse things to do that it's going

32:08.120 --> 32:09.520
to have some staying power.

32:09.520 --> 32:14.760
Well, Facebook also has games, which I find interesting, you know, and in one topic, I

32:14.760 --> 32:17.600
think we got into it on Bobby show a little bit last week and I can't remember if we got

32:17.600 --> 32:22.440
into it on our own show, but I was talking about how Leo Facebook casual games are the

32:22.440 --> 32:25.800
future of casual gaming because they're casual MMOs.

32:25.800 --> 32:30.040
A lot of these that are coming up games like the mafia, the mobsters, the sorority life,

32:30.040 --> 32:35.480
the farm bill, the ones I hate, you know, I like my animal, my pet society, hate them

32:35.480 --> 32:36.480
as much as you want.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.640
I'm telling you tons of people are playing them.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.640
Oh no, I know.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.760
I have plenty of notifications about it that I've had to ignore.

32:43.760 --> 32:48.520
I was playing those games myself, but I finally stopped playing the one cause it was something

32:48.520 --> 32:49.920
my ex got me into.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.920
So I stopped playing it cause you know, I didn't want to play it anymore.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.640
But you know, there's, you know, there's a lot of people playing those games.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.640
Yeah.

32:57.640 --> 33:02.200
I'd, I'd play that and it'd be interesting if those could somehow come to Xbox 360, but

33:02.200 --> 33:05.200
obviously I don't think that's possible, obviously.

33:05.200 --> 33:09.400
Maybe that's part of the deal actually getting the Facebook on is you get the apps with it.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.400
Hmm.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
Okay.

33:11.400 --> 33:15.680
Rama in chat says, yeah, but Rob, that's not the big reason why people are leaving LJ.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.160
People don't like the new draconian rules and regulations brought in, thus the Exodus.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.640
The rules on live journal have never once affected me.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.640
Same here.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.400
I'm blogging about my life.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.840
You know, that has never been something impacted by the live journal rules.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.560
I think sometimes I think especially live journalers more than, and boy am I getting

33:34.560 --> 33:36.680
off the subject, but I don't care tonight.

33:36.680 --> 33:43.000
Um, I think live journals, uh, almost more than anyone want to start drama over everything.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.960
And sometimes they're making a big fuss about nothing.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.680
Like I think, do you remember when they banned all those accounts because they were getting

33:49.680 --> 33:54.800
into suggested pedophilia and all this stuff?

33:54.800 --> 33:55.800
Do you remember that?

33:55.800 --> 34:00.120
And there was this big stink about it and how it was like freedom of speech being stopped

34:00.120 --> 34:01.120
and all this.

34:01.120 --> 34:05.840
And I'm kind of like, there's so many people making a big deal over this that I really

34:05.840 --> 34:10.440
don't think we're honestly impacted in one way or another.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.840
It was a bit ridiculous anyway.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.880
And plus I think live journal does have a certain responsibility to stop a lot of that

34:17.880 --> 34:19.100
crap from happening.

34:19.100 --> 34:23.780
I think that some of it they did take out of context, which is really the big thing

34:23.780 --> 34:27.000
that you run into anytime you bring in a corporate entity.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.600
Um, and a lot of people will just look for reasons to be offended.

34:31.600 --> 34:40.280
I mean, you know how I feel about that, but I think that because they do have a legal

34:40.280 --> 34:43.240
responsibility to protect, yes.

34:43.240 --> 34:46.440
You know, I think that they were justified in their actions.

34:46.440 --> 34:50.460
I don't, they just needed to learn the difference between a Harry Potter fan fic and you know,

34:50.460 --> 34:53.840
what was legitimately, you know, yeah, bad naughty stuff.

34:53.840 --> 35:01.020
I think that it would have been better if they had taken more time or had better filtering

35:01.020 --> 35:02.020
in place.

35:02.020 --> 35:10.280
And I do kind of like that now it's like if you're going, if you're not logged in and

35:10.280 --> 35:16.080
then, um, it'll ask you right up front, it'll have you, it won't let you look at certain

35:16.080 --> 35:20.920
things if you're underage, if it suspects you of being underage.

35:20.920 --> 35:25.400
And I didn't like how everybody was so quick to abandon live journal for other just clones,

35:25.400 --> 35:28.040
ripoffs of live journal, which you know, live journal was always open source.

35:28.040 --> 35:32.120
So it was very easy to make the ripoffs of because it was always about the community.

35:32.120 --> 35:36.080
And if the community branches off in all these directions, it's exactly what happened to

35:36.080 --> 35:37.900
my old wow guild.

35:37.900 --> 35:41.680
Everybody started abandoning it because everybody wanted to get something else out of the game.

35:41.680 --> 35:42.960
And some people went over here.

35:42.960 --> 35:46.800
Some people went over here, someone went over here and the game got ruined for everybody

35:46.800 --> 35:50.280
because the community was gone.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.760
Because I don't know, maybe I'm going to take some shit for this comment, but some people

35:53.760 --> 35:56.320
got a little selfish and it ruined the community.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.400
And I think in the sense, that's kind of what happened to live journalism sets.

35:59.400 --> 36:05.080
I think a lot of those people that abandoned it for other sites got selfish, but give me

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
shit for that comment.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.080
If you want.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.080
That's how I honestly feel.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.080
So too bad.

36:09.080 --> 36:15.000
Um, let's see, but, but every time I feel like live journals dying, I just load up,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.320
Oh no, they didn't.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.400
And then I'm always like, Oh, okay.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.880
There's still tons of people on live journal.

36:18.880 --> 36:26.040
We actually have a new member, by the way, to our cast who wants to comment on this.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.640
What in the hell is that?

36:27.640 --> 36:28.640
Tribble.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.120
His name is Angus.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.960
Since, since we don't have the ferret in this studio, I suppose Angus will have to do Angus

36:34.960 --> 36:35.960
the Tribble.

36:35.960 --> 36:36.960
Angus the Tribble.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.960
Nice.

36:37.960 --> 36:38.960
All right.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
Um, okay.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
Sorry.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.320
I, I got on a rant about social networking that I didn't mean to get into.

36:43.320 --> 36:47.720
Um, but yeah, Hey, uh, Facebook and Twitter only if you're on gold, otherwise you're

36:47.720 --> 36:49.840
going to get the trial period on silver.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.160
Um, I guess more to come about what these apps are really about, um, soon, but you know,

36:54.160 --> 36:59.360
I'm looking at a screenshot on Facebook or I'm sorry, Twitter, and it's pretty self-explanatory.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.960
You hit the X button to tweet what you're doing.

37:01.960 --> 37:05.040
Otherwise you see little clouds pop up on the screen with what all your friends are

37:05.040 --> 37:06.040
doing.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.400
It might be the kind of thing like you could run at a party, I guess.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.920
I wonder if the fail will make an appearance.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.160
I'll be interesting.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.160
Anyhow.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.160
Okay.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.160
Let's move on.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.160
One more gaming news.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.480
I know that I went on a huge tangent, but too bad.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.240
What we do is we're orange tangent radio.

37:23.240 --> 37:30.440
Um, at any rate though, in more X-Box news on, uh, the Amazon German site, there was

37:30.440 --> 37:37.440
a listing for 250 gigabyte X-Box 360 elite, um, that was promptly yanked right, right

37:37.440 --> 37:39.080
after it posts.

37:39.080 --> 37:50.160
Um, it was, uh, for, uh, 297, uh, Euro night, well, 297.99, um, and had two wireless controls.

37:50.160 --> 37:56.400
There's a copy of Forza Motorsport 3, which was, you know, it's coming out October.

37:56.400 --> 38:03.280
Um, and we, you know, we know about the price cut, so this could be, you know, something

38:03.280 --> 38:09.920
that they're gonna do to, uh, you know, produce more money to make, you know, put in a bit

38:09.920 --> 38:13.520
more profit, but there's no comment from Microsoft yet.

38:13.520 --> 38:19.160
Well, I think like most rumors, this one's gonna inevitably prove true as well.

38:19.160 --> 38:26.320
Yeah, it's kind of funny too, because in South Africa, apparently the website xboxgaming.co.za

38:26.320 --> 38:34.160
also had another elite, uh, console bundle with, um, also a, uh, what was it, uh, two

38:34.160 --> 38:39.080
wireless controllers and a 250 gigabyte, um, hard drive as well.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
Hmm.

38:40.080 --> 38:46.720
Well, I, you know, I think, um, these are probably inevitable for Christmas.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.720
I think, you know, these big bundles that come with lots of games and lots of storage,

38:50.720 --> 38:52.120
I think it's the Christmas.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.640
It's setting the stage for the holiday season.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.040
Sounds good to me.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.200
I think it's inevitable you're gonna see these larger drives come out, especially what's

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
funny.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.640
If those rumors about the PS3 slim with the 250 gigabytes are true, this is just right

39:03.640 --> 39:04.640
on par with that.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.640
Exactly.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.860
Everybody's, you know, aware of what everyone else is doing, and so why not?

39:08.860 --> 39:11.040
Just put out the terabyte hard drive and be done with it.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
Seriously.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.040
Those are down pretty cheap.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.040
I know.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.040
$100 for a terabyte drive.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.040
I know.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.040
It's crazy.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.360
You know, I was saying that, you know, I was, um, out at Fry's this weekend and I was actually

39:19.360 --> 39:23.480
saying that instead of just selling terabyte drives for $100, if you wanted to make tons

39:23.480 --> 39:28.720
of money, they should sell what's called terabyte full of porn, and just sell a terabyte, just

39:28.720 --> 39:35.640
sell one of those drives that's already preloaded with just porn, and sell it for like $150,

39:35.640 --> 39:39.280
and you would make just tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of money.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.280
What?

39:40.280 --> 39:43.600
Just like call it the, uh, the red light special or something?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.640
Just big brick of porn or something.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.640
Just sell like crazy.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.640
Big brick of porn.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
Yes.

39:49.640 --> 39:56.400
Um, something that's being offered, well, kind of on the down low, but Best Buy is apparently

39:56.400 --> 40:02.120
putting out a message to, um, their employees that says, um, you know, if you get anybody

40:02.120 --> 40:08.980
trying to return their recently purchased 80 gigabyte system, since, you know, the price

40:08.980 --> 40:12.080
just dropped and now you can get, you know, a system with a larger hard drive for the

40:12.080 --> 40:20.360
same price, um, you know, to discourage the return and instead offer a free game instead.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.200
So if you happen to have purchased a, you know, 80 gig system, you might as well try

40:24.200 --> 40:28.780
taking it back to Best Buy and see what they do, and they may give you a free copy of Infamous

40:28.780 --> 40:32.000
MLB 09 The Show or Killzone 2.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.480
How about a good game?

40:35.480 --> 40:37.520
Infamous is a good game, so is Killzone 2.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.800
Yeah, but they've been out for a little bit.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.800
Yeah.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.360
And they probably have a lot of people who already own all those games, you know?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.360
Well, you know what?

40:44.360 --> 40:48.720
They don't have a lot of games coming out that are made by Sony that are, you know,

40:48.720 --> 40:54.600
brand new, so this is gonna have to do for now, because there's no Uncharted 2 yet.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.880
Oh well.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.960
But um, yeah, it's kind of funny though.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.440
Why are they letting people get away with that?

41:00.440 --> 41:04.280
So people bring in their PS3s and say- Because they have like a 30 day return policy

41:04.280 --> 41:07.240
or whatever, and they can go- For any reason?

41:07.240 --> 41:08.680
Um, I guess, yeah.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.400
Well, then I guess it sucks to be them for putting up that reason in the first place.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
They should say so.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.880
They should have a clause in there.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.760
Well, it's because probably people are pissed off that they just bought a PS3.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.080
They knew that the price drop was coming.

41:20.080 --> 41:24.700
I mean, we kind of all knew that the price drop was coming, but essentially they may

41:24.700 --> 41:29.820
have known that the price drop was coming, and now that it has, you know, they just sold

41:29.820 --> 41:35.580
the console to a guy for $100 more, you know, for, you know, an 80 gig hard drive, and now

41:35.580 --> 41:40.080
he can buy, you know, the same console with the larger hard drive, it's slimmed down,

41:40.080 --> 41:41.960
brand new, for like a hundred bucks cheaper.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.640
Yeah, they'd be pretty pissed too.

41:43.640 --> 41:48.760
But at the same time, that's just the way the world works, so-

41:48.760 --> 41:49.760
Be mad at Sony.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.760
Yeah.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.760
I guess.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.720
I don't know, or be mad at yourself for not paying more attention to what's going on because

41:53.720 --> 41:55.280
we all knew this was coming for months.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.080
I don't know.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.720
Be an informed buyer.

41:58.720 --> 42:03.400
Well, anyhow, let's talk about the Wii a little bit, because we've been talking a lot about

42:03.400 --> 42:05.000
the 360 and the PS3 tonight.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.300
And one thing we talked about a lot last week were some of these new peripherals that are

42:08.300 --> 42:09.600
rumored for the Wii.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.640
And I'm getting to the point where, before I tell you what this is, this new peripheral

42:13.640 --> 42:16.400
this week, if you haven't already read about it, I'm getting to the point where I'm wondering

42:16.400 --> 42:17.760
if some of these aren't fake.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.380
That Nintendo does have a new peripheral on the way, but they're patenting all this other

42:21.380 --> 42:28.000
shit to throw us off, because now apparently a football controller has been patented.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.760
That's right, it's a little football where apparently there's a strap, I guess, on one

42:31.760 --> 42:35.560
side where you can actually put your hand, and then you, I guess, like imagine holding

42:35.560 --> 42:36.560
a football.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.640
You kind of put your hand through the strap, and then on the top would be where the Wiimote

42:39.640 --> 42:40.640
rests.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.200
I guess you'd still be able to hit some of the buttons.

42:42.200 --> 42:45.680
So you would be able to imagine yourself kind of throwing this football and then hitting

42:45.680 --> 42:48.680
maybe a button to release the ball or something as you're throwing it.

42:48.680 --> 42:52.640
That would be the type of controller, and apparently this was patented with the motion

42:52.640 --> 42:55.440
and plus as a part of the football, by the way.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.240
How many broken TVs are we going to see?

42:58.240 --> 43:01.080
That's what I'd be worried about, but apparently there's a big old strap on this football that

43:01.080 --> 43:02.080
you put your hand through.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.480
I think it's supposed to prevent that, but you know some dumb kid's going to throw this

43:05.480 --> 43:09.960
through a TV, but I'm sure they'll have all the safety warnings and all that stuff.

43:09.960 --> 43:16.600
It's just, these are dumb, and you know, it's sad, is that the next real idea they come

43:16.600 --> 43:19.560
out with is going to be very dumb as well.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.520
I mean, come on, the Wii Vitality Sensor.

43:22.520 --> 43:27.480
Well, I just want to also say about this football real quick is that it's also supposed to be

43:27.480 --> 43:28.980
able to interpret running.

43:28.980 --> 43:32.800
I guess it's supposed to notice your body motion, and so you can actually detect running.

43:32.800 --> 43:38.800
So maybe this is for some type of full-blown Nintendo-based football game coming out in

43:38.800 --> 43:40.760
the near future, or next year's Madden.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
I don't know.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.960
That sounds lame, and you know why?

43:42.960 --> 43:45.940
Because why do I need to buy another peripheral to do something that I could probably do with

43:45.940 --> 43:49.160
the remote by itself anyways?

43:49.160 --> 43:52.480
Maybe to kind of match that feel of actually holding the football in your hand?

43:52.480 --> 43:56.720
Maybe they should try something else more innovative instead of having to create a new

43:56.720 --> 43:58.960
peripheral for every fucking game that comes out.

43:58.960 --> 44:03.480
You know, why don't you create some new peripherals that can be used for more stuff than just

44:03.480 --> 44:05.480
like, you know, the football controller.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.840
Well, I'm not going to be able to use that for anything else than the football game,

44:08.840 --> 44:11.680
and I'm guessing there's probably only going to be like one or two football games that

44:11.680 --> 44:12.680
support it.

44:12.680 --> 44:17.280
Well, America and Canada and all the other countries in the world where the Wii is out,

44:17.280 --> 44:21.240
if you want Nintendo to stop doing this, stop buying them.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.960
But look, whenever they release a new peripheral, they sell like crazy.

44:23.960 --> 44:24.960
Because people are dumb.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.760
It's like a balance board.

44:27.760 --> 44:31.720
You know, I'm sure Wii Sports Resort is doing very well too with the Emotion Plus.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.520
I mean, granted, now here's one interesting thing.

44:34.520 --> 44:38.320
I saw at Fry's this weekend, I was there just shopping.

44:38.320 --> 44:41.640
They had maraca shells for the Wii, because remember, you know, they had a samba de amigo

44:41.640 --> 44:42.640
game of the Wii.

44:42.640 --> 44:48.320
They had the maraca shells on clearance, 90 cents for a maraca shell for you.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.900
I'm totally getting one.

44:49.900 --> 44:50.900
Go out to the Fry's and Roseville.

44:50.900 --> 44:51.900
You know what I looked at?

44:51.900 --> 44:52.900
They had shelves and shelves of them.

44:52.900 --> 44:57.600
I went down there too and I saw the Rock Revolution bundles and I'm like, I gotta see how much

44:57.600 --> 44:58.600
they were.

44:58.600 --> 44:59.800
Well, it was 20 bucks on the PS3, right?

44:59.800 --> 45:02.880
But still 60 bucks on the Xbox 360, which I thought was weird.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.880
Yeah.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.360
20 bucks though for the full drum set.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.640
I'm like, nope, still not worth 90 cents.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.640
That's what I'll buy it for.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.200
I almost picked up the game, but I still have a broken Xbox 360.

45:13.200 --> 45:17.520
You know, it might actually be good to convert into like a Drummania controller or something

45:17.520 --> 45:18.520
like that.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
Maybe.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.440
When it's 90 cents.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.440
Comments from chat.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.440
chat.orangehonestradio.com.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.440
Excuse me.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.440
Kevin.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.840
Going to Kevin tonight for some comments.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.000
Bochikawa asks, Wii motion plus can sense running, can't it?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah, I would think so.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
I mean, isn't that a part of...

45:33.000 --> 45:35.200
The Wii remote can sense running.

45:35.200 --> 45:43.040
EA active has running in it and it says Wii Fit has it and you're running in place.

45:43.040 --> 45:47.180
Frisbee says Nintendo because we spread ourselves too thin.

45:47.180 --> 45:48.840
Kind of not a bad argument.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.840
I mean, isn't that kind of what the problem seems to be with Nintendo right now?

45:51.840 --> 45:53.960
It's just like, okay, remember the Wii Zapper?

45:53.960 --> 45:57.960
The shell that was supposed to revolutionize, you know, their gun games?

45:57.960 --> 45:58.960
That was crap.

45:58.960 --> 45:59.960
Okay?

45:59.960 --> 46:01.360
Seriously, you don't need it.

46:01.360 --> 46:05.100
In fact, games play better without it, if you ask me.

46:05.100 --> 46:09.420
But whatever, you know, they put it out and now there's all these copies and stuff that

46:09.420 --> 46:12.240
actually do a better job than they did.

46:12.240 --> 46:16.080
But people bought it because it had a free game with it, you know, Link's Crossbow Training,

46:16.080 --> 46:21.100
which I can say, honestly, I've only played once that one time that we did like, you know,

46:21.100 --> 46:26.960
the challenge and that was it and I haven't touched it since.

46:26.960 --> 46:27.960
And the Zapper shell?

46:27.960 --> 46:28.960
Awful.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.580
I'll take the perfect shot any day.

46:31.580 --> 46:36.240
Game Guru in Chat says, just watch, this will be included in Super Mario Football and it

46:36.240 --> 46:37.240
will sell millions.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
Sad but true.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.800
Yeah, that's what they do.

46:40.800 --> 46:45.400
Just slap Mario's face on it or, you know, some popular Nintendo character's face on

46:45.400 --> 46:49.380
it and make the graphics really cute and chibi and it will sell like crazy.

46:49.380 --> 46:52.800
And then they'll be on the news about how, hey, kids can play football but at home.

46:52.800 --> 46:56.400
Well, then I don't want to hear any fucking bitching then when they're complaining that

46:56.400 --> 47:00.480
they can't figure out why, you know, the hardcore gamer doesn't want anything to do with them

47:00.480 --> 47:02.160
next console cycle.

47:02.160 --> 47:05.160
Why do they not want to play our games, you know?

47:05.160 --> 47:08.680
It's not like we're focusing only on children's games like we did at the GameCube and then

47:08.680 --> 47:10.520
bitched about that too.

47:10.520 --> 47:14.320
I mean, I don't know, it's just...

47:14.320 --> 47:16.960
I don't think you need to do this stuff, just make better games.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.840
By the way, a comment in chat made me think to remind for our international listeners

47:20.840 --> 47:23.980
when we are talking about football, we're talking about American football, not football

47:23.980 --> 47:24.980
as the rest of the world knows it.

47:24.980 --> 47:25.980
As in crap.

47:25.980 --> 47:26.980
Yeah.

47:26.980 --> 47:30.680
Because that would make no sense to put your hand in a glove with the ball.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.840
It would make no sense to be...

47:31.840 --> 47:35.160
I would hope most people kind of figured that out.

47:35.160 --> 47:39.240
We try to be aware that we have a worldwide audience but at the end of the day, we do

47:39.240 --> 47:43.500
live in California and sometimes we forget some of these things that football is different

47:43.500 --> 47:44.580
other places.

47:44.580 --> 47:47.440
So there you go.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.440
ActDeftInChat says, Nintendo, play Mario's dick with new dick peripheral.

47:51.440 --> 47:53.340
But that's not family friendly, you see.

47:53.340 --> 47:54.340
That's why that wouldn't happen.

47:54.340 --> 47:56.440
That's not for the whole family.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.440
That's why the Wii...

47:57.440 --> 47:58.440
But it is fun for Mario.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.360
The Wii Vitality sensor for old people.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.360
That's what they're going to put on it.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.360
That's going to be the slogan.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.360
For old people.

48:04.360 --> 48:08.860
In the pack-in game, you're going to die soon.

48:08.860 --> 48:12.900
It'll be like that banner ad you always see on the internet, you know, click to find out

48:12.900 --> 48:16.600
when you will die and then you put your mouse over it, it says 666 and all this guy.

48:16.600 --> 48:17.600
Have you ever seen that ad?

48:17.600 --> 48:18.600
No.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.600
I saw it on Myspace once.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.600
It just cracked me up at how stupid it is.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.600
Oh, that's why I don't go to Myspace.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.100
Why would somebody click on that, really?

48:25.100 --> 48:27.680
Although they have some pretty creative banner ads out there.

48:27.680 --> 48:32.760
They'll always have like, you know, slap Susan Boyle, win a prize and it's a picture of Susan

48:32.760 --> 48:36.960
Boyle or whatever, just some celebrity and they have some interesting banner ads.

48:36.960 --> 48:41.540
Admit it, there's been one out there that you've kind of tinkered with and hovered your

48:41.540 --> 48:43.040
mouse around.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.840
Hover the mouse around, not clicked on.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
Not clicked on.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.600
They're like, I moved the mouse and I'm like, Hey, that did something.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
Oh, that's cool.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
Block.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
All right.

48:52.600 --> 48:57.120
I want to say once I saw one with OJ Simpson and as she moved the mouse, he was wielding

48:57.120 --> 49:03.260
a knife and it was so wrong, but really funny and I still remember it to this day, which

49:03.260 --> 49:04.840
I guess is what advertising is all about.

49:04.840 --> 49:08.640
Of course, I just don't remember what product it was for.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.640
Win a free Xbox.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.640
All right.

49:11.640 --> 49:12.640
Sham.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.640
Wow.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.640
All right.

49:14.640 --> 49:15.640
Let's move on.

49:15.640 --> 49:16.640
We got release dates coming up, but first another story.

49:16.640 --> 49:22.760
Well, um, there's actually something to be in next week's, um, Famitsu is a game called

49:22.760 --> 49:32.080
Okami Den, um, which, um, it actually was, uh, put out for the Japanese seven 11 website,

49:32.080 --> 49:39.040
but it is a Capcom trademark and, um, they, uh, mentioned it in 2chan.

49:39.040 --> 49:45.480
So, uh, now everyone's talking about it and the rumor is that it's, um, a sequel to Okami.

49:45.480 --> 49:54.360
Um, because, uh, what it's looking like is it could either be Okami Gaiden or Okami Densetsu,

49:54.360 --> 49:58.560
which would be either Okami side story or Okami legend.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.440
So who knows?

50:00.440 --> 50:02.920
Well, you know, I'm not surprised.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.000
Okami was a pretty critically praised game.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.480
I don't know how it did sales wise, but I think it did okay.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.480
Yeah.

50:08.480 --> 50:12.520
It certainly, certainly is, uh, as well as other games that get sequels made of them.

50:12.520 --> 50:16.280
But, but Capcom broke with, um, Clover Studios.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.280
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.000
They might get another developer to do it.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.480
If they still own the IP, they can get whoever they want to do it.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.200
I mean, that would be nothing new.

50:24.200 --> 50:28.720
You see series going from developer to developer all the time, like Silent Hill, what happened

50:28.720 --> 50:29.720
to Team Silent?

50:29.720 --> 50:30.720
You know, they didn't have them done.

50:30.720 --> 50:31.720
Which is unfortunate.

50:31.720 --> 50:35.520
They decided to send the franchise over here where it'd promptly get ruined.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.800
I didn't think Homecoming was as terrible as a lot of people made it out to be, but

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
it was different.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.720
It was definitely different from the old school Silent Hill games.

50:41.720 --> 50:45.200
So, um, alright, well let's move into some release dates.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.200
Loki.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
Yes.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.280
Well, next week actually got some pretty decent stuff coming out.

50:50.280 --> 50:56.360
Um, starting off with, of course, Guitar Hero 5, which will be coming out on the 1st.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.960
And that's going to be on, you know, PlayStation 2, PS3, Wii, and 360.

50:59.960 --> 51:03.720
Remember, if you buy your copy during the month of September, you will also get a free

51:03.720 --> 51:09.880
copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen if you remember to register it online by the end of October.

51:09.880 --> 51:15.440
Also coming out will be Command & Conquer Red Alert Commander's Challenge on the PlayStation

51:15.440 --> 51:18.440
Network and Xbox Live Arcade this week.

51:18.440 --> 51:22.960
Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and 360, although if I remember correctly

51:22.960 --> 51:24.640
I think that's actually the week after.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.400
I think that date's wrong.

51:26.400 --> 51:37.600
Section 8 on PC and Xbox 360 this week, Soulcalibur Broken Destiny on PSP, 7 Wonders 2 on DS,

51:37.600 --> 51:41.640
and Champions Online on PC.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.200
Also another Xbox, or actually I think this is on both Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation

51:47.200 --> 51:49.960
Network, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine.

51:49.960 --> 51:55.300
You can actually build up some of your players for the new NBA game.

51:55.300 --> 52:00.520
And Fate Unlimited Codes on PSP, which is a digital download only title.

52:00.520 --> 52:05.120
I think those are the big ones for this week.

52:05.120 --> 52:10.100
I do need to get my 360 fixed soon because I do want to pick up Guitar Hero 5, just because

52:10.100 --> 52:12.000
I like the song list in it.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
And you know, what the hell.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
I may not be the biggest Van Halen fan, but hey, free game, it's kind of hard to ignore,

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
right?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Yeah.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Oh, I forgot some other ones here.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.080
Warriors of Rochi 2 on PSP was coming out as well.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.380
That's it.

52:27.380 --> 52:28.380
What was that on PSP?

52:28.380 --> 52:29.760
Warriors of Rochi 2.

52:29.760 --> 52:30.760
It's like Dynasty Warriors.

52:30.760 --> 52:31.760
Okay.

52:31.760 --> 52:32.760
All right.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.440
Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.360
It's a little bit of a slower week in Japan.

52:36.360 --> 52:40.700
There's not a whole lot coming out, but we do have a game called 428 is coming out from

52:40.700 --> 52:42.800
Sega on the PS3 this week.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.620
There's nothing on the 360, believe it or not.

52:44.620 --> 52:47.680
But this game's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and it looks like it kind of mixes in some

52:47.680 --> 52:49.920
real life scenes here.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.080
It looks like some type of interactive drama.

52:52.080 --> 52:55.060
But all I know is that there's a giant furry cat as part of the game.

52:55.060 --> 52:57.380
It's like a little action adventure game.

52:57.380 --> 52:58.380
So it looks interesting.

52:58.380 --> 53:01.860
I don't know if this is based off a show or something, but it's an action adventure game

53:01.860 --> 53:04.180
coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3.

53:04.180 --> 53:08.760
Not on the 360 that I saw, but definitely looks kind of interesting.

53:08.760 --> 53:13.720
A game coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week, Sweet Honeycoming is the name of the

53:13.720 --> 53:14.720
game.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.800
That's C-O-M-I-N-G.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.940
And it looks kind of like a date sim game because there's all these girls and practically

53:19.940 --> 53:21.980
upskirt shots of some of them.

53:21.980 --> 53:24.040
Are you sure that's the correct spelling?

53:24.040 --> 53:26.940
I'm perfectly sure that is the correct spelling of the game.

53:26.940 --> 53:30.300
But it looks to be like another dating game on the PlayStation 2, so have fun with that

53:30.300 --> 53:31.480
if you want.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.820
And we have some other games coming out on the Nintendo DS.

53:33.820 --> 53:37.200
Love Plus comes out from Konami on the DS.

53:37.200 --> 53:41.020
I think this might be yet another type of dating sim game.

53:41.020 --> 53:42.620
I think it was another dating sim.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.020
But this one's from Konami, so it's kind of one of the bigger series out there.

53:45.020 --> 53:51.660
I believe I saw an article on this on Kotaku and they've actually made it more explicit,

53:51.660 --> 53:54.980
I think, than the PC version.

53:54.980 --> 53:55.980
I don't know.

53:55.980 --> 53:56.980
It was either more or less.

53:56.980 --> 54:00.100
I think it was more, though, because I was like, huh, that's interesting.

54:00.100 --> 54:08.580
And then on the Sony PSP this week, Samurai Duo 2 Portable is coming out this week, which

54:08.580 --> 54:11.940
looks to be a type of fighting game about samurais, but it's not Samurai Showdown, but

54:11.940 --> 54:12.940
kind of close.

54:12.940 --> 54:16.380
I think it's Warriors Orochi 2, maybe.

54:16.380 --> 54:17.380
There you go.

54:17.380 --> 54:18.500
There's your Japanese release dates for the week.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.620
How about a trip to the UK, Dark Sakura?

54:20.620 --> 54:26.160
Well, what we have coming up on the second is Defense Grid The Awakening, and then a

54:26.160 --> 54:27.460
bunch of stuff on the fourth.

54:27.460 --> 54:35.620
We have Champions Online, Cursed Mountain, Dissidia Final Fantasy, Guilty Gear 2 Overture,

54:35.620 --> 54:45.980
IL-2's Stramovik Birds of Prey, Metroid Prime Trilogy, The Humans, and Warriors Orochi 2

54:45.980 --> 54:49.380
on PSP.

54:49.380 --> 54:52.180
Are we kind of at a slow period right now, because now we're kind of past the summer

54:52.180 --> 54:56.340
season with all the kiddies getting back in school, you know, and then the holidays will

54:56.340 --> 54:58.380
be kind of the next big push getting into October?

54:58.380 --> 55:02.020
I mean, Guitar Hero 5 is certainly a big game, and certainly The Beatles this month, but

55:02.020 --> 55:04.260
outside of music games, no.

55:04.260 --> 55:06.140
It's actually going to pick up a lot next week.

55:06.140 --> 55:07.140
Really?

55:07.140 --> 55:08.140
Yeah.

55:08.140 --> 55:10.700
It's just going to keep going, because this year everybody's afraid of Modern Warfare

55:10.700 --> 55:11.700
2.

55:11.700 --> 55:12.700
Why?

55:12.700 --> 55:15.540
I don't know, but there's a lot of games that normally come out in November that are

55:15.540 --> 55:20.180
coming out early, like Smackdown vs. Raw 2010 is coming out at the end of October instead

55:20.180 --> 55:26.020
of middle of November, but a lot of things are actually crammed in there, so like, especially

55:26.020 --> 55:31.940
next week with, like, you know, on the week of the eighth there's Dirt 2, Mini Ninjas,

55:31.940 --> 55:36.100
that pinball game, some other stuff coming out as well, and there's new releases each

55:36.100 --> 55:38.380
week that are actually pretty decent.

55:38.380 --> 55:41.900
Fair enough.

55:41.900 --> 55:52.220
So some other stuff, a little bit of Rock Band information, including, you may remember

55:52.220 --> 55:57.180
we talked about the Rock Band Network, how you can, well, first off they're going to

55:57.180 --> 56:01.020
have, you know, some original content coming to there as well, but another update that's

56:01.020 --> 56:06.180
supposedly going to be coming soon, I guess this November, is they're going to allow demos

56:06.180 --> 56:11.380
of songs that are available on their actual store, which is pretty cool.

56:11.380 --> 56:18.980
You get 30 second playable samples that you can check out, and, I mean, that's pretty

56:18.980 --> 56:19.980
sweet.

56:19.980 --> 56:22.020
You know, you get to actually try them before you buy them.

56:22.020 --> 56:24.620
That's good, because considering most of the bands that are supposed to be on this service

56:24.620 --> 56:26.580
are bands I've never heard of, that's kind of needed.

56:26.580 --> 56:30.980
I take that back, it wasn't 30 seconds, it was a free demo, it's one minute or 35% of

56:30.980 --> 56:33.700
the song, whatever is shorter.

56:33.700 --> 56:39.460
So you basically get a third of the song, I mean, that's still pretty cool that at least

56:39.460 --> 56:41.780
you get to try them out before you buy them.

56:41.780 --> 56:44.380
Yeah, I think it's important to hear what you're buying, especially because you're taking

56:44.380 --> 56:46.620
a gamble on a lot of these songs, I think.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.620
Yeah, exactly.

56:47.620 --> 56:50.900
So, I mean, hey, that's good, I'm glad.

56:50.900 --> 56:56.680
Also the Rock Band Network store will be coming to the Playstation 3 as well, however not

56:56.680 --> 56:58.240
to the Wii.

56:58.240 --> 57:04.940
And as of right now, though, the development tools to put songs on the actual Rock Band

57:04.940 --> 57:09.340
Network are only available through the XNA program, but they are going to pick select

57:09.340 --> 57:15.020
songs from that Rock Band Network and actually put them on to the Playstation 3.

57:15.020 --> 57:20.740
So basically the Playstation 3 will kind of have the greatest hits of the Rock Band Network,

57:20.740 --> 57:23.940
whereas the 360 will still have the bulk of the songs.

57:23.940 --> 57:29.780
Well, I guess it's nice to get that better than nothing, I suppose.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.620
But who's to say what the best is?

57:31.620 --> 57:35.820
You're kind of relying on, or maybe the best sellers, I guess, because otherwise you're

57:35.820 --> 57:39.220
relying on someone's opinion, which could be dangerous, but I guess if it's best sellers

57:39.220 --> 57:43.700
that's a little more fair, or, you know, critically acclaimed or something, I don't know.

57:43.700 --> 57:48.940
Yeah, apparently what's involved with it is not every song on the Rock Band Network will

57:48.940 --> 57:51.700
be available for PlayStation 3 owners.

57:51.700 --> 57:56.860
The option to bring over a song to the PS3 version of the store will be offered at Harmonix's

57:56.860 --> 58:01.460
discretion, and even then it will be an opt-in.

58:01.460 --> 58:05.700
The artists have to do some paperwork to properly port their songs to the Playstation Network,

58:05.700 --> 58:08.140
a process that Harmonix believes no one will refuse.

58:08.140 --> 58:11.060
It's more revenue.

58:11.060 --> 58:14.820
I am so excited, by the way, about Rock Band Beatles, can I just say?

58:14.820 --> 58:15.820
I'm so looking forward to seeing them.

58:15.820 --> 58:16.820
So am I.

58:16.820 --> 58:17.820
Did you see the demo that they had at Fry's?

58:17.820 --> 58:18.820
No.

58:18.820 --> 58:19.820
Oh, yes.

58:19.820 --> 58:20.820
No, I didn't see the demo at Fry's.

58:20.820 --> 58:21.820
Did they really?

58:21.820 --> 58:22.820
I missed it.

58:22.820 --> 58:26.980
No, I saw some other demos, but not of Rock Band Beatles, I saw a Rock Band demo, but

58:26.980 --> 58:27.980
it wasn't the Beatles.

58:27.980 --> 58:28.980
There's some kids playing it.

58:28.980 --> 58:29.980
Huh.

58:29.980 --> 58:31.060
Yeah, they actually had Rock Band Beatles.

58:31.060 --> 58:33.860
I don't know why, I'm just like really excited about it, even though I'm not like a huge

58:33.860 --> 58:34.860
Beatles fan.

58:34.860 --> 58:38.620
Well, I mean, certainly I respect them, and they have a lot of great songs, I just, I

58:38.620 --> 58:41.020
wouldn't consider myself like a rabid Beatles fan, you know what I mean?

58:41.020 --> 58:42.020
Yeah.

58:42.020 --> 58:46.280
Like I just think this game is gonna be so cool, like I'm just, and, you know, what a

58:46.280 --> 58:53.740
tribute to what they're doing over there with this game, that it's making a whole new generation.

58:53.740 --> 58:57.300
I mean, obviously I'm a little older than most people that probably listen to this show,

58:57.300 --> 59:00.860
but I would say a lot of the, you know, college kids that listen to this show are probably

59:00.860 --> 59:02.460
excited about this too.

59:02.460 --> 59:05.800
What a testament to that, that, you know, Rock Band's making people excited about the

59:05.800 --> 59:07.340
frickin' Beatles all over again.

59:07.340 --> 59:09.340
I just think it's neat.

59:09.340 --> 59:10.340
I agree.

59:10.340 --> 59:11.340
So.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.180
I'm looking forward to it, you know, I'm gonna get it.

59:13.180 --> 59:14.280
Oh, yeah.

59:14.280 --> 59:18.960
We should rock, rock, have a rock star party one night and get our Beatles on, be fun.

59:18.960 --> 59:19.960
Hell yeah.

59:19.960 --> 59:24.680
Anyhow, hey, but if you don't wanna play music games, one thing you can do with your 360

59:24.680 --> 59:30.520
or PS3 or soon, the Nintendo Wii, is this new service called Play On.

59:30.520 --> 59:34.200
It's actually already on the 360 and the PS3, but apparently the service is about to be

59:34.200 --> 59:36.880
going into beta for the Wii.

59:36.880 --> 59:42.140
This service will actually stream both Netflix and Hulu to your Wii.

59:42.140 --> 59:48.440
It basically builds a bridge between your computer and your Nintendo Wii, but hey, it's

59:48.440 --> 59:53.320
a way to get these services on your television if all you have is a Wii.

59:53.320 --> 59:58.800
It is a 14-day free trial, but after that you have to pay $40 if you wanna keep the

59:58.800 --> 59:59.800
service.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.960
The MediaMall.com is where you can pick this up.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.440
I thought Diversity already did that for free.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.520
You know, at least, I'm not sure about the Netflix, but I know, I think you can stream

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.240
Hulu with Diversity.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.760
I had Diversity for a little while, but it was kinda hard to figure out.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.720
I use it all the time.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.960
We watched a RiffTrax movie on that the other day, Prisoner of Azkaban.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.080
But yeah, we use it for streaming movies and pornography all the time.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080
Mainly movies, but yeah.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.560
Maybe I need to get the newer version of that or something, but the PS3 streams stuff pretty

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.000
well, but it doesn't tap into Netflix and Hulu.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.360
That's what makes this other thing pretty cool.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.360
Diversity does.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.040
I think it will actually tap into, I think you can set different streams on YouTube.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.240
It has a bunch of old TV shows, like Star Trek and stuff on there that you can actually

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.240
tap into.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.040
G4, I think it does Hulu, and then some other stuff.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040
But it's free.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.600
I mean, so I would try the free solution first if that doesn't work out for you.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.080
Then maybe there's a paid program.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.680
Granted, I haven't looked at Diversity in a year and a half, so maybe that's why.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680
Yeah.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680
I love it.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680
It works pretty good.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680
Hmm.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.640
Well, I'd be definitely curious to check that out, but of course you can't get that on the

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640
Wii.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640
I think it does work on the Wii, actually.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.640
Really?

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.680
It's done through a web interface or something.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
I thought it did.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.640
I could be completely wrong, because I don't ever use it on the Wii.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.880
But the Wii can't do high def.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.440
Does it stream high def if it's available?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.920
Well, it can stream high def for, you know, standard definition.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.080
Have you been watching high def porn?

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.640
I tend not to download the high def stuff, because the file size is larger, and it takes

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640
a lot longer.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.440
So, no, but we have streamed high def movies over on it, and it works pretty well.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.240
Of course, you know, Wi-Fi probably wouldn't work well with high def, and definitely not

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240
on the Wii.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240
All right.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.640
Well, we're just about to the end of part A tonight of our show.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.720
There's plenty more of Orange Lawn's radio still to come, but of course we can't say

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.000
goodbye to part A tonight without the Classic Game of the Week.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's right.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.360
It's time for the Classic Game of the Week, the part of the show where our very own Dark

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.920
Sakura takes a trip to the vault and pulls out a video game that she thinks, you know

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.920
what?

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.920
You guys ought to be playing this game.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.200
Why are you not playing this?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.200
Probably because they can't.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.160
Yeah, usually you pick a lot of games on systems that are just kind of hard to find these days.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.640
I did get picked something kind of obscure this week.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640
That's all right.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640
Obscure is fine.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.480
Maybe next week you can pick something more mainstream, but that's okay.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.480
You pick whatever the hell you want, Dark Sakura.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480
Hell yeah.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.360
What is tonight's Classic Game of the Week?

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.800
Tonight's Classic Game is a little shooter called Robo-Elast.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:35.120
I don't know if anyone else knows this game, but it's, um, it was a Sega CD game and it's

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.560
actually, it really is a fun game.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:45.380
It was put out by Tengen in 1992 in Japan, 93 in America.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:57.600
So it's like feudal Japan having giant mecha is pretty much the story of the game.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.600
And one of the pilots is fighting against the other feudal lords.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:11.920
And you play someone named Kage who is one of Nobunaga's robot ninja army and you're

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:20.360
flying the Elast, which is a big robot with a gun who looks very much like samurai armor.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.480
So yeah, pretty kind of weird storyline, but it's pretty funny.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.280
Oh, in Japan, by the way, it was called Denin Elast.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.280
So it's one of those vertical shooters.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:38.080
You have enemies coming forward and behind you and to the side and you have a boss and

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.620
yeah, shooter.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.700
So you've got different kind of weapons.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.840
You have Raisenha, which is a lightning attack.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:57.440
You have Husha Shuriken, which is, um, like big stars, um, the Hiei Meppujin, which is

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.920
also called the flying shadow formation.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.900
So you can, uh, have options that fly up in front of you and the Bakuryu Hosenka, which

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.600
is a exploding flower.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.480
So it's like little bombs going out and it's pretty cool little game.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.200
I mean, there's not really much else to say.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.240
It's just a shooter, but it's fun.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240
Oh yeah.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.480
And by the way, it was developed by Compile.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.840
So it's in that family.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.840
Awesome.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.040
Pretty cool game, what do you think?

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.880
Um, yeah, it sounds kind of fun.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.560
I like looking at this, it looks like a fun little shooter.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.120
Um, it almost looks white screen to me.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.400
I don't know if that's just the way they capture it.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.200
No, I guess this is kind of a standard size, but kind of interesting because obviously

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.680
they didn't make games on widescreen back then, but you know, just however, they occasionally

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.220
did make some shooters where you could turn your TV sideways.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.360
That is so why would you do that?

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.000
Isn't that dangerous for your TV?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.120
How do you think about a shooters are built and that there's actually quite a number of

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:05.040
games that are made with the monitor being in a, uh, in the top of the cabinet and using

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040
a mirror.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:11.280
So the game will play reverse and you and the mirror will show it right side.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.520
I think I've seen one of those before.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:19.480
Yeah, but it's done a lot of times for purposes of, uh, getting the right kind of, uh, screen

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480
shape.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.600
Uh, as she went on her mat in chat says, uh, wait, are you saying feudal Japan didn't have

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
meccas?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:33.120
No, feudal Japan did not have meccas and frisbee giant enemy crabs or giant enemy crabs.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120
You know what?

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.320
In the movie I saw the head giant enemy crab set in Japan was that it's called the house

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.120
where evil dwells.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.880
This was a movie that I had been looking for since I saw it when I was like six or seven

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.700
and it's one of the early American movies that did Japanese style horror and they is

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.640
about these people that moved to Japan.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.240
One of them is a writer and he wants inspiration except they end up being possessed by ghosts

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.640
who lived in the house.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:04.440
But there's a scene where like a good daughter gets thrown out of the tree by a giant demon

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:12.000
crab and they make grunting noises at her.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.320
All righty, whatever you're into.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320
There you go.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.320
All right.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.880
Robo Alest is your classic video game of the week on the Sega CD.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880
And yes, you can get it in English.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880
It is available.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.940
So check that out if you're Sega CDR and you want to see feudal Japan with a giant enemy

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940
robots.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940
All right.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.880
That's going to do it for tonight's Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.320
We've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your phone calls, your Twitter topics and

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.080
rapid fire news, as well as we're going to be talking a little bit about Walmart and

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.720
the possibility about arcades in Walmart's future beyond just the couple of games you

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720
might see in the lobby.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.640
We're going to talk about all that when we come back for Part B. So stay tuned here on

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:58.440
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:04.120
Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, August the 30th of 2009,

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.720
where we of course tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio from six o'clock

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.720
Pacific Standard Time till, I don't know, around nine, whenever we feel like quitting.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.460
That's the great thing about being on a flexible station like All Games Radio.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.760
We don't have a set time limit when we have to finish, but poor Bobby, the show before

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.360
us, he has to finish by six o'clock because that's where we're usually on, but he's flexible

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360
too.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.080
Sadly, he won't be on next week because he's going to Penny Arcade Expo and hopefully will

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.800
be calling us next week from Penny Arcade Expo to give us the rundown.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.160
We are all too poor to go this year.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.720
Actually I'm saving up to go to PAX East.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.840
I don't know about my wonderful co-hosts, but I know that's my goal is to get to Boston

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840
next year.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840
So we'll see.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
I'm saving up for more pasta.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.840
All right.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.840
I'm not traveling.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840
Yeah.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Not a big traveler?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
No.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840
All right.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.580
Well, I will represent OLR if no one else wants to, but you guys can do a show without

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:52.580
me that week.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.580
That'd be tons of fun, won't it?

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.580
Sure.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580
All right.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.580
All right.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.680
Let's get back into some more gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.680
Actually, wait.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.680
I lied.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.680
We're going to start with Twitter topics.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.520
We're always going to start off part B with some Twitter topics.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.560
And actually got us a little theme song this week.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.560
That's right.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.720
A little smooth jazz for your Twitter topics.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.880
Starting off, reading some of the responses on Twitter at OLR and things you want us to

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.040
talk about tonight, Blade3 asks, laptop with fold-out panoramic screens.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040
Good for gamers.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040
Totally 3D.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
I haven't heard of this.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.680
You have a laptop now with fold-out monitors?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.480
Loki, have you heard of this?

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.760
Nope, but it sounds cool.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.800
It sounds cool, but isn't that like kind of expensive?

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.360
Kind of pointless?

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:44.840
It would be kind of ridiculous now, a PC with panoramic monitors I can get behind that.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.000
At Deft wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, that was a plug for our show.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.480
Thank you, At Deft.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.960
Surtur wants to know, OLR, is the PS3 Slim slower than the PS3 Classic?

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.400
From what I've been reading, there are certain aspects that are definitely slower.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.120
By the way, my Slim will be here Thursday, my first new console since the NES.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120
Game suggestions?

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.120
Depends what you like.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:15.760
I guess, well, if you're getting in in a week or so, Guitar Hero 5, if you like that kind

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.760
of thing.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.200
Otherwise, Madden if you like sports, I guess.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.200
Download Mega Man 9.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.080
If you haven't gamed since the NES, Mega Man 9 will be right up your alley.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
I don't know.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.800
That's a long time to go without, I promise you.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.840
Buy some used $20 games or something.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.720
It's like buying a Commando drop down price.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.840
Dan Shadow says, OLR, the indie game PB Winterbottom is finally coming to Xbox Live after a great

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.880
showing at E3 2008.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
This looks good.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880
I've never heard of this.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.720
PB Winterbottom, have you heard of this?

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.280
I think this is actually one of the games that 2K is actually publishing on Xbox Live

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280
Arcade.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.000
It's an independent game, but they're publishing two games that are going to be on Xbox Live

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Arcade.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.280
I haven't heard too much about it, but it looked neat.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.840
Let's see, Spazinator says, how about a discussion, sorry, Spazinator PSN says, how about a discussion

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.760
about upcoming known features for the 360 and PS3 tonight?

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.760
That's kind of vague.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760
I don't know if there was a particular thing of mine.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.200
We talked a little bit about Twitter and Facebook.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.880
What's on the horizon for PlayStation 3?

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.560
We talked about their update a little bit last week.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.440
Do we know any other features on the horizon?

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.440
I don't know.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.440
It's just pretty much what they've discussed already.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.560
They're going to have, obviously, the Facebook, Twitter stuff, the Last.fm thing that they're

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.760
going to be adding on there.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:44.320
Whatever else they tend to throw in there as well, I guess, they've pretty much announced

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320
everything already.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.280
Unless they announce some more stuff at PAX, I don't think they have any press conferences

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280
at PAX.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.840
As far as the PlayStation 3 goes, there's supposed to be a lot of stuff for the 3.0

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:05.480
firmware upgrade, like the animated themes and the what's new portion of it.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480
I don't know.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.440
I don't really care about here, unfortunately.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.600
Ray Iannami says, I'd like to bring up Tetris the Grandmaster 4, which got announced, but

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm going to wait until more details to request it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.520
Oops, I guess I read it anyway.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.280
Is that the new one that they've talked about that's supposed to be coming out on Wii?

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.000
Or is this a whole new Tetris game?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.160
No, that's DS and Wii, it was like Tetris Party or something like that, it was different.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.000
Unless that's like calling Grandmaster 4.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.040
Hold on, I'm getting a picture right now of what this new little dual screen laptop looks

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
like.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.840
Wow, that looks actually kind of crappy.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.880
It looks like a bad Photoshop or something.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880
That's awful.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880
Alright.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.880
One more tweet from Tigerclaw305.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.160
Imagine sitting next to someone on a plane with that, watching a movie.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.960
Oh my god, as if the overweight people weren't bad enough.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:01.320
Tigerclaw305 says, Piracy protection is why PSP Go's battery isn't removable.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.280
There's no such thing as not removable.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.080
Apparently the whole Pandora's battery thing is the reason why the PSP Go's battery you

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.080
can't take it off.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080
Yeah, but they forget one thing.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.920
No one's going to buy the PSP Go, and if you really want to put homebrew and pirate stuff,

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.040
you're going to buy PSP 3000, which is also readily available for less than the PSP Go.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.920
What if they stop making PSP 3000?

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920
They're not going to.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920
You think?

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.080
They'll piss off a lot of people if they do that.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:32.160
By the way, there's a comment right here from John Collar, the Sony Computer Entertainment

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.520
Association, America's president.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.560
You won't be able to rip your games and play them on the PSP Go system.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.280
The firmware precludes that.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.920
There's no external battery, so there's a number of protections put into place on the

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
system.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.240
Oh, ho, ho, ho, you're just throwing out another challenge, aren't you?

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.560
Just stop doing that.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.440
They really want to take it apart to get to the battery they can, okay?

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.880
People will take apart their systems to mod it if they really need to.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.320
And just saying that you can't do it doesn't mean it's not possible, because every single

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.720
firmware that you've released has been cracked immediately.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720
All right.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.160
That's enough for Twitter topics.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.880
If you have more you want to contribute, we'll open up the Skypline a little later in the

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880
show.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.520
Sorry if we didn't get to your tweet, but we want to get to some rapid fire news.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.160
Loki, some quick topics to start us off tonight.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.160
All right.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.520
Well, let's start off with a little bit of Tim Curry news.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:28.160
He's apparently doing the voice of the villain in Dragon Age Origins, and that makes that

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.400
game 100% cooler now.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.760
So he's going to be a calculating villain.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.240
Tim Curry makes every game better.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.480
Yes.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:46.120
Also in other news, Space Invaders and Bust A Move are headed to the Blackberry.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.280
You know, mainly you see a lot of new games coming to the iPhone, but yes, it's nice to

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.400
see that the Blackberry is getting some new stuff as well.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.740
And both of those are going to be available, I guess, for $4.99 and feature two different

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.120
control schemes.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:08.480
And then finally, Peggle Knights is coming to Xbox Live Arcade via an expansion for Peggle.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.320
And of course, that will pretty much double the amount of levels that are available in

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:20.640
there and will feature three new achievements worth a total of 50 Microsoft points, or I

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.480
guess achievement points, not Microsoft points.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.640
No word yet on what the expansion is going to cost, but it will be coming out sometime

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.840
this fall.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.200
Moving on to some more news about a game we heard about a while ago that I haven't seen

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.760
any new news on lately, but iPet is actually coming out on November 17th.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.520
It's finally been dated.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.300
iPet is a game that you use the PlayStation Eye, I guess, to actually interact with a

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.800
small little pet.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.640
An eye-equipped bundle with the game is coming out for $60.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.560
I guess the game is supposedly like the old game Seaman on the Dreamcast, you remember

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560
that?

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.560
But it's not quite as weird.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.680
And it's a monkey, a little monkey instead of a little seahorse or whatever it was in

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.680
that game.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.120
He's much cuter than Seaman.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120
That's right.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.320
N Plus is developing a new game called Slick Entertainment Made N Plus.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.100
They are now making a new game called Scrap Metal that's had a little trailer release

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.340
this week.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.020
It's a top-down racing game, and it looks kind of like, if you remember, Super Off-Road,

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.560
which is like the quintessential Pizza Party game.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.440
Yeah, or like Super Sprint or something like that.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.960
Rock and Roll Racing is another game it's being compared to.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.960
All those games.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.640
But, of course, a newer type of physics engine, and it looks like the track doesn't all show

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.440
on the screen at once, but it looks pretty cool.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.920
It does look really sweet.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.320
I bet this game will be a lot of fun to play on Xbox Live Arcade, so keep an eye out for

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320
that.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.560
And lastly, some of your Rock Band updates this week.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.980
Some of the songs that will be coming out to Rock Band this week include The Talking

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:55.080
Heads and She Was, Cross-Eyed and Painless, Girlfriend is Better, Once in a Lifetime,

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080
and Take Me to the River.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.440
All of those games coming out on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Rock Band this week,

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:07.040
as well as some individual songs from Avenged Sevenfold, The Jam, Oasis, and Rage Against

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040
the Machine.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.120
Guerrilla Radio is coming out on Rock Band.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.040
Oasis, by the way, a live song coming from that, Supersonic.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.200
Apparently, you won't be seeing Oasis live anymore, as one of them threw a hissy fit,

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200
as tends to happen.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:29.040
I really like how it was said in an episode of Phineas and Ferb.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.840
It was a diva tantrum.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.320
Yeah, a diva tantrum.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.720
You know, I think Perez Hilton said that, too.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.020
So there you go.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.800
That's some of my rapid-fire news.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800
Star Sakura.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:46.320
Well, let's move forward with all that other stuff, as soon as my computer catches up.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320
There we go.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.760
They changed the date for the release of Scribblenauts in the UK.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.840
They said it's actually going to be pushed out until October 9th instead of September

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
15th.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.840
That sucks.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.200
Well, we're getting it on September 15th.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.080
I know, but I'm being epithetic for them.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.880
Yeah.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:19.920
Also, there is a Star Wars adventure game using the SCUMM engine, but it's actually

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.440
fan-made.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:31.240
It's called Han Solo Adventures, and it's an adventure game studio game, so it gets

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:39.800
the old LucasArts-type game, but it's supposed to be based on the early life of Han Solo.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.800
Han Solo.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.800
The early years.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.160
Taking Star Wars fanboy wank to a whole new level.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.440
Mr. I Shot First.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.120
And then, in other news, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is getting four new characters, two of them

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.620
being Tatsunoko characters and two of them being Capcom characters, and it's being announced

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:03.520
at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, so who knows?

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.720
Maybe we'll get a Joe from Gatchaman.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.320
Phoenix Wright, please.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320
Prank Quest.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320
Prank Quest.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320
Come on.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320
That would be hilarious.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.020
That would actually be a really good one for Western audiences, too, I think, v. Frank

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.020
West.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.020
Yeah, I like that.

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:21.800
I love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, except the end boss is a bitch.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.800
What if we're getting Kaze?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.520
Who knows?

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.480
Or Puzzle Fighter Dan.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480
They could draw a bunch of red bricks.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.160
All right, let's get back into some long discussions, we have a few topics we want to spend a little

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.160
more time on tonight.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.700
All right, well, there's a rumor going around that EA is the one responsible for holding

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:47.760
back PS3 cross-game chat, and the reason being is that one of their older games, and people

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.960
are not exactly going to say which one, although I remember reading somewhere that they think

01:18:51.960 --> 01:19:00.880
it's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apparently doesn't support custom soundtracks,

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.080
I guess, or something to that effect.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.080
What was it?

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.920
Oh, it was one of the ones, I guess, that didn't use an in-game cross-media bar or something

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.680
like that, didn't support it, and because I don't know why a year-old Harry Potter game

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.960
would be a big game for them still, because of that game, they didn't want the other games

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.400
making that game look bad or something like that, so.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.080
Yeah, but what's our source on this?

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080
I mean, is this coming from a respectable-

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.880
It's from an insider, you know.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.760
Are we talking the Ars Technica mole, who's usually pretty believable?

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.160
No, some other dude, I don't know.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.000
It's some dude on a forum?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.240
It's not some dude on a forum, but some, like, super, it's a guy, which has the worst screen

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.800
name ever, a guy called Super Secret.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.000
See, do you see why I'm taking this with a grain of salt?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
It's some dude on a forum.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.280
I would have more respect for him if he was called Secret Squirrel.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.280
Secret Squirrel.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.280
I love Secret Squirrel.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.600
Would that be your mole name if you were to spill trade secrets on a web forum, Secret

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.600
Squirrel?

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600
I would be Secret Squirrel.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600
There you go.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.480
Yeah, sj100matt in our chat room tonight asked, so I can't play Dragon Force while I play

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480
Harry Potter.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480
Nope.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480
Yeah.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480
Doesn't sound like it.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.480
Apparently, PS3 titles-

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.400
I don't understand why that would hold up voice chat, though.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400
So what?

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.000
You don't have to cross-media bar in an old-ass game.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.640
It's basically, um, well, what it was is custom soundtracks is actually what was the problem

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640
holding it back.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:28.160
Apparently, PS3 titles have to be developed with, um, custom soundtrack support in order

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.320
to, I guess, utilize voice chat, and apparently that was one of the titles that was before

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.920
all the whole custom soundtrack thing.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.960
But who gives a- ah.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Whatever, you know.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.920
I mean, so you can't chat back and forth.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Boohoo.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.560
Well, it is something the Xbox has that, you know, the PS3 doesn't have, but I also just

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.000
don't like to talk to people while I'm trying to play other games.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.160
Like, if we're playing a game together, yeah, of course I like to talk to people.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.160
Like, 1 vs. 100?

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.960
Yeah, you have to do party chat in those games.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960
It's way more fun.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.100
But, uh, you know, I don't- if somebody else is playing- or if- especially if I'm trying

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:07.580
to focus on a first-person game, like, I don't wanna- like, messages are bad enough.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.720
I don't wanna talk to people.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.720
Really?

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.960
Are people gonna wanna talk to each other while playing Harry Potter and the Order of

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960
the Phoenix?

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960
Yeah.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.560
Because otherwise I'm playing this year-old Harry Potter game.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.320
Which, by the way, if I ever ignore messages that you guys are sending me, don't take it

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.880
personally, but I'm probably just, like, in the middle of a game and I don't really wanna

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.920
stop and check messages, you know?

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.680
Or in the middle of a cutscene or something, you know?

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.480
People sending me invites to play random games that I don't own.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.120
I used to get that a lot on 360.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.640
I think people finally figured out I don't own some of those games, but-

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.640
I don't own Gears of War 2.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.640
Interesting.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:43.000
Alright, well, hey, um, another topic I wanna get into here is talking about the game DJ

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Max Technica.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.680
Yes, this game is continuing its little testing.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.400
Apparently there's one here at Rosewood Golf Line.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.400
We have a machine here locally.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.440
I've not been out to play it yet.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.360
But apparently there is a location test happening in the UK now.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.120
It's at Hollywood Bowl Finchley, and that's in Finchley, part of London.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.120
And so if you know where the Hollywood Bowl is at, you can check out a DJ Max Technica

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.120
machine if that's-

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.120
And report on it!

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120
Yes.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.480
But apparently, the other interesting thing, there's actually a test going on at a Walmart

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.520
right now in Santa Clarita.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.560
Is happening at a Walmart Supercenter store.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:21.320
Apparently, and this is why I wanted to bring this up, is it's not, you know, DJ Max has

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.920
been location testing for quite some time.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.440
I don't think that's really news, but I think what is news about this is the fact that it's

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.600
happening at a Walmart of all places, and this is being reported by MomaniStyle.com

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.840
who really keeps tabs on what's going on with these music-based games.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.660
But what's interesting about this is that apparently they're trying to actually kind

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.600
of move into the arcade business at Walmart.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.200
And rumor is going around that if these tests work, that they're expanding some of these

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.640
arcades in certain locations, that many of the Walmarts everywhere are gonna see more

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.640
floor space dedicated to a dedicated arcade.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.520
So I guess the big, was it the Cabela's Game Hunter games, and you know, the Deer Hunters

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520
and all that?

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.480
They're not bringing as much money in as they were before?

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:08.000
Hey, we did have Jumbo Safari at Walmart for a long time.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I don't know.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.600
I do see Walmarts, you know, their arcades and stuff, and I think all it really takes

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.840
is just replacing the games they have with some better games.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.080
Well, and that's the other thing, is that I think most Walmarts already have like a

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.960
little arcade, but not all of them.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.600
I've been to Walmarts that don't have them.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.920
The one near my house doesn't.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.640
Yeah, some don't have any arcade games whatsoever.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.840
So imagine if this was something that would be mandated as part of a Walmart.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.560
Like, for example, those Super Centers have a lot of stuff in them.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.320
You know, the Vision Centers, the Nails, the Nail Place, the McDonalds, I think they cut

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.720
your hair in them too.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.080
Imagine if they had a section for arcade, and it actually makes a lot of sense, drop

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.800
the kids off there while you do your shopping, it'll make a lot of sense.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.880
Definitely, and I remember back in the day when they had arcade games, regardless of

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:56.800
the stores, I remember we used to have like a, was it a Food Max or like a big warehouse

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:03.640
food store that had a Neo Geo, you know, multi-game system in there, and I used to love playing

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.800
like Magician's Lord and stuff like that.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
It was awesome.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800
I had that game in the vault.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.160
So, you know, I'm all for more places having arcade games.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.000
Hell, there's even 7-Elevens I see now that do not have an arcade game in them.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.680
What the hell?

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.400
That is just blasphemy right there.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.360
Lots of 7-Elevens don't have arcade games anymore.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360
I know, what the hell?

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.640
That was where I used to play Mortal Kombat 2.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.120
But it wasn't a 7-Eleven, it was a knockoff.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120
It was like called QuickMart.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.120
It was a little place in the town I grew up.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120
Street Fighter 2.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.520
They actually had Mortal Kombat 2, and it was huge when it first came out, like they

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520
had it.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.520
It was awesome.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.760
Street Fighter 2, and I remember there was a local diner that had Captain Commando.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.200
Oh, we used to play that all the time.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.200
Wouldn't that be weird though if arcades make a comeback thanks to Walmart?

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.360
Although I don't think it would be the same type of arcade.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.800
Like if it is a babysitting place at Walmart, this is an arcade I want to stay the hell

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800
away from.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.840
It's going to be weird if they have stuff like DJ Max Technica and like the cool new

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.640
games people want to play.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:07.160
Well maybe the whole DJ Max Technica testing at Walmart is to test its durability.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.440
That is going to be a big resource because you have to bring in people to fix those machines.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.040
But then again, something huge like Walmart, you could have a dude that just goes around

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.280
all the different Walmarts in the area and fixes all the arcade machines.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.340
You know, and I'm sure the machines would make decent money.

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.760
And then he'd shoot himself at the end of the week.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.640
You don't have to have the most top of the line games, I'm sure, at a Walmart arcade

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.880
to be able to make some money.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880
Well, they don't.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.920
I mean, obviously these Deer Hunter games are making some money.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.200
I've seen a dude playing those games.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.640
Dude, I played one once.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.080
I remember there was a Walmart near here that had a DDR solo machine in it.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080
It was like, what the fuck?

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.340
Yeah, I remember that.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.340
What the hell?

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:48.160
All right, so Walmart might possibly be the next resurgence of arcade gaming.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.400
And I'm not sure how I feel about that, but to be continued.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.760
Makes me feel kind of dirty.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760
Kind of dirty.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760
I think that's a good word for it.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760
A little dirty.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.600
Well, luckily you can get bath soap and all sorts of things to clean yourself off with

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.300
at Walmart in the bathing aisle.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:14.400
So anyway, moving on with more gaming news.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.480
Sonic and Knuckles is supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think is pretty

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.680
epic.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.120
On top of that, it will have the card stacking deal.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.760
So on September 9th, we can look forward to this.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:33.180
You just have to have the original games on the Xbox Live Arcade for that to work.

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:38.520
With Sonic the Hedgehog, you get the Blue Sphere chaos level.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.960
Then with Sonic 2, you'll be able to play as Knuckles.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.480
And then, of course, you know how it worked with Sonic 3.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.360
So that's pretty cool.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.760
Wait, so if I have those other games on Xbox Live, I get that?

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.300
Or does this all come free with Sonic and Knuckles?

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.280
It comes free with Sonic and Knuckles, the add-on capability.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.040
If you had the cartridges, it'd work the same way.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.180
But do I have to have the other games downloaded, you think?

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:06.600
You do have to have Sonic 2 to be able to play Knuckles in Sonic 2.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.480
It's just like owning the cartridges.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.480
Got it.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.200
This is different, this is in cartridges now, so I was just kind of wondering if they were

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.520
coming with the download or what have you.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.860
That's all in GameTap anyway.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.120
If I play those games, it's usually where I go to play it.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.120
I don't know.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.280
I'm not really interested in purchasing those games, especially since you can just buy the...

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.400
Yeah, I have the Mega Collection, which I don't know if it has Sonic and Knuckles on

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400
it, I can't remember.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
Probably not.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.720
I think it has Sonic and Knuckles, but I don't think it has the add-ons, like this does.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.880
But I have a feeling this wouldn't work with the Genesis Mega Collection.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.120
I just have a feeling it would not.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.680
They want you to buy the other games, or buy them again.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.200
So speaking of companies holding back other companies for doing things, I don't know if

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.400
we touched on this last week about Final Fantasy XIV and the reason why it's not coming to

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.800
the Xbox 360.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:03.920
Well apparently Microsoft was holding them back from putting an MMO on there.

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.840
Well apparently the same thing is now happening with Champions Online.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.720
Apparently it's just Microsoft doesn't have the framework built in place, or they're just

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.960
not willing to conform to what they're looking for.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.480
Um, Final Fantasy XI?

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.480
I know they do, but XI's a little different I think.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.060
But for whatever reason- Well XI had that whole Play Online front-end,

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.600
but it was a little awkward on the Xbox 360.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.280
Well I guess it was no different from PlayStation 2.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.520
They actually function very similar.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.680
You have to just log in through the Play Online front-end first, and the same thing on the

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.720
PC, and then you can get into the game, but it was always kind of a little weird.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:44.360
Yeah I guess because Final Fantasy XI was the exception to the rule I guess, but apparently

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.960
there's something that they're doing, some sort of red tape, that's holding up a bunch

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.920
of different games from being on there.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:55.880
Do you think this could be a bad misstep by Microsoft, because PlayStation 3 is going

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880
to be getting some MMOs, right?

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880
I think so.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.200
They have the DC Universe coming out, we know that.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.240
I think the one DC Universe and the Agency and stuff like that starts coming out on the

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:08.440
PS3 that might put a little bit more pressure on them to get their act together.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.920
I am kind of surprised that we haven't really seen a lot of MMOs on 360.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:21.820
There's supposed to be that Marvel one that kind of fell through, so I don't know.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.920
But yet they have Final Fantasy XI, but I guess I don't know if that front-end makes

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.080
the difference or what.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.880
Because I heard Final Fantasy XIV does not have Play Online.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.640
They're doing away with that whole thing, which is good.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.080
Play Online was crap.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.080
It was interesting at first, but the thing is that it really served no purpose unless

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.400
you also played Tetra Master, which very, very, very, very, very few people did.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.080
Play Online was originally supposed to be a front-end for all these other Squeenix games,

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.720
but nothing else ever came out but Final Fantasy XI.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.160
I think in Japan there might have been one or two others, but there really was nothing

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.760
anywhere else, and it made it kind of pointless.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:00.200
That would be kind of cool if they still used Play Online to be able to connect to Final

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:06.960
Fantasy XIV on the 360, so say I bought Final Fantasy XI, I don't have to update anything

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.560
because it's still the Play Online viewer or whatever.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.560
You wouldn't have it on one console and not have it on the other unless the players were

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.480
independent of each other, which I don't think is going to happen.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.160
I can't see them going that direction.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:25.320
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says, Play Online was a waste of space on my hard drive.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.320
It was pretty good.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.920
You couldn't really delete it, you know?

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.560
Yeah, you had to go through the uninstall.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.800
You had to put back in the disk just to uninstall the game, and if you tried to delete it, it

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.680
would kind of screw things up.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.600
It was just a nuisance.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.120
It was a pure and utter nuisance to deal with.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.680
Hopefully they're going to be smarter about it with Final Fantasy XIV, which it sounds

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.000
like they're going to do, so hey, cool.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.520
In theory, right?

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520
Yeah.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:53.040
Well, kind of something interesting came to light this week about the new Rock Band Unplugged

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.400
demo that's out there and available right now.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.720
Apparently though, the PSP Go is coming with a voucher that you get an exclusive demo of

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:09.960
Rock Band Unplugged for the PSP Go, so when you get your PSP Go, you get to download this

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:17.520
demo for Rock Band Unplugged, but the thing about this demo, it will also play downloads

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.900
from the Rock Band Unplugged store, so the demo comes with five songs, but if you don't

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:26.680
really want to buy the game, you don't have to.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:32.520
You can just buy the additional songs you want to play and add those to your game, and

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.840
just continue to play Rock Band Unplugged that way.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:41.120
So are they trying to do that to, see, I don't really get that.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.280
That seems in the long run, wouldn't they end up losing some money on it?

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.280
No.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.160
Well, but they gain the money from the song downloads, so it's weird.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.160
It's just weird.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.160
You know, you haven't really heard of a game distributed like that.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.920
Because the song downloads, I mean, later on if you decide to buy the game, it'll still

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.600
work with the full game too.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600
Yeah.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.480
I mean, really, the only asset then of getting the full game is getting the 40 whatever songs

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.360
that come with the game.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:08.040
Because apparently the engine itself is going to download all onto your PSP Go.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.100
Interesting.

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.360
That is very interesting.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.800
I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.560
I wonder if we're going to see more demos like that in the future, where essentially

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.720
all the sales are going to be based off of microtransactions, right?

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720
Yeah.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.720
So.

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.720
Mm-hmm.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.720
Okay.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:33.360
Well, we're going to take a little break here to get to the mailbag at mailbagatorangelawntrader.com.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.160
Every week you guys send us emails and we talk about them here on the program.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:40.160
The lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.920
and reads them here live on air.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.560
Dark Sakura, what do we have in the mailbag this week?

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.040
We have one from Loomis that says, prayer and thoughts to the OLR crew.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:51.280
I've been watching the news lately regarding the fires in California and hope y'all aren't

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.280
affected.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:56.000
We've been getting a little smoky air, but we're far enough north that all it does is

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
fuck with our weather.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yeah.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.200
We are totally far away from where all that is going on.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.240
We're in the Sacramento region and most of the fires unfortunately are happening in Southern

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240
California.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240
It's about seven hours away from us.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.240
Yeah.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.240
So most of it's far away.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.440
So thanks for thinking of us.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:13.880
If you really want to do something though, I know the Red Cross is always looking for

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.360
donations and things like that, and during these times they really need that stuff.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.920
So think about it.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.200
Well, next up comes from Rini.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.920
Greetings and salutations to the crew, but for once I'd like to extend my admirations

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.600
to Dark Sakura for choosing motherfucking Silphied as the classic game of the week on

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.040
episode 335.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.600
I bought that game completely out of randomness for an amazing $10 new, but that's not the

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.800
point of this email.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.840
While not everyone out there will run out to play Silphied, I would like to share a

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.240
bizarre yet awesome experience with the game.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.880
I had just started another session of the game.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.540
Around the second stage or so, the game crashed.

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.980
The game screen completely went to a dark screen with white text, and it caught me off

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.320
guard since Silphied never did that before.

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:02.920
I didn't bump my Sega CDX, yes the rareportable one, ah windows, nor was there anything within

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.200
the vicinity to jolt my console, the game just suddenly glitched itself for no reason.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.720
The interesting thing about this whole event is what was on screen.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.020
Pyramid Head brandishing its cleaver, kidding.

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.920
What was on the screen was an apology, that's right, the game apologized.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.620
What makes it even better is that the game was not only able to recover and head back

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:26.080
to the title screen, but it also shot off a free continue so I wouldn't lose my progress.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.400
Sadly, I've never been able to replicate this, nor do I believe there is a documented instance

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.800
over the internet, so I guess it's a sad little cherished memory for me to have and love alone.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:41.820
OLR Crew, have you had any experiences with unusual game behavior that stood out for you?

01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:47.160
Just pushing, having to reset the Genesis in that X-Men game.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.320
Outside of the Red Rings of Death, I would say maybe funny Engrish in games is always

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.440
a little bit of an experience, but I can't think of anything quite on the caliber of

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.160
what you're saying, that's a pretty neat little story about the game apologizing, I've never

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.160
heard of that.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:05.920
I'm gonna have to fuck around with mine then, I'm gonna have to actually see if there's

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.080
anything about that online anywhere, there might be, who knows.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.240
I've always thought that the game should apologize for me playing it, well not Silphie, but maybe

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.160
like Driver 3 or something like that.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.960
Sorry that we made this game, I know it sucks, but hey.

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.840
We got apologized to by Blockbuster after renting a game that we brought back an hour

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.840
later.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:33.120
We rented WCW Thunder, and it was so bad, we called Blockbuster and asked them if we

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.000
could take it back and they said they were sorry.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.440
They let us get another game because it sucked that bad.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.200
That sucks to have to apologize for something they really didn't do though, you know Blockbuster

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:45.840
is just the, I understand that that's just good customer service to let you bring the

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.240
game back and get a new one, but they shouldn't have to apologize for it, they didn't make

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.400
the game.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.760
But I know that's good customer service and blah blah blah.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:04.760
Well moving forward, from Shook, hello OLR, first off I want to say there was a typo in

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.560
my last letter, I meant to say that the K in my name is pronounced as if it were lowercase,

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:09.840
not silent.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.940
So Shook will suffice from now on.

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:16.400
Now on to other things, my bigot dad, you have my permission to call him whatever nasty

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.800
name you want, finally discovered that I had Final Fantasy X when he saw me in the middle

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.800
of a battle.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:25.380
Without a word, he ejected the disc, put it in its case, and put it in his safe keep.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:26.380
What a bummer.

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:31.480
Luckily, he didn't find Chrono Trigger, which is a very good thing because I think, no because

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.900
I will guard that game with my life, no joke, I truly have stumbled upon the best thing

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.320
I've ever played.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.840
And yes DarkSakura, I did do the ending where you beat it at the beginning, it was awesome.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.520
Proceed to bag on my dad.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.680
Now that that's over, I have a suggestion-

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.580
We'll come back at the end of the email, I do want to bag on your dad, but we'll come

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.580
back to that in a little while.

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.840
I have a suggestion for the Wii inflatable chair, I bet that there's going to be some

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.800
kind of fetish porn game that involves that inflatable chair so it's not completely bad.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.560
PS, can't wait to join the OLR home club, my PSN username is MGS654, don't ask.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.320
Your dad needs to-

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.920
Hold on a minute, I'm trying to kind of cue something up here because I-

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:20.760
The Tribble has a comment.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.240
That was one angry Tribble.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.160
That was a very angry Tribble.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.600
Hold on, Shook, Shookadook, Shookadook, I want you to actually go get your father.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.080
Will you please go get your father and put him on because I actually want to kind of

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.080
say something.

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.880
No, because then we want him to not be able to listen to the show.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.240
But I don't care, I want to say something to this guy because this is-

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.480
I want him to be able to keep listening to the show.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480
I do, but obviously he's already listening to the show and apparently the dad doesn't

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.000
know about it, so you know, I don't think he'll know about it.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.600
And he'll get in trouble for what you do, it sounds like that kind of person.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.040
All I have to say, okay whether you want to replay this or not, I don't care, all I have

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.680
to say is that he should be thankful that you want to spend your time playing something

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:19.920
that takes intelligence, strategy, wit to play and conquer and it's a story.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.720
You know, it's no worse than watching a movie or a miniseries and-

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.720
That his dad doesn't let him watch fantasy movies.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.840
It's not going to make you gay, okay, for playing these games or what have you.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.800
Heaven forbid you use your brain.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.800
You know what, your dad should be thankful that he has a kid that would rather stay at

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.880
home and play a game like Final Fantasy X than go out and kill people and shoot guns

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:50.520
and rob stores and do drugs and have premarital sex without protection.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.880
For the record it's okay to shoot guns as long as you have a supervised adult.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:58.400
You know what I mean though, at least he should be thankful that you're not into gangs or

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.420
any of this stuff.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:05.500
Because if he keeps trying to take this stuff away, that's how kids sometimes get involved

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.640
in this, is when they rebel, they rebel hard.

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.260
You sound smart enough where that's not going to happen, but your dad should be freaking

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:18.120
counting his blessings, that's all I have to say.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.760
I can say I can vouch for that from experience.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:28.940
Also one from Death Wishing, Rob, there is a Marvel vs Capcom 2 cabinet down the street

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.440
from me in a pizza shop.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.280
I really want to use it because, well, they are rare, right?

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.280
They are?

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.720
I would totally steal that if stealing was legal, but man, none of my friends will join

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.580
me because they think fighting games are gay.

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:46.680
I don't care for that terminology.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.880
Do you know a good fighting game that could turn them onto the genre?

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:50.880
P.S.

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.720
Don't say Street Fighter or they hate it.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.920
Love Death Wishing.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.640
Um, no.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.360
I can't think of a game, honestly, Street Fighter 2 is like the pinnacle of fighting

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.360
games.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.320
If they don't like that, there is nothing you can do.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:08.200
There is just, there is no fighting game that's going to work.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:14.680
I mean, you could try cutesy fighting games, but if Marvel vs Capcom 2 is too gay, then

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.960
sorry, but the other games are going to be even worse.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.660
Mortal Kombat maybe.

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.320
You should all make them play, um, what was that awful fighting game, um, with the, it

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.140
was really, Pit Fighter, make them play Pit Fighter.

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:31.000
I have better, Pit Fighter is like the worst fighting game I've ever played in my life.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.920
Here's, here's my suggestion, get new friends.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.920
That's my suggestion.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.360
Another email, oh god, this is long.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.040
Hello to Darksacrosky and Loki, thank you for discussing and reading my tweet on the

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.040
last show.

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:47.920
I'm really passionate about Extra Life and what we gamers can do to make a difference,

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.000
so I'm glad you brought it up during the show.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.480
Let me tell you a little bit about Extra Life.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.440
Extra Life was started by the folks at sarcasticgamer.com and its founder is Doc Adams.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.560
He has done some previous work with fundraisers before, but this has become something important

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560
to him.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.920
You can read about his inspiration, um, well the link doesn't work.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:12.400
Um, as for my inspiration, I recently put up a story on Sarcastic Gamer pointing out

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.400
why I've become involved.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.320
I'm going to read this.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.360
The reason I've brought it up to OLR is that you guys have quite a great community.

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:24.560
I've been listening to this show since it became a podcast a long, long time ago and

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.920
I've since become a huge fan.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:34.200
I know, I now listen to you guys on my iPhone on my drive to work or out on my morning runs.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:38.600
I was happy you got to be part of all games years ago since I listened to Scott and AGI

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.600
way back in the day.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.160
I never really was part of your forums or anything, but I always loved listening to

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.440
the show.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.560
For Extra Life you can sign up through the main page at extralife.sarcasticgamer.com

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.680
and click on the sign up button.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.720
It will take you to Texas Children's Hospital website and you can put up a donation page

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720
there.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720
This will be a personal donation.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.040
Wait, but this is something we do, not the listeners, right?

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.480
Yeah, unless listeners want to be.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.760
Oh, like because we have a lot of people that have kind of their own things too, so okay,

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:05.760
that makes sense.

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.400
Yeah, I want to make sure that people, that people do know about this.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.500
Um, and this will be a personal donation page that you can edit and change up quite a bit,

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.440
but more importantly you can send out the link to anyone so they can give you online

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.680
donations through the site.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.840
You can also use PayPal for overseas donations as well.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.240
Now from there you can also create a team so other participants can join with you.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.520
Anyone else in your community can sign up and join your team as well.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.000
We should totally do that.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.760
It takes an aggregate total of those that join your team and you can see how much the

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.040
OLR team raises overall.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.640
Oh, so don't, so then don't go make your own page.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.360
Let us do it, which we were going to do in the next week here and then we'll tell you

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.600
guys what our little link is so we can all race together.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.520
That would be fun.

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.660
You can even see how much each team member raises as well.

01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.720
That is if you go there right now.

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.460
What it is is other people can make their own donation pages, but we can band them together

01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:59.460
as a team.

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.460
Okay.

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.460
And it keeps an aggregate amount.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:03.320
We'll have to go in there and kind of play with it and see what it looks like.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.800
He put up his donation page, um, which, uh, is ways to give dot Texas children's dot org

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.040
slash net community slash Alan Ray, A-L-L-E-N-R-E-Y.

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.120
So if anyone wants to take a look at it.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.520
As for the gamer day myself, um, itself, you can do whatever you want.

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.920
A lot of people will be videotaping and live streaming their gamer activities.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.520
So if you, uh, guys and gals want to do it, it'll be cool.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.560
I like your theme of obscure fucking vault games.

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.560
Ha ha ha.

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:28.560
It would be awesome.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.440
Also, you would probably want to try having the marathon going and maybe broadcast and

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.040
record your podcast live that day.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.600
We should totally do that.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.800
It'll be a different show with the gaming marathon going on as well, but it might spice

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.800
things up.

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.800
We've done that at Bimani attorneys before.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:44.800
Yeah.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.080
I don't know how that's going to work because now I'm starting to think of the technical

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.280
aspect of it all.

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.480
That's going to be hard, but I think what's going to happen, I think we're going to have

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.480
more than just the three of us doing this.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.760
We're going to get some other folks involved.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:01.440
I imagine Dan's got to be involved one way or another somehow hopefully sign up and we'll

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.040
figure it, we'll figure it out, but we are doing it.

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.400
We just, we, we talked before the show tonight and we're going to make the commitment to

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.400
do it.

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.280
Um, so more details coming on that in the future.

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.380
So that's all going to go down October 17th.

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:17.520
And I, I don't know if any of the other all games folks are getting in on it because if

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.320
they're not, I would love to see what we can do with the stream that day.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.120
But I think, is that a Saturday?

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.360
I think under station live is on Saturday and there might be some other shows, so we

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.440
might not be able to take over the all game stream all day, but we'll see what we can

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.440
do.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.400
We're, we'll at least have some type of Ustream or Justin TV page that day.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.760
Um, to continue, what do you think sounds fun, right?

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.120
Yeah, actually, yeah, it does.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120
Just think of it this way.

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.880
This will be the most fun thing you do to raise money for any charity.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:46.560
Some people train for marathons like me, or ride a bike across the US.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.040
You'll put out way, you'll put out way too many calories and at some point it's going

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.040
to hurt.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.160
Take it from me, I hurt my knee training for my marathon.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.560
You will never have more fun raising money and you just have to pick up a game controller.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:00.400
We would love to have you added to the list of gamer sites participating.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.400
I also hope you can reach out to other shows on the all games network like VGO and Bobby

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.080
Black Wolf and his shows.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.080
Anyways, thank you for mentioning Extra Life and I hope to hear some good news from you

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.080
all soon.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.080
If you have any suggestions, I'm not going to share his Twitter on the thing.

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.080
Thank you for your time.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.720
And that's from Alan.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.920
Yeah, I'm, we're going to do it.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.000
Um, we'll, that's all going to go down October 17th.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.620
We'll, uh, yeah, we'll have something posted on our website this week as soon as we get

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:29.320
everything set up with more details.

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.040
Um, I just from a technical aspect, I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed with how we're

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.760
going to make it work because we want to do, we want to do an hour of pinball incorporated

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760
in this as well.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.680
So hopefully Rob, my best, my best advice in this, don't waste time overthinking it.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680
It'll be easy.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.680
Yeah.

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:48.680
We'll figure it out.

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:49.680
We'll figure it out.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.680
We have more than one video camera.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.400
We know that Loki has the video capture card and we have a switch box camera.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.240
We can borrow, hopefully maybe Victoria will lend us hers.

01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.240
That's my camera.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.240
She just always uses it.

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.240
Yeah.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.160
Well then we'll, we've got them and we can post photos and we can do like a splash page

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.160
or something.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:06.160
It's, it's Rob.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.160
It's not hard.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.160
I know.

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.160
I'll figure it out.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.800
We can put up a, I just wanted to go off without a hitch.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.600
I want it to be perfect for the children.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.600
Rob.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.600
What?

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.480
We can put up a, um, uh, Oh crap.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.480
What is it?

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.600
The CCS page.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.160
I think the way it's going to work though, we're going to do games from the vault for

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.200
one hour basically.

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.560
And I don't know how we're going to pick them.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.760
I don't know if we'll, if we'll have folks donate, but I don't know if there's any way

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.520
to kind of show like so and so donated money.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.800
So they pick the next game.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.520
I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll figure something out.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.920
Whoever donates the most money during one game gets to pick the next game.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920
Yeah.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920
Maybe we'll do something like that.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.800
We're going to have to have a list of games or get to pick a system.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800
Yeah.

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.800
We'll, we'll figure something out.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.360
We'll work out the details over the next few weeks.

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.360
Yeah.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.680
Although what I see happening is us having the newer systems hooked up in the front room

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:00.300
and the older systems hooked up in the vault.

01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.000
We will have dreamcast age.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.200
All right.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.200
Testify.

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.760
So when we need to get some more of our local friends involved, so we'll put out the call

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760
this week.

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760
Get off your asses.

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.760
All right.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.560
Last email from Rabababa.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.680
In reference to the August 16th podcast, my first PS2 was broken from the start, but in

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.920
a very odd way that took me two years to notice.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.000
In retrospect, I should have kept the old one for the novelty of it all.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.600
It played all the games fine, oddly enough, and it never physically failed.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.400
There's something wrong with the processor clock or math processing.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.940
I'd play a round of Ridge Racer 5, watch the playback, and it would get out of sync

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.840
with the playback about 20 or 30 seconds in.

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:39.400
The car was still maneuvering around the proper order, but being out of sync caused it to

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.360
repeatedly crash into the walls.

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:45.880
I honestly thought this was a software problem with Ridge Racer 5 because it looked like

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.160
a software problem.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.760
And finally we got Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec in the US.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.320
The replay effect was really bad in GT3.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.160
I finally realized it was my hardware.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.280
That was the strangest hardware problem in a game system ever.

01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:03.560
But massive hardware failures frequently covered under unofficial extended warranties for me

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.360
starting with the original Game Boy.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.160
My first two or three Game Boys had the dead slash solid pixel raster problem, and Nintendo

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.200
happily repaired slash replaced for free.

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.340
I'm not certain, but I believe it was because the Game Boy was not rugged enough for typical

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.760
portable play, i.e. carrying around.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:24.360
I also needed direct sunlight to play, but that was a different issue.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.520
You know, remember the PSP had the problem with the dead pixels in the corner?

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.400
It was that.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:35.240
So massive hardware failures have been around at least 20 years, but like

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.720
you said, Flaming Forums wasn't a big sport back then.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:39.720
Later Rubba Bubba.

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720
That's it.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.840
I'm glad that he's just signing it Rubba Bubba.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.840
Adopting his title.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.840
There you go.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.840
And for the record?

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.200
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have some emails you want to send in.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:03.520
But we want to take a minute to get our angst on here in studio because, well, you know,

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.200
sometimes we just read things on the internet that really tick us off, and when they do

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:12.240
make us very upset, we have to do a little segment here that we like to call the FUs

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:28.880
of the Week.

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.480
And let me read a little bit of inspiration for our FUs of the Week this week, and this

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:38.400
comes from a GameStop apparently in Jacksonville, Florida.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:44.360
Apparently somebody tried to rob this GameStop, but it wasn't for money.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:51.720
No, he wanted the employee to fill the bag with games, copies of Madden NFL 10.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:55.200
The robber went into a GameStop on a Monday night, unfortunately the guy's not named otherwise

01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.440
we named him by name, was pretending he wanted a 360, but then whipped out a gun and demanded

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:07.100
copies for Madden NFL 10 and any other 360 games that would fit in the bag.

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:15.480
Apparently he made off with 23 games, $1,300 is what that's valued at, two 360s as well.

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480
Yikes.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480
FU.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:30.200
My FU goes to, it's sort of a pseudo-FU just because I'm kind of happy about it at the

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:37.760
same time, to 250th Anniversary Guinness, FU to being delicious, because I want to go

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.980
back and drink more of you.

01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:42.480
A lot more of you.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.960
It was very, very freaking good.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.440
That's it.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:52.680
FU to having to go to work tomorrow.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680
It sucks.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.360
Well I just don't want to go to work.

01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:00.040
I like the weekends.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:06.160
My FU goes to people that can't see the faults in themselves and like to blame other people

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:11.960
for things that they did, that think they can do no wrong, and some folks need to learn

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:18.960
to accept responsibility, and yeah, need to learn how to take a break.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.920
That's it.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.280
Let's move on to some more gaming news.

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:28.880
Just a couple more and then we're going to get to your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:33.960
While there's something kind of, I don't know if it's really super interesting, but it made

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.880
it into the gaming Guinness Book of World Records, which having thumbed through the

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.720
Guinness Book of World Records for games, pretty much anything can make it in there,

01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:48.680
but Arkham Asylum has now set the record for being the most critically acclaimed superhero

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.980
game ever.

01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.180
So what's that mean?

01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:57.720
It was a superhero game that didn't suck.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:02.440
But I mean really, like, what superhero games have been that awesome?

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:06.040
I mean, did they say what it took the- Marvel Ultimate Alliance is pretty damn awesome.

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:12.120
Well, they're basically saying that it's gotten the highest Metacritic review average, I guess,

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.920
among all the superhero games, but that's just like, that's almost as bad as saying

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:19.960
it's the most critically acclaimed superhero game starring Batman that's ever appeared

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.880
on the consoles.

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.160
Who cares?

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.280
Why is that a record?

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.560
That's not a record.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.860
That's just people's opinions.

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:34.360
It's not like, you know, it's- I'm sorry, but like this game book is just really kind

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.800
of watering down all the other records.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.160
Like, okay, being the tallest person, I mean, yeah, that's not really much of an achievement,

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.760
that's just your DNA, but still, that's a physical, you know, achievement that you have

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760
there.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760
I mean, you're that tall.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:51.800
You know, this is just subjective stuff, like if, you know, if we all wanted to get together

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.680
with all the reviewers and make a game, you know, the highest rated game ever, they could

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.040
easily do that and rig it.

01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:00.240
I mean, it's just, it is a little weird that Metacritic is being used by Guinness.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.480
That's just weird.

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.520
I don't know if I like that.

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.160
And this is just an odd title.

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:08.480
Doesn't this reek of like, hi, we're going to pay these guys a lot of money to get this

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.160
title so we can use it in our marketing?

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.920
I mean, I don't know.

01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:20.220
You want to hear something that I just thought of just now that's kind of a little fishy?

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:23.360
Batman Arkham Asylum was published by Eidos, which is owned by Warner games.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:27.400
Warner games also published a game called Guinness Book of World Records, the game.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:32.720
Gee, don't have close ties with them, do they?

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:33.720
Conflict of interest?

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:34.720
Never.

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.720
Yes, exactly.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.720
I didn't even think of that.

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:37.720
That's a good little comparison.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.200
I just thought of that.

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:42.200
So yeah.

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:46.080
Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get to the Skype line,

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:49.620
your phone calls, and your opinions on the latest and greatest in gaming news.

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:56.040
And what you're going to hear in the background here, oh yes, you know that old classic song.

01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.960
This is a Guitar Hero 5 ad.

01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:01.800
This is a new one that's airing on TV.

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:07.360
And it features Playboy bunnies, yes, 10 of them, all rocking out to Guitar Hero wearing

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.360
no pants.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.320
It's like the risky business.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.200
Oh yeah, it's kind of like the ads, and then there's half variety.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.420
83 bands, all kinds of rock, buy in September and get the unreleased Guitar Hero Van Halen

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.420
on the house.

01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:24.640
And that was the thing that caught my eye about the ad is that they're selling that

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:29.080
whole Guitar Hero Van Halen thing on the house.

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.080
Not free.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.840
Well, it does say, look at the little red text at the bottom of the screen though.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.080
It just says, buy one, get one, but it doesn't say free.

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:41.840
Can't say free because it'll get sued.

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.840
Very interesting.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.540
That's a very interesting way around it.

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.000
But yeah, I thought that was interesting.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.840
They're working that whole Van Halen giveaway into it, and you know, whatever, the half

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.840
thing.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.840
That's funny.

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:53.840
Dude, it's half.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.120
He's a cultural icon.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:56.120
It's pretty cool.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.120
They got everybody involved.

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:03.320
But really, they really do need to come up with a new ad for the whole Guitar Hero thing.

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320
I don't know.

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:07.720
I think there'd be plenty of guys that would argue with you that they could do 10 Playboy

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.240
playmates running around without pants on all day long and they'll never get old.

01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.240
Next time, a trampoline though.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.240
How about that?

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:22.360
We need trampoline hero to come out just for that little ad to come out.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.320
Only if we get pantsless rage.

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.520
Of course, I'm sure there are some ladies that would like to see maybe some guys mixed

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:29.520
in with no pants on.

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:30.520
I don't know.

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.520
Dark Sakura.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.520
I have no problem with that.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520
All right.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.520
There you go.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:39.200
So maybe they need to just have no pants day in honor of Guitar Hero.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.960
I don't know how that works, but the marketing folks at Activision should get right on that.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.320
I am totally down with that.

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.720
Hey, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:51.920
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.920
you want to give us a call.

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.640
It seems like the show is kind of a little short tonight, but there just hasn't been

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.420
a whole lot of gaming news this week.

01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:01.540
It's been a little bit slow and I think it's probably one of the whole fact that a lot

01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:03.560
of folks are going back to school right now.

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:06.800
And so we're kind of just like a little bit of lull before we're going to get slammed

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:07.800
with game releases.

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:11.560
Well, also, they're trying to kind of keep it quiet as far as news goes because we just

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:19.120
had Gamescom and Blizzcon and now they have to save up some announcements for, you know,

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.120
PAX.

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.120
Makes sense.

01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:22.120
Yeah.

01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:23.120
That's true.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.080
I guess we are kind of in a lull because probably all the secrets that are yet to be announced

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.360
are going to be coming through on PAX pretty soon.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.580
Hey, let's go to the phones.

01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:31.580
We have a call.

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:32.580
1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:33.580
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:34.580
Who's this?

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:35.580
Hi, this is Ray Iyanami.

01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:36.580
Hi, Ray Iyanami.

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.580
What's on your mind?

01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:38.580
Yo.

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:46.760
Hi, I guess DJ Maxx told you a few weeks ago, I don't know if I should talk about it since

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.640
the game's like eight months old.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.120
Eh, so what?

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120
So it's a little old.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:58.320
Sometimes we like to look at the games past and things that might be in the bargain bin

01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.320
at this point.

01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.320
What's up?

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.320
Under the radar?

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:02.320
Yeah.

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:09.280
Anyways, so DJ Maxx Trilogy is kind of like the old DJ Maxx Online or kind of like O2

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.280
Jammery.

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.840
It's kind of like being a maniac, but instead of using a proprietary controller, you use

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.200
the PC keyboard.

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.040
And there's a bunch of button modes in it, but there's one thing I really don't like

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:30.960
about it that the other new DJ Maxx games have, and it's a feature called Autocorrect.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.800
Now what, so this is an online game that you can download, kind of like O2 Jam you said?

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:42.080
No, actually it's, you have to buy the physical copies and then you have to install it from

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:49.240
the DVD raw inside, but once you get it set up you don't need to get it anymore.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.920
And it's offline, but there's an online mode.

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:57.800
Is this something that you can only import, or is this available in the US?

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:03.440
It's import only, but it has an English language option, though it's really crappy English.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.120
But enough to get you through the game.

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah, pretty much.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.360
What do you think would attract music game fans to this game?

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:14.440
What makes this game good enough to check out for music game fans?

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:23.520
Oh, I can get to that later, because, but anyways, I don't know, I think just the fact

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:28.840
that like, DJ Maxx online has been dead for two years now, so this kind of gives you a

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:35.560
chance to play a ribbon game that isn't set on the PC again.

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:43.000
And there's a feature I wanted to rant about in this game.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.120
What's this feature?

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:49.320
I'm Autocorrect, where basically you can hit the wrong node, but at the right time you'll

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:51.440
still get credit for it.

01:58:51.440 --> 01:59:01.280
Like, I suppose it hit the J key, but if it hit K, you'll still get the full judgment

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.280
score for it.

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:06.040
Well, not really the score, you still get 100%, but you have a little bit of a score

01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:11.240
penalty, but for me, that's better enough to be okay with the feature.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:15.340
That seems kind of easy, like what's to stop somebody from hitting the key the same the

01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:19.040
whole time, just because your score will be a little bit lower in the end?

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:27.000
Yeah, but a lot of people have songs that you normally would not be able to pass up

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
this feature.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.880
I mean, even guitar hero and rock band don't have this feature.

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:42.360
I just unlocked a new key mode, and I'm trying to learn it, but when you have this feature

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.400
turned on, it makes it confusing to learn, because I don't know if I'm hitting the correct

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:46.400
keys or not.

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.960
Hey, I'd rather be penalized for hitting the wrong key, because at least I know that'll

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:57.440
treat me to hit the right key, instead of just guessing which keys I'm hitting incorrectly.

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:02.580
Okay, well I guess it sounds like a feature that can maybe help make the game more accessible

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:03.580
to some.

02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.840
Alright, well do you have any other thoughts for us?

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:08.160
No, not really.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.520
Alright, we're going to go ahead and let you go, but have a good one buddy, alright?

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520
We'll talk to you later.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.520
Alright, see ya.

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:15.520
Later.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:19.240
Alright, so, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:20.840
a call on this lovely Sunday evening.

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.360
Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting for calls?

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:28.920
I don't think we have a lot tonight, we kind of covered everything, didn't we?

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:32.520
Apparently there is some sort of deal going on with Best Buy that they're offering, buy

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.040
one get one half off for 360 games.

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:37.920
Hmm, let me get a, we have another call, we can come back to this in a minute.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:38.920
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:39.920
Hi, this is President Nader.

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920
Hi, President Nader, what's on your mind tonight?

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:54.200
Yeah, couple things, first off, I just got off of WhatUp.com and I saw a story on there

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.280
that I think you may be interested in.

02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.280
Go ahead, shoot.

02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:05.200
I just sent a picture to your profile for you to check it out later on.

02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.200
What is this?

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:14.480
Apparently there's coming, there's going to be a new Xbox 360 bundle coming out soon and

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.000
according to this picture they're calling it the Super Elite.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.160
Is this the 250 gigabyte system we talked about earlier in part A?

02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:29.480
Actually, I'm not sure what you talked about in part A, I missed a little bit of the show,

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:38.320
so I just happened to see this on OneUp.com, so I thought I'd mention it.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.560
Well, what are your, well, assuming it's the same deal, what are your thoughts on it?

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.660
Is this something that's necessary for Microsoft to do or do you think this is just more, yet

02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:50.320
another skew out there in the marketplace to confuse me?

02:01:50.320 --> 02:02:00.360
I'd say, I don't know, it's kind of a toss up, if you don't already have a 360 or your

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:09.640
360 is basically dead then maybe, yeah, you could use it, otherwise, no.

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:14.800
You may be able to make use of the hard drive.

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:19.480
What exactly, and I kind of pointed this on the PlayStation 3 too, we keep hearing bigger

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:23.920
hard drives, bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives, but on both the 360 and the PS3, for

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.240
what?

02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:28.320
What do we need these huge hard drives for?

02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:36.160
Well, at least for, with the bulk of systems, they're constantly coming out with arcade

02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:44.200
games and, you know, assuming that you buy a lot of the arcade games for your system

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:53.560
or playing a game like a lot of TV shows or at least on the PlayStation 3 buying the movies,

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:56.640
then you're talking to them now.

02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.480
That sounds more like it, room to buy more movies and spend more money on their store.

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.480
That I can agree with.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.400
Anything else you have in mind tonight, Spazinator?

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:06.400
Yeah.

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:14.400
I don't know if you saw my response to your tweet about performing at the club, but yeah,

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:25.200
I'd be interested in joining your ORR club or should be on PSN for the rest of the evening.

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.200
You know, I'll probably get to those later this evening.

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.280
A lot of folks, I mean, I know your PSN name matches your Twitter, but a lot of folks asked

02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:35.760
to be added and I don't think their PSN names match up to their Twitter, so I'm probably

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.400
going to put out another call this evening for folks, but we'll try to get folks added

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.240
this evening or at least tomorrow at the latest.

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.640
All right, well, thanks for your call, Spazinator.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.680
Have a good one and we'll see you probably next week.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:48.840
All right, have a good one.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:49.840
Later.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:50.840
1877 game OLR.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.440
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.800
Loki, what was the rest of this?

02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:56.560
Buy one, get one half off?

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:04.440
Apparently this week we will have the opportunity to get one game and, you know, another game

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.480
for half off at Best Buy and there's a bunch of different games that they're offering that

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.960
and so you just purchase one of the qualifying games and get another one for 50% off.

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:12.960
All right, let's go to the phones.

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:13.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.960
Who's this?

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:15.960
Misty.

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:16.960
Misty?

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:17.960
It's Misty.

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:18.960
Hi.

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.960
Hello.

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:20.960
Hi.

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:25.080
Now, you are on the road to Cali right now, correct?

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.080
That's right.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.160
I don't know exactly how far I have to go, but I'm somewhere outside of Salt Lake City

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.160
right now.

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.160
I'm so sorry.

02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:39.160
I think you're about 15 hours away.

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.760
Well, let's see.

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:41.760
It's an hour and a half to Reno.

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:43.240
I think about another eight.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.560
She's probably about, well, considering the bus has to stop everywhere.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.560
Yeah.

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.120
But I think she's taking the Reno route.

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:50.120
Gotcha.

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.120
Okay.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:52.120
Yeah.

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.120
Yeah.

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:54.120
You got to go through Nevada, which is going to be very boring.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.120
Well, how's the trip been so far?

02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:03.240
Mostly boring, especially once I got out to the mountains, it's been like Illinois only

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:05.480
not left, in my opinion.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:08.160
Are you occupying your time with any video games?

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:11.160
Did you bring a DS or a PSP, something to play?

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:17.400
Not because I broke this, but I am playing... I've got my netbook, so I'm playing random

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.200
like real arcade games on that.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.200
You've got your what?

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.200
I'm sorry?

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.200
Netbook.

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:25.320
My netbook, that computer I took to ASEN.

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.320
Oh, yeah.

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.320
Yeah.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:28.320
Your little netbook.

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.320
Okay.

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320
Cool.

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.320
Okay.

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:32.320
That works.

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.320
Yeah.

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:34.320
A little PC gaming on the way.

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.320
Yeah.

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.320
I remember that from ASEN.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:37.320
Okay.

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:38.320
Very cool.

02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:39.320
What kinds of stuff are you looking forward to seeing when you get here to Sacramento?

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:46.200
At the moment, the main thing is an actual Para Para Para because it's been so fucking

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.960
long since I've seen one.

02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:51.120
Do we have a Para Para in town?

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:52.120
I hope to disappoint.

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.120
I've got one nearby.

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.760
There is one in an arcade close to Jamie's house.

02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.840
Oh, that sunrise thing.

02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:59.040
I haven't been to in forever.

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.040
I haven't been there either.

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:01.040
Yeah.

02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.040
I know what she's talking about.

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.040
Okay.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:04.040
Okay.

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:06.640
Well, I'm hoping we can make your trip fun.

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:11.240
You're a real trooper for taking the long way out here, but you know what?

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:15.040
I've driven cross country, and even though some parts are really boring, it's a beautiful

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.040
experience.

02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:20.080
I think definitely enjoy the time on the way out here.

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080
Definitely.

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080
Definitely.

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:24.680
Well, we will be seeing you soon, Misty.

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:25.680
Take care.

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.880
Be safe, and don't talk to strangers.

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.720
I'll try and ask you.

02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.720
All right.

02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.720
Take care, Misty.

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:33.720
We'll see you tomorrow.

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:37.600
Hey, give me a text when you hit Reno.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:38.880
I was planning on it.

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:39.880
Okay, cool.

02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.880
All right.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:43.240
It sounds like I'll be seeing you either tomorrow night or Tuesday for sure.

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.240
So take care.

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:45.240
Hopefully.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.880
Hopefully tomorrow night compared to your unprotected six video.

02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.880
We shall see.

02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:51.480
I'm pretty sure we can make that happen.

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.480
All right.

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.480
Take care.

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:54.480
All right.

02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:55.480
Later.

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:56.480
All right.

02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.480
Bye.

02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:58.480
You know what, Rob?

02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:00.040
I think tomorrow night we should take Misty to Mungo Chow.

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:01.040
We can probably arrange that.

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.040
That might be fun.

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.040
Yeah.

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:04.040
All right.

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:05.040
All right.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.040
Well, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line for tonight.

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:10.280
Sorry for those folks that didn't get through, but I don't think anyone should be too disappointed

02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:12.200
seeing the names that were popping up.

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:14.200
It's all people that have been on every week.

02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:19.640
So anyhow, but try again next week, guys, and especially sorry for the new folks that

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:21.120
can't get through.

02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:27.040
Unfortunately, I used to be able to see who was calling in, and I tried to rotate it,

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:31.200
but Skype changed it so that you can't, like if multiple people are calling in, only the

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.120
fastest dialer gets through.

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.940
So we just kind of take the calls as they get in.

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:39.800
So if you're a new caller, my biggest advice to you is just keep trying or, you know, write

02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:44.840
an email or a Twitter and do it that way if you haven't learned how to get fast on the

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:45.840
phones yet.

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:46.840
So.

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:47.840
All right.

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.640
Do we have any other last minute stories here tonight?

02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:51.640
No.

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:57.680
Sonic Adventure DX is getting another remake, apparently.

02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.120
Oh, goody.

02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:05.960
This is coming from the Australian Classification Board, has a new listing for Sonic Adventure

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:15.960
DX Director's Cut and suggests that apparently it might be getting ported to new systems

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:22.440
and no word on what it, you know, which ones it's going to be ported to, but I don't know,

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:26.560
speculation's up in the air, but at least it's been classified, so it probably means

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.560
it's coming.

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560
Oh, boy.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:33.960
All right, well, I guess if that's it for last minute stories tonight, it's time to

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.400
go around and get everybody's final thought, because we're getting pretty close to wrapping

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.400
up the show tonight.

02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:41.120
I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but it's just been a slower week.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:44.120
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.020
I wish I really lived in this house.

02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:48.020
My Sim house.

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.020
New Sim house.

02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.460
It's really awesome.

02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:55.580
My final thought is coffee is awesome.

02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:56.580
It is.

02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:58.080
If I had more cream, I'd make you some more.

02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.080
That's all right.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.480
The cup I had earlier was delicious.

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:01.480
Thank you very much.

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.480
Loki, your final thought?

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:07.360
I wish they were still selling Blue Shark DDR pads, but they're not, so that's too bad.

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:08.360
All right.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:10.920
Well, believe it or not, folks, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:11.920
Radio.

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:15.200
As always, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into us and supporting

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:16.200
it.

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:18.440
If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.920
Help us spread the word.

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:24.760
That's really how we succeed is through word of mouth, so that's what we really want is

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.220
just to help us spread the word, because we don't have big advertising dollars or a magazine

02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:34.080
behind us or anything like that, so it really is up to you guys to help spread the word.

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:38.180
But we'll be here to do it all again next week on a, I guess you could say, Penny Arcade

02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:41.420
edition of Orange Launch Radio, where we're hoping we'll at least hear from some of our

02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:43.640
listeners making the trek out to Penny Arcade.

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.480
Sadly, we will not be there this year, but you guys will, and so we want to hear your

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.480
voices next week on Orange Launch Radio.

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:52.960
We'll see you next week at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio.

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.000
Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:24.840
She's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out!

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.120
See you next week!
