14107	19291	Tonight, August 30th, 2009, is yet another novelty controller on the way for the Wii?
19631	22253	Could your local Walmart's arcade soon be expanding?
22633	25195	And we talk about new details on the Rock Band Network.
33908	39272	Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
39352	45616	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
45696	46737	My name is Rob Roberts.
46877	51480	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51940	52200	Hi.
52781	54042	And TechMasterLoki.
55062	55382	Hello.
55603	56463	How are you guys doing tonight?
56843	57084	Good.
57524	57944	I'm full.
58545	59085	Full of what?
59485	59685	Crap.
59745	60046	Crap.
61701	65784	Leftover pasta from Olive Garden because right now the Neverending Pasta Bowl is going on.
66024	67405	Oh damn, we need to go there.
67865	70106	I had whole wheat linguine with Alfredo sauce.
70627	83955	You know, apparently we had some type of unannounced contest that was win a night stay in the vault here at OLR Studios and Misty won it because she's actually on her way right now to hang out with us.
83975	86537	She's not going to be on the show tonight because of the way the whole schedule works.
86557	88338	She doesn't fly so she took a bus.
88398	90179	She's hitting Reno tomorrow.
90379	91701	Yeah, so that's pretty cool.
92041	94364	But I guess she's going to be here and kind of staying in the vault.
94384	98889	But I'm thinking Misty needs to be taken out for the full OLR Olive Garden experience.
99530	100571	We might have to make that happen.
101572	102813	How about... Well, shoot.
102874	103815	I'm trying to think because...
104775	105296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
125057	127578	I'll go ahead and say, because, you know, it's a big deal for me.
128039	131700	My wedding anniversary is on the second, not the second, the Tuesday.
131820	133521	I'm thinking Tuesday is second day.
134362	136022	It's on Tuesday, the first.
136943	140825	Dan and I will have been married for four years, and the entire time I haven't killed him.
141005	141465	Congrats.
141905	142185	Thanks.
142425	142946	On both counts.
144206	147948	We've been together for over 11 years, so, yeah.
149805	149905	Um, no.
174346	177907	Alright, just a quiet night at home with the wife?
178307	178647	I don't know.
178867	179907	At least go out to a nice dinner.
180227	181747	You and the wife like Benihana, right?
181807	186688	Well, usually the family will take me out, then her family will take me out, then she'll take me out.
187628	189449	So I get good dinners all weekend.
190049	191289	Here, I have a present for you.
192069	193649	It's a can of air missing the nozzle.
194669	196790	I could use that because my other can of air is kind of out of air.
197010	197830	Here, take it.
198230	198570	Awesome.
198850	199670	You're missing a nozzle.
200290	201391	I can put the nozzle in there.
201431	202811	You don't really need the nozzle, actually.
202871	203731	No, I know.
204921	208943	Let's go to our chat room because our chat is always up and running.
208963	210183	We love... Wait, wait, wait.
210344	210544	What?
211464	214145	Totally off topic, but since we were talking about food anyways.
214305	214685	Yeah, sure.
215826	219528	So, the wife has been really looking... Sorry, chat room, you've been bumped in favor of food.
219568	222289	But this also ties in with possible birthday ideas.
222309	223930	Okay, fine, fine.
225150	231113	So, my wife's been really interested in watching this new show that's on the Food Network called What Would Brian Boitano Make?
232268	233429	and, you know, I kept hearing about it.
233449	235631	I'm like, oh, it's going to be very underwhelming, you know.
235831	243216	It's, you know, it can't possibly be, you know, first off, there's no way that they're going to use the theme song from, you know, South Park.
243236	244317	There's no way that's going to happen.
244617	245858	And this show is probably just going to suck.
247065	248345	So, it came on today.
248565	260049	Not only did they use the theme song from the South Park episode, which is fucking awesome already, but the episode was a bacon episode, dedicated to all these different party foods using bacon.
260249	262370	And it was just like, sold?
263790	264890	So that show's actually pretty funny.
265150	266431	But he is very flamboyant.
267611	269652	I'm serious, he's very flamboyant.
270052	274173	But you can't go wrong with an episode dedicated to bacon.
274273	275794	I mean, all sorts of awesome stuff.
275814	276574	Bacon muffins.
278618	280219	Bacon corn muffins would be really delicious.
280239	281360	They are bacon corn muffins.
281380	282020	That's what it was.
282300	288244	So I guess in honor of this, the chat rooms name tonight will be Bacon.
288724	290265	So we're going to go to Bacon right now.
290285	291326	I think we should name him Kevin.
292867	293187	Why?
293387	294028	Kevin Bacon.
294801	295782	Your name is Kevin!
321314	327178	BlackWolf, our old buddy who tapes live before us, who's not going to be live next week because he's traveling to PAX.
327278	327698	We're not.
327758	328619	We'll get into that in a minute.
329259	333862	BlackWolf in chat says, she sounds as excited about being married as I am to going to PAX.
334242	338085	Because if you listen to Bobby's show this week, he's kind of like, yeah, yeah, you know, PAX.
338345	344209	No, I'm really excited about being married, but my excitement gets spread out over, you know, 365 slash 356 days, you know, a year.
349492	351215	I'm really happy.
352377	353258	It's kind of hard.
353338	359227	It would be like being excited about my finger.
359587	360428	It's a part of me.
360569	362531	It's a useful part of me, you know?
363564	366787	Guys, I woke up today and I still had all ten fingers.
366927	367467	I'm so excited.
367608	369749	I love this finger.
370470	371611	I love this finger.
371991	373152	This finger loves you.
374433	378737	Some days I wish we were a TV show because I'll just leave it to your imagination which finger I was holding up.
378857	380839	Hey, Rob, I like these two fingers.
381600	386404	Tiger Claw in Kevin says, Good thing Dan knows the date of the anniversary.
386784	388786	If he didn't, there's no telling what Dark Sakura would do.
389707	390067	There you go.
391089	394330	Alright, anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks.
396651	403134	Actdeft follows up the Orange Lounge Foodio on AllSnacksRadio.com right after the Bobby Hot Dog Show.
407616	409997	I almost feel like there ought to be a parody website or something.
410057	410618	Alright, forget it.
411198	414379	Let's go and talk about your gaming week, or I guess your food week if you want.
414419	416120	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
416676	426019	I actually really didn't play that much this week because the skin on my hand is kind of getting really sore.
426700	429020	In that stage of healing where it gets really sore.
429661	435203	So I haven't done a lot of gaming except for playing a little bit of RO, a little bit of...
437244	443168	Sims, lots of that MMO on Gaia just because I was sitting here.
443488	445189	But I started school.
445289	446290	It's my first week of school.
447331	449412	Oh yeah, I played a lot of Peggle.
450092	451373	Played a lot of Peggle before class.
453195	463462	But my gaming weeks in the future are going to be rather dull coming up because the two classes I'm taking are going to be a lot of work and I go back to work in two weeks.
463622	465283	So I'm trying to get ahead of my school work.
466972	469013	I'm being responsible!
469073	470094	No Sims 3 even?
470635	471875	Oh, I need to boot that up right now.
472736	474177	She's not even playing during the show.
474457	475138	I'm surprised.
476058	476839	It's customary.
477919	479000	It was like, what was it?
479541	483523	Whenever a Harry Potter book would come out, I would ignore the show in favor of reading the Harry Potter book.
484404	485004	You know this.
485445	486085	Yeah, I remember.
486165	488807	I've never ignored the show to play games, I'll have you know.
489702	492243	as you were playing Flash games during the show.
492283	497766	I've seen he's been playing Flash games or hacking, downloading torrents while we're trying to broadcast the show.
497906	500747	I wasn't really ignoring the show, by the way.
500947	503028	I was just caught up in my book.
503408	505329	And I do not ignore the show to play Sims.
505569	509191	I am multi-talented and can multitask like a mofo.
509451	509791	Fine.
510691	510912	Rob.
511212	511412	What?
511632	512012	Heart!
512512	513673	Loki, how was your gaming week?
513773	514753	My gaming week was alright.
514773	514793	I...
517864	521985	I played Grand Theft Auto, because I do that every day anyways, so that's a given.
522905	524206	Nothing really interesting happened there.
525106	530908	And played more Earth Defense Force, because I'm slowly getting back into that, because I'm determined to finish the damn game!
531328	535249	It's been like 80 hours already, and it's so damn hard!
536229	537950	But I'm going to finish it, and...
539329	539949	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
561183	562004	Thanks for watching!
573456	577138	And the trial, you know, is all in Japanese, so I couldn't really figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.
577198	580319	But, I don't know, it's a basic rip-off of Zelda.
580479	584001	I mean, like, it looks like they made Zelda kind of Flash-looking.
584081	588403	Don't the games have to go through, like, some type of check where they make sure they're not ripping something else off?
588543	591624	Well, there were TurboGrafx games that were almost complete Zelda rip-offs.
592284	593385	The Newtopia series.
594005	597647	It's different enough to where it's not Zelda, but it's Zelda, okay?
597847	600688	It's seriously a top-down Zelda game, which is all right.
601108	601829	She's got a point, though.
601989	603830	If you ever played Newtopia, it's a lot like Zelda 2.
603970	606192	And there were a lot of games in that era that were kind of like that.
606792	613236	And then speaking of rip-offs of games, there was a Mario Kart rip-off on there as well called Wacky Karts that I tried playing.
613716	616979	And it was less wacky, more bland.
617319	619460	So I played that for a little bit.
619480	621542	It was alright, I guess.
622202	627345	But the one game I did play a demo of that was really awesome and will be coming out in a few weeks here is Wet.
629011	629772	Thank you for watching!
645148	652753	There's one scene that you play in the demo where you're on, like, cars on a freeway, you know, with traffic and everything.
653393	658677	And there's just cars flying through the air and you're jumping from car to car and shooting people in slow motion.
658817	660358	It's just, it's awesome.
660558	662960	It's a real fun action-packed game.
663080	666362	So, one that kind of wasn't really on my radar.
666382	668423	I mean, I like the poster for it.
669444	672266	But now I'm actually thinking about picking it up because it was pretty sweet.
673702	674584	Definitely check out the demo.
674604	676567	It's on live, so check it out.
676827	681754	I think it may be on the PlayStation... I'm not sure if it's on the PlayStation 3 network yet, but it will be soon.
682996	685479	And I think that's it.
685580	686421	That's all I really played.
687978	690240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
714099	714519	DarkSakura.com
739641	740562	Game Launching from Home
766039	772842	This is really the first one I can think of that's really... Well, I know they do it for Resident Evil 5, and I think there's another game at home that they do it for, too.
773183	776344	But this is the first one that's really easy to test because you can do it with demos.
776864	778425	And it just kind of stinks.
778525	779006	I'm sorry.
779066	785509	It's not that... You know, if this is supposed to compete with Xbox Live and launching games out of parties and stuff, no.
786910	788530	It doesn't... It's very, very slow.
788550	788871	You'd fail.
789171	789391	Yeah.
789771	790932	But I did have... You know, I...
792092	793273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
810143	810523	DarkSakura.com
827539	831763	I'll put another tweet out when I'm home, either later tonight or tomorrow, and say, give me your names.
831983	833444	And then you can come visit the OLR club.
833544	834645	I did do a little decorating.
834685	839589	I actually plopped down some of the things that I got in the Namco games.
839829	841391	All the arcade machines are in our club.
841671	843412	And then I was putting messages on the bulletin board.
843452	846575	I'm trying to make it not so plain so that people actually want to visit it.
846895	850698	And then maybe during the show one night or something, we can have it up here in studio somehow.
850718	851279	It'll be kind of fun.
851499	853360	You're being interior virtual decorator.
853761	855542	Well, here's the thing.
855682	862827	I think we here at Orange Launch Radio, over the past seven years, we try to be on top of every new interactive technology.
863467	865889	One of our taglines we say here is where every gamer has a voice.
866249	868431	So when Skype came out, we tried to get on Skype.
868691	870172	When Twitter came out, we tried to get on Twitter.
870452	873014	So now that Home's been out, we're trying to just...
873334	874155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
888971	889311	DarkSakura.com
912415	913156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
931215	932835	Other than that, they didn't play a lot of new games.
933135	934536	I'm still waiting for ION this month.
934596	935456	It's going to be a big game.
936936	938617	My Xbox 360 is still out of commission.
939417	942378	But I got a really interesting email today that I need to follow up on.
942398	945698	Because apparently, OLR has listeners in all sorts of interesting places.
947359	948359	That's what I found out today.
948399	948699	Who knew?
949039	950379	So more on that next week.
950579	952680	But hopefully I'll have an Xbox 360 back very soon.
955322	965361	Going to the chatroom for some comments, Bochikawa in chat says, I checked out home when I got my PS3 and never went back.
966488	968409	It's worth taking a peek.
968429	971590	Again, if you haven't been there in months, you're going to find a lot of really interesting stuff.
971670	973791	I think the Namco Arcade is really cool looking, too.
974071	979773	They have a whole little zone for the Namco Arcade where they have all the different machines set up.
979793	982775	It kind of feels like an old 80s arcade, so it's kind of cute.
984235	988337	I see Loki is pimping out his Loki Arcade Cabinet Fund in chat.
988697	989598	What is this all about, Loki?
989638	990078	Tell us about it.
990318	995500	It's just where people can donate money so I can finance the cabinet because it's expensive.
996849	998311	I see, so it's basically give me money.
998811	1000433	Yes, it's pretty much... PayPal me money.
1000934	1001575	Alright, fair enough.
1002836	1004478	Let's see, also in chat...
1006587	1010948	Ray Iannami says, I'm not sure if I want a PS3 Slim.
1011008	1012249	I mean, $300 for a PS3?
1012289	1015229	Hell yeah, but does it have enough good exclusives?
1015750	1019371	Also, yeah, it has Blu-ray, but I see no point in it because I don't have an HDTV.
1019731	1020191	Good point.
1020251	1023952	I mean, if you don't have an HDTV, Blu-ray doesn't really give you a whole lot.
1024292	1028493	I would say plop down to $300 and get a decent HDTV.
1028513	1029713	They're starting to come down in price.
1030474	1034175	Although, be careful because a lot of these cheap HDTVs only are capable of 720p.
1035515	1039837	You can actually get a good Blu-ray player now for about $100 and something.
1039977	1045599	I think especially in the holiday season this year, you're going to see these HDTVDs and Blu-ray players big time.
1045919	1046600	Price reductions.
1046920	1047880	So keep an eye out for that.
1048741	1050862	Just remember, the longer you wait, the cheaper they'll get.
1051082	1051482	That's right.
1052602	1055044	Alright, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.
1055244	1056745	Oh, there's one other thing I forgot to mention.
1056765	1057306	Yeah, go ahead.
1057386	1060428	It's not really anything I played, but I saw it on the indie games.
1061589	1068253	Definitely check out all the Japanese games, or Japanese named games, because obviously they're from Japanese companies.
1068614	1070815	But they had one on there that was a sequel to Dodgeball.
1071055	1072496	Remember the old NES Dodgeball game?
1072577	1072797	Yes.
1073317	1074137	I saw one of those on DS.
1074157	1075998	We reviewed that as one of the Kunio games, too.
1076178	1078918	Yeah, I saw a copy of that on DS when I was at shopping this week.
1079078	1082839	Yeah, they have something very similar to that on the indie games, and it was pretty cheap.
1083620	1085540	Also, they have some good shmups on there.
1087521	1088461	Just a bunch of stuff.
1088521	1090241	Seriously, the indie games are worth checking out.
1090301	1094842	I mean, there's new stuff coming on there every day, and the rating system works really well now.
1095463	1096823	But, I don't know.
1096923	1100964	For some reason, I'm interested in the Japanese games because there's a lot of interesting stuff on there.
1102372	1102632	All right.
1103833	1106414	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we get into gaming news.
1106974	1107414	Housekeeping.
1107474	1109095	I actually do have something to pimp this week.
1109875	1115438	Our friends at the podcast, The Ultimate Quest, located at ultimatequest.net, invited me on their show this week.
1115458	1117679	They had a little bit of a roundtable talking about MMOs.
1118079	1118919	So check it out.
1118939	1119940	I think it's going to be episode 85.
1120560	1121441	I might be wrong.
1121761	1123301	Check that out, though, at ultimatequest.net.
1123722	1124422	It was a roundtable.
1124442	1126043	It wasn't just me, but...
1126943	1154160	somebody I run into at a lot of the industry shows I go to, Ninja Sista from Electric Sista Hood was on and her co-host Panda was also on the show and I don't remember his online name but I know his name was Wes and he was from the Control Point which is a Team Fortress 2 podcast but it's part of a larger network that unfortunately I forgot the name of but I know they had like a WoW podcast and stuff because he knew his stuff when it came to MMOs so we were talking a little bit about MMOs but it also got into other subjects like I know we were talking about actually Sony Home for a
1156541	1161005	And of course, it's all hosted by Xenocore, who calls into this show once in a while.
1161085	1162446	So check that out.
1163067	1164468	That'll be out this week at some point.
1164528	1166429	It's not there right now, but I'm sure it'll be out during the week.
1167410	1169912	Also, of course, we always want to pimp the ways you can follow us online.
1169952	1171153	We have our Twitter at OLR.
1171514	1173575	We have our Facebook at OL Army.
1173615	1174256	Just search for that.
1174616	1176698	And of course, our Facebook at username Orange Lounge.
1176738	1178559	And we do have a MySpace we check like once a month.
1178579	1179300	Yeah.
1179710	1180650	So be on the lookout for that.
1199758	1200718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1222307	1244293	and of course the arcade is still going to be at $199 and the pro to kind of clear it out dropped down to $249 but once they're gone you know they're gone so I don't know it's always good to drop the prices of those and you know at least not a bad system but I guess if you don't want you know a black system then
1246380	1251103	There's a slight bit of deception in this price drop, though, is that they removed the cables.
1251243	1255226	The HDMI cable, I think, used to come with the Elite.
1255646	1257447	And I think it came with a component, too.
1257628	1258148	I could be wrong.
1258448	1261650	But those component cables, dude, those are like proprietary by Microsoft.
1261850	1263912	I mean, you can get an HDMI cable cheap.
1264412	1273778	But if your TV only has one HDMI port currently occupied by your PS3 like mine does or, you know, what have you, and you want to hook up through component cables, those component cables are like $40.
1275059	1275860	And they took those out.
1276680	1280922	So, they may have dropped the price by $100, but they also dropped the value by $40.
1281582	1285104	But their excuse is that they're offering the same thing that Sony is.
1285224	1290046	And Sony, in all their excuses, no matter what, it's always been just the standard AV cables.
1290446	1292087	And I suppose that's fair.
1292187	1295168	But, I mean, we do need to look at both sides of it.
1295308	1299650	Is that, you know, yeah, the Xbox 360 is dropping in price, but it's not quite what it was.
1299730	1299990	I mean...
1301559	1331151	I think they're both guilty of it look at Sony, oh they dropped the system price oh but they removed backwards compatibility or oh we dropped the system price and now we removed some USB ports or we removed this or that I don't know they're all guilty of it and yeah you can probably find cheap third party cables for a lot less than you know maybe for Playstation 3 but I don't know about Xbox 360 they've got like universal cables I thought they were proprietary on that
1331869	1332129	No.
1332349	1332550	No?
1332930	1333110	No.
1333410	1347940	The HDMI stuff, you can use just a straight HDMI cable, but if you want your audio to go out not over the HDMI and you want it to go out either optical or just stereo RCA, you've got to have their proprietary cable.
1349140	1359507	Technically, you have to have their proprietary cable just because if you were to plug in another AV cable or whatever, it happens to block the HDMI port or something like that.
1359547	1360248	They're a little fat.
1360468	1360608	Hmm.
1362247	1363969	Thanks for watching!
1380253	1383055	Why do you think they waited so long to announce this price drop officially?
1383075	1386857	I mean, we kind of knew this was coming for two weeks based on all the rumors and leaked marketing.
1387198	1390700	I mean, was it timed to compete directly with the PS3 Slim?
1391200	1394503	Probably to take some thunder out of their announcement.
1396044	1397605	You know, it's like, oh, the PlayStation's $299.
1398285	1402048	Well, the Xbox has been $299, and now the better one's $299.
1403569	1407972	So you can basically buy either system with very similar specs.
1409079	1411020	and now it's just the games that kind of decide it.
1411240	1415462	And really, with the games, you know, the 360 has a larger catalog anyways.
1428951	1432113	Also, kind of one thing I want to ask, though, is the PS3 commercial.
1432133	1434335	Have you seen the new Slim TV commercial?
1434355	1434775	Yeah.
1434896	1436096	It's kind of like, it does everything.
1436717	1440980	The guy that was in it, there was the one that was about the price drop or whatever.
1441521	1445223	That guy, I recognize him from another commercial, but I can't think of what it was.
1446264	1448486	But he's been in some other funny commercials like that.
1448626	1450707	But that was pretty little tongue-in-cheek there.
1450968	1454871	He looks like one of those dudes that would be in a movie with Seth Rogen.
1455011	1456472	That's kind of what it looked like to me.
1458103	1464389	But yeah, I like how they're saying, I heard a rumor that it's going to drop to $2.99.
1464429	1466050	What do you have to say about this?
1466671	1467952	I don't know what you're talking about.
1468312	1471235	Yeah, it was kind of funny the way they kind of did that.
1471835	1476539	Because obviously the slim rumor has been around forever, and it only turned out to be true.
1477060	1478661	It was kind of a funny way they did it.
1478781	1481564	Most console rumors end up turning out to be true.
1481824	1484066	I'm sure we'll have more to go into that later.
1485799	1489802	GameGuru in chat says, PS3, it does everything except play PS2 games.
1491823	1493224	But it plays PS1 games just fine.
1493244	1494204	Does it print money?
1495165	1495505	I don't know.
1495565	1504250	I have a real hard time buying the argument of, well, PS3s don't play PS2 games because you can just go get a PS2 to play them on.
1504631	1506192	Well, then why do they play PS1 games?
1507588	1508909	Thanks for watching!
1524381	1527444	No, that was like the Metal Gear Solid 80 gig systems.
1527524	1533210	It was only a limited amount that were playable, but it had one of the two chips that were in there.
1533591	1535192	It just emulated the other chip.
1535973	1541219	So it can't do full emulation, but if they decided, hey, we're going to bring back that one chip again, then yeah, you could do it.
1541819	1545283	But they're not going to because that cuts down the cost of their system.
1547142	1555670	Alright, well let's move on to talking about something Xbox and of course one of the features that's coming to Xbox pretty soon, Twitter and of course Facebook.
1556892	1562257	Also, I guess there was a little like press release that came out about the price cut and there was kind of a little footnote tucked away in it that mentioned that
1562637	1566598	An Xbox Live Gold membership is going to be required for Twitter and Facebook.
1566998	1571680	So apparently it is not going to be something that is going to be included as part of the basic Silver package.
1572220	1586264	But in an interview with Joystick, or I guess maybe a clarification to Joystick, that's with a Q of course, the gaming blog, a Microsoft representative said to them that Facebook and Twitter on Xbox Live will be free to Gold members with a free trial period available for Silver members.
1587597	1592319	I'm not quite understanding what the point of Twitter and Facebook is on Xbox.
1592359	1593660	I think I have to see it in action.
1594080	1600322	But essentially, if it's just me viewing Twitter updates on my Xbox 360, dude, that's just like using the web.
1600502	1603104	And why do I need to pay for gold to have that?
1603164	1603544	It's a little silly.
1603564	1604744	Same reason we have it on our phones.
1604884	1609786	I think that if you've already got gold access, it's really a moot point.
1609906	1613168	But it's not something I would want to use on my Xbox.
1613348	1614328	That's why I have my phone.
1614628	1615849	That's why I have my computer.
1616529	1619051	This just seems like more ammunition for the Sony fanboys.
1619071	1631137	I thought the whole thing with Twitter and Facebook, or at least with Facebook, is that you can upload, well, starting soon with games supporting it, you can upload screen caps of you beating certain levels or getting achievements or something like that.
1631218	1635100	So more crap to spam your Facebook with, basically.
1635400	1636861	Isn't that kind of what the DSi does?
1636881	1638482	You can upload the photos from your DSi?
1638562	1641323	It kind of interacts like a mobile phone does with Facebook.
1641343	1644325	Yeah, but this is going to be a little bit more game-related, though.
1645037	1645577	Everyone with Raptor!
1645617	1646057	I don't care!
1674807	1684535	But yeah, I don't really... I mean, I guess some people are interested or some people think what they're playing is so important that they have to show everybody every little thing that they've done.
1684995	1690139	Like, if I saw something funny happen in a game, then I might put a picture up.
1690199	1692021	Like, when would I put those Blue Dragon pictures up?
1692061	1696224	Like, two months ago when I was up all night bored?
1697145	1698686	Yeah, that's one thing.
1698766	1700428	It's with people who are like, oh, I played this.
1700548	1702629	Oh, I'm uploading every day, every day, every day, every day.
1702970	1703250	Who cares?
1704526	1712109	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'm just really worried that we are going to get nothing but spam tweets and Facebook status of what people are playing.
1712529	1713770	If so, then that will be suck.
1714150	1718491	And you know, I kind of agree because Twitter is already kind of ruined for me as it is.
1719092	1721132	Like, I don't really like to check Twitter.
1721213	1722293	It's too much.
1722873	1724834	I can't... Like...
1726391	1726692	I don't know.
1726712	1731255	I try to use TweetDeck so that there's filters, but even then it will only go so far back.
1731295	1735798	And if I'm only able to check Twitter once a day, I feel like I kind of lose what everybody's up to.
1736158	1738739	I'm really starting to just not like Twitter.
1738880	1740921	I just think it got too big too fast.
1742042	1744583	I think it's Friendster.
1745004	1747765	It's going to go the way of Friendster, where it just starts crapping out too much.
1747785	1748426	I never use Friendster.
1748926	1750267	Yeah, but do you remember Friendster?
1750407	1757409	It was supposed to be Facebook and MySpace, but it started crashing every day, and it was down for weeks at a time, so everybody abandoned it for MySpace.
1757549	1761191	I think I looked at it and went, it was kind of, I like Facebook, really.
1762714	1763374	I do like Facebook.
1763394	1764735	It's easier to ignore shit on Facebook.
1764815	1771196	Yeah, one thing I love about Facebook is that if there is an app that's publishing things that you don't want to see, ignore, and you never see it again.
1771316	1771896	It's great.
1773497	1779198	I just hope with the 360 and the Wii, if it does start publishing those types of updates, you can block those as easily.
1779238	1785040	Because unfortunately, Facebook is turning into Twitter, but it's almost getting worse because of all these quiz updates and things.
1785720	1790521	I may be just as guilty as the next guy, but if you don't check that stuff...
1791851	1797900	Facebook is like Rapid Fire Live Journal is really what it is.
1798576	1813267	Well, I was using Facebook for things, you know, like my family's on Facebook, so I actually more or less, it's how I, I put a little bit more important things there so I can keep in touch with my family.
1813327	1825596	My Twitter is more like, just how I, it's more for networking now in a lot of the circles that I'm in, you know, for, I use it as a communication tool for people who don't text, you know, because it comes to my phone.
1826896	1829818	Honestly, I only use Twitter for the networking aspect of it at this point.
1830658	1833500	I find that most of my personal status updates I'm putting on Facebook.
1834920	1835941	I'm using my live journal again.
1836809	1846074	Yeah, you know, I can't get into the in-depth thoughts on really deal with my day on Twitter and Facebook the way I can on LiveJournal.
1846474	1851917	And I'm kind of sad to see lots of people abandoning LiveJournal for Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff.
1852057	1855258	I've got that permanent account and it was a gift and I'm going to damn well use it.
1855278	1855578	Me too.
1856559	1860261	And people warn me that LiveJournal wouldn't be around forever, but at the same time I say, look...
1861101	1864362	If it were not for LiveJournal, the show probably would not exist.
1864662	1865843	I think it's pretty much a given.
1866903	1869244	I would not have met some of the friends that I have in real life.
1869304	1876367	My current roommate, one of my best friends, and a couple other of my best friends, I would never have met if it wasn't for LiveJournal.
1876727	1880128	I mean, that website has had a profound impact on my life.
1880228	1881829	I would be a different individual.
1882189	1886190	And call me a nerd, call me a dork, whatever you want to call me, for saying that about a website.
1886851	1887151	Fuck you.
1888751	1889772	But it's true.
1890112	1890292	Yeah.
1890552	1890872	DarkSakura,
1911997	1919965	Everyone's going to go to the biggest, baddest, newest thing, but I honestly still think that LiveJournal is remaining a staple for a lot of people.
1920646	1929194	I think Facebook has enough in terms of diverse things to do that it's going to have some staying power.
1930115	1933057	Facebook also has games, which I find interesting.
1934258	1947128	One topic, I think we got into it on Bobby's show a little bit last week, and I can't remember if we got into it on our own show, but I was talking about how Facebook casual games are the future of casual gaming because they're casual MMOs, a lot of these that are coming up.
1947228	1950751	Games like The Mafia, The Mobsters, The Sorority Life, The Farmville.
1950871	1951592	The ones I hate.
1952833	1954974	I like my pet society.
1977853	1978795	I'd play that.
1978855	1984084	It would be interesting if those could somehow come to Xbox 360, but I don't think that's possible, obviously.
1984464	1988631	Eh, maybe that's part of the deal, actually, getting the Facebook on is you get the apps with it.
1989212	1989353	Mm-hmm.
1990919	1995424	Okay, Ranma in chat says, Yeah, but Rob, that's not the big reason why people are leaving LJ.
1995484	1999328	People don't like the new draconian rules and regulations brought in, thus the exodus.
2000129	2003152	The rules on LiveJournal have never once affected me.
2003453	2003853	Same here.
2004013	2005655	I'm blogging about my life.
2007137	2009760	That has never been something impacted by the LiveJournal rules.
2009900	2010200	I think...
2011141	2016323	Sometimes I think, especially live journalers, and boy am I getting off subject, but I don't care tonight.
2017784	2022366	I think live journals, almost more than anyone, want to start drama over everything.
2022946	2026308	And sometimes they're making a big fuss about nothing.
2026368	2030110	Do you remember when they banned all those accounts because they were getting into...
2031477	2031997	and DarkSakura.com
2059741	2066245	I think that some of it they did take out of context, which is really the big thing that you run into anytime you bring in a corporate entity.
2068026	2071508	And a lot of people will just look for reasons to be offended.
2071688	2074189	I mean, you know how I feel about that.
2074930	2086374	But I think that because they do have a legal responsibility to protect, I think that they were justified in their actions.
2086774	2093857	They just needed to learn the difference between a Harry Potter fanfic and what was legitimately bad, naughty stuff.
2094197	2102400	I think that it would have been better if they had taken more time or had better filtering in place.
2103360	2119237	and I do kind of like that now it's like if you're going if you're not logged in and then it'll ask you right up front it will let you look at certain things if you're underage if it suspects you of being underage
2120865	2131992	And I didn't like how everybody was so quick to abandon LiveJournal for other just clones, rip-offs of LiveJournal, which, you know, LiveJournal was always open source, so it was very easy to make the rip-offs of, because it was always about the community.
2132073	2137036	And if the community branches off in all these directions, it's exactly what happened to my old WoW guild.
2137616	2148383	Everybody started abandoning it because everybody wanted to get something else out of the game, and some people went over here, some people went over here, some people went over here, and the game got ruined for everybody because the community was gone.
2149944	2150365	Because...
2151636	2155941	I don't know, maybe I'm going to take some shit for this comment, but some people got a little selfish, and it ruined the community.
2156282	2159426	And I think, in the sense, that's kind of what happened to LiveJournal in some sense.
2159446	2162449	I think a lot of those people that abandoned it for other sites got selfish.
2163971	2166254	But give me shit for that comment if you want.
2166274	2168036	That's how I honestly feel, so too bad.
2171007	2171327	Let's see.
2171767	2175768	But every time I feel like LiveJournal's dying, I just load up, oh no, they didn't.
2176248	2178569	And then I'm always like, oh, okay, there's still tons of people on LiveJournal.
2178869	2182270	We actually have a new member, by the way, to our cast who wants to comment on this.
2185951	2187131	What in the hell is that?
2187331	2187732	Tribble.
2188492	2189472	His name is Angus.
2191853	2195434	Since we don't have the ferret in this studio, I suppose Angus will have to do Angus the Tribble.
2195754	2196354	Angus the Tribble.
2196534	2196754	Nice.
2197947	2199888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2225905	2226526	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2241178	2242758	We're Orange Tangent Radio.
2244499	2258443	At any rate, though, in more Xbox news, on the Amazon German site, there was a listing for 250 gigabyte Xbox 360 Elite that was promptly yanked right after it posts.
2260724	2261764	It was for €297.99.
2268747	2270067	and had two wireless controls.
2270087	2274511	There's a copy of Forza Motorsport 3 which is coming out in October.
2278834	2292704	We know about the price cut so this could be something that they're going to do to produce more money to put in a bit more profit but there's no comment from Microsoft yet.
2294298	2299100	Well, I think like most rumors, this one's going to inevitably prove true as well.
2299381	2318090	Yeah, it's kind of funny, too, because in South Africa, apparently the website xboxgaming.co.za also had another Elite console bundle with also two wireless controllers and a 250 gigabyte hard drive as well.
2319911	2320051	Hmm.
2322745	2326688	Well, you know, I think these are probably inevitable for Christmas.
2326808	2331952	I think, you know, these big bundles that come with lots of games and lots of storage, I think it's the Christmas.
2332073	2333534	It's setting the stage for the holiday season.
2333734	2334294	Sounds good to me.
2335455	2344362	I think it's inevitable you're going to see these larger drives come out, especially what's funny, if those rumors about the PS3 Slim with the 250 gigabytes are true, this is just right on par with that.
2344623	2345103	Exactly.
2345223	2348606	Everybody's, you know, aware of what everyone else is doing, and so why not?
2348806	2349546	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2373311	2378854	And sell it for like $150 and you would make just tons and tons and tons and tons of money.
2379095	2383017	What, just like call it the red light special or something?
2383497	2385318	Just big brick of porn or something.
2385338	2386679	It would just sell like crazy.
2386799	2387780	Big brick of porn.
2387860	2388060	Yes.
2389421	2392262	Well, something that's being offered, well...
2394025	2395787	Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy
2414898	2415718	How about a good game?
2415738	2417179	Infamous is a good game, so is Killzone 2.
2417239	2419380	Yeah, but they've been out for a little bit.
2440169	2442871	That's true, you probably have a lot of people who already own all those games.
2443471	2451336	Well, you know what, they don't have a lot of games coming out that are made by Sony that are brand new, so this is going to have to do for now.
2451776	2453317	Because there's no Uncharted 2 yet.
2454678	2454978	Oh well.
2455859	2458921	Yeah, it's kind of funny though.
2458941	2460382	Why are they letting people get away with that?
2460422	2466906	So people bring in their PS3s and say... Because they have a 30-day return policy or whatever, and they can go... For any reason?
2466926	2467206	Yeah.
2468088	2468868	I guess, yeah.
2468908	2471329	Well, then I guess it sucks to be them for putting up that reason in the first place.
2472329	2473729	They should have a clause in there.
2474089	2477650	Well, it's because probably people are pissed off that they just bought it.
2477710	2479570	They knew that the price drop was coming.
2480150	2491073	I mean, we kind of all knew that the price drop was coming, but essentially they may have known that the price drop was coming, and now that it has, you know, they just sold the console to a guy for $100 more for, you know,
2494312	2499836	Be mad at Sony, or be mad at yourself for not paying more attention to what's going on, because we all knew this was coming for months.
2499896	2500577	I don't know.
2500597	2501277	Be an informed buyer.
2519417	2520578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2543154	2544295	Thanks for watching!
2562117	2568039	So you would be able to imagine yourself kind of throwing this football and then hitting maybe a button to release the ball or something as you're throwing it.
2568499	2569859	That would be the type of controller.
2570339	2574940	And apparently this was patented with the motion and plus as a part of the football, by the way.
2575360	2577001	How many broken TVs are we going to see?
2578021	2578981	That's what I'd be worried about.
2579001	2581862	But apparently there's a big old strap on this football that you put your hand through.
2582182	2583162	I think it's supposed to prevent that.
2583202	2586163	But you know some dumb kid's going to throw this through a TV.
2586463	2589144	But I'm sure they'll have all the safety warnings and all that stuff.
2589844	2590204	It's just...
2591946	2592647	These are dumb.
2593067	2594188	And you know what's sad?
2594728	2598871	Is that the next real idea they come out with is going to be very dumb as well.
2599591	2600392	I mean, come on.
2600732	2602373	The Wii Vitality Sensor.
2603874	2608677	Well, I just want to also say about this football real quick is that it's also supposed to be able to interpret running.
2609017	2612320	I guess it's supposed to notice your body motion and so you can actually detect running.
2612720	2615422	So maybe this is for some type of full-blown...
2616900	2620702	Nintendo-based football game coming out in the near future or next year's Madden.
2620762	2621042	I don't know.
2621062	2621743	That sounds lame.
2621883	2622523	And you know why?
2622623	2627386	Because why do I need to buy another peripheral to do something that I could probably do with the remote by itself anyways?
2628947	2632469	Maybe to kind of match that feel of actually holding the football in your hand.
2632669	2638872	Maybe they should try something else more innovative instead of having to create a new peripheral for every fucking game that comes out.
2639773	2643515	Why don't you create some new peripherals that can be used for more stuff than just like
2644500	2644880	Thanks for watching!
2667711	2668612	I'm totally getting one.
2689858	2691260	Go out to the Fries and Roses.
2691340	2692941	They had shelves and shelves of them.
2692961	2698007	I went down there too and I saw the Rock Revolution bundles and I'm like, I gotta see how much they were.
2698287	2699749	It was $20 on the PS3, right?
2699769	2702351	But still $60 on the Xbox 360, which I thought was weird.
2702812	2704193	Yeah.
2704213	2706356	$20 though for the full drum set.
2706376	2707457	I'm like, nope, still not worth it.
2708989	2709349	90 cents!
2709469	2710470	That's what I'll buy it for.
2710670	2713053	I almost picked up the game, but I still have a broken Xbox 360.
2713173	2718018	You know, it might actually be good to convert into a Drum Mania controller or something like that.
2718879	2719960	Maybe, when it's 90 cents.
2722356	2745927	comments from chat chat.orange.com excuse me Kevin going to Kevin tonight for some comments Bochikawa asks Wii Motion Plus can sense running can't it yeah I would think so I mean isn't that a part of the Wii Remote can sense running EA Active has running in it and Wii Fit has it and you're running in place Frisbee says Nintendo because we spread ourselves too thin
2747188	2748289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2765726	2766447	ZapperShell, Awful
2789383	2790644	I'll take the perfect shot any day.
2791424	2797028	GameGuru in chat says, just watch, this will be included in Super Mario Football and it will sell millions.
2798263	2799904	Yeah, that's what they do.
2799924	2808232	Then I don't want to hear any fucking bitching when they're complaining that they can't figure out why the hardcore gamer doesn't want anything to do with them.
2820582	2821663	Next console cycle.
2822103	2824684	Why do they not want to play our games?
2825104	2829946	It's not like we're focusing only on children's games like we did at the GameCube and then bitched about that too.
2830586	2831426	I mean, I don't know.
2831506	2835688	It's just... I don't think you need to do this stuff.
2835708	2836668	Just make better games.
2836948	2843171	By the way, a comment in chat made me think to remind for our international listeners, when we are talking about football, we're talking about American football.
2843531	2844851	Not football as the rest of the world knows it.
2844872	2845352	As in crap.
2845752	2845932	Yeah.
2846854	2849295	Actdeft in chat says Nintendo, play Mario's dick with new dick peripheral.
2849335	2850236	But that's not family friendly, you see.
2850256	2851056	That's why that wouldn't happen.
2851096	2852297	That's not for the whole family.
2876734	2878175	It is fun for Mario.
2878215	2881117	The Wii Vitality Sensor for old people.
2881257	2882218	That's what they're going to put on it.
2882258	2883179	That's going to be the slogan.
2883379	2885120	In the pack-in game, you're going to die soon.
2888842	2891364	It'll be like that banner ad you always see on the internet.
2891384	2893946	You know, click to find out when you will die.
2894066	2895107	And then you put your mouse over it.
2895147	2896548	It says 666 and all this.
2896668	2897568	Have you ever seen that ad?
2897949	2898089	Nope.
2898109	2899309	I saw it on MySpace once.
2899369	2900130	It just cracked me up.
2900250	2902391	Oh, that's why I don't go to MySpace.
2902452	2904033	Why would somebody click on that, really?
2905069	2905629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2932698	2938820	I want to say once I saw one with OJ Simpson and as she moved the mouse he was wielding a knife and it was so wrong.
2940701	2944822	But really funny and I still remember it to this day which I guess is what advertising is all about.
2944842	2946982	Of course I just don't remember what product it was for.
2948543	2949603	Win a free Xbox.
2949943	2951064	It was for ShamWow.
2951684	2953364	Alright, ShamWow.
2953724	2954144	Let's move on.
2954164	2956065	We've got release dates coming up but first another story.
2957185	2960488	Well, um... There's actually something to be in next week's.
2960708	2963570	Um... Famitsu is a game called Okamiden.
2964591	2971957	Um... Which, um... It actually was, uh... Put out for the Japanese 7-Eleven website.
2972478	2974680	But it is a Capcom trademark.
2975740	2978383	And, um... They mentioned it in 2chan.
2978963	2981545	So, uh... Now everyone's talking about it.
2981605	2984568	And the rumor is that it's a sequel to Okami.
2985809	2985909	Um...
2990141	2997707	What it's looking like is it could either be Okami Gaiden or Okami Densetsu, which would be either Okami Side Story or Okami Legend.
2999769	3000129	Who knows?
3001650	3002871	Well, I'm not surprised.
3002931	3004993	Okami was a pretty critically praised game.
3005013	3008736	I don't know how it did sales-wise, but I think it did okay.
3008976	3012359	Certainly as well as other games that get sequels made of them.
3012679	3017163	But Capcom broke with Clover Studios.
3017423	3018024	SILENT HILL SILENT HILL
3046021	3049844	Yes, well, next week actually got some pretty decent stuff coming out.
3050624	3055527	Starting off with, of course, Guitar Hero 5, which will be coming out on the 1st.
3056248	3059530	And that's going to be on PlayStation 2, PS3, Wii, and 360.
3059610	3068256	Remember, if you buy your copy during the month of September, you will also get a free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen if you remember to register it online by the end of October.
3069679	3077111	Also coming out will be Command & Conquer Red Alert Commander's Challenge on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this week.
3078366	3099842	Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and 360 Although if I remember correctly I think that's actually the week after I think that day is wrong Section 8 on PC and Xbox 360 this week Soul Calibur Broken Destiny on PSP Seven Wonders 2 on DS and Champions Online on PC
3101457	3109466	Also another Xbox, or actually I think this is on both Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine.
3109986	3114691	You can actually build up some of your players for the new NBA game.
3115232	3120638	And Fate Unlimited Codes on PSP, which is a digital download only title.
3121319	3123201	I think those are the big ones for this week.
3125548	3131250	I do need to get my 360 fixed soon because I do want to pick up Guitar Hero 5 just because I like the song list in it.
3131890	3132870	And, you know, what the hell?
3133130	3136451	I may not be the biggest Van Halen fan, but hey, free game?
3136871	3138132	It's kind of hard to ignore, right?
3138392	3138632	Yeah.
3138852	3140212	Oh, I forgot some other ones here.
3140592	3143373	Warriors of Rochi 2 on PSP was coming out as well.
3145934	3146194	That's it.
3147270	3147911	Warriors Orochi 2
3164649	3165169	Thanks for watching!
3187140	3188501	Definitely looks kind of interesting.
3189182	3193745	A game coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week, Sweet Honey Coming is the name of the game.
3194606	3196047	That's C-O-M-I-N-G.
3196707	3201791	And it looks kind of like a date sim game because there's all these girls and practically upskirt shots of some of them.
3201811	3202972	Are you sure that's the
3203012	3205955	And if I remember correctly, I believe I saw an article on this on Kotaku, and they've actually...
3230396	3231017	Warrior's Orochi 2
3256360	3256701	There you go.
3256821	3258324	There's your Japanese release dates for the week.
3258525	3260269	How about a trip to the UK, DarkSakura?
3260936	3267462	Well, what we have coming up on the second is Defense Grid The Awakening, and then a bunch of stuff on the fourth.
3267482	3286358	We have Champions Online, Cursed Mountain, Dissidia Final Fantasy, Guilty Gear 2 Overture, IL2's Stromovic Birds of Prey, Metroid Prime Trilogy, The Humans, and Warriors Orochi 2 on PSP.
3289406	3289947	Thanks for watching!
3306641	3308062	Yeah, it's just going to keep going.
3308262	3310584	Because this year, everybody's afraid of Modern Warfare 2.
3311184	3312005	Why, I don't know.
3312125	3316028	But there's a lot of games that normally come out in November that are coming out early.
3316448	3321472	Like, SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 is coming out at the end of October instead of the middle of November.
3323133	3325174	But a lot of things are actually crammed in there.
3325234	3327076	So, like, especially next week with, like...
3327896	3328937	Dirt 2 Mini Ninjas Rock Band Information
3349454	3376717	Including, you may remember we talked about the Rock Band Network How you can, well first off they're going to have some original content coming to there as well But another update that's supposedly going to be coming soon, I guess this November Is they're going to allow demos of songs that are available on their actual store Which is pretty cool, you get 30 second playable samples that you can check out And um
3378226	3379346	I mean, that's pretty sweet.
3393641	3399225	The Rock Band Network Store will be coming to the PlayStation 3 as well, however not to the Wii.
3418096	3443585	and you know as of right now though the development tools to put songs on the actual Rock Band Network are only available through the XNA program but they are going to pick select songs from that Rock Band Network and actually put them on to the PlayStation 3 so basically the PlayStation 3 will kind of have the greatest hits of the Rock Band Network whereas you know the 360 will still have the bulk of the songs
3444741	3445721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3463621	3471304	Yeah, apparently what's involved with it says, not every song on the Rock Band Network will be available for PlayStation 3 owners.
3471664	3479747	The option to bring over a song to the PS3 version of the store will be offered at Harmonix's discretion, and even then it will be an opt-in.
3481447	3487989	The artists have to do some paperwork to properly port their songs to the PlayStation Network, a process that Harmonix believes no one will refuse.
3488089	3488770	It's more revenue.
3488790	3489670	Yeah.
3491147	3494329	I am so excited, by the way, about Rock Band Beatles, can I just say?
3494609	3495650	I'm so looking forward to this game.
3495690	3497250	Did you see the demo that they had at Fry's?
3497831	3497971	No.
3498111	3498391	Oh, yes.
3498851	3500212	No, I didn't see the demo at Fry's.
3500232	3501353	Yeah, they have the demo at Fry's.
3501373	3501913	Did they really?
3502073	3502553	I missed it.
3503594	3505475	No, I saw some other demos, but not of Rock Band Beatles.
3505515	3507576	I saw a Rock Band demo, but it wasn't the Beatles.
3507596	3508357	There was some kid playing it.
3508577	3508857	Huh.
3509497	3510778	Yeah, they actually had Rock Band Beatles.
3511147	3514549	I don't know why, I'm just really excited about it, even though I'm not a huge Beatles fan.
3515149	3518011	Well, I mean, certainly I respect them and they have a lot of great songs.
3518331	3520833	I wouldn't consider myself a rabid Beatles fan, you know what I mean?
3521333	3523875	I just think this game is going to be so cool.
3524635	3527137	And, you know, what a tribute to...
3528627	3553008	what they're doing over there with this game that it's making a whole new generation I mean obviously I'm a little older than most people that probably listen to this show but I would say a lot of the you know college kids that listen to this show are probably excited about this too what a testament to that that you know Rock Band's making people excited about the freaking Beatles all over again I think it's neat I agree so I'm looking forward to it you know I'm gonna get it oh yeah
3554212	3558135	We should have a rock star party one night and get our Beatles on.
3558155	3558636	It'd be fun.
3558796	3559276	Hell yeah.
3559877	3570326	Anyhow, hey, but if you don't want to play music games, one thing you can do with your 360 or PS3 or soon the Nintendo Wii is this new service called Play On.
3570446	3571607	It's actually already on the 360 and the PS3.
3572828	3575949	But apparently the service is about to be going into beta for the Wii.
3576729	3581430	This service will actually stream both Netflix and Hulu to your Wii.
3582091	3586532	It basically builds a bridge between your computer and your Nintendo Wii.
3587612	3593134	But hey, it's a way to get these services on your television if all you have is a Wii.
3593294	3598855	It is a 14-day free trial, but after that you have to pay $40 if you want to keep the service.
3599515	3601836	Themediamall.com is where you can pick this up.
3602125	3604547	I thought Diversity already did that for free.
3605307	3610911	You know, at least, I'm not sure about the Netflix, but I know, I think you can stream Hulu with, um, Diversity.
3611351	3614013	I had Diversity for a little while, but it was kind of hard to figure out.
3614313	3619837	Like, I use it all the time for our, we watched, um, a Riff Trax movie on that the other day.
3619857	3620197	Did you?
3620217	3621077	Prisoner of Azkaban.
3621258	3621478	Yeah.
3621838	3624620	But, uh, yeah, we use it for streaming movies and pornography all the time.
3624700	3624780	Ha!
3625999	3627479	G4, I think it does Hulu, and then some other stuff.
3627499	3630040	But it's free, so I would try the free solution first if that doesn't work out for you.
3655547	3657168	I haven't checked that out.
3657188	3660371	Granted, I haven't looked at Diversity in a year and a half, so maybe that's why.
3660551	3661631	Yeah, I love it.
3661932	3662572	It works pretty good.
3665294	3668776	Well, I'd be definitely curious to check that out, but of course you can't get that on the Wii.
3669057	3670658	I think it does work on the Wii, actually.
3671058	3671318	Really?
3671338	3673460	It's done through a web interface or something.
3673900	3674560	I thought it did.
3674600	3676642	I could be completely wrong because I don't ever use it on the Wii.
3676662	3677783	But the Wii can't do high def.
3677843	3679624	Does it stream high def if it's available?
3679644	3681225	Well, it can stream high def for standard definition.
3681245	3682286	Have you been watching high def porn?
3684175	3709980	I tend not to download the high def stuff because the file size is larger and it takes a lot longer so no but we have streamed high def movies over on it and it works pretty well of course you know Wi-Fi probably wouldn't work well with high def and definitely not on the Wii alright well we're just about to the end of part A tonight of our show there's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio still to come but of course we can't say goodbye to part A tonight without the classic game of the week
3710834	3711655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3740100	3745482	Tonight's classic game is a little shooter called Robo Aleste.
3746902	3749923	I don't know if anyone else knows this game.
3751143	3758065	But it's, um, it was a Sega CD game, and it's actually, it really is a fun game.
3758566	3761387	It was put out by Tengen in 1992, um, in Japan, 93 in America.
3761447	3762207	So, um,
3769159	3772096	It's like feudal Japan having giant mecha.
3773883	3776324	is pretty much the story of the game.
3777444	3783266	And one of the pilots is fighting against the other feudal lords.
3783526	3790469	And you play someone named Kage, who is one of Nobunaga's robot ninja army.
3791589	3797932	And you're flying the Aleste, which is a big robot with a gun who looks very much like samurai armor.
3800332	3801213	So yeah, pretty...
3802213	3804494	It's kind of a weird storyline, but it's pretty funny.
3804574	3807395	Oh, in Japan, by the way, it was called Denin Aleste.
3808235	3812197	So, it's one of those vertical shooters.
3812257	3819040	You have your enemies coming forward and behind you and to the side, and you have a boss, and yeah, shooter.
3819600	3821621	So, you've got different kind of weapons.
3821681	3825743	You have Reisenha, which is a lightning attack.
3825823	3826223	You have...
3827363	3832985	Husha Shuriken, which is like big stars.
3834646	3843409	The Hiei Meppujin, which is also called the Flying Shadow Formation, so you can have options that fly up in front of you.
3843649	3847790	And the Bakuryu Hosenka, which is Exploding Flower.
3848591	3850271	So it's like little bombs going out.
3850471	3851392	And it's a pretty cool little game.
3851632	3854513	I mean, there's not really much else to say, it's just a shooter.
3855513	3856013	But it's fun.
3856794	3861237	Oh yeah, and by the way, it was developed by Compile, so it's in that family.
3861357	3861698	Awesome.
3863519	3866301	Pretty cool game, what do you think?
3866321	3867882	Um, yeah, it sounds kind of fun.
3867902	3870564	I'm looking at this, it looks like a fun little shooter.
3873486	3875107	It almost looks widescreen to me.
3875147	3876388	I don't know if that's just the way they capture it.
3876428	3880311	No, I guess this is kind of a standard size, but... Kind of interesting.
3880691	3882793	Because obviously they didn't make games on widescreen back then, but...
3883812	3887034	However, they occasionally did make some shooters where you could turn your TV sideways.
3888534	3889355	Why would you do that?
3889395	3890636	Isn't that dangerous for your TV?
3890976	3893037	How do you think about how shooters are built?
3895038	3905603	There's actually quite a number of games that are made with the monitor being in the top of the cabinet and using a mirror.
3906003	3907744	So the game will play reverse.
3908885	3911286	And the mirror will show it right side.
3911346	3912687	I think I've seen one of those before, yeah.
3913649	3919834	But it's done a lot of times for purposes of getting the right kind of screen shape.
3920835	3925039	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Wait, are you saying Feudal Japan didn't have mechas?
3926000	3927941	No, Feudal Japan did not have mechas.
3928302	3930303	It did have giant enemy crabs.
3930323	3932285	Yeah, Frisbee just asked, or giant enemy crabs.
3933106	3933566	You know what?
3933626	3936629	There's a movie I saw that had giant enemy crabs set in Japan.
3938210	3938651	What was that?
3938931	3941333	It's called The House Where Evil Dwells.
3943052	3946795	This was a movie that I had been looking for since I saw it when I was like 6 or 7.
3947976	3951699	And it's one of the early American movies that did Japanese style horror.
3952179	3954621	And it's about these people that moved to Japan.
3955261	3957203	One of them is a writer and he wants inspiration.
3957643	3959925	Except they end up being possessed by ghosts who live in the house.
3960546	3964749	But there's a scene where the daughter gets thrown out of a tree by a giant demon crab.
3964769	3968372	I'm not sure what to think of this.
3968412	3969993	And they make grunting noises at her.
3971963	3973265	Alrighty, whatever you're into.
3973465	3973946	There you go.
3974687	3978592	Alright, Robo Aleste is your classic video game of the week on the Sega CD.
3978813	3980175	And yes, you can get it in English.
3980836	3987785	It is available, so check that out if you're a Sega CD owner and you want to see feudal Japan with giant enemy robots.
3988379	4006574	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, we've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your phone calls, your Twitter topics, and rapid-fire news, as well as we're going to be talking a little bit about Walmart and the possibility about arcades in Walmart's future, beyond just the couple of games you might see in the lobby.
4007175	4011739	We're going to talk about all that when we come back for Part B, so stay tuned here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4018334	4031642	Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, August the 30th of 2009, where we, of course, tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio from 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time till, I don't know, around 9, whenever we feel like quitting.
4032563	4036145	That's the great thing about being on a flexible station like All Games Radio.
4036385	4045431	We don't have a set time limit when we have to finish, but poor Bobby, the show before us, he has to finish by 6 o'clock because that's when we're usually on, but he's flexible, too.
4045951	4063290	and sadly he won't be on next week because he's going to Penny Arcade Expo and hopefully will be calling us next week from Penny Arcade Expo to give us the rundown we are all too poor to go this year actually I'm saving up to go to PAX East I don't know about my wonderful co-hosts but I know that's my goal is to get to Boston next year so we'll see I'm saving up for more pasta
4063995	4064715	I'm not traveling.
4065616	4066236	Not a big traveler?
4066556	4066816	No.
4067356	4070157	Well, I will represent OLR if no one else wants to.
4070617	4072077	But you guys can do a show without me that week.
4072097	4073097	That would be tons of fun, won't it?
4073638	4073958	Sure.
4075238	4079819	Okay, let's get back into some more gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4080199	4080719	Actually, wait, I lied.
4080739	4081840	We're going to start with Twitter topics.
4081860	4083880	We're going to start off Part B with some Twitter topics.
4084380	4087301	And I actually got us a little theme song this week.
4087901	4088321	That's right.
4088601	4090462	A little smooth jazz for your Twitter topics.
4093515	4099601	Starting off, reading some of the responses on Twitter at OLR and things you want us to talk about tonight.
4099981	4105686	Blade3 asks, laptop with fold-out panoramic screens, good for gamers, possibly 3D?
4106146	4106786	I haven't heard of this.
4106907	4108628	You have a laptop now with fold-out monitors?
4109008	4109769	Loki, have you heard of this?
4110349	4111430	Nope, but it sounds cool.
4111791	4115133	It sounds cool, but isn't that kind of expensive?
4115153	4115193	No.
4116214	4117155	It would seem kind of pointless.
4117295	4118616	It would be kind of ridiculous.
4118696	4123280	Now, a PC with panoramic monitors, I can get behind that.
4124861	4126662	Actdeft wants to know... Oh, I'm sorry.
4126682	4127723	That was a plug for our show.
4127763	4128283	Thank you, Actdeft.
4129464	4138871	Sertour wants to know... From what I've been reading, there are certain aspects that are definitely slower.
4139412	4141413	By the way, my Slim will be here Thursday.
4141473	4143835	My first new console since the NES.
4144015	4144836	Game suggestions...
4147192	4152316	Buy some used $20 games or something It's like buying a Commando drop down price
4174676	4182440	Dan Shadow says, OLR, the indie game PB Winterbottom is finally coming to Xbox Live after a great showing at E3 2008.
4182801	4183581	This looks good.
4183981	4185782	I've never heard of this, PB Winterbottom.
4185983	4186423	You heard of this?
4186763	4192406	I think this is actually one of the games that 2K is actually publishing on Xbox Live Arcade.
4192646	4196509	It's an independent game, but they're publishing two games that are going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
4198109	4199770	I haven't heard too much about it, but it looked neat.
4200531	4200651	Hmm.
4202999	4205821	What's on the horizon for PS3?
4205841	4207562	Do we know any other features on the horizon?
4224377	4225737	I don't think they have any press conferences though at PAX.
4250197	4263150	As far as the PlayStation 3 goes, there's supposed to be a lot of stuff for the 3.0 firmware upgrade, like the animated themes and the What's New portion of it.
4265526	4266487	Ray Ayanami says, Oops, I guess I read it anyway.
4266507	4268388	Is that the new one that they've talked about that's supposed to be coming out on Wii?
4268408	4269909	Or is this a whole new Tetris game?
4269929	4270509	No, that's DS and Wii.
4270549	4272190	It was like Tetris Party or something like that.
4272210	4272710	It was different.
4289033	4291154	Unless that's what he's calling Grandmaster for.
4291194	4295417	Hold on, I'm getting a picture right now of what this new little dual screen laptop looks like.
4295917	4298058	Wow, that looks actually kind of crappy.
4300880	4302701	It looks like a bad Photoshop or something.
4302721	4303201	That's awful.
4303661	4306523	Alright, one more tweet from Tigerclaw305.
4306723	4310045	Imagine sitting next to someone on a plane with that watching a movie.
4310665	4313007	God, as if the overweight people weren't bad enough.
4313928	4319005	TigerClaw305 says Piracy protection is why PSP Go's battery isn't removable
4321189	4340205	There's no such thing as not removable Apparently the whole Pandora's battery thing is the reason why the PSP Go is battery, you can't take it off Yeah, but they forget one thing No one's going to buy the PSP Go And if you really want to put homebrew and pirate stuff, you're going to buy PSP 3000 Which is also readily available for less than the PSP Go What if they stop making PSP 3000?
4340845	4342326	They're not going to You think?
4342907	4345329	They'll piss off a lot of people if they do that
4347059	4354303	By the way, there's a comment right here from John Collar, the Sony Computer Entertainment Association, America's president.
4355484	4358506	You won't be able to rip your games and play them on the PSP Go system.
4358546	4359887	The firmware precludes that.
4360147	4363989	There's no external battery, so there's a number of protections put into place on the system.
4364490	4366951	Oh, ho, ho, ho, you're just throwing out another challenge, aren't you?
4366971	4368512	Just stop doing that.
4368552	4371734	They really want to take it apart to get to the battery they can't.
4372375	4376999	Okay, people will take apart their systems to mod it if they really need to.
4377819	4383904	And just saying that you can't do it doesn't mean it's not possible because every single firmware that you've released has been cracked immediately.
4384464	4386126	Alright, that's enough for Twitter topics.
4386666	4390049	If you have more you want to contribute, we'll open up the Skype line a little later in the show.
4390109	4394272	Sorry if we didn't get to your tweet, but we want to get to some rapid fire news.
4394412	4396814	Loki, some quick topics to start us off tonight.
4397110	4398771	Tim Curry makes every game better.
4417260	4425303	Also, in other news, Space Invaders and Bust a Move are headed to the BlackBerry.
4426423	4432386	Mainly, you see a lot of new games coming to the iPhone, but yes, it's nice to see that the BlackBerry is getting some new stuff as well.
4434046	4438708	Both of those are going to be available, I guess, for $4.99 and feature two different control schemes.
4440684	4468222	and then finally, Peggle Nights is coming to Xbox Live Arcade via an expansion for Peggle and of course that will pretty much double the amount of levels that are available in there and will feature three new achievements worth a total of 50 Microsoft points or I guess achievement points, not Microsoft points no word yet on what the expansion is going to cost but it will be coming out sometime this fall
4469793	4470514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4498487	4503068	and it's a monkey, a little monkey instead of a little seahorse or whatever it was in that game.
4503609	4504849	He's much cuter than Seaman.
4505029	4505329	That's right.
4506349	4509990	N Plus is developing a new game called Scrap Metal.
4510110	4512171	I'm sorry, Slick Entertainment made N Plus.
4512291	4516672	They are now making a new game called Scrap Metal that's had a little trailer released this week.
4517273	4523554	It's a top-down racing game and it looks kind of like, if you remember, Super Off-Road, which is like the quintessential pizza parlor game.
4523614	4525375	Yeah, or like Super Sprint or something like that.
4525475	4527536	Rock and Roll Racing is another game that's being compared to.
4527916	4528497	All those games.
4529057	4531398	But of course, a newer type of physics engine.
4531758	4536421	It looks like the track doesn't all show on the screen at once, but it looks pretty cool.
4536861	4537922	It does look really sweet.
4537982	4541363	I bet this game will be a lot of fun to play on Xbox Live Arcade, so keep an eye out for that.
4541804	4544425	And lastly, some of your Rock Band updates this week.
4544465	4549408	Some of the songs that will be coming out to Rock Band this week include The Talking Heads,
4550268	4555933	and she was Cross-Eyed and Painless, Girlfriend is Better, Once in a Lifetime and Take Me to the River.
4556053	4561718	All of those games coming out on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Rock Band this week as well as some individual songs.
4562901	4567625	from Avenged Sevenfold, The Jam, Oasis, and Rage Against the Machine.
4568045	4570928	Gorilla Radio is coming out on Rock Band.
4571268	4574271	Oasis, by the way, a live song coming from them, Supersonic.
4574571	4580136	Apparently you won't be seeing Oasis live anymore as one of them threw a hissy fit as tends to happen.
4580636	4588863	I really like how it was said in an episode of Phineas and Ferb.
4588883	4590625	It was a diva tantrum.
4592290	4593892	You know, I think Perez Hilton said that too.
4595694	4596235	So there you go.
4596835	4598597	That's some of my rapid fire news.
4598717	4599298	DarkSakura.
4600359	4603483	Well, let's move forward with all that other stuff.
4604966	4606187	As soon as my computer catches up.
4606247	4606667	There we go.
4607387	4610649	They changed the date for the release of Scribblenauts in the UK.
4611750	4617474	They said it's actually going to be pushed out until October 9th instead of September 15th.
4617594	4618094	That sucks.
4618954	4621136	Well, we're getting it on September 15th.
4621156	4622837	I know, but I'm being empathetic for them.
4626700	4634566	Also, there is a Star Wars adventure game using the Scum Engine.
4638297	4665346	but it's actually fan made it's called Han Solo Adventures and it's one of the it's an adventure game studio game so it gets the old LucasArts type game but it's supposed to be based off the early life of Han Solo Han Solo, the early years taking Star Wars fanboy wank to a whole new level Mr. Eyeshot first
4667426	4672248	And then other news, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is getting four new characters.
4672768	4676670	Two of them being Tatsunoko characters and two of them being Capcom characters.
4677550	4680592	And it's being announced at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show.
4681872	4682873	So, who knows?
4683413	4687535	Maybe we'll get Joe from Gatchaman.
4687755	4688975	Phoenix Wright, please.
4689255	4690716	Frank West, Frank West, come on.
4692057	4694758	That would actually be a really good one for Western audiences too, I think.
4695899	4696439	Frank West.
4697179	4701380	I love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom except the end boss is a bitch.
4701780	4702861	What if we're getting Kaze?
4703881	4705242	Who knows?
4705562	4706662	Or Puzzle Fighter Dan.
4709423	4710643	They could draw a bunch of red bricks.
4711364	4712924	Alright, let's get back into some long discussions.
4712944	4715065	We have a few topics we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.
4715734	4722537	Alright, well there's a rumor going around that EA is the one responsible for holding back PS3 cross-game chat.
4723237	4742504	And the reason being is that one of their older games, and people are not exactly going to say which one, although I remember reading somewhere that they think it's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apparently doesn't support custom soundtracks, I guess, or something to that effect.
4743064	4744545	What was it, uh...
4745589	4751654	Oh, it was one of the ones I guess that didn't use an in-game cross-media bar or something like that in support.
4751694	4763042	And because I don't know why your old Harry Potter game would be a big game for them still, because of that game, they didn't want the other games making that game look bad or something like that.
4763763	4765104	Yeah, but what's our source on this?
4765244	4768306	I mean, is this coming from a respectable... It's from an insider.
4768927	4771929	Are we talking the Ars Technica mole who's usually pretty believable?
4771949	4772930	No, some other dude.
4773310	4774331	Some dude on a forum?
4775011	4776791	I would have more respect for him if he was called Secret Squirrel.
4776831	4777692	Secret Squirrel.
4778192	4779332	I love Secret Squirrel.
4780432	4784733	Would that be your mole name if you were to spill trade secrets on a web forum, Secret Squirrel?
4784753	4785574	I would be Secret Squirrel.
4785594	4785874	There you go.
4801144	4806128	Yeah, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom tonight asked, so I can't play Dragon Force while I play Harry Potter.
4806248	4806449	Nope.
4807149	4807930	Doesn't sound like it.
4808070	4812234	Apparently, PS3 titles... I don't understand why that would hold up voice chat, though.
4812314	4812714	So what?
4812734	4814596	You don't have the cross-media bar in an old-ass game.
4814616	4821121	Well, it's basically... What it was is custom soundtracks is actually what was the problem holding it back.
4821382	4823924	Apparently, PS3 titles have to be developed with...
4825345	4827167	Thank you for watching!
4844397	4844837	Boohoo.
4844917	4848580	Well, it is something the Xbox has that, you know, the PS3 doesn't have.
4848620	4851943	But I also just don't like to talk to people while I'm trying to play other games.
4851983	4855165	Like, if we're playing a game together, yeah, of course I like to talk to people.
4855185	4857947	Like, 1 vs. 100, yeah, you have to do party chat in those games.
4857987	4858668	It's way more fun.
4859048	4864653	But, you know, if somebody else is playing, or especially if I'm trying to focus on a first-person game, like, I don't...
4865353	4865814	Thanks for watching!
4890458	4890999	I don't own Gears of War 2
4898035	4898655	DJ Max Technica
4925692	4933094	Yes, but apparently the other interesting thing, there's actually a test going on at a Walmart right now in Santa Clarita.
4933815	4936776	It's happening at a Walmart Supercenter store.
4937316	4942838	Apparently, and this is why I wanted to bring this up, DJ Max has been location testing for quite some time.
4942858	4947159	I don't think that's really news, but I think what is news about this is the fact that it's happening at a Walmart.
4947479	4953102	This is being reported by MamaniStyle.com, who really keeps tabs on what's going on with these music-based games.
4953663	4960666	But what's interesting about this is that apparently they're trying to actually kind of move into the arcade business at Walmart.
4961507	4973954	And rumor is going around that if these tests work, that they're expanding some of these arcades in certain locations, that many of the Walmarts everywhere are going to see more floor space dedicated to a dedicated arcade.
4974574	4975875	So I guess the big...
4976559	4978401	Was it the Cabela's Game Hunter games?
4978561	4981184	Deer Hunters and all that.
4981224	4983426	They're not bringing as much money in as they were before?
4983446	4986109	Hey, we did have Jumbo Safari at Walmart for a long time.
4988091	4988432	I don't know.
4988552	4991295	I do see Walmart's arcades and stuff.
4991535	4993036	I think all it really takes is just...
4993874	4995895	replacing the games they have with some better games
5024635	5025476	It'll make a lot of sense.
5025756	5026216	Definitely.
5026356	5030961	And I remember back in the day when they had arcade games, regardless of the source.
5031241	5042072	I remember we used to have like a, was it a FoodMax or like a big warehouse food store that had a Neo Geo multi-game system in there.
5042692	5045735	And I used to love playing Magician's Lord and stuff like that.
5045755	5046276	It was awesome.
5046296	5047237	I have that game in the vault.
5047897	5052860	So, you know, I'm all for more places having arcade games.
5053140	5056602	Hell, there's even 7-Elevens I see now that do not have an arcade game in them.
5056882	5057602	What the hell?
5058543	5060203	That is just blasphemy right there.
5061264	5063185	Lots of 7-Elevens don't have arcade games anymore.
5063445	5064165	I know, what the hell?
5064206	5065466	That was where I used to play Mortal Kombat 2.
5065646	5067047	It wasn't a 7-Eleven, it was a knockoff.
5067087	5068067	It was called Quick Mart.
5068448	5069968	It was a little place in the town I grew up.
5069988	5070449	Street Fighter 2.
5070669	5073890	They actually had Mortal Kombat 2, and when it first came out, they had it.
5074031	5074771	It was awesome.
5075424	5104115	Street Fighter 2 and I remember there was a local diner that had Captain Commando oh we used to play that all the time wouldn't that be weird though if arcades make a comeback thanks to Walmart although I don't think it would be the same type of arcade like if it is a babysitting place at Walmart this is an arcade I want to stay the hell away from but it's going to be weird if they have stuff like DJ Max Technica and like the cool new games people want to play well maybe the whole DJ Max Technica testing at Walmart is to test it's durability
5107087	5110068	That is going to be big resources because you have to bring in people to fix those machines.
5110388	5116850	But then again, something huge like Walmart, you could have a dude that just goes around all the different Walmarts in the area and fixes all the arcade machines.
5117490	5119071	And I'm sure the machines would make decent money.
5119291	5121251	And then he'd shoot himself at the end of the week.
5121712	5126853	You don't have to have the most top-of-the-line games, I'm sure, at a Walmart arcade to be able to make some money.
5127433	5129934	I mean, obviously these Deer Hunter games are making some money.
5130034	5131554	I've seen a dude play in those games.
5132955	5133715	I played one once.
5134727	5138028	I remember there was a Walmart near here that had a DDR solo machine in it.
5138088	5139048	It was like, what the fuck?
5139388	5140169	Yeah, I remember that.
5141249	5141849	What the hell?
5143530	5147751	Alright, so Walmart might possibly be the next resurgence of arcade gaming.
5148111	5151152	And I'm not sure how I feel about that, but to be continued.
5152272	5154593	That makes me feel kind of dirty.
5157007	5158549	I think that's a good word for it.
5158829	5159369	A little dirty.
5159449	5166575	Well, luckily you can get bath soap and all sorts of things to clean yourself off with at Walmart in the bathing aisle.
5168257	5169618	So anyway, moving on with more gaming news.
5174102	5175764	Sonic the Hedgehog, Blue Sphere, Chaos Level
5198362	5200605	Then with Sonic 2, you'll be able to play as Knuckles.
5200865	5203448	And then, of course, you know how it worked with Sonic 3.
5203528	5204969	So it's pretty cool.
5206972	5209655	Wait, so if I have those other games on Xbox Live, I get that?
5209755	5211737	Or does this all come free with Sonic & Knuckles?
5212297	5214900	It comes free with Sonic & Knuckles, the add-on capability.
5214960	5217003	If you had the cartridges, it'd work the same way.
5217984	5220105	But do I have to have the other games downloaded, do you think?
5220645	5225526	You do have to have the other... You have to have Sonic 2 to be able to play Knuckles in Sonic 2.
5225866	5226166	Got it.
5226486	5227866	It's just like owning the cartridges.
5228346	5228627	Got it.
5228707	5230707	Well, I wasn't sure if because... You know, this is different.
5230727	5234848	This is in cartridges now, so I was just kind of wondering if they were coming with the download or what have you.
5235308	5236608	Nah, it's all in GameTap anyway.
5236888	5238709	If I play those games, it's usually where I go to play it.
5240489	5240689	Hmm.
5241189	5241410	Hmm.
5242330	5242690	I don't know.
5243110	5247171	I'm not really interested in purchasing those games, especially since you can just buy the...
5247847	5250471	Yeah, I have the Mega Collection, which I don't know if it has Sonic & Knuckles on it.
5250491	5250912	I can't remember.
5250932	5251433	Probably not.
5251533	5254978	I think it has Sonic & Knuckles, but I don't think it has the add-ons like this does.
5255719	5258864	But I have a feeling this wouldn't work with the Genesis Mega Collection.
5259005	5259706	I just have a feeling.
5259866	5260367	It would not.
5261128	5262190	Maybe I'll just buy the other games.
5262430	5262951	Or buy them again.
5264672	5277660	So, speaking of companies holding back other companies for doing things, I don't know if we touched on this last week about Final Fantasy XIV and the reason why it's not coming to the Xbox 360.
5277720	5282923	Well, apparently Microsoft was holding them back from putting an MMO on there.
5283864	5286606	Well, apparently the same thing is now happening with Champions Online.
5287475	5295790	Apparently, it's just Microsoft doesn't have the framework built in place, or they're just not willing to conform to what they're looking for.
5296712	5297473	Final Fantasy XI?
5297653	5299998	I know they do, but XI's a little different, I think.
5302032	5307977	Well, XI had that whole play online front end, but it was a little awkward on the Xbox 360.
5308217	5309658	Well, I guess it was no different from PlayStation 2.
5310258	5311499	They actually function very similar.
5311539	5318264	You have to just log in through the play online front end first, and the same thing on the PC, and then you can get into the game, but it was always kind of a little weird.
5318665	5331214	Yeah, I guess because Final Fantasy XI was the exception to the rule, I guess, but apparently there's something that they're doing, some sort of red tape that's holding up a bunch of different games from being on there.
5331906	5334768	Do you think this could be a bad misstep by Microsoft?
5334788	5337089	Because PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some MMOs, right?
5337109	5339110	They have the DC Universe coming out, we know that.
5339270	5347655	I think, though, when DC Universe and the agency and stuff like that starts coming out on the PS3, that might put a little bit more pressure on them to get their act together.
5348656	5351778	I am kind of surprised that we haven't really seen a lot of MMOs on 360.
5351818	5357141	There's supposed to be that Marvel one that kind of fell through, so I don't know.
5361770	5387161	but yet they have Final Fantasy XI but I guess I don't know if that front end makes the difference or what because I heard Final Fantasy XIV does not have play online they're doing away with that whole thing which is good play online was crap it was interesting at first but I mean the thing is that it really served no purpose unless you also played Tetra Master which very very very very very few people did play online was originally supposed to be like a front end for I think all these other
5389502	5396908	I think in Japan there might have been one or two others, but there really was nothing anywhere else, and it made it kind of pointless.
5404193	5409440	Final Fantasy XI, I don't have to update anything because it's still the play online viewer or whatever.
5411542	5418170	You wouldn't have it on one console and not have it on the other unless the players were independent of each other, which I don't think is going to happen.
5418551	5419873	I can't see them going that direction.
5421303	5424946	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Play online was a waste of space on my hard drive.
5425327	5425847	It was pretty pretty.
5425867	5427989	And you couldn't really delete it, you know?
5428149	5429510	Yeah, you had to go through the uninstall.
5429530	5431893	You had to put back in the disk just to uninstall the game.
5431953	5434955	And if you tried to delete it, it would kind of screw things up.
5435676	5438398	It was just a nuisance.
5438599	5440901	It was a pure and utter nuisance to deal with.
5441061	5444504	Hopefully they're going to be smarter about it with Final Fantasy XIV, which it sounds like they're going to do.
5444624	5445805	So, hey, cool.
5446025	5446926	In theory, right?
5447306	5447527	Yeah.
5448067	5455452	Well, kind of something interesting came to light this week about the new Rock Band Unplugged demo that's out there and available right now.
5457393	5466139	Apparently, though, the PSP Go is coming with a voucher that you get an exclusive demo of Rock Band Unplugged for the PSP Go.
5466519	5471603	So when you get your PSP Go, you'll get to download this demo for Rock Band Unplugged.
5472103	5475885	But the thing about this demo, it will also play...
5476966	5489255	Downloads from the Rock Band Unplugged store So the demo comes with five songs But if you don't really want to buy the game You don't have to You can just buy the additional songs you want to play
5490504	5494445	and add those to your game and just continue to play Rock Band Unplugged that way.
5494785	5501027	So, are they trying to do that to... See, I don't really get that.
5501047	5504529	That seems in the long run, wouldn't they end up losing some money on it?
5504569	5506789	Well, but they gain the money from the song downloads.
5506849	5507770	So it's weird.
5508070	5508790	It's just weird.
5508970	5510991	You haven't really heard of a game distributed like that.
5511031	5515212	Because the song downloads, I mean, later on if you decide to buy the game, they'll still work with the full game too.
5515492	5515712	Yeah.
5516192	5522554	But I mean, really the only asset then of getting the full game is getting the 40 whatever songs that come with the game.
5523195	5526996	Because apparently the engine itself is going to download all onto your PSP Go.
5529317	5529797	Interesting.
5530057	5531177	That is very interesting.
5532498	5534619	I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.
5535179	5541661	I wonder if we're going to see more demos like that in the future where essentially all the sales are going to be based off of microtransactions, right?
5542661	5542861	Yeah.
5543602	5543762	So...
5545917	5552341	Okay, well, we're going to take a little break here to get to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
5553262	5556124	Every week you guys send us emails and we talk about them here on the program.
5556144	5561727	The lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails and reads them here live on air.
5561827	5564129	Dark Sakura, what do we have in the mailbag this week?
5564529	5567512	We have one from Loomies that says, Yeah, we are totally far away from where all that is going on.
5567532	5570454	We're in the Sacramento region, and most of the fires, unfortunately, are happening in Southern California.
5570474	5571315	It's about seven hours away from us.
5571335	5572296	Yeah, so most of it's far away.
5572316	5573016	So thanks for thinking of us, and...
5590431	5597916	If you really want to do something, though, I know the Red Cross is always looking for donations and things like that, and during these times, they really need that stuff, so think about it.
5598876	5601178	Well, um, next up comes from Rini.
5602158	5611044	Greetings and salutations to the crew, but for once I'd like to extend my admirations to DarkSakura for choosing motherfucking Silphid as the classic game of the week on episode 335.
5611744	5618468	I bought that game completely out of randomness for an amazing $10 new, but that's not the point of this email.
5619629	5625735	While not everyone out there will run out to play Silphid, I would like to share a bizarre yet awesome experience with the game.
5626276	5628138	I had just started another session of the game.
5628618	5630820	Around the second stage or so, the game crashed.
5631501	5636826	The game screen completely went to a dark screen with white text, and it caught me off guard since Silphid never did that before.
5637447	5639029	I didn't bump my Sega CDX.
5639069	5639990	Yes, the rare portable one.
5640090	5640610	I have Windows.
5641651	5644473	Nor was there anything within the vicinity to jolt my console.
5644513	5646654	The game just suddenly glitched itself for no reason.
5647134	5650416	The interesting thing about this whole event is what was on screen.
5650696	5652237	Pyramid Head brandishing its cleaver.
5652317	5652677	Kidding.
5653858	5655639	What was on the screen was an apology.
5655859	5657260	That's right, the game apologized.
5657820	5665805	What makes it even better is that the game was not only able to recover and head back to the title screen, but it also shot off a free continue so I wouldn't lose my progress.
5666505	5675635	Sadly, I've never been able to replicate this, nor do I believe there is a documented instance over the internet, so I guess it's a sad little cherished memory for me to have and love alone.
5676055	5679479	OLR Crew, have you had any experiences with unusual game behavior that stood out for you?
5681661	5685605	Just pushing having to reset the Genesis in that X-Men game.
5686597	5692462	I'm gonna have to fuck around with mine then I'm gonna have to actually see if there's anything about that online anywhere There might be, who knows
5710134	5712856	I've always thought that the game should apologize for me playing it.
5712876	5717378	Well, not Sylphie, but maybe like Driver 3 or something like that.
5717899	5719260	Sorry that we made this game.
5719320	5720881	I know it sucks, but hey.
5720921	5725363	We got apologized to by Blockbuster after renting a game that we brought back an hour later.
5726644	5731147	We rented WCW Thunder and it was so bad.
5731587	5734809	We called Blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back and they said they were sorry.
5735950	5737831	They let us get another game because it sucked that bad.
5738376	5741398	That sucks to have to apologize for something they really didn't do, though.
5741438	5748882	You know, Blockbuster's just the... I understand that that's just good customer service to let you bring the game back and get a new one, but they shouldn't have to apologize for it.
5748902	5749622	They didn't make the game.
5750342	5752864	But I know that's good customer service and blah, blah, blah.
5754665	5755645	Well, moving forward.
5756145	5756345	Yes.
5756826	5757626	From Shook.
5758567	5759207	Hello, OLR.
5759227	5760628	Shook, Shook, gay duke.
5762148	5765551	Hello LLR, first off I want to say there was a typo in my last letter.
5765651	5769153	I meant to say that the K in my name is pronounced as if it were lowercase, not silent.
5769794	5772296	So Shook will suffice from now on.
5772916	5773817	Now on to other things.
5773897	5781323	My bigot dad, you have my permission to call him whatever nasty name you want, finally discovered that I had Final Fantasy X when he saw me in the middle of a battle.
5781623	5784986	Without a word, he ejected the disc, put it in its case, and put it in his safekeep.
5785326	5785866	What a bummer.
5786707	5792832	Luckily, he didn't find Chrono Trigger, which is a very good thing because I will guard that game with my life.
5792892	5793272	No joke.
5793472	5795754	I truly have stumbled upon the best thing I've ever played.
5796255	5799437	And yes, DarkSakura, I did do the ending where you beat it at the beginning.
5799537	5800178	It was awesome.
5800558	5801599	Proceed to bag on my dad.
5802460	5805642	Now that that's over, I have a suggestion.
5805662	5806903	We'll come back at the end of the email.
5806943	5809285	I do want to bag on your dad, but we'll come back to that in a little while.
5809653	5811774	I have a suggestion for the Wii inflatable chair.
5811914	5818258	I bet that there's going to be some kind of fetish porn game that involves that inflatable chair so it's not completely bad.
5818778	5819078	P.S.
5819458	5821179	Can't wait to join the OLR Home Club.
5821219	5823020	My PSN username is MGS654.
5823500	5823921	Don't ask.
5828003	5831825	Your dad needs to... Hold on a minute.
5831845	5835847	I'm trying to kind of cue something up here because I... The Tribble has a comment.
5840540	5841661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5858997	5860019	Now he'll know about it.
5876750	5878472	And he'll get in trouble for what you do.
5879193	5880575	It sounds like that kind of person.
5880695	5884079	All I have to say... Okay, whether you want to replay this or not, I don't care.
5884760	5895152	All I have to say is that he should be thankful that you want to spend your time playing something that takes intelligence, strategy, wit...
5896929	5897969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5915236	5916377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5943857	5947663	That's how kids sometimes get involved in this is when they rebel, they rebel hard.
5948585	5953493	You sound smart enough where that's not going to happen, but your dad should be freaking counting his blessings.
5954654	5955436	That's all I have to say.
5959198	5960859	I can vouch for that from experience.
5961580	5963101	Also one from Deathwishing.
5965482	5970126	Rob, there is a Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet down the street from me in a pizza shop.
5970566	5973789	I really want to use it because, well, they are rare, right?
5974249	5974549	They are?
5975370	5982275	I would totally steal that if stealing was legal, but man, none of my friends will join me because they think fighting games are gay.
5983756	5984897	I don't care for that terminology.
5986627	5989876	Do you know a good fighting game that could turn them on to the genre?
5989916	5992262	PS, don't say Street Fighter, they hate it.
5992804	5993646	Love, Deathwishing.
5996142	5998723	Um, no, I can't think of a game.
5998843	6002784	Honestly, Street Fighter 2 is like the pinnacle of fighting games.
6002884	6005064	If they don't like that, there is nothing you can do.
6005184	6008165	There is just, there's no fighting game that's going to work.
6008225	6016727	I mean, you could try cutesy fighting games, but if Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is too gay, then sorry, but the other games are going to be even worse.
6016807	6017627	Mortal Kombat, maybe.
6019585	6026293	You should all make them play... What was that awful fighting game with the... It was really... Pit Fighter.
6026313	6027054	Make them play Pit Fighter.
6027234	6030358	I have better... Pit Fighter is the worst fighting game I've ever played in my life.
6030378	6031479	Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
6031499	6032340	Here's my suggestion.
6032440	6033001	Get new friends.
6033782	6034603	That's my suggestion.
6036007	6036788	Another email!
6037068	6037788	God, this is long.
6039229	6040810	Hello to DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
6040851	6043593	Thank you for discussing and reading my tweet on the last show.
6043973	6049437	I'm really passionate about Extra Life and what we gamers can do to make a difference, so I'm glad you brought it up during the show.
6049897	6051999	Let me tell you a little bit about Extra Life.
6052239	6056862	Extra Life was started by the folks at SarcasticGamer.com and its founders, Doc Adams.
6057402	6061846	He has done some previous work with fundraisers before, but this has become something important to him.
6062266	6063727	You can read about his inspiration.
6063747	6065008	Well, the link doesn't work.
6068608	6073432	As for my inspiration, I recently put up a story on Sarcastic Gamer pointing out why I've become involved.
6073872	6074432	I'm going to read this.
6075273	6080116	The reason I brought it up to OLR is that you guys have quite a great community.
6080457	6086281	I've been listening to this show since it became a podcast a long, long time ago, and I've since become a huge fan.
6087990	6093734	I now listen to you guys on my iPhone on my drive to work or out on my morning runs.
6094215	6099258	I was happy you got to be part of All Games years ago since I listened to Scott and AGI way back in the day.
6099999	6103521	I never really was part of your forums or anything, but I always loved listening to the show.
6104402	6110146	For Extra Life, you can sign up through the main page at extralife.sarcasticgamer.com and click on the sign up button.
6110667	6114790	It will take you to Texas Children's Hospital website and you can put up a donation page there.
6115550	6116911	This will be a personal donation.
6116931	6118751	Wait, but this is something we do, not the listeners, right?
6118971	6124274	Yeah, unless listeners want to be... Oh, because we have a lot of people that have their own things too?
6124654	6128275	Yeah, I want to make sure that people do know about this.
6131156	6134138	This will be a personal donation page that you can edit and change up quite a bit.
6134438	6139640	But more importantly, you can send out the link to anyone so they can give you online donations through the site.
6139680	6142061	You can also use PayPal for overseas donations as well.
6143812	6148036	Now from there, you can also create a team so other participants can join with you.
6148096	6151399	Anyone else in your community can sign up and join your team as well.
6151500	6152220	We should totally do that.
6152981	6159167	It takes an aggregate total of those that join your team, and you can see how much the OLR team raises overall.
6159327	6161289	Oh, so then don't go make your own page.
6161569	6167735	Let us do it, which we're going to do in the next week here, and then we'll tell you guys what our little link is so we can all raise together.
6167755	6168196	That would be fun.
6170467	6173108	You can even see how much each team member raises as well.
6173528	6174468	That is if you go there.
6174528	6179110	Now, what it is is other people can make their own donation pages, but we can band them together as a team.
6179270	6179550	Okay.
6179850	6180951	And it keeps an aggregate amount.
6181031	6182871	We'll have to go in there and kind of play with it and see what it looks like.
6183311	6191974	He put up his donation page, which is waystogive.texaschildrens.org slash netcommunity slash Alan Ray, A-L-L-E-N-R-E-Y.
6192114	6193095	So if anyone wants to take a look at it.
6194085	6197488	As for the Gamer Day itself, you can do whatever you want.
6197588	6204453	A lot of people will be videotaping and livestreaming their gamer activities, so if you guys and gal want to do it, it'll be cool.
6204613	6206474	I like your theme of obscure fucking vault games.
6206534	6207635	Ha ha ha, it would be awesome.
6209045	6209885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6231417	6232858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6253806	6254926	We'll see what we can do.
6274393	6276776	To continue, what do you think?
6276816	6277576	Sounds fun, right?
6277857	6278497	Actually, yeah, it does.
6278978	6279859	Just think of it this way.
6279919	6282801	This will be the most fun thing you do to raise money for any charity.
6282841	6286165	Some people train for marathons, like me, or ride a bike across the U.S.
6286505	6290529	You'll put out way too many calories and at some point it's going to hurt.
6290589	6291029	Take it from me.
6291069	6292591	I hurt my knee training for my marathon.
6293191	6296614	You will never have more fun raising money and you just have to pick up a game controller.
6297435	6300418	We would love to have you added to the list of gamer sites participating.
6300558	6305322	I also hope you can reach out to other shows on the All Games Network like VGO and Bobby Blackwolf and his shows.
6306283	6310586	Anyways, thank you for mentioning Extra Life and I hope to hear some good news from you all soon.
6310626	6314570	If you have any suggestions, I'm not going to share Twitter on the thing.
6314950	6315691	Thank you for your time.
6316031	6317212	And that's from Alan.
6319178	6320659	Yeah, we're going to do it.
6322100	6324341	That's all going to go down October 17th.
6324941	6329104	We'll have something posted on our website this week as soon as we get everything set up with more details.
6330545	6339890	Just from a technical aspect, I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed with how we're going to make it work because we want to do an hour of pinball incorporated in this as well, hopefully.
6340150	6345554	Rob, my best advice on this, don't waste time overthinking it.
6345674	6346134	It'll be easy.
6346932	6347995	We'll figure it out.
6348075	6349377	We have more than one video camera.
6350019	6352784	We know that Loki has the video capture card and we have a switch box.
6353005	6354027	I have a video camera.
6354367	6356993	We can borrow, hopefully maybe Victoria will lend us hers.
6358032	6358672	and DarkSakura.com.
6382904	6388667	I think the way it's going to work though, we're going to do games from the vault for one hour basically.
6389208	6390589	And I don't know how we're going to pick them.
6390709	6393790	I don't know if we'll have folks donate.
6393991	6398673	But I don't know if there's any way to kind of show like so-and-so donated money so they pick the next game.
6399094	6401115	I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll figure something out.
6401275	6404737	Whoever donates the most money during one game gets to pick the next game.
6404757	6406758	Yeah, maybe we'll do something like that.
6407298	6408759	We're going to have to have a list of games or something.
6408779	6409640	Or gets to pick a system.
6410137	6411297	Yeah, we'll figure something out.
6411317	6413118	We'll work out the details over the next few weeks.
6413258	6419100	Although what I see happening is us having the newer systems hooked up in the front room and the older systems hooked up in the vault.
6420240	6423721	We will have Dreamcastage testify.
6423741	6427262	And we need to get some more of our local friends involved, so we'll put out the call this week as well.
6427282	6428482	So everyone, get off your asses.
6429703	6431123	Last email from Rob-a-ba-ba-ba.
6432535	6439820	In reference to the August 16th podcast, my first PS2 was broken from the start, but in a very odd way that took me two years to notice.
6439920	6442522	In retrospect, I should have kept the old one for the novelty of it all.
6442982	6446444	It played all the games fine, oddly enough, and it never physically failed.
6446464	6449166	There was something wrong with the processor clock or math processing.
6449566	6455470	I'd play around with Ridge Racer 5, watch the playback, and it would get out of sync with the playback about 20 or 30 seconds in.
6455930	6461054	The car was still maneuvering around the proper order, but being out of sync caused it to repeatedly crash into the walls.
6462406	6466668	I honestly thought this was a software problem with Ridge Racer 5 because it looked like a software problem.
6467088	6469910	And finally we got Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec in the US.
6470730	6473171	The replay effect was really bad in GT3.
6473452	6477594	I finally realized that was the strangest hardware problem in a game system ever.
6478194	6482415	But massive hardware failures frequently covered under unofficial extended warranties.
6483255	6489317	For me, starting with the original Game Boy, my first two or three Game Boys had the dead-slash-solid-pixel-raster problem.
6489817	6492938	And Nintendo happily repaired-slash-replaced for free.
6493358	6498399	I'm not certain, but I believe it was because the Game Boy was not rugged enough for typical portable play, i.e.
6498459	6499180	carrying around.
6499620	6503461	I also needed direct sunlight to play, but that was a different issue.
6504901	6507163	Remember the PSP had the problem with the dead pixels in the corner?
6508123	6508523	It was that.
6509344	6518389	Some massive hardware failures have been around at least 20 years, but like you said, flaming forums wasn't a big sport back then.
6518569	6519369	Later, rub-a-ba-ba.
6520910	6521230	That's it.
6523091	6526653	I'm glad that he's just signing it rub-a-ba-ba.
6526913	6527794	Adopting his title.
6528174	6528614	There you go.
6529194	6529955	And for the record...
6532779	6536122	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have some emails you want to send in.
6537003	6545892	But we want to take a minute to get our angst on here in studio because, well, you know, sometimes we just read things on the internet that really tick us off.
6546433	6553440	And when they do make us very upset, we have to do a little segment here that we like to call the FUs of the Week.
6568806	6583741	and let me read a little bit of inspiration for our FUs of the week this week and this comes from a GameStop apparently in Jacksonville, Florida apparently somebody tried to rob this GameStop but it wasn't for money
6584884	6588265	No, he wanted the employee to fill the bag with games.
6588746	6590826	Copies of Madden NFL 10.
6591707	6605132	The robber went into a GameStop on a Monday night, unfortunately the guy's not named, otherwise we'd name him by name, was pretending he wanted a 360, but then whipped out a gun and demanded copies for Madden NFL 10 and any other 360 games that would fit in the bag.
6606832	6607913	Apparently he made off with 23 games.
6607953	6609193	$1,300 is what that's valued at.
6609213	6609794	Two 360s as well.
6609814	6609914	Yikes.
6615211	6618174	F you.
6620015	6630945	My F you goes to, it's sort of a pseudo F you, just because I'm kind of happy about it at the same time.
6632386	6638871	To 250th Anniversary Guinness, F you to being delicious, because I want to go back and drink more of you.
6641053	6641714	A lot more of you.
6642461	6644042	It was very, very freaking good.
6645082	6645482	That's it.
6647383	6647643	Loki.
6648523	6651024	F you to having to go to work tomorrow.
6652664	6653265	It sucks.
6654405	6655745	Well, I just don't want to go to work.
6656406	6657186	I like the weekends.
6660000	6676892	My FU goes to people that can't see the faults in themselves and like to blame other people for things that they did that think they can do no wrong and some folks need to learn to accept responsibility and yeah, need to learn how to take a break.
6678794	6679134	That's it.
6680835	6682116	Let's move on to some more gaming news.
6682176	6684698	Just a couple more and then we're going to get to your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6688753	6715745	well there's something kind of I don't know if this is really super interesting but you know it made it into the gaming Guinness Book of World Records which having thumbed through the Guinness Book of World Records for games pretty much anything can make it in there but Arkham Asylum has now set the record for being the most critically acclaimed superhero game ever so what's that mean it was a superhero game that didn't suck so um
6717645	6722448	But I mean, really, like, what superhero games have been that awesome?
6722488	6726230	I mean, did they say what it took the... Marvel Ultimate Alliance is pretty damn awesome.
6726250	6733394	They're basically saying that it's gotten the highest Metacritic review average, I guess, among all the superhero games.
6733414	6741219	But that's just like, that's almost as bad as saying it's the most critically acclaimed superhero game starring Batman that's ever appeared on the consoles.
6741839	6742940	Who cares?
6744122	6745083	Why is that a record?
6745123	6746263	That's not a record.
6746403	6747724	That's just people's opinions.
6747784	6754507	It's not like, you know... I'm sorry, but this game book is just really kind of...
6756329	6762232	Watering down all the other records, being the tallest person, that's not really much of an achievement, that's just your DNA.
6762332	6766074	But still, that's a physical achievement that you have there.
6766134	6766834	You're that tall.
6767374	6768895	This is just subjective stuff.
6770836	6775999	If we all wanted to get together with all the reviewers and make a game the highest rated game ever, they could easily do that and rig it.
6776999	6779780	It is a little weird that Metacritic is being used by Guinness.
6779920	6781181	That's just weird.
6781561	6782702	I don't know if I like that.
6783422	6784663	And this is just an odd title.
6784963	6790046	Doesn't this reek of like, hi, we're going to pay these guys a lot of money to get this title so we can use it in our marketing?
6790186	6790866	I mean, I don't know.
6791847	6797050	You want to hear something that I just thought of just now that's kind of a little fishy?
6799911	6803133	Batman Arkham Asylum was published by Eidos, which is owned by Warner Games.
6803173	6806435	Warner Games also published a game called Guinness Book of World Records The Game.
6807716	6808076	Gee...
6809534	6812177	Don't have close ties with them, do they?
6812597	6813418	Conflict of interest?
6813478	6813738	Never.
6813999	6814880	Yes, exactly.
6815100	6815881	I didn't even think of that.
6815921	6817282	That's a good little comparison.
6817763	6821326	I just thought of that.
6822728	6828995	Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get to the Skype line, your phone calls, and your opinions on the latest and greatest in gaming news.
6829495	6831157	And what you're going to hear in the background here...
6834099	6835642	Oh yes, you know that old classic song.
6835942	6837845	This is a Guitar Hero 5 ad.
6837885	6839628	This is a new one that's airing on TV.
6841731	6843514	And it features Playboy Bunnies.
6844195	6848142	Yes, ten of them, all rocking out to Guitar Hero wearing no pants.
6848661	6850522	It's like the risky business.
6850662	6851842	Oh yeah, it's kind of like the ads.
6851903	6854204	I like variety.
6854384	6855784	83 bands, all kinds of rock.
6855904	6859026	Buy in September and get the unreleased Guitar Hero Van Halen on the house.
6859646	6868490	That was the thing that caught my eye about the ad is that they're selling that whole Guitar Hero Van Halen thing on the house.
6868910	6869670	Not free.
6869810	6870531	Well, it does say.
6870571	6873152	Look at the little red text at the bottom of the screen, though.
6873172	6875573	It just says, buy one, get one.
6875933	6876814	But it doesn't say free.
6877154	6877494	Uh-huh.
6877834	6880155	Can't stay free, because he'll get sued.
6881595	6882575	Very interesting.
6882615	6883936	That's a very interesting way around it.
6884356	6885896	But yeah, I thought that was interesting.
6885916	6888077	They're working that whole Van Halen giveaway into it.
6888517	6890337	And, you know, whatever.
6890377	6890937	The Hef thing.
6891137	6891998	That's funny.
6892098	6893458	Dude, it's Hef.
6893638	6894798	He's a cultural icon.
6895038	6896539	It's pretty cool they got everybody involved.
6896779	6900780	But really, they really do need to come up with a new ad for...
6903465	6903945	I don't know.
6904005	6910810	I think there'd be plenty of guys that would argue with you that they could do 10 Playboy Playmates running around without pants on all day long and they'll never get old.
6912031	6913292	Next time a trampoline though.
6913312	6913833	How about that?
6916575	6920598	We need Trampoline Hero to come out just for that little ad to come out.
6922239	6923480	Only if we get pantsless rage.
6925270	6926031	I am totally down with that.
6944468	6946730	Hey, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
6946750	6949133	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
6949273	6952676	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
6952977	6957301	Seems like the show's kind of a little short tonight, but there just hasn't been a whole lot of gaming news this week.
6957341	6963187	It's been a little bit slow, and I think it's probably one of the whole fact that a lot of folks are going back to school right now.
6963487	6967772	And so we're kind of at just like a little bit of lull before we're going to get slammed with game releases.
6968052	6978801	Also, they're trying to kind of keep it quiet as far as news goes because we just had Gamescom and BlizzCon, and now they have to save up some announcements for PAX.
6979761	6980202	Makes sense.
6981483	6981683	Yeah.
6982544	6983004	That's true.
6983064	6989189	I guess we are kind of in a lull because probably all the secrets that are yet to be announced are going to be coming through on PAX pretty soon.
6989589	6990490	Hey, let's go to the phones.
6990530	6991090	We have a call.
6991110	6993032	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6993092	6994053	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6994073	6994373	Who's this?
6996055	6998155	Hi, this is Ray Iannami.
6998856	7004517	I got DJ Max Trilogy a few weeks ago.
7004597	7008057	I don't know if I should talk about it since the game is like 8 months old.
7009598	7010678	We're under the radar.
7023208	7028711	Anyways, so DJMAX Trilogy is kind of like the old DJMAX Online or kind of like O2 Jammery.
7030012	7038136	It plays somewhat like Beatmania, but instead of using a proprietor controller, you use the PC keyboard.
7039097	7048642	And there's a bunch of button modes in it, and... But there's one thing I really don't like about it that the other new DJMAX games have, and it's a feature called AutoCorrect.
7050908	7055149	Now, so this is an online game that you can download, kind of like O2 Jam, you said?
7056349	7068512	No, actually, you have to buy the physical copy, and then you have to install it from the DVD ROM inside, but once you get it set up, you don't need to disk it anymore.
7069092	7071433	And it's offline, but there's an online mode.
7071873	7075894	Is this something that you can only import, or is this available in the U.S. ?
7077741	7081125	It's import only, but it has an English language option, though it's really crappy English.
7081165	7081765	Yeah, pretty much.
7081785	7085869	What makes this game good enough to check out for music game fans?
7085889	7087090	Oh, I can get to that later, but anyway...
7102378	7113140	I don't know, I think it's the fact that, like, the DMX Online has been dead for a few years now, so this kind of gives you a chance to play a rhythm game that isn't set to be on the PC again.
7115280	7119061	And there's a feature I wanted to rant about in this game.
7122842	7123942	What's this feature?
7125282	7130383	I'm also correct, where basically if you hit the wrong node, but at the right time, you'll still get credit for it.
7131331	7141916	Like, say you're supposed to hit the J key, but you hit K, you'll still get the full judgment score for it.
7142117	7150901	Well, not only the score, you still get 100%, but you have a little bit of a score penalty, but for me, that's good enough to be okay with the feature.
7151041	7152522	That seems kind of easy.
7152622	7158005	Like, what's to stop somebody from hitting the key the same the whole time, just because your score will be a little bit lower in the end?
7159986	7160246	Yeah, but...
7161247	7167470	It allows you to pass songs that you normally would not be able to pass without this feature.
7167530	7170592	I mean, even Guitar Hero and Rock Band don't have this feature.
7171032	7175935	And moreover, I just unlocked a new key mode.
7177415	7186160	I unlocked a new key mode, and I'm trying to learn it, but when you have this feature turned on, it makes it confusing to learn, because I don't know if I'm hitting the correct keys or not.
7187000	7190102	I'd rather be penalized for hitting the wrong keys, because at least I know...
7190834	7197280	That'll train me to hit the right keys instead of just guessing which keys I'm hitting incorrectly.
7197300	7199622	Alright, well, do you have any other thoughts for us?
7199642	7200223	No, not really.
7200263	7200863	No, not really.
7214119	7217782	Alright, see ya Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?
7244678	7246820	Yeah, a couple things.
7247620	7256246	First off, I just got off of WhatUp.com and I saw a story on there that I think you may be interested in.
7256326	7257106	Go ahead, shoot.
7258387	7264451	I just sent a picture to your profile for you to check it out later on.
7265131	7265972	What is this?
7267153	7273497	Apparently, there's going to be a new Xbox 360 bundle coming out soon.
7274369	7278590	According to this picture, they're calling it the Super Elite.
7278970	7283831	Is this the 250 gigabyte system we talked about earlier in Part A?
7284331	7293074	Actually, I'm not sure what you talked about in Part A. I missed a little bit of the show, so... I just happened to see this on...
7298228	7301510	Well, assuming it's the same deal, what are your thoughts on it?
7301550	7309635	Is this something that's necessary for Microsoft to do, or do you think this is just yet another skew out there in the marketplace to confuse me?
7311837	7314038	Honestly, I don't know.
7314058	7316300	It's kind of a toss-up.
7316420	7318041	If we don't already have a 360 or...
7320037	7325780	Your 360 is basically dead, then maybe you can use it.
7327080	7328021	Otherwise, no.
7329521	7332262	You may be able to make use of the hard drive.
7334663	7335384	What exactly?
7335944	7338345	I kind of pointed this out on the PlayStation 3, too.
7338685	7341006	We keep hearing bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives.
7341406	7343988	But on both the 360 and the PS3, for what?
7345128	7346989	What do we need these huge hard drives for?
7349601	7369675	Well, at least for, you know, with both the systems, they're constantly coming out with arcade games, and, you know, assuming that you buy a lot of the arcade games, you know, for your system, or playing a game like a lot of TV shows, or at least on the
7371924	7380786	Now that sounds more like it, room to buy more movies and spend more money on their store.
7380886	7382346	That I can agree with.
7383206	7384726	Anything else on your mind tonight, Spazinator?
7385947	7398729	Yeah, I don't know if you saw my response to your tweet about informing the club, but yeah, I'd be interested in joining your OLR club,
7399671	7404415	It should be on PSN for the rest of the evening.
7427563	7429063	Alright, have a good one.
7429083	7429723	Later!
7429743	7433164	1877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
7433884	7434724	Loki, what was the rest of this?
7434764	7435845	Buy one, get one half off?
7436265	7451627	Apparently this week we will have the opportunity to get one game and another game for half off at Best Buy and there's a bunch of different games that they're offering that and so you just purchase one of the qualifying games and get another one for 50% off.
7451667	7453028	Alright, let's go to the phones.
7453068	7453948	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7453968	7454268	Who's this?
7456678	7456858	Hi!
7456939	7457079	Hello!
7457099	7462807	That's right, I don't know exactly how far I have to go, but I'm...
7471932	7472812	I'm so sorry.
7474833	7478714	I think you're about 15 hours away.
7480014	7480614	Well, let's see.
7480654	7481755	It's an hour and a half to Reno.
7481775	7482415	I think about another 8.
7483115	7486736	She's probably about, well, considering the bus has to stop everywhere.
7487076	7488777	But I think she's taking the Reno route.
7488897	7489477	Gotcha.
7489737	7491257	Okay.
7491437	7493498	You've got to go through Nevada, which is going to be very boring.
7493738	7495018	Well, how's the trip been so far?
7497479	7500320	Mostly boring, especially once I got out to the mountains.
7500400	7500520	It's
7503031	7508054	Are you occupying your time with any video games?
7508114	7509655	Did you bring a DS or a PSP?
7509735	7510295	Something to play?
7512256	7513717	You've got your what?
7513797	7514217	I'm sorry?
7523154	7523554	Netbook?
7523714	7525335	That computer I took to ASIN?
7525435	7530737	At the moment, the main thing is an actual Far Far Apart because it's been so fucking long since I
7548939	7550582	Do we have a Parapara in town?
7551223	7552986	I think we've got one nearby.
7555835	7557577	Oh, that sunrise thing.
7557697	7559018	I haven't been to in forever.
7559078	7560299	I haven't been there either.
7560519	7561500	I know what she's talking about.
7561580	7562261	Okay, okay.
7562781	7570268	Well, I'm hoping we can make your trip fun, and you're a real trooper for taking the long way out here.
7570348	7571229	But you know what?
7571269	7575092	I've driven cross-country, and even though some parts are really boring, it's a beautiful experience.
7575212	7579516	So I think definitely enjoy the time on the way out here.
7582830	7584451	Well, we will be seeing you soon, Misty.
7584511	7587432	Take care, be safe, and don't talk to strangers.
7589772	7590553	I'll try not to.
7590953	7592013	Alright, take care, Misty.
7592033	7593274	We'll see you tomorrow.
7593634	7595955	Hey, give me a text when you hit Reno.
7597655	7598535	I was planning on it.
7598795	7599216	Okay, cool.
7600016	7603657	Alright, it sounds like I'll be seeing you either tomorrow night or Tuesday for sure, so take care.
7605078	7605978	Hopefully.
7605998	7608579	Hopefully tomorrow night.
7608819	7609579	We shall see.
7609879	7611100	I'm pretty sure we can make that happen.
7611460	7611740	Alright.
7612523	7612863	Take care.
7613804	7614004	Later.
7635450	7637071	Anyhow, but try again next week, guys.
7637751	7640733	And especially sorry for the new folks that can't get through.
7642034	7652741	Unfortunately, I used to be able to see who was calling in, and I'd try to rotate it, but Skype changed it so that you can't – like if multiple people are calling in, only the fastest dialer gets through.
7653081	7654762	So we just kind of take the calls as they get in.
7655062	7661046	So if you're a new caller, my biggest advice to you is just keep trying or write an email or a Twitter message.
7662337	7665300	and do it that way if you haven't learned how to get fast on the phones yet.
7666340	7666621	Alright.
7668042	7669583	Do we have any other last minute stories here tonight?
7672225	7672365	No.
7673886	7677288	Sonic Adventure DX is getting another remake apparently.
7678209	7678749	Oh goody.
7679110	7689637	This is coming from the Australian Classification Board has a new listing for Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut and suggests that apparently
7691886	7692406	Thanks for watching!
7710003	7710323	All right.
7710964	7718131	Well, I guess if that's it for Last Minute Stories tonight, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought because we're getting pretty close to wrapping up the show tonight.
7718191	7720593	I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but it's just been a slower week.
7720993	7722114	DarkSakura, your final thought.
7724236	7727579	I wish I really lived in this house, my sim house.
7727619	7728140	Your sim house.
7728720	7729661	It's really awesome.
7730462	7734706	My final thought is coffee is awesome.
7735566	7736047	It is.
7736408	7737891	If I had more cream, I'd make you some more.
7737951	7738452	That's all right.
7738532	7740355	The cup I had earlier was delicious.
7740375	7740916	Thank you very much.
7741077	7741858	Loki, your final thought.
7742279	7746227	I wish they were still selling Blue Shark DDR pads, but they're not, so that's too bad.
7747543	7747843	All right.
7748264	7751266	Well, believe it or not, folks, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio.
7751326	7755189	Again, as always, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into us and supporting it.
7755530	7757972	If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or two about the show.
7758292	7759373	Help us spread the word.
7759693	7763156	That's really how we succeed is through word of mouth.
7763236	7770762	So that's what we really want is just to help us spread the word because we don't have big advertising dollars or a magazine behind us or anything like that.
7770842	7773545	So it really is up to you guys to help spread the word.
7773945	7783570	But we'll be here to do it all again next week on a, I guess you could say, Penny Arcade edition of Orange Lounge Radio, where we're hoping we'll at least hear from some of our listeners making the trek out to Penny Arcade.
7783650	7789133	Sadly, we will not be there this year, but you guys will, and so we want to hear your voices next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
7789413	7792915	We'll see you next week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio.
7792955	7797077	Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.
