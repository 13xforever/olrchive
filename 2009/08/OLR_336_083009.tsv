0	19720	Tonight, August 30th, 2009, is yet another novelty controller on the way for the Wii.
19720	22160	Could your local Walmart's arcade soon be expanding?
22160	29760	And we talk about new details on the Rock Band Network.
29760	38600	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
38600	39600	Radio.
39600	44840	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
44840	45840	lifestyle.
45840	46840	My name is Rob Roberts.
46840	51080	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely co-hosts, Dark Sakura, Jamie
51080	52080	Summers.
52080	53080	Hi.
53080	54080	And Techmaster Loki.
54080	55080	Hello.
55080	56720	How are you guys doing tonight?
56720	57720	Good.
57720	58720	I'm full.
58720	59720	Full of what?
59720	60720	Oh, crap.
60720	61720	Haha.
61720	66040	Leftover pasta from Olive Garden because right now the Never Ending Pasta Bowl is going on.
66040	67040	Oh, damn.
67040	68040	We need to go there.
68040	70680	I had whole wheat linguine with Alfredo sauce.
70680	76920	You know, apparently, we had some type of unannounced contest that was a win a night
76920	81680	stay in the vault here at OLR Studios and Misty won it because she's actually on her
81680	84080	way right now to hang out with us.
84080	86600	She's not going to be on the show tonight because of the way the whole schedule works.
86600	88520	She doesn't fly, so she took a bus.
88520	89520	That's pretty brave.
89520	90520	She's going to Reno tomorrow.
90520	91520	Yeah.
91520	92520	So that's pretty cool.
92520	95440	But I guess she's going to be here and kind of staying in the vault, but I'm thinking
95440	99560	Misty needs to be taken out for the full OLR Olive Garden experience.
99560	100800	We might have to make that happen.
100800	104820	How about, well, shoot, I'm trying to think because...
104820	105820	How long is she here?
105820	106820	Do we...
106820	107820	I don't remember.
107820	108820	I think she's going back Friday.
108820	109820	Okay.
109820	112240	But it would have to be like Thursday that we do this because Wednesday I have class
112240	113240	until 10.
113240	114240	Okay.
114240	115240	That works.
115240	116240	Yeah.
116240	119460	That's why I've been enlisting aid to help keep her occupied while I'm in school and
119460	120460	whatnot.
120460	123840	And right now we have no idea what to do one of the days, but we'll work it out when she
123840	124840	gets here.
124840	128080	Oh, I'll go ahead and say because it's a big deal for me.
128080	132800	My wedding anniversary is on the second, not the second, Tuesday, I'm thinking Tuesday
132800	134420	is second day.
134420	136960	It's on Tuesday, the first.
136960	140760	Dan and I will have been married for four years and the entire time I haven't killed
140760	141760	him.
141760	142760	Congrats.
142760	143760	Thanks.
143760	144760	On both counts.
144760	152040	We've been together for over 11 years, so yeah, I'm a married woman.
152040	153600	You sound so excited about it.
153600	155600	It's a little pasta, dude.
155600	157120	I might have a little more.
157120	158500	And Loki has a birthday coming up.
158500	162360	You guys may not know, but Loki, Loki's birthday is the easiest to remember.
162360	164200	You will never forget Loki's birthday.
164200	167680	September 11th is Loki's birthday, so it's very easy to remember.
167680	171760	So any plans for how to celebrate your birthday this year, Loki?
171760	172760	No.
172760	173760	All right.
173760	178080	Just a quiet home, a night at home with the wife?
178080	179080	I don't know.
179080	180080	At least go out to a nice dinner.
180080	181840	You and the wife like Betty Hunter, right?
181840	185760	Well, usually like the family will take me out and then her family will take me out and
185760	187680	she'll take me out.
187680	189640	So I get good dinners all weekend.
189640	191560	Here, I have a present for you.
191560	194600	It's a can of air missing the nozzle.
194600	197400	I could use that because my other can of air is kind of out of air.
197400	198400	Here, take it.
198400	199400	Awesome.
199400	200400	We're missing a nozzle.
200400	201440	I can put the nozzle in there.
201440	205000	You don't really need the nozzle actually.
205000	209000	Let's go to our chat room because our chat is always up and running.
209000	210000	We love...
210000	211000	Wait, wait, wait.
211000	212000	What?
212000	214680	Totally off topic, but since we were talking about food anyways.
214680	215880	Yeah, sure.
215880	217760	So the wife has been really looking...
217760	218760	Sorry, chat room.
218760	219920	You've been bumped in favor of food.
219920	225200	This also ties in with possible birthday ideas.
225200	229600	So my wife's been really interested in watching this new show that's on the Food Network called
229600	232680	What Would Brian Boitano Make?
232680	233680	I kept hearing about it.
233680	236840	I'm like, it's going to be very underwhelming.
236840	239600	It can't possibly be...
239600	243320	First off, there's no way that they're going to use the theme song from South Park.
243320	244320	There's no way that's going to happen.
244320	247080	And the show is probably just going to suck.
247080	248680	So it came on today.
248680	253360	Not only did they use the theme song from the South Park episode, which is fucking awesome
253360	259200	already, but the episode was a bacon episode dedicated to all these different party foods
259200	260280	using bacon.
260280	263800	And it was just like sold.
263800	267000	So that show is actually pretty funny, but he is very flamboyant.
267000	268400	I'm serious.
268400	270100	He's very flamboyant.
270100	274200	But you can't go wrong with an episode dedicated to bacon.
274200	276000	I mean, all sorts of awesome stuff.
276000	278800	Bacon muffins.
278800	280000	Bacon corn muffins would be really delicious.
280000	281460	They are bacon corn muffins.
281460	282460	That's what it was.
282460	285640	So I guess in honor of this, the chat rooms tonight will...
285640	288740	Their chat rooms name tonight will be bacon.
288740	290320	So we're going to go to bacon right now.
290320	291320	I think we should name them Kevin.
291320	292320	Why?
292320	293320	Kevin Bacon.
293320	294320	Your name is Kevin.
294320	295320	Fine.
295320	301640	We will go to Kevin at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and read some of the comments.
301640	305160	Dark Tetsuya says, Orange Lounge Fudio only on allsnacksradio.com.
305160	306920	There you go.
306920	311000	Because obviously we broadcast live every week at six o'clock Pacific Standard Time,
311000	314040	nine o'clock Eastern at allgamesradio.com.
314040	315840	But all snacks radio.
315840	318720	If that isn't up and running, somebody should register that.
318720	320960	Let's see what else Kevin has to say tonight.
320960	326080	Black Wolf, our old buddy who tapes live before us, who's not going to be live next week because
326080	327360	he's traveling to PAX.
327360	328360	We're not.
328360	329360	We'll get into that in a minute.
329360	333960	Black Wolf in chat says, She sounds as excited about being married as I am to going to PAX.
333960	337880	Because if you listen to Bobby's show this week, he's kind of like, yeah, yeah, you know,
337880	338880	PAX.
338880	340580	No, I'm really excited about being married.
340580	349400	But my excitement gets spread out over, you know, 365 slash 356 days, you know, a year.
349400	353340	I'm really happy to it's, it's kind of hard.
353340	359140	It would be like being excited about my finger.
359140	360620	It's a, it's a part of me.
360620	362260	It's a useful part of me.
362260	366840	You know, guys, I woke up today and I still had all 10 fingers.
366840	367840	I'm so excited.
367840	374480	I love this finger, I love this finger, this finger loves you.
374480	377120	Some days I wish we were a TV show because I'll just leave it to your imagination which
377120	378360	finger I was holding up.
378360	379360	All right.
379360	381600	Hey Rob, I like these two fingers.
381600	386760	Tiger Claw in Kevin says, Good thing Dan knows the date, Dan knows the date of the anniversary.
386760	389120	If he didn't, there's no telling what Dark Sakura would do.
389120	390640	There you go.
390640	391880	All right.
391880	396640	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks.
396640	401760	Jack Defs follows up the Orange Lounge Foodie on AllSnacksRadio.com with the right after
401760	407480	the Bobby hot dog show.
407480	410000	I almost feel like there ought to be a parody website or something.
410000	411240	All right, forget it.
411240	414480	Let's go and talk about your gaming week or I guess your food week if you want.
414480	416500	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
416500	424220	I actually really didn't play that much this week because my, the skin on my hand is kind
424220	429640	of getting really sore in that stage of healing where it gets really sore.
429640	434760	So I haven't done a lot of gaming except for playing some, a little bit of RO, a little
434760	443280	bit of Sims, lots of that MMO on Gaia just, you know, because I was sitting here.
443280	447160	But I went to, I started school, it's my first week of school.
447160	453280	So really, oh yeah, I played a lot of Peggle, played a lot of Peggle before class.
453280	460360	But my gaming weeks in the future are going to be rather dull coming up because the two
460360	463600	classes I'm taking are going to be a lot of work and I go back to work in two weeks.
463600	465760	So I'm trying to get ahead of my schoolwork.
465760	467800	I'm being responsible.
467800	470040	Busy, but no Sims 3 even?
470040	472800	Oh, I need to boot that up right now.
472800	474320	She's not even playing during the show.
474320	475320	I'm surprised.
475320	476320	She's breaking her street chair.
476320	477320	It's customary.
477320	479560	You know, it was like, what was it?
479560	482600	Whenever Harry Potter book would come out, I would ignore the show in favor of reading
482600	484400	the Harry Potter book.
484400	485400	You know this.
485400	486400	Yeah, I remember.
486400	489680	I've never ignored the show to play games, I'll have you know.
489680	491840	As you were playing Flash games during the show.
491840	496000	I've seen he's been playing Flash games or hacking, downloading torrents while we're
496000	497720	trying to progress the show.
497720	500760	I wasn't really ignoring the show, by the way.
500760	503400	I was just caught up in my book.
503400	505320	And I do not ignore the show to play Sims.
505320	509320	I am multi-talented and can multitask like a mofo.
509320	510320	Fine.
510320	511320	Rob.
511320	512320	What?
512320	513320	Low key.
513320	514320	How was your gaming week?
514320	515480	My gaming week was alright.
515480	520600	I played Grand Theft Auto because I do that every day anyways.
520600	522880	So that's a given.
522880	525280	Nothing really interesting happened there.
525280	528680	And played more Earth Defense Force because I'm slowly getting back into that because
528680	531420	I'm determined to finish the damn game.
531420	536320	It's been like 80 hours already and it's so damn hard.
536320	537940	But I'm going to finish it.
537940	540640	And so I'm going to play more of that.
540640	546640	And then I decided to once again try to broaden my horizon of video games I've been playing
546640	552420	by testing out more indie games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Service.
552420	557960	So I tried this week some Japanese game, which I don't even know what the name is because
557960	561680	it was all in Katakana and I can't read Katakana.
561680	563600	But apparently it's a ripoff of Zelda.
563600	566200	Like extremely a ripoff of Zelda.
566200	567380	It was fun.
567380	569000	But the music was kind of blaring.
569000	573520	I could not get it to sound right on my headphones that I had.
573520	576840	And the trial was all in Japanese so I couldn't really figure out what I'm supposed to be
576840	577840	doing.
577840	578840	But I don't know.
578840	581120	It's a basic ripoff of Zelda.
581120	584260	It looks like they made Zelda kind of flash looking.
584260	587280	Don't the games have to go through some type of check where they make sure they're not
587280	589080	ripping something else off?
589080	592280	There were TurboGrafx games that were almost complete Zelda ripoffs.
592280	594080	The Newtopia series.
594080	596680	It's different enough to where it's not Zelda.
596680	598160	But it's Zelda, okay?
598160	600200	It's seriously a top-down Zelda game.
600200	601200	Which is alright.
601200	602200	And then she's got a point though.
602200	604800	If you've ever played Newtopia, it's a lot like Zelda II and there were a lot of games
604800	606840	in that era that were kind of like that.
606840	611480	And then speaking of ripoffs of games, there was a Mario Kart ripoff on there as well called
611480	613760	Wacky Karts that I tried playing.
613760	617360	And it was less wacky, more bland.
617360	622240	So I played that for a little bit and it was alright I guess.
622240	626200	But the one game I did play a demo of that was really awesome and will be coming out
626200	629080	in a few weeks here is Wet.
629080	631160	That game is like kill build the game.
631160	635320	It's basically very much a grindhouse feel to it.
635320	637620	Lots of punk music in there.
637620	638620	Lots of killing.
638620	641680	It's like the way Stranglehold should have been.
641680	645280	Lots of flying through the air, shooting stuff.
645280	652080	There's one scene that you play in the demo where you're on cars on a freeway with traffic
652080	653560	and everything.
653560	657600	And there's just cars flying through the air and you're jumping from car to car and shooting
657600	659920	people in slow motion.
659920	660920	It's awesome.
660920	664240	It's a real fun action-packed game.
664240	667280	One that kind of wasn't really on my radar.
667280	672000	I liked the poster for it, but now I'm actually thinking about picking it up because it was
672000	673000	pretty sweet.
673000	674680	But yeah, definitely check out the demo.
674680	676720	It's on live, so check it out.
676720	680520	I think it might be on the Playstation 3 network yet.
680520	684840	But it will be soon.
684840	685840	And I think that's it.
685840	687840	That's all I really played.
687840	689920	I didn't play a lot of new games this week.
689920	691360	I actually played Home.
691360	692360	I know.
692360	693360	Weird, right?
693360	694360	I don't know why.
694360	695920	I just kind of was just checking out what's new in Home.
695920	699560	Actually, I know what possessed me to do it is that I was playing the Namco Arcade Collection
699560	700680	again, trying to unlock some new stuff.
700680	705320	Here's the really weird thing about the Namco Arcade Essentials on Playstation 3 is that
705320	710800	if you want everything, you actually have to download and play the demo as well.
710800	714140	Because the demo has completely different unlocks than the regular game.
714140	718320	In fact, you unlock more Home stuff in the demo than you do the regular game, which is
718320	719440	really weird.
719440	724200	So if you download the demo, you can get like, I got a Dig Dug shirt that has a, what were
724200	725200	the fat guys called?
725200	726200	The Pookas?
726200	727600	I have a shirt that has a Pooka on it.
727600	731360	And you can actually unlock the machines for your house, which I thought was kind of cool.
731360	735920	So I have like a, I have a Dig Dug and a Pac-Man and a Galaga machine all in my house now.
735920	739200	And you can obviously launch the games from Home.
739200	742340	I think the game launching from Home right now is ridiculous though.
742340	747420	It takes forever to get into the game, and even worse, to get out of the game.
747420	751600	Takes forever, because once you come out of the game, then it has to reload Home, then
751600	754800	it reconnects to the network, then it reloads the room you're in.
754800	759000	I mean, it just, they need to find a way to make that faster, somehow using, like caching
759000	760080	the data better.
760080	763560	I don't know what they've got to do, but it's a little bit, you know, considering how much
763560	767800	they talk about game launching from Home, this is really the first one I can think of
767800	771520	that's really, well, I know they do it for Resident Evil 5, and I think there's another
771520	774920	game in Home that they do it for too, but this is the first one that's really easy to
774920	776880	test because you can do it with demos.
776880	779080	And it just kind of stinks, I'm sorry.
779080	783180	It's not that, you know, if this is supposed to compete with Xbox Live and launching games
783180	786880	out of parties and stuff, no.
786880	788560	It doesn't, it's very, very slow.
788560	789560	You fail.
789560	795040	But, I did have, you know, I finally decided to plop down the $5 and get an Orange Lounge
795040	796040	Radio Clubhouse.
796040	797120	I mean, what the hell, right?
797120	798400	I was kind of curious.
798400	800240	It's five bucks, whatever.
800240	803120	I was pretty good with my money this week, so I figured, what the hell, I'll get one
803120	804120	of the Orange Lounge Radio Clubhouses.
804120	808280	So, I've kind of been playing with that, and what is cool is that the Clubhouses are a
808280	813400	new type of room that you don't see outside of a Clubhouse, so I did decorate it a little
813400	814400	bit.
814400	815800	So, now I have to invite people to the Club.
815800	817200	I put a call out on Twitter.
817200	821360	I did see some responses, but I just haven't been back to home to invite people.
821360	825000	And I don't think anybody gave me, when they said, oh, add me to the Club, they didn't
825000	827280	give me their PlayStation names.
827280	831320	So I'll put another tweet out when I'm home, either later tonight or tomorrow, and say,
831320	833440	give me your names, and then you can come visit the OLR Club.
833440	834520	I did do a little decorating.
834520	839960	I actually plopped down some of the things that I got in the Namco games, like all the
839960	843440	arcade machines are in our Club, and then I was putting messages on the bulletin board.
843440	846540	I'm trying to make it not so plain, so that people will, like, actually want to visit
846540	847540	it.
847540	849840	And then, like, maybe during the show one night or something, we can have it up here
849840	851600	in studio somehow and be kind of fun.
851600	853520	You're being interior virtual decorator.
853520	857320	Well, here's the thing, is that, you know, I think we here at Orange Launch Radio, you
857320	862960	know, over the past seven years, we try to be on top of every new interactive technology.
862960	866280	You know, one of our taglines we say here is where every gamer has a voice.
866280	868740	So when Skype came out, we tried to get on Skype.
868740	870480	When Twitter came out, we tried to get on Twitter.
870480	874320	So you know, now that home's been out, you know, we're trying to just use that as well.
874320	878160	It's just another way to interact with the show, so I figured, what the hell, it's only
878160	883240	five bucks and the monthly fees aren't going to start until at least 2010, so we'll see.
883240	886480	And home has been making improvements a little bit.
886480	891680	It's still kind of, I don't know, but what I do like about it is that, you know, they
891680	893560	are still adding a lot of stuff to explore.
893560	897960	Like, if you haven't visited home in three months, seriously, if you go back now, you're
897960	901520	going to be like, what the hell, there's like 60 different zones to visit now.
901520	904440	I mean, there's a lot of stuff to check out.
904440	907000	I just kind of wish they could make it a little faster.
907000	910360	It does still feel a little clunky moving around home.
910360	912480	That's the one problem I have with it still.
912480	916180	Otherwise, I played the Arkham Asylum demo for a little bit, because obviously the internet's
916180	918240	been all abuzz about Arkham Asylum.
918240	920200	You know, it was a trending topic on Twitter this week.
920200	922360	I haven't really heard a lot of bad things about it yet.
922360	923480	I only played the demo.
923480	926620	I don't want to review a game based off the demo.
926620	928120	I liked what I saw so far.
928120	931360	I haven't plopped down the money for the regular game, but maybe soon.
931360	933040	Other than that, they didn't play a lot of new games.
933040	934480	I'm still waiting for Ion this month.
934480	940000	It's going to be a big game, and my Xbox 360 is still out of commission, but I got a really
940000	944400	interesting email today that I need to follow up on, because apparently, OLR has listeners
944400	947480	in all sorts of interesting places.
947480	948480	That's what I found out today.
948480	949480	Who knew?
949480	955480	So, more on that next week, but hopefully I'll have an Xbox 360 back very soon.
955480	957440	Going to chat rooms and comment.
957440	960400	Going to the chat room for some comments.
960400	961400	Let's see.
961400	966560	Bochikawa in chat says, I checked out home when I got my PS3 and never went back.
966560	967760	It's worth taking a peek.
967760	970640	You know, again, if you haven't been there in months, you're going to find a lot of really
970640	971640	interesting stuff.
971640	973760	Like, I think the Namco arcade is really cool looking too.
973760	977600	They have a whole little zone for the Namco arcade, where they have all the different
977600	984040	machines set up, and it kind of feels like an old 80s arcade, so it's kind of cute.
984040	988760	I see Loki is pimping out his Loki arcade cabinet fund in chat.
988760	989760	What is this all about, Loki?
989760	990760	Tell us about it.
990760	996760	It's just where people can donate money so I can finance the cabinet, because it's expensive.
996760	997760	I see.
997760	998760	So it's like, give me money.
998760	999760	Yes, it's pretty much.
999760	1000760	PayPal me money.
1000760	1002960	Alright, fair enough.
1002960	1003960	Let's see.
1003960	1010960	Also in chat, Ray Iannami says, I'm not sure if I want a PS3 Slim.
1010960	1012920	I mean, $300 for a PS3?
1012920	1015360	Hell yeah, but does it have enough good exclusives?
1015360	1019720	Also, yeah, it has Blu-ray, but I see no point in it because I don't have an HDTV.
1019720	1020720	Good point.
1020720	1024320	I mean, if you don't have an HDTV, Blu-ray doesn't really give you a whole lot, but I
1024320	1028560	would say plop down the $300 and get a decent HDTV.
1028560	1033280	They're starting to come down in price, although be careful because a lot of these cheap HDTVs
1033280	1034600	only are capable of 720p.
1034600	1038600	You can actually get a good Blu-ray player now for about $100 instead then.
1038600	1042680	Yeah, they're coming down, and I think especially in the holiday season this year, you're going
1042680	1047560	to see these HDTVDs and Blu-ray players big time price reductions, so keep an eye out
1047560	1048560	for that.
1048560	1051200	Just remember, the longer you wait, the cheaper they'll get.
1051200	1052200	That's right.
1052200	1055120	All right, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.
1055120	1056800	Oh, there's one other thing I forgot to mention.
1056800	1057800	Yeah, go ahead.
1057800	1061840	It's not really anything I played, but I saw it on the indie games.
1061840	1067800	Definitely check out all the Japanese named games because obviously they're from Japanese
1067800	1070720	companies, but they had one on there that was a sequel to Dodgeball.
1070720	1072760	Remember the old NES Dodgeball game?
1072760	1073760	Yes.
1073760	1074760	I saw one of those on the DS.
1074760	1076120	We reviewed that as one of the Kunio games too.
1076120	1077120	Yeah.
1077120	1078880	I saw a copy of that on DS when I was at shopping this week.
1078880	1082440	Yeah, they have something very similar to that on the indie games, and it was pretty
1082440	1083440	cheap.
1083440	1087640	Also, they have some good shmups on there.
1087640	1088640	Just a bunch of stuff.
1088640	1090200	Seriously, the indie games are worth checking out.
1090200	1094360	I mean, there's new stuff coming on there every day, and the rating system works really
1094360	1096960	well now, but I don't know.
1096960	1100320	For some reason, I'm interested in the Japanese games because there's a lot of interesting
1100320	1101800	stuff on there.
1101800	1103960	All right.
1103960	1107080	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we get into gaming news.
1107080	1109880	Housekeeping, I actually do have something to pimp this week.
1109880	1114640	Our friends at the podcast, The Ultimate Quest, located at ultimatequest.net, invited me on
1114640	1115640	their show this week.
1115640	1118920	They had a little bit of a roundtable talking about MMOs, so check it out.
1118920	1120360	I think it's going to be episode 85.
1120360	1121860	I might be wrong.
1121860	1123720	Check that out, though, at ultimatequest.net.
1123720	1124720	It was a roundtable.
1124720	1129560	It wasn't just me, but somebody I run into at a lot of the industry shows I go to, Ninja
1129560	1135000	Sista from Electric Sista Hood was on, and her co-host Panda was also on the show.
1135000	1139680	I don't remember his online name, but I know his name was Wes, and he was from The Control
1139680	1141880	Point, which is a Team Fortress 2 podcast.
1141880	1145680	But it's part of a larger network that unfortunately I forgot the name of, but I know they had
1145680	1148900	a WoW podcast and stuff because he knew his stuff when it came to MMOs.
1148900	1151960	So we were talking a little bit about MMOs, but it also got into other subjects.
1151960	1156520	I know we were talking about actually Sony Home for a little bit and some of the other
1156520	1157520	console-related things.
1157520	1161120	And of course, it's all hosted by Xenocore, who calls into this show once in a while.
1161120	1163140	So check that out.
1163140	1164560	That'll be out this week at some point.
1164560	1166920	It's not there right now, but I'm sure it'll be out during the week.
1166920	1169980	Also, of course, we always want to pimp the ways you can follow us online.
1169980	1171560	We have our Twitter at OLR.
1171560	1173720	We have our Facebook at OLRME.
1173720	1174720	Just search for that.
1174720	1176480	And of course, our Facebook at username OrangeLounge.
1176480	1179760	And we do have a MySpace we check like once a month.
1179760	1181160	So be on the lookout for that.
1181160	1182160	Okay, let's get into-
1182160	1183380	Oh, I forgot about MySpace.
1183380	1184380	That's right.
1184380	1185380	Most people did.
1185380	1190520	All right, let's get into tonight's gaming news and some discussion tonight on what happened
1190520	1191520	this week.
1191520	1192520	Loki, start us off tonight.
1192520	1195320	Yeah, there was a few things happening this week.
1195320	1201880	Not a lot of stuff we didn't know was coming, but we pretended to be shocked.
1201880	1206440	But yes, Microsoft finally confirmed that the Xbox 360 was dropping in price, at least
1206440	1212040	the Elite system and the Pro system while they last.
1212040	1217600	And of course, this is the kind of bring it down to two skews now, just the Arcade and
1217600	1219160	the Elite system.
1219160	1224640	The Elite will be dropping down to $299 and of course, the Arcade is still going to be
1224640	1229840	at $199 and the Pro to kind of clear it out, drop down to $249.
1229840	1232720	But once they're gone, they're gone.
1232720	1235740	So I don't know.
1235740	1241280	It's always good to drop the prices of those and the Elite's not a bad system, but I guess
1241280	1246520	if you don't want a black system, then-
1246520	1250960	There's a slight bit of deception in this price drop though, is that they removed the
1250960	1251960	cables.
1251960	1257280	The HDMI cable I think used to come with the Elite and I think it came with a component
1257280	1258280	too.
1258280	1259280	I could be wrong.
1259280	1262080	But those component cables, dude, those are proprietary by Microsoft.
1262080	1267680	You can get an HDMI cable cheap, but if your TV only has one HDMI port currently occupied
1267680	1272440	by your PS3 like mine does or what have you and you want to hook up through component
1272440	1276720	cables, those component cables are like $40 and they took those out.
1276720	1281680	So they may have dropped the price by $100, but they also dropped the value by $40.
1281680	1286000	But their excuse is that they're offering the same thing that Sony is and Sony in all
1286000	1290520	their skews, no matter what, it's always been just the standard AV cables.
1290520	1295320	And I suppose that's fair, but I mean, we do need to look at both sides of it.
1295320	1301440	Is that, yeah, the Xbox 360 is dropping in price, but it's not quite what it was.
1301440	1303080	I think they're both guilty of it.
1303080	1304080	Look at Sony.
1304080	1305080	Oh, they dropped the system price.
1305080	1309000	Oh, but they removed backwards compatibility or, oh, we dropped the system price and now
1309000	1313440	we removed some USB ports or we removed, you know, this or that.
1313440	1314440	I don't know.
1314440	1316600	It's, they're all guilty of it.
1316600	1323720	And yeah, you can probably find cheap third party cables for a lot less than, you know,
1323720	1324720	the 50 bucks.
1324720	1327960	Maybe for PlayStation 3, but I don't know about Xbox 360.
1327960	1328960	No, they've got them.
1328960	1329960	They've got like universal cables.
1329960	1331680	I thought they were proprietary on that.
1331680	1332680	No.
1332680	1333680	No?
1333680	1334680	No.
1334680	1337880	The HDMI stuff, you can use just a straight HDMI cable, but if you want your audio to
1337880	1345400	go out not over the HDMI and you want it to go out either optical or just stereo RCA,
1345400	1349080	you've got to have their proprietary, you know, cable.
1349080	1354240	Technically you have to have their proprietary cable just because if you were to plug in
1354240	1359240	like another AV cable or whatever, it happens to block the, you know, HDMI port or something
1359240	1360240	like that.
1360240	1362420	They're a little fat.
1362420	1367680	But yeah, I mean, if you're fine with it just going over HDMI, then you just buy an HDMI
1367680	1371240	cable for a few bucks and you're good to go.
1371240	1372840	But I don't know.
1372840	1377840	It's interesting and, you know, definitely price drops can't hurt, especially coming
1377840	1379560	to like the holiday and everything.
1379560	1382880	Why do you think they waited so long to announce this price drop officially?
1382880	1386720	I mean, we kind of knew this was coming for two weeks based on all the rumors and leaked
1386720	1387720	marketing.
1387720	1391420	Is it timed to compete directly with the PS3 Slim?
1391420	1396080	Probably to take some like, you know, thunder out of their announcement.
1396080	1398400	You know, it's like, oh, the PlayStation's $299.
1398400	1403640	Well, the Xbox has been $299 and now the better one's $299.
1403640	1409520	So you can basically, you know, buy either system with very similar specs and now it's
1409520	1411360	just the games that kind of decide it.
1411360	1417000	And really with the games, you know, the 360 has a larger catalog anyways.
1417000	1421680	And a Tigerclaw is linking us in chat to an Xbox 360 component cable for $6.75.
1421680	1422760	So okay, I guess I'm wrong.
1422760	1427760	I always thought you had to use the official cables when it came to the 360, but whatever.
1427760	1429120	All right.
1429120	1433000	Also kind of one thing I want to ask though, is the PS3 commercial, have you seen the new
1433000	1434240	Slim TV commercial?
1434240	1435240	Yeah.
1435240	1436760	It's kind of like, it does everything.
1436760	1441600	The guy that was in it, there was the one that was about the price drop or whatever.
1441600	1446360	That guy, I recognize him from another commercial, but I can't think of what it was.
1446360	1450120	But he's been like some other funny commercials like that, but that was pretty little tongue
1450120	1451120	in cheek there.
1451120	1455160	He looks like one of those dudes that would be in like a movie with Seth Rogen.
1455160	1458200	That's kind of what it looked like to me.
1458200	1463400	But yeah, just, you know, I like how they're like saying, you know, I heard a rumor that
1463400	1464400	it's going to drop the $299.
1464400	1466440	What do you have to say about this?
1466440	1467920	I don't know what you're talking about.
1467920	1472560	Yeah, it was kind of funny the way they kind of did that with the, because this is that,
1472560	1476400	you know, obviously the Slim rumor has been around forever and it only turned out to be
1476400	1477400	true.
1477400	1478920	That's kind of, it was kind of a funny way they did it.
1478920	1481720	Most console rumors end up turning out to be true.
1481720	1484520	I'm sure we'll have more that go into that later.
1484520	1491880	I like that Game Guru in chat says, PS3, it does everything except play PS2 games.
1491880	1493400	But it plays PS1 games just fine.
1493400	1494740	Does it print money?
1494740	1495740	So I don't know.
1495740	1501860	I have a real hard time buying the argument of, well, PS3s don't play PS2 games because
1501860	1504400	you can just go get a PS2 to play them on.
1504400	1507760	Well, then why do they play PS1 games?
1507760	1512360	Because they sell PS1 games over their marketing service right now.
1512360	1514880	And how long before they start selling the PS2 games over their service?
1514880	1517680	Until they figure out a way to emulate it, it might just be too much.
1517680	1518680	They do.
1518680	1522920	The ones in Europe, don't they use, wasn't there a SKU that used a software emulation
1522920	1524400	because not every game was playable?
1524400	1527520	No, that was like the middle of your solid 80 gig systems.
1527520	1532760	It was only a limited amount that were playable, but it had one of the two chips that were
1532760	1533760	in there.
1533760	1535280	It just emulated the other chip.
1535280	1539540	So it can't do full emulation, but if they decided, hey, we're going to bring back that
1539540	1541960	one chip again, then yeah, you could do it.
1541960	1546080	But they're not going to because that cuts down the cost of their system.
1546080	1547560	All right.
1547560	1551840	Well, let's move on to talking about something with Xbox and, of course, one of the features
1551840	1557080	that's coming to Xbox pretty soon, Twitter and, of course, Facebook.
1557080	1560080	Also I guess it was a little like press release that came out about the price cut, and there
1560080	1563640	was kind of a little footnote tucked away in it that mentioned that an Xbox Live Gold
1563640	1567020	membership is going to be required for Twitter and Facebook.
1567020	1570440	So apparently it is not going to be something that is going to be included as part of the
1570440	1572440	basic silver package.
1572440	1576440	But in an interview with Joystick, or I guess maybe a clarification to Joystick, that's
1576440	1580360	with a Q, of course, the gaming blog, a Microsoft representative said to them that Facebook
1580360	1585120	and Twitter on Xbox Live will be free to Gold members with a free trial period available
1585120	1586840	for Silver members.
1586840	1592400	Now, I'm not quite understanding what the point of Twitter and Facebook is on Xbox.
1592400	1594200	I think I have to see it in action.
1594200	1599080	But essentially if it's just me viewing Twitter updates on my Xbox 360, dude, that's just
1599080	1600620	like using the web.
1600620	1603280	And why do I need to pay for Gold to have that?
1603280	1604280	It's a little silly.
1604280	1605280	Same reason we have it on our phones.
1605280	1610120	I mean, I think though if you've already got Gold access, it's really a moot point.
1610120	1612960	But it's not something I would want to use on my Xbox.
1612960	1614760	I mean, that's why I have my phone.
1614760	1615760	That's why I have my computer.
1615760	1621400	I mean, this just seems like more ammunition for the Sony fanboys about Twitter and Facebook,
1621400	1625920	at least with Facebook, is that you can upload, well, starting soon with games supporting
1625920	1629880	it, you can upload like screen caps of you, you know, beating certain levels or getting
1629880	1631280	achievements or something like that.
1631280	1635440	So, you know, more crap to spam your Facebook with, basically.
1635440	1636920	Isn't that kind of what the DSI does?
1636920	1640560	You can upload the photos from your DSI, just like it kind of interacts like a mobile phone
1640560	1641560	does with Facebook.
1641560	1642560	Yeah.
1642560	1644960	But this is going to be a little bit more game related though.
1644960	1648280	I don't know why I would care what other people are playing.
1648280	1652920	Like I, like even those, uh, what is it that you see on the Raptor?
1652920	1653920	I hate those.
1653920	1658720	Like, I really could care less what you're playing unless, you know, I'm actually playing
1658720	1662800	it too or it's a game I'm interested in, but I really don't want to know what your achievements
1662800	1663800	are.
1663800	1664800	That really is meaningless to me.
1664800	1668520	Those, that has to be enabled by the user because I have a Raptor account, but it doesn't
1668520	1669520	publish my Twitter.
1669520	1671220	I just don't give it my Twitter password.
1671220	1672280	Everyone with Raptor.
1672280	1679600	I don't care, but yeah, I, I don't really, I mean, I guess some people are interested
1679600	1683360	or some people think what they're playing is so important that they have to show everybody
1683360	1685080	every little thing that they've done.
1685080	1690280	Like if I saw something funny happen in a game, then I might put a picture up.
1690280	1692120	Like when would I put those blue dragon pictures up?
1692120	1696840	Like two months ago when I was up all night bored.
1696840	1697840	Yeah.
1697840	1698840	That's, that's one thing.
1698840	1700520	It's with people who are like, oh, I played this.
1700520	1702240	Oh, I'm uploading every day, every day, every day.
1702240	1703240	Um, who cares?
1703240	1708560	Um, associate 100 Matt in chat says, uh, I, I'm just really worried that we are going
1708560	1712920	to get nothing but spam tweets and Facebook status of what people are playing is so then
1712920	1714200	that will be suck.
1714200	1719160	And you know, I kind of agree because Twitter is already kind of ruined for me as it is
1719160	1721240	like I don't really like to check Twitter.
1721240	1722560	It's too much.
1722560	1729600	I can't like, I don't know, I try to use tweet decks so that there's filters, but even then
1729600	1734040	it will only go so far back and if I'm only able to check Twitter once a day, I feel like
1734040	1735960	I kind of lose what everybody's up to.
1735960	1738880	Like I just, I'm really starting to just not like Twitter.
1738880	1743400	Like I just think it got too big too fast and I don't think they have the system.
1743400	1745040	I think it's going, it's Friendster.
1745040	1748280	It's going to go the way of Friendster where it just starts crapping out too much.
1748280	1749280	Yeah.
1749280	1750400	But do you remember Friendster?
1750400	1754420	It was supposed to be Facebook and Myspace, but it started crashing every day and it was
1754420	1755700	down for weeks at a time.
1755700	1757460	So everybody abandoned it for Myspace.
1757460	1762640	I think I looked at it and when it was kind of, I like Facebook really.
1762640	1763640	I do like Facebook.
1763640	1764640	It's easier to ignore shit on Facebook.
1764640	1765640	Yeah.
1765640	1768640	One thing I love about Facebook is that if there is an app that's publishing things that
1768640	1771360	you don't want to see, ignore and you never see it again.
1771360	1773400	It's great.
1773400	1778080	I just hope with the 360 and the Wii, if it does start publishing those types of updates,
1778080	1782120	you can block those as easily because unfortunately Facebook is turning into Twitter, but it's
1782120	1785120	almost getting worse because of all these like quiz updates and things.
1785120	1790120	You know, I may be just as guilty as the next guy, but I mean like if you don't check that
1790120	1796960	stuff regularly and you have a lot of friends, you know, it's like rapid fire live journal
1796960	1799000	is really what it is.
1799000	1805960	Well, I was using Facebook for things, you know, like my, my, my family's on Facebook,
1805960	1811520	so I actually more or less, it's how I, I put a little bit more important things there
1811520	1813320	so I can keep in touch with my family.
1813320	1818640	My Twitter is more like just how like it's more for networking now and a lot of the circles
1818640	1823360	that I'm in, you know, for, uh, I use it as a communication tool for people who don't
1823360	1826000	text, you know, because it comes to my phone.
1826000	1827000	Yeah.
1827000	1830000	I honestly, I only use Twitter for the networking aspect of it at this point.
1830000	1834800	There's, I find that most of my personal status updates I'm putting on Facebook, you know.
1834800	1836440	I'm using my live journal again.
1836440	1837440	Yeah.
1837440	1842960	You know, I will, I think I can't get into the in depth thoughts on really, really deal
1842960	1847160	with my day on Twitter and Facebook the way I can on live journal and I'm kind of sad
1847160	1851440	to see lots of people abandoning live journal for, you know, Twitter and Facebook and all
1851440	1852440	this stuff.
1852440	1855280	I've got that permanent account and it was a gift and I'm going to damn well use it.
1855280	1856280	Me too.
1856280	1859400	I, and people warned me that live journal wouldn't be around forever, but at the same
1859400	1864600	time I say, look, if it were not for live journal, the show probably would not exist.
1864600	1866280	I think that's pretty much a given.
1866280	1869320	Um, I would not have met some of the friends that I have in real life.
1869320	1873080	My current roommate, some of one of my best friends and a couple of other of my best friends.
1873080	1876600	Um, you know, I would never have met if it wasn't for live journal.
1876600	1880120	I mean that website has had a profound impact on my life.
1880120	1884480	I would be a different individual and call me a nerd, call me a dork, whatever you want
1884480	1886940	to call me for saying that about a website.
1886940	1887940	Fuck you.
1887940	1890480	Um, but it's true.
1890480	1893480	I would not be the same person if it was not for this website.
1893480	1898640	And so it's just really sad to see it being abandoned, you know, and in favor of all this
1898640	1899640	other junk.
1899640	1902160	The other thing I like live journal about though is that it actually is a good chance
1902160	1907620	for me to look back a few years and see where I was, you know, it's a really good tool for
1907620	1914760	personal inventory, but yeah, I, everyone's going to go to the, to the biggest, baddest,
1914760	1918400	newest thing, but I think that there's, I honestly still think that live journal is
1918400	1920480	remaining a staple for a lot of people.
1920480	1928120	I think, you know, Facebook has enough in terms of diverse things to do that it's going
1928120	1929520	to have some staying power.
1929520	1934760	Well, Facebook also has games, which I find interesting, you know, and in one topic, I
1934760	1937600	think we got into it on Bobby show a little bit last week and I can't remember if we got
1937600	1942440	into it on our own show, but I was talking about how Leo Facebook casual games are the
1942440	1945800	future of casual gaming because they're casual MMOs.
1945800	1950040	A lot of these that are coming up games like the mafia, the mobsters, the sorority life,
1950040	1955480	the farm bill, the ones I hate, you know, I like my animal, my pet society, hate them
1955480	1956480	as much as you want.
1956480	1958640	I'm telling you tons of people are playing them.
1958640	1959640	Oh no, I know.
1959640	1963760	I have plenty of notifications about it that I've had to ignore.
1963760	1968520	I was playing those games myself, but I finally stopped playing the one cause it was something
1968520	1969920	my ex got me into.
1969920	1972920	So I stopped playing it cause you know, I didn't want to play it anymore.
1972920	1976640	But you know, there's, you know, there's a lot of people playing those games.
1976640	1977640	Yeah.
1977640	1982200	I'd, I'd play that and it'd be interesting if those could somehow come to Xbox 360, but
1982200	1985200	obviously I don't think that's possible, obviously.
1985200	1989400	Maybe that's part of the deal actually getting the Facebook on is you get the apps with it.
1989400	1990400	Hmm.
1990400	1991400	Okay.
1991400	1995680	Rama in chat says, yeah, but Rob, that's not the big reason why people are leaving LJ.
1995680	2000160	People don't like the new draconian rules and regulations brought in, thus the Exodus.
2000160	2003640	The rules on live journal have never once affected me.
2003640	2004640	Same here.
2004640	2006400	I'm blogging about my life.
2006400	2009840	You know, that has never been something impacted by the live journal rules.
2009840	2014560	I think sometimes I think especially live journalers more than, and boy am I getting
2014560	2016680	off the subject, but I don't care tonight.
2016680	2023000	Um, I think live journals, uh, almost more than anyone want to start drama over everything.
2023000	2025960	And sometimes they're making a big fuss about nothing.
2025960	2029680	Like I think, do you remember when they banned all those accounts because they were getting
2029680	2034800	into suggested pedophilia and all this stuff?
2034800	2035800	Do you remember that?
2035800	2040120	And there was this big stink about it and how it was like freedom of speech being stopped
2040120	2041120	and all this.
2041120	2045840	And I'm kind of like, there's so many people making a big deal over this that I really
2045840	2050440	don't think we're honestly impacted in one way or another.
2050440	2053840	It was a bit ridiculous anyway.
2053840	2057880	And plus I think live journal does have a certain responsibility to stop a lot of that
2057880	2059100	crap from happening.
2059100	2063780	I think that some of it they did take out of context, which is really the big thing
2063780	2067000	that you run into anytime you bring in a corporate entity.
2067000	2071600	Um, and a lot of people will just look for reasons to be offended.
2071600	2080280	I mean, you know how I feel about that, but I think that because they do have a legal
2080280	2083240	responsibility to protect, yes.
2083240	2086440	You know, I think that they were justified in their actions.
2086440	2090460	I don't, they just needed to learn the difference between a Harry Potter fan fic and you know,
2090460	2093840	what was legitimately, you know, yeah, bad naughty stuff.
2093840	2101020	I think that it would have been better if they had taken more time or had better filtering
2101020	2102020	in place.
2102020	2110280	And I do kind of like that now it's like if you're going, if you're not logged in and
2110280	2116080	then, um, it'll ask you right up front, it'll have you, it won't let you look at certain
2116080	2120920	things if you're underage, if it suspects you of being underage.
2120920	2125400	And I didn't like how everybody was so quick to abandon live journal for other just clones,
2125400	2128040	ripoffs of live journal, which you know, live journal was always open source.
2128040	2132120	So it was very easy to make the ripoffs of because it was always about the community.
2132120	2136080	And if the community branches off in all these directions, it's exactly what happened to
2136080	2137900	my old wow guild.
2137900	2141680	Everybody started abandoning it because everybody wanted to get something else out of the game.
2141680	2142960	And some people went over here.
2142960	2146800	Some people went over here, someone went over here and the game got ruined for everybody
2146800	2150280	because the community was gone.
2150280	2153760	Because I don't know, maybe I'm going to take some shit for this comment, but some people
2153760	2156320	got a little selfish and it ruined the community.
2156320	2159400	And I think in the sense, that's kind of what happened to live journalism sets.
2159400	2165080	I think a lot of those people that abandoned it for other sites got selfish, but give me
2165080	2166080	shit for that comment.
2166080	2167080	If you want.
2167080	2168080	That's how I honestly feel.
2168080	2169080	So too bad.
2169080	2175000	Um, let's see, but, but every time I feel like live journals dying, I just load up,
2175000	2176320	Oh no, they didn't.
2176320	2177400	And then I'm always like, Oh, okay.
2177400	2178880	There's still tons of people on live journal.
2178880	2186040	We actually have a new member, by the way, to our cast who wants to comment on this.
2186040	2187640	What in the hell is that?
2187640	2188640	Tribble.
2188640	2190120	His name is Angus.
2190120	2194960	Since, since we don't have the ferret in this studio, I suppose Angus will have to do Angus
2194960	2195960	the Tribble.
2195960	2196960	Angus the Tribble.
2196960	2197960	Nice.
2197960	2198960	All right.
2198960	2199960	Um, okay.
2199960	2200960	Sorry.
2200960	2203320	I, I got on a rant about social networking that I didn't mean to get into.
2203320	2207720	Um, but yeah, Hey, uh, Facebook and Twitter only if you're on gold, otherwise you're
2207720	2209840	going to get the trial period on silver.
2209840	2214160	Um, I guess more to come about what these apps are really about, um, soon, but you know,
2214160	2219360	I'm looking at a screenshot on Facebook or I'm sorry, Twitter, and it's pretty self-explanatory.
2219360	2221960	You hit the X button to tweet what you're doing.
2221960	2225040	Otherwise you see little clouds pop up on the screen with what all your friends are
2225040	2226040	doing.
2226040	2229400	It might be the kind of thing like you could run at a party, I guess.
2229400	2231920	I wonder if the fail will make an appearance.
2231920	2233160	I'll be interesting.
2233160	2234160	Anyhow.
2234160	2235160	Okay.
2235160	2236160	Let's move on.
2236160	2237160	One more gaming news.
2237160	2239480	I know that I went on a huge tangent, but too bad.
2239480	2243240	What we do is we're orange tangent radio.
2243240	2250440	Um, at any rate though, in more X-Box news on, uh, the Amazon German site, there was
2250440	2257440	a listing for 250 gigabyte X-Box 360 elite, um, that was promptly yanked right, right
2257440	2259080	after it posts.
2259080	2270160	Um, it was, uh, for, uh, 297, uh, Euro night, well, 297.99, um, and had two wireless controls.
2270160	2276400	There's a copy of Forza Motorsport 3, which was, you know, it's coming out October.
2276400	2283280	Um, and we, you know, we know about the price cut, so this could be, you know, something
2283280	2289920	that they're gonna do to, uh, you know, produce more money to make, you know, put in a bit
2289920	2293520	more profit, but there's no comment from Microsoft yet.
2293520	2299160	Well, I think like most rumors, this one's gonna inevitably prove true as well.
2299160	2306320	Yeah, it's kind of funny too, because in South Africa, apparently the website xboxgaming.co.za
2306320	2314160	also had another elite, uh, console bundle with, um, also a, uh, what was it, uh, two
2314160	2319080	wireless controllers and a 250 gigabyte, um, hard drive as well.
2319080	2320080	Hmm.
2320080	2326720	Well, I, you know, I think, um, these are probably inevitable for Christmas.
2326720	2330720	I think, you know, these big bundles that come with lots of games and lots of storage,
2330720	2332120	I think it's the Christmas.
2332120	2333640	It's setting the stage for the holiday season.
2333640	2335040	Sounds good to me.
2335040	2338200	I think it's inevitable you're gonna see these larger drives come out, especially what's
2338200	2339200	funny.
2339200	2343640	If those rumors about the PS3 slim with the 250 gigabytes are true, this is just right
2343640	2344640	on par with that.
2344640	2345640	Exactly.
2345640	2348860	Everybody's, you know, aware of what everyone else is doing, and so why not?
2348860	2351040	Just put out the terabyte hard drive and be done with it.
2351040	2352040	Seriously.
2352040	2353040	Those are down pretty cheap.
2353040	2354040	I know.
2354040	2355040	$100 for a terabyte drive.
2355040	2356040	I know.
2356040	2357040	It's crazy.
2357040	2359360	You know, I was saying that, you know, I was, um, out at Fry's this weekend and I was actually
2359360	2363480	saying that instead of just selling terabyte drives for $100, if you wanted to make tons
2363480	2368720	of money, they should sell what's called terabyte full of porn, and just sell a terabyte, just
2368720	2375640	sell one of those drives that's already preloaded with just porn, and sell it for like $150,
2375640	2379280	and you would make just tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of money.
2379280	2380280	What?
2380280	2383600	Just like call it the, uh, the red light special or something?
2383600	2385640	Just big brick of porn or something.
2385640	2386640	Just sell like crazy.
2386640	2388640	Big brick of porn.
2388640	2389640	Yes.
2389640	2396400	Um, something that's being offered, well, kind of on the down low, but Best Buy is apparently
2396400	2402120	putting out a message to, um, their employees that says, um, you know, if you get anybody
2402120	2408980	trying to return their recently purchased 80 gigabyte system, since, you know, the price
2408980	2412080	just dropped and now you can get, you know, a system with a larger hard drive for the
2412080	2420360	same price, um, you know, to discourage the return and instead offer a free game instead.
2420360	2424200	So if you happen to have purchased a, you know, 80 gig system, you might as well try
2424200	2428780	taking it back to Best Buy and see what they do, and they may give you a free copy of Infamous
2428780	2432000	MLB 09 The Show or Killzone 2.
2432000	2435480	How about a good game?
2435480	2437520	Infamous is a good game, so is Killzone 2.
2437520	2439800	Yeah, but they've been out for a little bit.
2439800	2440800	Yeah.
2440800	2443360	And they probably have a lot of people who already own all those games, you know?
2443360	2444360	Well, you know what?
2444360	2448720	They don't have a lot of games coming out that are made by Sony that are, you know,
2448720	2454600	brand new, so this is gonna have to do for now, because there's no Uncharted 2 yet.
2454600	2455880	Oh well.
2455880	2458960	But um, yeah, it's kind of funny though.
2458960	2460440	Why are they letting people get away with that?
2460440	2464280	So people bring in their PS3s and say- Because they have like a 30 day return policy
2464280	2467240	or whatever, and they can go- For any reason?
2467240	2468680	Um, I guess, yeah.
2468680	2471400	Well, then I guess it sucks to be them for putting up that reason in the first place.
2471400	2472400	They should say so.
2472400	2473880	They should have a clause in there.
2473880	2477760	Well, it's because probably people are pissed off that they just bought a PS3.
2477760	2480080	They knew that the price drop was coming.
2480080	2484700	I mean, we kind of all knew that the price drop was coming, but essentially they may
2484700	2489820	have known that the price drop was coming, and now that it has, you know, they just sold
2489820	2495580	the console to a guy for $100 more, you know, for, you know, an 80 gig hard drive, and now
2495580	2500080	he can buy, you know, the same console with the larger hard drive, it's slimmed down,
2500080	2501960	brand new, for like a hundred bucks cheaper.
2501960	2503640	Yeah, they'd be pretty pissed too.
2503640	2508760	But at the same time, that's just the way the world works, so-
2508760	2509760	Be mad at Sony.
2509760	2510760	Yeah.
2510760	2511760	I guess.
2511760	2513720	I don't know, or be mad at yourself for not paying more attention to what's going on because
2513720	2515280	we all knew this was coming for months.
2515280	2517080	I don't know.
2517080	2518720	Be an informed buyer.
2518720	2523400	Well, anyhow, let's talk about the Wii a little bit, because we've been talking a lot about
2523400	2525000	the 360 and the PS3 tonight.
2525000	2528300	And one thing we talked about a lot last week were some of these new peripherals that are
2528300	2529600	rumored for the Wii.
2529600	2533640	And I'm getting to the point where, before I tell you what this is, this new peripheral
2533640	2536400	this week, if you haven't already read about it, I'm getting to the point where I'm wondering
2536400	2537760	if some of these aren't fake.
2537760	2541380	That Nintendo does have a new peripheral on the way, but they're patenting all this other
2541380	2548000	shit to throw us off, because now apparently a football controller has been patented.
2548000	2551760	That's right, it's a little football where apparently there's a strap, I guess, on one
2551760	2555560	side where you can actually put your hand, and then you, I guess, like imagine holding
2555560	2556560	a football.
2556560	2559640	You kind of put your hand through the strap, and then on the top would be where the Wiimote
2559640	2560640	rests.
2560640	2562200	I guess you'd still be able to hit some of the buttons.
2562200	2565680	So you would be able to imagine yourself kind of throwing this football and then hitting
2565680	2568680	maybe a button to release the ball or something as you're throwing it.
2568680	2572640	That would be the type of controller, and apparently this was patented with the motion
2572640	2575440	and plus as a part of the football, by the way.
2575440	2578240	How many broken TVs are we going to see?
2578240	2581080	That's what I'd be worried about, but apparently there's a big old strap on this football that
2581080	2582080	you put your hand through.
2582080	2585480	I think it's supposed to prevent that, but you know some dumb kid's going to throw this
2585480	2589960	through a TV, but I'm sure they'll have all the safety warnings and all that stuff.
2589960	2596600	It's just, these are dumb, and you know, it's sad, is that the next real idea they come
2596600	2599560	out with is going to be very dumb as well.
2599560	2602520	I mean, come on, the Wii Vitality Sensor.
2602520	2607480	Well, I just want to also say about this football real quick is that it's also supposed to be
2607480	2608980	able to interpret running.
2608980	2612800	I guess it's supposed to notice your body motion, and so you can actually detect running.
2612800	2618800	So maybe this is for some type of full-blown Nintendo-based football game coming out in
2618800	2620760	the near future, or next year's Madden.
2620760	2621760	I don't know.
2621760	2622960	That sounds lame, and you know why?
2622960	2625940	Because why do I need to buy another peripheral to do something that I could probably do with
2625940	2629160	the remote by itself anyways?
2629160	2632480	Maybe to kind of match that feel of actually holding the football in your hand?
2632480	2636720	Maybe they should try something else more innovative instead of having to create a new
2636720	2638960	peripheral for every fucking game that comes out.
2638960	2643480	You know, why don't you create some new peripherals that can be used for more stuff than just
2643480	2645480	like, you know, the football controller.
2645480	2648840	Well, I'm not going to be able to use that for anything else than the football game,
2648840	2651680	and I'm guessing there's probably only going to be like one or two football games that
2651680	2652680	support it.
2652680	2657280	Well, America and Canada and all the other countries in the world where the Wii is out,
2657280	2661240	if you want Nintendo to stop doing this, stop buying them.
2661240	2663960	But look, whenever they release a new peripheral, they sell like crazy.
2663960	2664960	Because people are dumb.
2664960	2667760	It's like a balance board.
2667760	2671720	You know, I'm sure Wii Sports Resort is doing very well too with the Emotion Plus.
2671720	2674520	I mean, granted, now here's one interesting thing.
2674520	2678320	I saw at Fry's this weekend, I was there just shopping.
2678320	2681640	They had maraca shells for the Wii, because remember, you know, they had a samba de amigo
2681640	2682640	game of the Wii.
2682640	2688320	They had the maraca shells on clearance, 90 cents for a maraca shell for you.
2688320	2689900	I'm totally getting one.
2689900	2690900	Go out to the Fry's and Roseville.
2690900	2691900	You know what I looked at?
2691900	2692900	They had shelves and shelves of them.
2692900	2697600	I went down there too and I saw the Rock Revolution bundles and I'm like, I gotta see how much
2697600	2698600	they were.
2698600	2699800	Well, it was 20 bucks on the PS3, right?
2699800	2702880	But still 60 bucks on the Xbox 360, which I thought was weird.
2702880	2703880	Yeah.
2703880	2706360	20 bucks though for the full drum set.
2706360	2709640	I'm like, nope, still not worth 90 cents.
2709640	2710640	That's what I'll buy it for.
2710640	2713200	I almost picked up the game, but I still have a broken Xbox 360.
2713200	2717520	You know, it might actually be good to convert into like a Drummania controller or something
2717520	2718520	like that.
2718520	2719520	Maybe.
2719520	2722440	When it's 90 cents.
2722440	2723440	Comments from chat.
2723440	2724440	chat.orangehonestradio.com.
2724440	2725440	Excuse me.
2725440	2726440	Kevin.
2726440	2727840	Going to Kevin tonight for some comments.
2727840	2731000	Bochikawa asks, Wii motion plus can sense running, can't it?
2731000	2732000	Yeah, I would think so.
2732000	2733000	I mean, isn't that a part of...
2733000	2735200	The Wii remote can sense running.
2735200	2743040	EA active has running in it and it says Wii Fit has it and you're running in place.
2743040	2747180	Frisbee says Nintendo because we spread ourselves too thin.
2747180	2748840	Kind of not a bad argument.
2748840	2751840	I mean, isn't that kind of what the problem seems to be with Nintendo right now?
2751840	2753960	It's just like, okay, remember the Wii Zapper?
2753960	2757960	The shell that was supposed to revolutionize, you know, their gun games?
2757960	2758960	That was crap.
2758960	2759960	Okay?
2759960	2761360	Seriously, you don't need it.
2761360	2765100	In fact, games play better without it, if you ask me.
2765100	2769420	But whatever, you know, they put it out and now there's all these copies and stuff that
2769420	2772240	actually do a better job than they did.
2772240	2776080	But people bought it because it had a free game with it, you know, Link's Crossbow Training,
2776080	2781100	which I can say, honestly, I've only played once that one time that we did like, you know,
2781100	2786960	the challenge and that was it and I haven't touched it since.
2786960	2787960	And the Zapper shell?
2787960	2788960	Awful.
2788960	2791580	I'll take the perfect shot any day.
2791580	2796240	Game Guru in Chat says, just watch, this will be included in Super Mario Football and it
2796240	2797240	will sell millions.
2797240	2798240	Sad but true.
2798240	2800800	Yeah, that's what they do.
2800800	2805400	Just slap Mario's face on it or, you know, some popular Nintendo character's face on
2805400	2809380	it and make the graphics really cute and chibi and it will sell like crazy.
2809380	2812800	And then they'll be on the news about how, hey, kids can play football but at home.
2812800	2816400	Well, then I don't want to hear any fucking bitching then when they're complaining that
2816400	2820480	they can't figure out why, you know, the hardcore gamer doesn't want anything to do with them
2820480	2822160	next console cycle.
2822160	2825160	Why do they not want to play our games, you know?
2825160	2828680	It's not like we're focusing only on children's games like we did at the GameCube and then
2828680	2830520	bitched about that too.
2830520	2834320	I mean, I don't know, it's just...
2834320	2836960	I don't think you need to do this stuff, just make better games.
2836960	2840840	By the way, a comment in chat made me think to remind for our international listeners
2840840	2843980	when we are talking about football, we're talking about American football, not football
2843980	2844980	as the rest of the world knows it.
2844980	2845980	As in crap.
2845980	2846980	Yeah.
2846980	2850680	Because that would make no sense to put your hand in a glove with the ball.
2850680	2851840	It would make no sense to be...
2851840	2855160	I would hope most people kind of figured that out.
2855160	2859240	We try to be aware that we have a worldwide audience but at the end of the day, we do
2859240	2863500	live in California and sometimes we forget some of these things that football is different
2863500	2864580	other places.
2864580	2867440	So there you go.
2867440	2871440	ActDeftInChat says, Nintendo, play Mario's dick with new dick peripheral.
2871440	2873340	But that's not family friendly, you see.
2873340	2874340	That's why that wouldn't happen.
2874340	2876440	That's not for the whole family.
2876440	2877440	That's why the Wii...
2877440	2878440	But it is fun for Mario.
2878440	2881360	The Wii Vitality sensor for old people.
2881360	2882360	That's what they're going to put on it.
2882360	2883360	That's going to be the slogan.
2883360	2884360	For old people.
2884360	2888860	In the pack-in game, you're going to die soon.
2888860	2892900	It'll be like that banner ad you always see on the internet, you know, click to find out
2892900	2896600	when you will die and then you put your mouse over it, it says 666 and all this guy.
2896600	2897600	Have you ever seen that ad?
2897600	2898600	No.
2898600	2899600	I saw it on Myspace once.
2899600	2901600	It just cracked me up at how stupid it is.
2901600	2902600	Oh, that's why I don't go to Myspace.
2902600	2905100	Why would somebody click on that, really?
2905100	2907680	Although they have some pretty creative banner ads out there.
2907680	2912760	They'll always have like, you know, slap Susan Boyle, win a prize and it's a picture of Susan
2912760	2916960	Boyle or whatever, just some celebrity and they have some interesting banner ads.
2916960	2921540	Admit it, there's been one out there that you've kind of tinkered with and hovered your
2921540	2923040	mouse around.
2923040	2924840	Hover the mouse around, not clicked on.
2924840	2925840	Not clicked on.
2925840	2928600	They're like, I moved the mouse and I'm like, Hey, that did something.
2928600	2930600	Oh, that's cool.
2930600	2931600	Block.
2931600	2932600	All right.
2932600	2937120	I want to say once I saw one with OJ Simpson and as she moved the mouse, he was wielding
2937120	2943260	a knife and it was so wrong, but really funny and I still remember it to this day, which
2943260	2944840	I guess is what advertising is all about.
2944840	2948640	Of course, I just don't remember what product it was for.
2948640	2949640	Win a free Xbox.
2949640	2951640	All right.
2951640	2952640	Sham.
2952640	2953640	Wow.
2953640	2954640	All right.
2954640	2955640	Let's move on.
2955640	2956640	We got release dates coming up, but first another story.
2956640	2962760	Well, um, there's actually something to be in next week's, um, Famitsu is a game called
2962760	2972080	Okami Den, um, which, um, it actually was, uh, put out for the Japanese seven 11 website,
2972080	2979040	but it is a Capcom trademark and, um, they, uh, mentioned it in 2chan.
2979040	2985480	So, uh, now everyone's talking about it and the rumor is that it's, um, a sequel to Okami.
2985480	2994360	Um, because, uh, what it's looking like is it could either be Okami Gaiden or Okami Densetsu,
2994360	2998560	which would be either Okami side story or Okami legend.
2998560	3000440	So who knows?
3000440	3002920	Well, you know, I'm not surprised.
3002920	3005000	Okami was a pretty critically praised game.
3005000	3007480	I don't know how it did sales wise, but I think it did okay.
3007480	3008480	Yeah.
3008480	3012520	It certainly, certainly is, uh, as well as other games that get sequels made of them.
3012520	3016280	But, but Capcom broke with, um, Clover Studios.
3016280	3018280	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
3018280	3020000	They might get another developer to do it.
3020000	3022480	If they still own the IP, they can get whoever they want to do it.
3022480	3024200	I mean, that would be nothing new.
3024200	3028720	You see series going from developer to developer all the time, like Silent Hill, what happened
3028720	3029720	to Team Silent?
3029720	3030720	You know, they didn't have them done.
3030720	3031720	Which is unfortunate.
3031720	3035520	They decided to send the franchise over here where it'd promptly get ruined.
3035520	3038800	I didn't think Homecoming was as terrible as a lot of people made it out to be, but
3038800	3039800	it was different.
3039800	3041720	It was definitely different from the old school Silent Hill games.
3041720	3045200	So, um, alright, well let's move into some release dates.
3045200	3046200	Loki.
3046200	3047200	Yes.
3047200	3050280	Well, next week actually got some pretty decent stuff coming out.
3050280	3056360	Um, starting off with, of course, Guitar Hero 5, which will be coming out on the 1st.
3056360	3059960	And that's going to be on, you know, PlayStation 2, PS3, Wii, and 360.
3059960	3063720	Remember, if you buy your copy during the month of September, you will also get a free
3063720	3069880	copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen if you remember to register it online by the end of October.
3069880	3075440	Also coming out will be Command & Conquer Red Alert Commander's Challenge on the PlayStation
3075440	3078440	Network and Xbox Live Arcade this week.
3078440	3082960	Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and 360, although if I remember correctly
3082960	3084640	I think that's actually the week after.
3084640	3086400	I think that date's wrong.
3086400	3097600	Section 8 on PC and Xbox 360 this week, Soulcalibur Broken Destiny on PSP, 7 Wonders 2 on DS,
3097600	3101640	and Champions Online on PC.
3101640	3107200	Also another Xbox, or actually I think this is on both Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation
3107200	3109960	Network, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine.
3109960	3115300	You can actually build up some of your players for the new NBA game.
3115300	3120520	And Fate Unlimited Codes on PSP, which is a digital download only title.
3120520	3125120	I think those are the big ones for this week.
3125120	3130100	I do need to get my 360 fixed soon because I do want to pick up Guitar Hero 5, just because
3130100	3132000	I like the song list in it.
3132000	3133000	And you know, what the hell.
3133000	3138000	I may not be the biggest Van Halen fan, but hey, free game, it's kind of hard to ignore,
3138000	3139000	right?
3139000	3140000	Yeah.
3140000	3141000	Oh, I forgot some other ones here.
3141000	3146080	Warriors of Rochi 2 on PSP was coming out as well.
3146080	3147380	That's it.
3147380	3148380	What was that on PSP?
3148380	3149760	Warriors of Rochi 2.
3149760	3150760	It's like Dynasty Warriors.
3150760	3151760	Okay.
3151760	3152760	All right.
3152760	3154440	Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there.
3154440	3156360	It's a little bit of a slower week in Japan.
3156360	3160700	There's not a whole lot coming out, but we do have a game called 428 is coming out from
3160700	3162800	Sega on the PS3 this week.
3162800	3164620	There's nothing on the 360, believe it or not.
3164620	3167680	But this game's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and it looks like it kind of mixes in some
3167680	3169920	real life scenes here.
3169920	3172080	It looks like some type of interactive drama.
3172080	3175060	But all I know is that there's a giant furry cat as part of the game.
3175060	3177380	It's like a little action adventure game.
3177380	3178380	So it looks interesting.
3178380	3181860	I don't know if this is based off a show or something, but it's an action adventure game
3181860	3184180	coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3.
3184180	3188760	Not on the 360 that I saw, but definitely looks kind of interesting.
3188760	3193720	A game coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week, Sweet Honeycoming is the name of the
3193720	3194720	game.
3194720	3196800	That's C-O-M-I-N-G.
3196800	3199940	And it looks kind of like a date sim game because there's all these girls and practically
3199940	3201980	upskirt shots of some of them.
3201980	3204040	Are you sure that's the correct spelling?
3204040	3206940	I'm perfectly sure that is the correct spelling of the game.
3206940	3210300	But it looks to be like another dating game on the PlayStation 2, so have fun with that
3210300	3211480	if you want.
3211480	3213820	And we have some other games coming out on the Nintendo DS.
3213820	3217200	Love Plus comes out from Konami on the DS.
3217200	3221020	I think this might be yet another type of dating sim game.
3221020	3222620	I think it was another dating sim.
3222620	3225020	But this one's from Konami, so it's kind of one of the bigger series out there.
3225020	3231660	I believe I saw an article on this on Kotaku and they've actually made it more explicit,
3231660	3234980	I think, than the PC version.
3234980	3235980	I don't know.
3235980	3236980	It was either more or less.
3236980	3240100	I think it was more, though, because I was like, huh, that's interesting.
3240100	3248580	And then on the Sony PSP this week, Samurai Duo 2 Portable is coming out this week, which
3248580	3251940	looks to be a type of fighting game about samurais, but it's not Samurai Showdown, but
3251940	3252940	kind of close.
3252940	3256380	I think it's Warriors Orochi 2, maybe.
3256380	3257380	There you go.
3257380	3258500	There's your Japanese release dates for the week.
3258500	3260620	How about a trip to the UK, Dark Sakura?
3260620	3266160	Well, what we have coming up on the second is Defense Grid The Awakening, and then a
3266160	3267460	bunch of stuff on the fourth.
3267460	3275620	We have Champions Online, Cursed Mountain, Dissidia Final Fantasy, Guilty Gear 2 Overture,
3275620	3285980	IL-2's Stramovik Birds of Prey, Metroid Prime Trilogy, The Humans, and Warriors Orochi 2
3285980	3289380	on PSP.
3289380	3292180	Are we kind of at a slow period right now, because now we're kind of past the summer
3292180	3296340	season with all the kiddies getting back in school, you know, and then the holidays will
3296340	3298380	be kind of the next big push getting into October?
3298380	3302020	I mean, Guitar Hero 5 is certainly a big game, and certainly The Beatles this month, but
3302020	3304260	outside of music games, no.
3304260	3306140	It's actually going to pick up a lot next week.
3306140	3307140	Really?
3307140	3308140	Yeah.
3308140	3310700	It's just going to keep going, because this year everybody's afraid of Modern Warfare
3310700	3311700	2.
3311700	3312700	Why?
3312700	3315540	I don't know, but there's a lot of games that normally come out in November that are
3315540	3320180	coming out early, like Smackdown vs. Raw 2010 is coming out at the end of October instead
3320180	3326020	of middle of November, but a lot of things are actually crammed in there, so like, especially
3326020	3331940	next week with, like, you know, on the week of the eighth there's Dirt 2, Mini Ninjas,
3331940	3336100	that pinball game, some other stuff coming out as well, and there's new releases each
3336100	3338380	week that are actually pretty decent.
3338380	3341900	Fair enough.
3341900	3352220	So some other stuff, a little bit of Rock Band information, including, you may remember
3352220	3357180	we talked about the Rock Band Network, how you can, well, first off they're going to
3357180	3361020	have, you know, some original content coming to there as well, but another update that's
3361020	3366180	supposedly going to be coming soon, I guess this November, is they're going to allow demos
3366180	3371380	of songs that are available on their actual store, which is pretty cool.
3371380	3378980	You get 30 second playable samples that you can check out, and, I mean, that's pretty
3378980	3379980	sweet.
3379980	3382020	You know, you get to actually try them before you buy them.
3382020	3384620	That's good, because considering most of the bands that are supposed to be on this service
3384620	3386580	are bands I've never heard of, that's kind of needed.
3386580	3390980	I take that back, it wasn't 30 seconds, it was a free demo, it's one minute or 35% of
3390980	3393700	the song, whatever is shorter.
3393700	3399460	So you basically get a third of the song, I mean, that's still pretty cool that at least
3399460	3401780	you get to try them out before you buy them.
3401780	3404380	Yeah, I think it's important to hear what you're buying, especially because you're taking
3404380	3406620	a gamble on a lot of these songs, I think.
3406620	3407620	Yeah, exactly.
3407620	3410900	So, I mean, hey, that's good, I'm glad.
3410900	3416680	Also the Rock Band Network store will be coming to the Playstation 3 as well, however not
3416680	3418240	to the Wii.
3418240	3424940	And as of right now, though, the development tools to put songs on the actual Rock Band
3424940	3429340	Network are only available through the XNA program, but they are going to pick select
3429340	3435020	songs from that Rock Band Network and actually put them on to the Playstation 3.
3435020	3440740	So basically the Playstation 3 will kind of have the greatest hits of the Rock Band Network,
3440740	3443940	whereas the 360 will still have the bulk of the songs.
3443940	3449780	Well, I guess it's nice to get that better than nothing, I suppose.
3449780	3451620	But who's to say what the best is?
3451620	3455820	You're kind of relying on, or maybe the best sellers, I guess, because otherwise you're
3455820	3459220	relying on someone's opinion, which could be dangerous, but I guess if it's best sellers
3459220	3463700	that's a little more fair, or, you know, critically acclaimed or something, I don't know.
3463700	3468940	Yeah, apparently what's involved with it is not every song on the Rock Band Network will
3468940	3471700	be available for PlayStation 3 owners.
3471700	3476860	The option to bring over a song to the PS3 version of the store will be offered at Harmonix's
3476860	3481460	discretion, and even then it will be an opt-in.
3481460	3485700	The artists have to do some paperwork to properly port their songs to the Playstation Network,
3485700	3488140	a process that Harmonix believes no one will refuse.
3488140	3491060	It's more revenue.
3491060	3494820	I am so excited, by the way, about Rock Band Beatles, can I just say?
3494820	3495820	I'm so looking forward to seeing them.
3495820	3496820	So am I.
3496820	3497820	Did you see the demo that they had at Fry's?
3497820	3498820	No.
3498820	3499820	Oh, yes.
3499820	3500820	No, I didn't see the demo at Fry's.
3500820	3501820	Did they really?
3501820	3502820	I missed it.
3502820	3506980	No, I saw some other demos, but not of Rock Band Beatles, I saw a Rock Band demo, but
3506980	3507980	it wasn't the Beatles.
3507980	3508980	There's some kids playing it.
3508980	3509980	Huh.
3509980	3511060	Yeah, they actually had Rock Band Beatles.
3511060	3513860	I don't know why, I'm just like really excited about it, even though I'm not like a huge
3513860	3514860	Beatles fan.
3514860	3518620	Well, I mean, certainly I respect them, and they have a lot of great songs, I just, I
3518620	3521020	wouldn't consider myself like a rabid Beatles fan, you know what I mean?
3521020	3522020	Yeah.
3522020	3526280	Like I just think this game is gonna be so cool, like I'm just, and, you know, what a
3526280	3533740	tribute to what they're doing over there with this game, that it's making a whole new generation.
3533740	3537300	I mean, obviously I'm a little older than most people that probably listen to this show,
3537300	3540860	but I would say a lot of the, you know, college kids that listen to this show are probably
3540860	3542460	excited about this too.
3542460	3545800	What a testament to that, that, you know, Rock Band's making people excited about the
3545800	3547340	frickin' Beatles all over again.
3547340	3549340	I just think it's neat.
3549340	3550340	I agree.
3550340	3551340	So.
3551340	3553180	I'm looking forward to it, you know, I'm gonna get it.
3553180	3554280	Oh, yeah.
3554280	3558960	We should rock, rock, have a rock star party one night and get our Beatles on, be fun.
3558960	3559960	Hell yeah.
3559960	3564680	Anyhow, hey, but if you don't wanna play music games, one thing you can do with your 360
3564680	3570520	or PS3 or soon, the Nintendo Wii, is this new service called Play On.
3570520	3574200	It's actually already on the 360 and the PS3, but apparently the service is about to be
3574200	3576880	going into beta for the Wii.
3576880	3582140	This service will actually stream both Netflix and Hulu to your Wii.
3582140	3588440	It basically builds a bridge between your computer and your Nintendo Wii, but hey, it's
3588440	3593320	a way to get these services on your television if all you have is a Wii.
3593320	3598800	It is a 14-day free trial, but after that you have to pay $40 if you wanna keep the
3598800	3599800	service.
3599800	3601960	The MediaMall.com is where you can pick this up.
3601960	3604440	I thought Diversity already did that for free.
3604440	3608520	You know, at least, I'm not sure about the Netflix, but I know, I think you can stream
3608520	3611240	Hulu with Diversity.
3611240	3614760	I had Diversity for a little while, but it was kinda hard to figure out.
3614760	3616720	I use it all the time.
3616720	3621960	We watched a RiffTrax movie on that the other day, Prisoner of Azkaban.
3621960	3626080	But yeah, we use it for streaming movies and pornography all the time.
3626080	3627080	Mainly movies, but yeah.
3627080	3630560	Maybe I need to get the newer version of that or something, but the PS3 streams stuff pretty
3630560	3634000	well, but it doesn't tap into Netflix and Hulu.
3634000	3635360	That's what makes this other thing pretty cool.
3635360	3636360	Diversity does.
3636360	3642040	I think it will actually tap into, I think you can set different streams on YouTube.
3642040	3646240	It has a bunch of old TV shows, like Star Trek and stuff on there that you can actually
3646240	3647240	tap into.
3647240	3651040	G4, I think it does Hulu, and then some other stuff.
3651040	3652040	But it's free.
3652040	3655600	I mean, so I would try the free solution first if that doesn't work out for you.
3655600	3657080	Then maybe there's a paid program.
3657080	3660680	Granted, I haven't looked at Diversity in a year and a half, so maybe that's why.
3660680	3661680	Yeah.
3661680	3662680	I love it.
3662680	3663680	It works pretty good.
3663680	3664680	Hmm.
3664680	3668640	Well, I'd be definitely curious to check that out, but of course you can't get that on the
3668640	3669640	Wii.
3669640	3670640	I think it does work on the Wii, actually.
3670640	3671640	Really?
3671640	3673680	It's done through a web interface or something.
3673680	3674680	I thought it did.
3674680	3676640	I could be completely wrong, because I don't ever use it on the Wii.
3676640	3677880	But the Wii can't do high def.
3677880	3679440	Does it stream high def if it's available?
3679440	3680920	Well, it can stream high def for, you know, standard definition.
3680920	3684080	Have you been watching high def porn?
3684080	3687640	I tend not to download the high def stuff, because the file size is larger, and it takes
3687640	3688640	a lot longer.
3688640	3693440	So, no, but we have streamed high def movies over on it, and it works pretty well.
3693440	3697240	Of course, you know, Wi-Fi probably wouldn't work well with high def, and definitely not
3697240	3698240	on the Wii.
3698240	3699240	All right.
3699240	3702640	Well, we're just about to the end of part A tonight of our show.
3702640	3705720	There's plenty more of Orange Lawn's radio still to come, but of course we can't say
3705720	3711000	goodbye to part A tonight without the Classic Game of the Week.
3711000	3712000	That's right.
3712000	3714360	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week, the part of the show where our very own Dark
3714360	3717920	Sakura takes a trip to the vault and pulls out a video game that she thinks, you know
3717920	3718920	what?
3718920	3720920	You guys ought to be playing this game.
3720920	3722200	Why are you not playing this?
3722200	3724200	Probably because they can't.
3724200	3729160	Yeah, usually you pick a lot of games on systems that are just kind of hard to find these days.
3729160	3731640	I did get picked something kind of obscure this week.
3731640	3732640	That's all right.
3732640	3733640	Obscure is fine.
3733640	3735480	Maybe next week you can pick something more mainstream, but that's okay.
3735480	3737480	You pick whatever the hell you want, Dark Sakura.
3737480	3738480	Hell yeah.
3738480	3740360	What is tonight's Classic Game of the Week?
3740360	3746800	Tonight's Classic Game is a little shooter called Robo-Elast.
3746800	3755120	I don't know if anyone else knows this game, but it's, um, it was a Sega CD game and it's
3755120	3758560	actually, it really is a fun game.
3758560	3765380	It was put out by Tengen in 1992 in Japan, 93 in America.
3765380	3777600	So it's like feudal Japan having giant mecha is pretty much the story of the game.
3777600	3783600	And one of the pilots is fighting against the other feudal lords.
3783600	3791920	And you play someone named Kage who is one of Nobunaga's robot ninja army and you're
3791920	3800360	flying the Elast, which is a big robot with a gun who looks very much like samurai armor.
3800360	3804480	So yeah, pretty kind of weird storyline, but it's pretty funny.
3804480	3808280	Oh, in Japan, by the way, it was called Denin Elast.
3808280	3812280	So it's one of those vertical shooters.
3812280	3818080	You have enemies coming forward and behind you and to the side and you have a boss and
3818080	3819620	yeah, shooter.
3819620	3821700	So you've got different kind of weapons.
3821700	3825840	You have Raisenha, which is a lightning attack.
3825840	3837440	You have Husha Shuriken, which is, um, like big stars, um, the Hiei Meppujin, which is
3837440	3839920	also called the flying shadow formation.
3839920	3845900	So you can, uh, have options that fly up in front of you and the Bakuryu Hosenka, which
3845900	3848600	is a exploding flower.
3848600	3851480	So it's like little bombs going out and it's pretty cool little game.
3851480	3853200	I mean, there's not really much else to say.
3853200	3856240	It's just a shooter, but it's fun.
3856240	3857240	Oh yeah.
3857240	3859480	And by the way, it was developed by Compile.
3859480	3861840	So it's in that family.
3861840	3862840	Awesome.
3862840	3866040	Pretty cool game, what do you think?
3866040	3867880	Um, yeah, it sounds kind of fun.
3867880	3871560	I like looking at this, it looks like a fun little shooter.
3871560	3875120	Um, it almost looks white screen to me.
3875120	3876400	I don't know if that's just the way they capture it.
3876400	3881200	No, I guess this is kind of a standard size, but kind of interesting because obviously
3881200	3884680	they didn't make games on widescreen back then, but you know, just however, they occasionally
3884680	3888220	did make some shooters where you could turn your TV sideways.
3888220	3889360	That is so why would you do that?
3889360	3891000	Isn't that dangerous for your TV?
3891000	3896120	How do you think about a shooters are built and that there's actually quite a number of
3896120	3905040	games that are made with the monitor being in a, uh, in the top of the cabinet and using
3905040	3906040	a mirror.
3906040	3911280	So the game will play reverse and you and the mirror will show it right side.
3911280	3912520	I think I've seen one of those before.
3912520	3919480	Yeah, but it's done a lot of times for purposes of, uh, getting the right kind of, uh, screen
3919480	3920480	shape.
3920480	3924600	Uh, as she went on her mat in chat says, uh, wait, are you saying feudal Japan didn't have
3924600	3925600	meccas?
3925600	3933120	No, feudal Japan did not have meccas and frisbee giant enemy crabs or giant enemy crabs.
3933120	3934120	You know what?
3934120	3940320	In the movie I saw the head giant enemy crab set in Japan was that it's called the house
3940320	3943120	where evil dwells.
3943120	3947880	This was a movie that I had been looking for since I saw it when I was like six or seven
3947880	3952700	and it's one of the early American movies that did Japanese style horror and they is
3952700	3954640	about these people that moved to Japan.
3954640	3959240	One of them is a writer and he wants inspiration except they end up being possessed by ghosts
3959240	3960640	who lived in the house.
3960640	3964440	But there's a scene where like a good daughter gets thrown out of the tree by a giant demon
3964440	3972000	crab and they make grunting noises at her.
3972000	3973320	All righty, whatever you're into.
3973320	3974320	There you go.
3974320	3975320	All right.
3975320	3978880	Robo Alest is your classic video game of the week on the Sega CD.
3978880	3980880	And yes, you can get it in English.
3980880	3981880	It is available.
3981880	3986940	So check that out if you're Sega CDR and you want to see feudal Japan with a giant enemy
3986940	3987940	robots.
3987940	3988940	All right.
3988940	3991880	That's going to do it for tonight's Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not.
3991880	3996320	We've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your phone calls, your Twitter topics and
3996320	4001080	rapid fire news, as well as we're going to be talking a little bit about Walmart and
4001080	4005720	the possibility about arcades in Walmart's future beyond just the couple of games you
4005720	4006720	might see in the lobby.
4006720	4010640	We're going to talk about all that when we come back for Part B. So stay tuned here on
4010640	4018440	Orange Lounge Radio.
4018440	4024120	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, August the 30th of 2009,
4024120	4027720	where we of course tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio from six o'clock
4027720	4032720	Pacific Standard Time till, I don't know, around nine, whenever we feel like quitting.
4032720	4036460	That's the great thing about being on a flexible station like All Games Radio.
4036460	4040760	We don't have a set time limit when we have to finish, but poor Bobby, the show before
4040760	4045360	us, he has to finish by six o'clock because that's where we're usually on, but he's flexible
4045360	4046360	too.
4046360	4050080	Sadly, he won't be on next week because he's going to Penny Arcade Expo and hopefully will
4050080	4052800	be calling us next week from Penny Arcade Expo to give us the rundown.
4052800	4055160	We are all too poor to go this year.
4055160	4056720	Actually I'm saving up to go to PAX East.
4056720	4060840	I don't know about my wonderful co-hosts, but I know that's my goal is to get to Boston
4060840	4061840	next year.
4061840	4062840	So we'll see.
4062840	4063840	I'm saving up for more pasta.
4063840	4064840	All right.
4064840	4065840	I'm not traveling.
4065840	4066840	Yeah.
4066840	4067840	Not a big traveler?
4067840	4068840	No.
4068840	4069840	All right.
4069840	4071580	Well, I will represent OLR if no one else wants to, but you guys can do a show without
4071580	4072580	me that week.
4072580	4073580	That'd be tons of fun, won't it?
4073580	4074580	Sure.
4074580	4075580	All right.
4075580	4076580	All right.
4076580	4079680	Let's get back into some more gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4079680	4080680	Actually, wait.
4080680	4081680	I lied.
4081680	4082680	We're going to start with Twitter topics.
4082680	4084520	We're always going to start off part B with some Twitter topics.
4084520	4087560	And actually got us a little theme song this week.
4087560	4088560	That's right.
4088560	4093720	A little smooth jazz for your Twitter topics.
4093720	4098880	Starting off, reading some of the responses on Twitter at OLR and things you want us to
4098880	4104040	talk about tonight, Blade3 asks, laptop with fold-out panoramic screens.
4104040	4105040	Good for gamers.
4105040	4106040	Totally 3D.
4106040	4107040	I haven't heard of this.
4107040	4108680	You have a laptop now with fold-out monitors?
4108680	4110480	Loki, have you heard of this?
4110480	4111760	Nope, but it sounds cool.
4111760	4114800	It sounds cool, but isn't that like kind of expensive?
4114800	4116360	Kind of pointless?
4116360	4124840	It would be kind of ridiculous now, a PC with panoramic monitors I can get behind that.
4124840	4128000	At Deft wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, that was a plug for our show.
4128000	4129480	Thank you, At Deft.
4129480	4134960	Surtur wants to know, OLR, is the PS3 Slim slower than the PS3 Classic?
4134960	4139400	From what I've been reading, there are certain aspects that are definitely slower.
4139400	4144120	By the way, my Slim will be here Thursday, my first new console since the NES.
4144120	4145120	Game suggestions?
4145120	4147120	Depends what you like.
4147120	4155760	I guess, well, if you're getting in in a week or so, Guitar Hero 5, if you like that kind
4155760	4156760	of thing.
4156760	4161200	Otherwise, Madden if you like sports, I guess.
4161200	4162200	Download Mega Man 9.
4162200	4166080	If you haven't gamed since the NES, Mega Man 9 will be right up your alley.
4166080	4168080	I don't know.
4168080	4169800	That's a long time to go without, I promise you.
4169800	4171840	Buy some used $20 games or something.
4171840	4174720	It's like buying a Commando drop down price.
4174720	4180840	Dan Shadow says, OLR, the indie game PB Winterbottom is finally coming to Xbox Live after a great
4180840	4182880	showing at E3 2008.
4182880	4183880	This looks good.
4183880	4184880	I've never heard of this.
4184880	4186720	PB Winterbottom, have you heard of this?
4186720	4191280	I think this is actually one of the games that 2K is actually publishing on Xbox Live
4191280	4192280	Arcade.
4192280	4196000	It's an independent game, but they're publishing two games that are going to be on Xbox Live
4196000	4197000	Arcade.
4197000	4203280	I haven't heard too much about it, but it looked neat.
4203280	4209840	Let's see, Spazinator says, how about a discussion, sorry, Spazinator PSN says, how about a discussion
4209840	4213760	about upcoming known features for the 360 and PS3 tonight?
4213760	4214760	That's kind of vague.
4214760	4216760	I don't know if there was a particular thing of mine.
4216760	4219200	We talked a little bit about Twitter and Facebook.
4219200	4220880	What's on the horizon for PlayStation 3?
4220880	4222560	We talked about their update a little bit last week.
4222560	4224440	Do we know any other features on the horizon?
4224440	4225440	I don't know.
4225440	4227440	It's just pretty much what they've discussed already.
4227440	4234560	They're going to have, obviously, the Facebook, Twitter stuff, the Last.fm thing that they're
4234560	4237760	going to be adding on there.
4237760	4244320	Whatever else they tend to throw in there as well, I guess, they've pretty much announced
4244320	4245320	everything already.
4245320	4248280	Unless they announce some more stuff at PAX, I don't think they have any press conferences
4248280	4249280	at PAX.
4249280	4256840	As far as the PlayStation 3 goes, there's supposed to be a lot of stuff for the 3.0
4256840	4265480	firmware upgrade, like the animated themes and the what's new portion of it.
4265480	4266480	I don't know.
4266480	4269440	I don't really care about here, unfortunately.
4269440	4273600	Ray Iannami says, I'd like to bring up Tetris the Grandmaster 4, which got announced, but
4273600	4276000	I'm going to wait until more details to request it.
4276000	4277520	Oops, I guess I read it anyway.
4277520	4280280	Is that the new one that they've talked about that's supposed to be coming out on Wii?
4280280	4282000	Or is this a whole new Tetris game?
4282000	4289160	No, that's DS and Wii, it was like Tetris Party or something like that, it was different.
4289160	4291000	Unless that's like calling Grandmaster 4.
4291000	4295040	Hold on, I'm getting a picture right now of what this new little dual screen laptop looks
4295040	4296040	like.
4296040	4300840	Wow, that looks actually kind of crappy.
4300840	4302880	It looks like a bad Photoshop or something.
4302880	4303880	That's awful.
4303880	4304880	Alright.
4304880	4306880	One more tweet from Tigerclaw305.
4306880	4310160	Imagine sitting next to someone on a plane with that, watching a movie.
4310160	4313960	Oh my god, as if the overweight people weren't bad enough.
4313960	4321320	Tigerclaw305 says, Piracy protection is why PSP Go's battery isn't removable.
4321320	4323280	There's no such thing as not removable.
4323280	4327080	Apparently the whole Pandora's battery thing is the reason why the PSP Go's battery you
4327080	4328080	can't take it off.
4328080	4329080	Yeah, but they forget one thing.
4329080	4333920	No one's going to buy the PSP Go, and if you really want to put homebrew and pirate stuff,
4333920	4339040	you're going to buy PSP 3000, which is also readily available for less than the PSP Go.
4339040	4340920	What if they stop making PSP 3000?
4340920	4341920	They're not going to.
4341920	4342920	You think?
4342920	4347080	They'll piss off a lot of people if they do that.
4347080	4352160	By the way, there's a comment right here from John Collar, the Sony Computer Entertainment
4352160	4355520	Association, America's president.
4355520	4358560	You won't be able to rip your games and play them on the PSP Go system.
4358560	4360280	The firmware precludes that.
4360280	4363920	There's no external battery, so there's a number of protections put into place on the
4363920	4364920	system.
4364920	4367240	Oh, ho, ho, ho, you're just throwing out another challenge, aren't you?
4367240	4368560	Just stop doing that.
4368560	4373440	They really want to take it apart to get to the battery they can, okay?
4373440	4377880	People will take apart their systems to mod it if they really need to.
4377880	4381320	And just saying that you can't do it doesn't mean it's not possible, because every single
4381320	4383720	firmware that you've released has been cracked immediately.
4383720	4384720	All right.
4384720	4386160	That's enough for Twitter topics.
4386160	4389880	If you have more you want to contribute, we'll open up the Skypline a little later in the
4389880	4390880	show.
4390880	4394520	Sorry if we didn't get to your tweet, but we want to get to some rapid fire news.
4394520	4397160	Loki, some quick topics to start us off tonight.
4397160	4398160	All right.
4398160	4401520	Well, let's start off with a little bit of Tim Curry news.
4401520	4408160	He's apparently doing the voice of the villain in Dragon Age Origins, and that makes that
4408160	4411400	game 100% cooler now.
4411400	4413760	So he's going to be a calculating villain.
4413760	4416240	Tim Curry makes every game better.
4416240	4417480	Yes.
4417480	4426120	Also in other news, Space Invaders and Bust A Move are headed to the Blackberry.
4426120	4430280	You know, mainly you see a lot of new games coming to the iPhone, but yes, it's nice to
4430280	4433400	see that the Blackberry is getting some new stuff as well.
4433400	4437740	And both of those are going to be available, I guess, for $4.99 and feature two different
4437740	4441120	control schemes.
4441120	4448480	And then finally, Peggle Knights is coming to Xbox Live Arcade via an expansion for Peggle.
4448480	4452320	And of course, that will pretty much double the amount of levels that are available in
4452320	4460640	there and will feature three new achievements worth a total of 50 Microsoft points, or I
4460640	4464480	guess achievement points, not Microsoft points.
4464480	4467640	No word yet on what the expansion is going to cost, but it will be coming out sometime
4467640	4469840	this fall.
4469840	4474200	Moving on to some more news about a game we heard about a while ago that I haven't seen
4474200	4478760	any new news on lately, but iPet is actually coming out on November 17th.
4478760	4480520	It's finally been dated.
4480520	4484300	iPet is a game that you use the PlayStation Eye, I guess, to actually interact with a
4484300	4485800	small little pet.
4485800	4490640	An eye-equipped bundle with the game is coming out for $60.
4490640	4494560	I guess the game is supposedly like the old game Seaman on the Dreamcast, you remember
4494560	4495560	that?
4495560	4498560	But it's not quite as weird.
4498560	4502680	And it's a monkey, a little monkey instead of a little seahorse or whatever it was in
4502680	4503680	that game.
4503680	4505120	He's much cuter than Seaman.
4505120	4506120	That's right.
4506120	4512320	N Plus is developing a new game called Slick Entertainment Made N Plus.
4512320	4516100	They are now making a new game called Scrap Metal that's had a little trailer release
4516100	4517340	this week.
4517340	4521020	It's a top-down racing game, and it looks kind of like, if you remember, Super Off-Road,
4521020	4523560	which is like the quintessential Pizza Party game.
4523560	4525440	Yeah, or like Super Sprint or something like that.
4525440	4527960	Rock and Roll Racing is another game it's being compared to.
4527960	4528960	All those games.
4528960	4533640	But, of course, a newer type of physics engine, and it looks like the track doesn't all show
4533640	4536440	on the screen at once, but it looks pretty cool.
4536440	4537920	It does look really sweet.
4537920	4541320	I bet this game will be a lot of fun to play on Xbox Live Arcade, so keep an eye out for
4541320	4542320	that.
4542320	4544560	And lastly, some of your Rock Band updates this week.
4544560	4548980	Some of the songs that will be coming out to Rock Band this week include The Talking
4548980	4555080	Heads and She Was, Cross-Eyed and Painless, Girlfriend is Better, Once in a Lifetime,
4555080	4556080	and Take Me to the River.
4556080	4560440	All of those games coming out on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Rock Band this week,
4560440	4567040	as well as some individual songs from Avenged Sevenfold, The Jam, Oasis, and Rage Against
4567040	4568040	the Machine.
4568040	4571120	Guerrilla Radio is coming out on Rock Band.
4571120	4574040	Oasis, by the way, a live song coming from that, Supersonic.
4574040	4579200	Apparently, you won't be seeing Oasis live anymore, as one of them threw a hissy fit,
4579200	4580200	as tends to happen.
4580200	4589040	I really like how it was said in an episode of Phineas and Ferb.
4589040	4590840	It was a diva tantrum.
4590840	4592320	Yeah, a diva tantrum.
4592320	4595720	You know, I think Perez Hilton said that, too.
4595720	4597020	So there you go.
4597020	4598800	That's some of my rapid-fire news.
4598800	4599800	Star Sakura.
4599800	4606320	Well, let's move forward with all that other stuff, as soon as my computer catches up.
4606320	4607320	There we go.
4607320	4611760	They changed the date for the release of Scribblenauts in the UK.
4611760	4616840	They said it's actually going to be pushed out until October 9th instead of September
4616840	4617840	15th.
4617840	4618840	That sucks.
4618840	4621200	Well, we're getting it on September 15th.
4621200	4625080	I know, but I'm being epithetic for them.
4625080	4626880	Yeah.
4626880	4639920	Also, there is a Star Wars adventure game using the SCUMM engine, but it's actually
4639920	4642440	fan-made.
4642440	4651240	It's called Han Solo Adventures, and it's an adventure game studio game, so it gets
4651240	4659800	the old LucasArts-type game, but it's supposed to be based on the early life of Han Solo.
4659800	4660800	Han Solo.
4660800	4661800	The early years.
4661800	4664160	Taking Star Wars fanboy wank to a whole new level.
4664160	4667440	Mr. I Shot First.
4667440	4673120	And then, in other news, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is getting four new characters, two of them
4673120	4678620	being Tatsunoko characters and two of them being Capcom characters, and it's being announced
4678620	4683520	at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, so who knows?
4683520	4687720	Maybe we'll get a Joe from Gatchaman.
4687720	4689320	Phoenix Wright, please.
4689320	4690320	Prank Quest.
4690320	4691320	Prank Quest.
4691320	4692320	Come on.
4692320	4693320	That would be hilarious.
4693320	4696020	That would actually be a really good one for Western audiences, too, I think, v. Frank
4696020	4697020	West.
4697020	4698020	Yeah, I like that.
4698020	4701800	I love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, except the end boss is a bitch.
4701800	4703800	What if we're getting Kaze?
4703800	4705520	Who knows?
4705520	4709480	Or Puzzle Fighter Dan.
4709480	4710480	They could draw a bunch of red bricks.
4710480	4714160	All right, let's get back into some long discussions, we have a few topics we want to spend a little
4714160	4715160	more time on tonight.
4715160	4719700	All right, well, there's a rumor going around that EA is the one responsible for holding
4719700	4727760	back PS3 cross-game chat, and the reason being is that one of their older games, and people
4727760	4731960	are not exactly going to say which one, although I remember reading somewhere that they think
4731960	4740880	it's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apparently doesn't support custom soundtracks,
4740880	4743080	I guess, or something to that effect.
4743080	4745080	What was it?
4745080	4750920	Oh, it was one of the ones, I guess, that didn't use an in-game cross-media bar or something
4750920	4755680	like that, didn't support it, and because I don't know why a year-old Harry Potter game
4755680	4760960	would be a big game for them still, because of that game, they didn't want the other games
4760960	4763400	making that game look bad or something like that, so.
4763400	4765080	Yeah, but what's our source on this?
4765080	4767080	I mean, is this coming from a respectable-
4767080	4768880	It's from an insider, you know.
4768880	4771760	Are we talking the Ars Technica mole, who's usually pretty believable?
4771760	4773160	No, some other dude, I don't know.
4773160	4775000	It's some dude on a forum?
4775000	4781240	It's not some dude on a forum, but some, like, super, it's a guy, which has the worst screen
4781240	4783800	name ever, a guy called Super Secret.
4783800	4787000	See, do you see why I'm taking this with a grain of salt?
4787000	4788000	Yeah.
4788000	4789000	It's some dude on a forum.
4789000	4792280	I would have more respect for him if he was called Secret Squirrel.
4792280	4793280	Secret Squirrel.
4793280	4794280	I love Secret Squirrel.
4794280	4797600	Would that be your mole name if you were to spill trade secrets on a web forum, Secret
4797600	4798600	Squirrel?
4798600	4799600	I would be Secret Squirrel.
4799600	4800600	There you go.
4800600	4805480	Yeah, sj100matt in our chat room tonight asked, so I can't play Dragon Force while I play
4805480	4806480	Harry Potter.
4806480	4807480	Nope.
4807480	4808480	Yeah.
4808480	4809480	Doesn't sound like it.
4809480	4810480	Apparently, PS3 titles-
4810480	4812400	I don't understand why that would hold up voice chat, though.
4812400	4813400	So what?
4813400	4815000	You don't have to cross-media bar in an old-ass game.
4815000	4820640	It's basically, um, well, what it was is custom soundtracks is actually what was the problem
4820640	4821640	holding it back.
4821640	4828160	Apparently, PS3 titles have to be developed with, um, custom soundtrack support in order
4828160	4834320	to, I guess, utilize voice chat, and apparently that was one of the titles that was before
4834320	4836920	all the whole custom soundtrack thing.
4836920	4839960	But who gives a- ah.
4839960	4840960	Whatever, you know.
4840960	4843920	I mean, so you can't chat back and forth.
4843920	4844920	Boohoo.
4844920	4849560	Well, it is something the Xbox has that, you know, the PS3 doesn't have, but I also just
4849560	4852000	don't like to talk to people while I'm trying to play other games.
4852000	4855160	Like, if we're playing a game together, yeah, of course I like to talk to people.
4855160	4856160	Like, 1 vs. 100?
4856160	4857960	Yeah, you have to do party chat in those games.
4857960	4858960	It's way more fun.
4858960	4862100	But, uh, you know, I don't- if somebody else is playing- or if- especially if I'm trying
4862100	4867580	to focus on a first-person game, like, I don't wanna- like, messages are bad enough.
4867580	4868720	I don't wanna talk to people.
4868720	4869720	Really?
4869720	4871960	Are people gonna wanna talk to each other while playing Harry Potter and the Order of
4871960	4872960	the Phoenix?
4872960	4873960	Yeah.
4873960	4876560	Because otherwise I'm playing this year-old Harry Potter game.
4876560	4880320	Which, by the way, if I ever ignore messages that you guys are sending me, don't take it
4880320	4882880	personally, but I'm probably just, like, in the middle of a game and I don't really wanna
4882880	4884920	stop and check messages, you know?
4884920	4886680	Or in the middle of a cutscene or something, you know?
4886680	4889480	People sending me invites to play random games that I don't own.
4889480	4892120	I used to get that a lot on 360.
4892120	4894640	I think people finally figured out I don't own some of those games, but-
4894640	4896640	I don't own Gears of War 2.
4896640	4897640	Interesting.
4897640	4903000	Alright, well, hey, um, another topic I wanna get into here is talking about the game DJ
4903000	4904000	Max Technica.
4904000	4906680	Yes, this game is continuing its little testing.
4906680	4908400	Apparently there's one here at Rosewood Golf Line.
4908400	4909400	We have a machine here locally.
4909400	4911440	I've not been out to play it yet.
4911440	4915360	But apparently there is a location test happening in the UK now.
4915360	4921120	It's at Hollywood Bowl Finchley, and that's in Finchley, part of London.
4921120	4924120	And so if you know where the Hollywood Bowl is at, you can check out a DJ Max Technica
4924120	4925120	machine if that's-
4925120	4926120	And report on it!
4926120	4927120	Yes.
4927120	4931480	But apparently, the other interesting thing, there's actually a test going on at a Walmart
4931480	4934520	right now in Santa Clarita.
4934520	4937560	Is happening at a Walmart Supercenter store.
4937560	4941320	Apparently, and this is why I wanted to bring this up, is it's not, you know, DJ Max has
4941320	4942920	been location testing for quite some time.
4942920	4946440	I don't think that's really news, but I think what is news about this is the fact that it's
4946440	4950600	happening at a Walmart of all places, and this is being reported by MomaniStyle.com
4950600	4953840	who really keeps tabs on what's going on with these music-based games.
4953840	4957660	But what's interesting about this is that apparently they're trying to actually kind
4957660	4961600	of move into the arcade business at Walmart.
4961600	4965200	And rumor is going around that if these tests work, that they're expanding some of these
4965200	4970640	arcades in certain locations, that many of the Walmarts everywhere are gonna see more
4970640	4974640	floor space dedicated to a dedicated arcade.
4974640	4980520	So I guess the big, was it the Cabela's Game Hunter games, and you know, the Deer Hunters
4980520	4981520	and all that?
4981520	4983480	They're not bringing as much money in as they were before?
4983480	4988000	Hey, we did have Jumbo Safari at Walmart for a long time.
4988000	4989000	I don't know.
4989000	4992600	I do see Walmarts, you know, their arcades and stuff, and I think all it really takes
4992600	4995840	is just replacing the games they have with some better games.
4995840	5000080	Well, and that's the other thing, is that I think most Walmarts already have like a
5000080	5001960	little arcade, but not all of them.
5001960	5003600	I've been to Walmarts that don't have them.
5003600	5004920	The one near my house doesn't.
5004920	5007640	Yeah, some don't have any arcade games whatsoever.
5007640	5010840	So imagine if this was something that would be mandated as part of a Walmart.
5010840	5013560	Like, for example, those Super Centers have a lot of stuff in them.
5013560	5017320	You know, the Vision Centers, the Nails, the Nail Place, the McDonalds, I think they cut
5017320	5018720	your hair in them too.
5018720	5022080	Imagine if they had a section for arcade, and it actually makes a lot of sense, drop
5022080	5025800	the kids off there while you do your shopping, it'll make a lot of sense.
5025800	5030880	Definitely, and I remember back in the day when they had arcade games, regardless of
5030880	5036800	the stores, I remember we used to have like a, was it a Food Max or like a big warehouse
5036800	5043640	food store that had a Neo Geo, you know, multi-game system in there, and I used to love playing
5043640	5045800	like Magician's Lord and stuff like that.
5045800	5046800	It was awesome.
5046800	5047800	I had that game in the vault.
5047800	5053160	So, you know, I'm all for more places having arcade games.
5053160	5057000	Hell, there's even 7-Elevens I see now that do not have an arcade game in them.
5057000	5058680	What the hell?
5058680	5061400	That is just blasphemy right there.
5061400	5063360	Lots of 7-Elevens don't have arcade games anymore.
5063360	5064360	I know, what the hell?
5064360	5065640	That was where I used to play Mortal Kombat 2.
5065640	5067120	But it wasn't a 7-Eleven, it was a knockoff.
5067120	5068120	It was like called QuickMart.
5068120	5070120	It was a little place in the town I grew up.
5070120	5071120	Street Fighter 2.
5071120	5073520	They actually had Mortal Kombat 2, and it was huge when it first came out, like they
5073520	5074520	had it.
5074520	5075520	It was awesome.
5075520	5079760	Street Fighter 2, and I remember there was a local diner that had Captain Commando.
5079760	5082200	Oh, we used to play that all the time.
5082200	5087200	Wouldn't that be weird though if arcades make a comeback thanks to Walmart?
5087200	5089360	Although I don't think it would be the same type of arcade.
5089360	5092800	Like if it is a babysitting place at Walmart, this is an arcade I want to stay the hell
5092800	5093800	away from.
5093800	5096840	It's going to be weird if they have stuff like DJ Max Technica and like the cool new
5096840	5099640	games people want to play.
5099640	5107160	Well maybe the whole DJ Max Technica testing at Walmart is to test its durability.
5107160	5110440	That is going to be a big resource because you have to bring in people to fix those machines.
5110440	5114040	But then again, something huge like Walmart, you could have a dude that just goes around
5114040	5117280	all the different Walmarts in the area and fixes all the arcade machines.
5117280	5119340	You know, and I'm sure the machines would make decent money.
5119340	5121760	And then he'd shoot himself at the end of the week.
5121760	5125640	You don't have to have the most top of the line games, I'm sure, at a Walmart arcade
5125640	5126880	to be able to make some money.
5126880	5127880	Well, they don't.
5127880	5129920	I mean, obviously these Deer Hunter games are making some money.
5129920	5132200	I've seen a dude playing those games.
5132200	5134640	Dude, I played one once.
5134640	5138080	I remember there was a Walmart near here that had a DDR solo machine in it.
5138080	5139080	It was like, what the fuck?
5139080	5141340	Yeah, I remember that.
5141340	5142340	What the hell?
5142340	5148160	All right, so Walmart might possibly be the next resurgence of arcade gaming.
5148160	5153400	And I'm not sure how I feel about that, but to be continued.
5153400	5156760	Makes me feel kind of dirty.
5156760	5157760	Kind of dirty.
5157760	5158760	I think that's a good word for it.
5158760	5159760	A little dirty.
5159760	5164600	Well, luckily you can get bath soap and all sorts of things to clean yourself off with
5164600	5168300	at Walmart in the bathing aisle.
5168300	5174400	So anyway, moving on with more gaming news.
5174400	5178480	Sonic and Knuckles is supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think is pretty
5178480	5179680	epic.
5179680	5184120	On top of that, it will have the card stacking deal.
5184120	5187760	So on September 9th, we can look forward to this.
5187760	5193180	You just have to have the original games on the Xbox Live Arcade for that to work.
5193180	5198520	With Sonic the Hedgehog, you get the Blue Sphere chaos level.
5198520	5200960	Then with Sonic 2, you'll be able to play as Knuckles.
5200960	5204480	And then, of course, you know how it worked with Sonic 3.
5204480	5206360	So that's pretty cool.
5206360	5209760	Wait, so if I have those other games on Xbox Live, I get that?
5209760	5212300	Or does this all come free with Sonic and Knuckles?
5212300	5215280	It comes free with Sonic and Knuckles, the add-on capability.
5215280	5218040	If you had the cartridges, it'd work the same way.
5218040	5221180	But do I have to have the other games downloaded, you think?
5221180	5226600	You do have to have Sonic 2 to be able to play Knuckles in Sonic 2.
5226600	5228480	It's just like owning the cartridges.
5228480	5229480	Got it.
5229480	5233200	This is different, this is in cartridges now, so I was just kind of wondering if they were
5233200	5235520	coming with the download or what have you.
5235520	5236860	That's all in GameTap anyway.
5236860	5242120	If I play those games, it's usually where I go to play it.
5242120	5243120	I don't know.
5243120	5247280	I'm not really interested in purchasing those games, especially since you can just buy the...
5247280	5250400	Yeah, I have the Mega Collection, which I don't know if it has Sonic and Knuckles on
5250400	5251400	it, I can't remember.
5251400	5252400	Probably not.
5252400	5255720	I think it has Sonic and Knuckles, but I don't think it has the add-ons, like this does.
5255720	5258880	But I have a feeling this wouldn't work with the Genesis Mega Collection.
5258880	5261120	I just have a feeling it would not.
5261120	5264680	They want you to buy the other games, or buy them again.
5264680	5270200	So speaking of companies holding back other companies for doing things, I don't know if
5270200	5276400	we touched on this last week about Final Fantasy XIV and the reason why it's not coming to
5276400	5277800	the Xbox 360.
5277800	5283920	Well apparently Microsoft was holding them back from putting an MMO on there.
5283920	5287840	Well apparently the same thing is now happening with Champions Online.
5287840	5293720	Apparently it's just Microsoft doesn't have the framework built in place, or they're just
5293720	5295960	not willing to conform to what they're looking for.
5295960	5297480	Um, Final Fantasy XI?
5297480	5300480	I know they do, but XI's a little different I think.
5300480	5305060	But for whatever reason- Well XI had that whole Play Online front-end,
5305060	5307600	but it was a little awkward on the Xbox 360.
5307600	5310280	Well I guess it was no different from PlayStation 2.
5310280	5311520	They actually function very similar.
5311520	5314680	You have to just log in through the Play Online front-end first, and the same thing on the
5314680	5318720	PC, and then you can get into the game, but it was always kind of a little weird.
5318720	5324360	Yeah I guess because Final Fantasy XI was the exception to the rule I guess, but apparently
5324360	5328960	there's something that they're doing, some sort of red tape, that's holding up a bunch
5328960	5331920	of different games from being on there.
5331920	5335880	Do you think this could be a bad misstep by Microsoft, because PlayStation 3 is going
5335880	5336880	to be getting some MMOs, right?
5336880	5337880	I think so.
5337880	5339200	They have the DC Universe coming out, we know that.
5339200	5343240	I think the one DC Universe and the Agency and stuff like that starts coming out on the
5343240	5348440	PS3 that might put a little bit more pressure on them to get their act together.
5348440	5352920	I am kind of surprised that we haven't really seen a lot of MMOs on 360.
5352920	5361820	There's supposed to be that Marvel one that kind of fell through, so I don't know.
5361820	5364920	But yet they have Final Fantasy XI, but I guess I don't know if that front-end makes
5364920	5366080	the difference or what.
5366080	5368880	Because I heard Final Fantasy XIV does not have Play Online.
5368880	5371640	They're doing away with that whole thing, which is good.
5371640	5373080	Play Online was crap.
5373080	5379080	It was interesting at first, but the thing is that it really served no purpose unless
5379080	5384400	you also played Tetra Master, which very, very, very, very, very few people did.
5384400	5389080	Play Online was originally supposed to be a front-end for all these other Squeenix games,
5389080	5391720	but nothing else ever came out but Final Fantasy XI.
5391720	5395160	I think in Japan there might have been one or two others, but there really was nothing
5395160	5396760	anywhere else, and it made it kind of pointless.
5396760	5400200	That would be kind of cool if they still used Play Online to be able to connect to Final
5400200	5406960	Fantasy XIV on the 360, so say I bought Final Fantasy XI, I don't have to update anything
5406960	5411560	because it's still the Play Online viewer or whatever.
5411560	5415560	You wouldn't have it on one console and not have it on the other unless the players were
5415560	5418480	independent of each other, which I don't think is going to happen.
5418480	5420160	I can't see them going that direction.
5420160	5425320	SSJ100Matt in our chat room says, Play Online was a waste of space on my hard drive.
5425320	5426320	It was pretty good.
5426320	5427920	You couldn't really delete it, you know?
5427920	5429560	Yeah, you had to go through the uninstall.
5429560	5433800	You had to put back in the disk just to uninstall the game, and if you tried to delete it, it
5433800	5435680	would kind of screw things up.
5435680	5438600	It was just a nuisance.
5438600	5441120	It was a pure and utter nuisance to deal with.
5441120	5443680	Hopefully they're going to be smarter about it with Final Fantasy XIV, which it sounds
5443680	5446000	like they're going to do, so hey, cool.
5446000	5447520	In theory, right?
5447520	5448520	Yeah.
5448520	5453040	Well, kind of something interesting came to light this week about the new Rock Band Unplugged
5453040	5457400	demo that's out there and available right now.
5457400	5463720	Apparently though, the PSP Go is coming with a voucher that you get an exclusive demo of
5463720	5469960	Rock Band Unplugged for the PSP Go, so when you get your PSP Go, you get to download this
5469960	5477520	demo for Rock Band Unplugged, but the thing about this demo, it will also play downloads
5477520	5482900	from the Rock Band Unplugged store, so the demo comes with five songs, but if you don't
5482900	5486680	really want to buy the game, you don't have to.
5486680	5492520	You can just buy the additional songs you want to play and add those to your game, and
5492520	5494840	just continue to play Rock Band Unplugged that way.
5494840	5501120	So are they trying to do that to, see, I don't really get that.
5501120	5504280	That seems in the long run, wouldn't they end up losing some money on it?
5504280	5505280	No.
5505280	5508160	Well, but they gain the money from the song downloads, so it's weird.
5508160	5509160	It's just weird.
5509160	5511160	You know, you haven't really heard of a game distributed like that.
5511160	5513920	Because the song downloads, I mean, later on if you decide to buy the game, it'll still
5513920	5515600	work with the full game too.
5515600	5516600	Yeah.
5516600	5521480	I mean, really, the only asset then of getting the full game is getting the 40 whatever songs
5521480	5523360	that come with the game.
5523360	5528040	Because apparently the engine itself is going to download all onto your PSP Go.
5528040	5530100	Interesting.
5530100	5532360	That is very interesting.
5532360	5534800	I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.
5534800	5538560	I wonder if we're going to see more demos like that in the future, where essentially
5538560	5542720	all the sales are going to be based off of microtransactions, right?
5542720	5543720	Yeah.
5543720	5544720	So.
5544720	5545720	Mm-hmm.
5545720	5546720	Okay.
5546720	5553360	Well, we're going to take a little break here to get to the mailbag at mailbagatorangelawntrader.com.
5553360	5556160	Every week you guys send us emails and we talk about them here on the program.
5556160	5560160	The lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails
5560160	5561920	and reads them here live on air.
5561920	5564560	Dark Sakura, what do we have in the mailbag this week?
5564560	5568040	We have one from Loomis that says, prayer and thoughts to the OLR crew.
5568040	5571280	I've been watching the news lately regarding the fires in California and hope y'all aren't
5571280	5572280	affected.
5572280	5576000	We've been getting a little smoky air, but we're far enough north that all it does is
5576000	5577000	fuck with our weather.
5577000	5578000	Yeah.
5578000	5580200	We are totally far away from where all that is going on.
5580200	5584240	We're in the Sacramento region and most of the fires unfortunately are happening in Southern
5584240	5585240	California.
5585240	5586240	It's about seven hours away from us.
5586240	5587240	Yeah.
5587240	5588240	So most of it's far away.
5588240	5590440	So thanks for thinking of us.
5590440	5593880	If you really want to do something though, I know the Red Cross is always looking for
5593880	5597360	donations and things like that, and during these times they really need that stuff.
5597360	5598920	So think about it.
5598920	5602200	Well, next up comes from Rini.
5602200	5606920	Greetings and salutations to the crew, but for once I'd like to extend my admirations
5606920	5610600	to Dark Sakura for choosing motherfucking Silphied as the classic game of the week on
5610600	5613040	episode 335.
5613040	5617600	I bought that game completely out of randomness for an amazing $10 new, but that's not the
5617600	5619800	point of this email.
5619800	5623840	While not everyone out there will run out to play Silphied, I would like to share a
5623840	5626240	bizarre yet awesome experience with the game.
5626240	5628880	I had just started another session of the game.
5628880	5631540	Around the second stage or so, the game crashed.
5631540	5634980	The game screen completely went to a dark screen with white text, and it caught me off
5634980	5637320	guard since Silphied never did that before.
5637320	5642920	I didn't bump my Sega CDX, yes the rareportable one, ah windows, nor was there anything within
5642920	5647200	the vicinity to jolt my console, the game just suddenly glitched itself for no reason.
5647200	5650720	The interesting thing about this whole event is what was on screen.
5650720	5654020	Pyramid Head brandishing its cleaver, kidding.
5654020	5657920	What was on the screen was an apology, that's right, the game apologized.
5657920	5661620	What makes it even better is that the game was not only able to recover and head back
5661620	5666080	to the title screen, but it also shot off a free continue so I wouldn't lose my progress.
5666080	5670400	Sadly, I've never been able to replicate this, nor do I believe there is a documented instance
5670400	5675800	over the internet, so I guess it's a sad little cherished memory for me to have and love alone.
5675800	5681820	OLR Crew, have you had any experiences with unusual game behavior that stood out for you?
5681820	5687160	Just pushing, having to reset the Genesis in that X-Men game.
5687160	5691320	Outside of the Red Rings of Death, I would say maybe funny Engrish in games is always
5691320	5695440	a little bit of an experience, but I can't think of anything quite on the caliber of
5695440	5700160	what you're saying, that's a pretty neat little story about the game apologizing, I've never
5700160	5701160	heard of that.
5701160	5705920	I'm gonna have to fuck around with mine then, I'm gonna have to actually see if there's
5705920	5710080	anything about that online anywhere, there might be, who knows.
5710080	5715240	I've always thought that the game should apologize for me playing it, well not Silphie, but maybe
5715240	5718160	like Driver 3 or something like that.
5718160	5720960	Sorry that we made this game, I know it sucks, but hey.
5720960	5725840	We got apologized to by Blockbuster after renting a game that we brought back an hour
5725840	5726840	later.
5726840	5733120	We rented WCW Thunder, and it was so bad, we called Blockbuster and asked them if we
5733120	5736000	could take it back and they said they were sorry.
5736000	5738440	They let us get another game because it sucked that bad.
5738440	5742200	That sucks to have to apologize for something they really didn't do though, you know Blockbuster
5742200	5745840	is just the, I understand that that's just good customer service to let you bring the
5745840	5749240	game back and get a new one, but they shouldn't have to apologize for it, they didn't make
5749240	5750400	the game.
5750400	5754760	But I know that's good customer service and blah blah blah.
5754760	5764760	Well moving forward, from Shook, hello OLR, first off I want to say there was a typo in
5764760	5768560	my last letter, I meant to say that the K in my name is pronounced as if it were lowercase,
5768560	5769840	not silent.
5769840	5772940	So Shook will suffice from now on.
5772940	5776400	Now on to other things, my bigot dad, you have my permission to call him whatever nasty
5776400	5780800	name you want, finally discovered that I had Final Fantasy X when he saw me in the middle
5780800	5781800	of a battle.
5781800	5785380	Without a word, he ejected the disc, put it in its case, and put it in his safe keep.
5785380	5786380	What a bummer.
5786380	5791480	Luckily, he didn't find Chrono Trigger, which is a very good thing because I think, no because
5791480	5794900	I will guard that game with my life, no joke, I truly have stumbled upon the best thing
5794900	5796320	I've ever played.
5796320	5800840	And yes DarkSakura, I did do the ending where you beat it at the beginning, it was awesome.
5800840	5802520	Proceed to bag on my dad.
5802520	5805680	Now that that's over, I have a suggestion-
5805680	5808580	We'll come back at the end of the email, I do want to bag on your dad, but we'll come
5808580	5809580	back to that in a little while.
5809580	5813840	I have a suggestion for the Wii inflatable chair, I bet that there's going to be some
5813840	5818800	kind of fetish porn game that involves that inflatable chair so it's not completely bad.
5818800	5825560	PS, can't wait to join the OLR home club, my PSN username is MGS654, don't ask.
5825560	5831320	Your dad needs to-
5831320	5834920	Hold on a minute, I'm trying to kind of cue something up here because I-
5834920	5840760	The Tribble has a comment.
5840760	5842240	That was one angry Tribble.
5842240	5844160	That was a very angry Tribble.
5844160	5849600	Hold on, Shook, Shookadook, Shookadook, I want you to actually go get your father.
5849600	5855080	Will you please go get your father and put him on because I actually want to kind of
5855080	5856080	say something.
5856080	5859880	No, because then we want him to not be able to listen to the show.
5859880	5863240	But I don't care, I want to say something to this guy because this is-
5863240	5865480	I want him to be able to keep listening to the show.
5865480	5869480	I do, but obviously he's already listening to the show and apparently the dad doesn't
5869480	5874000	know about it, so you know, I don't think he'll know about it.
5874000	5880600	And he'll get in trouble for what you do, it sounds like that kind of person.
5880600	5885040	All I have to say, okay whether you want to replay this or not, I don't care, all I have
5885040	5890680	to say is that he should be thankful that you want to spend your time playing something
5890680	5899920	that takes intelligence, strategy, wit to play and conquer and it's a story.
5899920	5903720	You know, it's no worse than watching a movie or a miniseries and-
5903720	5905720	That his dad doesn't let him watch fantasy movies.
5905720	5909840	It's not going to make you gay, okay, for playing these games or what have you.
5909840	5912800	Heaven forbid you use your brain.
5912800	5916800	You know what, your dad should be thankful that he has a kid that would rather stay at
5916800	5921880	home and play a game like Final Fantasy X than go out and kill people and shoot guns
5921880	5930520	and rob stores and do drugs and have premarital sex without protection.
5930520	5934880	For the record it's okay to shoot guns as long as you have a supervised adult.
5934880	5938400	You know what I mean though, at least he should be thankful that you're not into gangs or
5938400	5940420	any of this stuff.
5940420	5945500	Because if he keeps trying to take this stuff away, that's how kids sometimes get involved
5945500	5948640	in this, is when they rebel, they rebel hard.
5948640	5952260	You sound smart enough where that's not going to happen, but your dad should be freaking
5952260	5958120	counting his blessings, that's all I have to say.
5958120	5961760	I can say I can vouch for that from experience.
5961760	5968940	Also one from Death Wishing, Rob, there is a Marvel vs Capcom 2 cabinet down the street
5968940	5970440	from me in a pizza shop.
5970440	5974280	I really want to use it because, well, they are rare, right?
5974280	5975280	They are?
5975280	5979720	I would totally steal that if stealing was legal, but man, none of my friends will join
5979720	5983580	me because they think fighting games are gay.
5983580	5986680	I don't care for that terminology.
5986680	5989880	Do you know a good fighting game that could turn them onto the genre?
5989880	5990880	P.S.
5990880	5992720	Don't say Street Fighter or they hate it.
5992720	5994920	Love Death Wishing.
5994920	5997640	Um, no.
5997640	6002360	I can't think of a game, honestly, Street Fighter 2 is like the pinnacle of fighting
6002360	6003360	games.
6003360	6005320	If they don't like that, there is nothing you can do.
6005320	6008200	There is just, there is no fighting game that's going to work.
6008200	6014680	I mean, you could try cutesy fighting games, but if Marvel vs Capcom 2 is too gay, then
6014680	6016960	sorry, but the other games are going to be even worse.
6016960	6019660	Mortal Kombat maybe.
6019660	6025320	You should all make them play, um, what was that awful fighting game, um, with the, it
6025320	6027140	was really, Pit Fighter, make them play Pit Fighter.
6027140	6031000	I have better, Pit Fighter is like the worst fighting game I've ever played in my life.
6031000	6033920	Here's, here's my suggestion, get new friends.
6033920	6034920	That's my suggestion.
6034920	6039360	Another email, oh god, this is long.
6039360	6043040	Hello to Darksacrosky and Loki, thank you for discussing and reading my tweet on the
6043040	6044040	last show.
6044040	6047920	I'm really passionate about Extra Life and what we gamers can do to make a difference,
6047920	6050000	so I'm glad you brought it up during the show.
6050000	6052480	Let me tell you a little bit about Extra Life.
6052480	6057440	Extra Life was started by the folks at sarcasticgamer.com and its founder is Doc Adams.
6057440	6061560	He has done some previous work with fundraisers before, but this has become something important
6061560	6062560	to him.
6062560	6066920	You can read about his inspiration, um, well the link doesn't work.
6066920	6072400	Um, as for my inspiration, I recently put up a story on Sarcastic Gamer pointing out
6072400	6073400	why I've become involved.
6073400	6075320	I'm going to read this.
6075320	6080360	The reason I've brought it up to OLR is that you guys have quite a great community.
6080360	6084560	I've been listening to this show since it became a podcast a long, long time ago and
6084560	6087920	I've since become a huge fan.
6087920	6094200	I know, I now listen to you guys on my iPhone on my drive to work or out on my morning runs.
6094200	6098600	I was happy you got to be part of all games years ago since I listened to Scott and AGI
6098600	6099600	way back in the day.
6099600	6103160	I never really was part of your forums or anything, but I always loved listening to
6103160	6104440	the show.
6104440	6108560	For Extra Life you can sign up through the main page at extralife.sarcasticgamer.com
6108560	6110680	and click on the sign up button.
6110680	6114720	It will take you to Texas Children's Hospital website and you can put up a donation page
6114720	6115720	there.
6115720	6116720	This will be a personal donation.
6116720	6119040	Wait, but this is something we do, not the listeners, right?
6119040	6121480	Yeah, unless listeners want to be.
6121480	6124760	Oh, like because we have a lot of people that have kind of their own things too, so okay,
6124760	6125760	that makes sense.
6125760	6129400	Yeah, I want to make sure that people, that people do know about this.
6129400	6134500	Um, and this will be a personal donation page that you can edit and change up quite a bit,
6134500	6138440	but more importantly you can send out the link to anyone so they can give you online
6138440	6139680	donations through the site.
6139680	6143840	You can also use PayPal for overseas donations as well.
6143840	6148240	Now from there you can also create a team so other participants can join with you.
6148240	6151520	Anyone else in your community can sign up and join your team as well.
6151520	6153000	We should totally do that.
6153000	6157760	It takes an aggregate total of those that join your team and you can see how much the
6157760	6159040	OLR team raises overall.
6159040	6161640	Oh, so don't, so then don't go make your own page.
6161640	6165360	Let us do it, which we were going to do in the next week here and then we'll tell you
6165360	6167600	guys what our little link is so we can all race together.
6167600	6170520	That would be fun.
6170520	6173660	You can even see how much each team member raises as well.
6173660	6174720	That is if you go there right now.
6174720	6178460	What it is is other people can make their own donation pages, but we can band them together
6178460	6179460	as a team.
6179460	6180460	Okay.
6180460	6181460	And it keeps an aggregate amount.
6181460	6183320	We'll have to go in there and kind of play with it and see what it looks like.
6183320	6188800	He put up his donation page, um, which, uh, is ways to give dot Texas children's dot org
6188800	6192040	slash net community slash Alan Ray, A-L-L-E-N-R-E-Y.
6192040	6194120	So if anyone wants to take a look at it.
6194120	6197520	As for the gamer day myself, um, itself, you can do whatever you want.
6197520	6200920	A lot of people will be videotaping and live streaming their gamer activities.
6200920	6204520	So if you, uh, guys and gals want to do it, it'll be cool.
6204520	6206560	I like your theme of obscure fucking vault games.
6206560	6207560	Ha ha ha.
6207560	6208560	It would be awesome.
6208560	6213440	Also, you would probably want to try having the marathon going and maybe broadcast and
6213440	6215040	record your podcast live that day.
6215040	6216600	We should totally do that.
6216600	6220800	It'll be a different show with the gaming marathon going on as well, but it might spice
6220800	6221800	things up.
6221800	6223800	We've done that at Bimani attorneys before.
6223800	6224800	Yeah.
6224800	6227080	I don't know how that's going to work because now I'm starting to think of the technical
6227080	6228280	aspect of it all.
6228280	6232480	That's going to be hard, but I think what's going to happen, I think we're going to have
6232480	6235480	more than just the three of us doing this.
6235480	6236760	We're going to get some other folks involved.
6236760	6241440	I imagine Dan's got to be involved one way or another somehow hopefully sign up and we'll
6241440	6244040	figure it, we'll figure it out, but we are doing it.
6244040	6247400	We just, we, we talked before the show tonight and we're going to make the commitment to
6247400	6248400	do it.
6248400	6250280	Um, so more details coming on that in the future.
6250280	6252380	So that's all going to go down October 17th.
6252380	6257520	And I, I don't know if any of the other all games folks are getting in on it because if
6257520	6261320	they're not, I would love to see what we can do with the stream that day.
6261320	6263120	But I think, is that a Saturday?
6263120	6266360	I think under station live is on Saturday and there might be some other shows, so we
6266360	6269440	might not be able to take over the all game stream all day, but we'll see what we can
6269440	6270440	do.
6270440	6273400	We're, we'll at least have some type of Ustream or Justin TV page that day.
6273400	6277760	Um, to continue, what do you think sounds fun, right?
6277760	6279120	Yeah, actually, yeah, it does.
6279120	6280120	Just think of it this way.
6280120	6282880	This will be the most fun thing you do to raise money for any charity.
6282880	6286560	Some people train for marathons like me, or ride a bike across the US.
6286560	6290040	You'll put out way, you'll put out way too many calories and at some point it's going
6290040	6291040	to hurt.
6291040	6293160	Take it from me, I hurt my knee training for my marathon.
6293160	6296560	You will never have more fun raising money and you just have to pick up a game controller.
6296560	6300400	We would love to have you added to the list of gamer sites participating.
6300400	6304400	I also hope you can reach out to other shows on the all games network like VGO and Bobby
6304400	6306080	Black Wolf and his shows.
6306080	6310080	Anyways, thank you for mentioning Extra Life and I hope to hear some good news from you
6310080	6311080	all soon.
6311080	6315080	If you have any suggestions, I'm not going to share his Twitter on the thing.
6315080	6316080	Thank you for your time.
6316080	6317720	And that's from Alan.
6317720	6320920	Yeah, I'm, we're going to do it.
6320920	6324000	Um, we'll, that's all going to go down October 17th.
6324000	6327620	We'll, uh, yeah, we'll have something posted on our website this week as soon as we get
6327620	6329320	everything set up with more details.
6329320	6334040	Um, I just from a technical aspect, I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed with how we're
6334040	6338760	going to make it work because we want to do, we want to do an hour of pinball incorporated
6338760	6339760	in this as well.
6339760	6345680	So hopefully Rob, my best, my best advice in this, don't waste time overthinking it.
6345680	6346680	It'll be easy.
6346680	6347680	Yeah.
6347680	6348680	We'll figure it out.
6348680	6349680	We'll figure it out.
6349680	6350680	We have more than one video camera.
6350680	6354400	We know that Loki has the video capture card and we have a switch box camera.
6354400	6358240	We can borrow, hopefully maybe Victoria will lend us hers.
6358240	6359240	That's my camera.
6359240	6360240	She just always uses it.
6360240	6361240	Yeah.
6361240	6364160	Well then we'll, we've got them and we can post photos and we can do like a splash page
6364160	6365160	or something.
6365160	6366160	It's, it's Rob.
6366160	6367160	It's not hard.
6367160	6368160	I know.
6368160	6369160	I'll figure it out.
6369160	6371800	We can put up a, I just wanted to go off without a hitch.
6371800	6373600	I want it to be perfect for the children.
6373600	6374600	Rob.
6374600	6375600	What?
6375600	6379480	We can put up a, um, uh, Oh crap.
6379480	6380480	What is it?
6380480	6382600	The CCS page.
6382600	6387160	I think the way it's going to work though, we're going to do games from the vault for
6387160	6389200	one hour basically.
6389200	6390560	And I don't know how we're going to pick them.
6390560	6394760	I don't know if we'll, if we'll have folks donate, but I don't know if there's any way
6394760	6397520	to kind of show like so and so donated money.
6397520	6398800	So they pick the next game.
6398800	6401520	I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll figure something out.
6401520	6404920	Whoever donates the most money during one game gets to pick the next game.
6404920	6405920	Yeah.
6405920	6406920	Maybe we'll do something like that.
6406920	6409800	We're going to have to have a list of games or get to pick a system.
6409800	6410800	Yeah.
6410800	6411800	We'll, we'll figure something out.
6411800	6413360	We'll work out the details over the next few weeks.
6413360	6414360	Yeah.
6414360	6417680	Although what I see happening is us having the newer systems hooked up in the front room
6417680	6420300	and the older systems hooked up in the vault.
6420300	6422000	We will have dreamcast age.
6422000	6423200	All right.
6423200	6424200	Testify.
6424200	6426760	So when we need to get some more of our local friends involved, so we'll put out the call
6426760	6427760	this week.
6427760	6428760	Get off your asses.
6428760	6429760	All right.
6429760	6432560	Last email from Rabababa.
6432560	6437680	In reference to the August 16th podcast, my first PS2 was broken from the start, but in
6437680	6439920	a very odd way that took me two years to notice.
6439920	6443000	In retrospect, I should have kept the old one for the novelty of it all.
6443000	6446600	It played all the games fine, oddly enough, and it never physically failed.
6446600	6449400	There's something wrong with the processor clock or math processing.
6449400	6452940	I'd play a round of Ridge Racer 5, watch the playback, and it would get out of sync
6452940	6455840	with the playback about 20 or 30 seconds in.
6455840	6459400	The car was still maneuvering around the proper order, but being out of sync caused it to
6459400	6462360	repeatedly crash into the walls.
6462360	6465880	I honestly thought this was a software problem with Ridge Racer 5 because it looked like
6465880	6467160	a software problem.
6467160	6470760	And finally we got Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec in the US.
6470760	6473320	The replay effect was really bad in GT3.
6473320	6475160	I finally realized it was my hardware.
6475160	6478280	That was the strangest hardware problem in a game system ever.
6478280	6483560	But massive hardware failures frequently covered under unofficial extended warranties for me
6483560	6485360	starting with the original Game Boy.
6485360	6490160	My first two or three Game Boys had the dead slash solid pixel raster problem, and Nintendo
6490160	6493200	happily repaired slash replaced for free.
6493200	6497340	I'm not certain, but I believe it was because the Game Boy was not rugged enough for typical
6497340	6500760	portable play, i.e. carrying around.
6500760	6504360	I also needed direct sunlight to play, but that was a different issue.
6504360	6507520	You know, remember the PSP had the problem with the dead pixels in the corner?
6507520	6509400	It was that.
6509400	6515240	So massive hardware failures have been around at least 20 years, but like
6515240	6518720	you said, Flaming Forums wasn't a big sport back then.
6518720	6519720	Later Rubba Bubba.
6519720	6520720	That's it.
6520720	6526840	I'm glad that he's just signing it Rubba Bubba.
6526840	6527840	Adopting his title.
6527840	6528840	There you go.
6528840	6532840	And for the record?
6532840	6537200	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have some emails you want to send in.
6537200	6543520	But we want to take a minute to get our angst on here in studio because, well, you know,
6543520	6547200	sometimes we just read things on the internet that really tick us off, and when they do
6547200	6552240	make us very upset, we have to do a little segment here that we like to call the FUs
6552240	6568880	of the Week.
6568880	6572480	And let me read a little bit of inspiration for our FUs of the Week this week, and this
6572480	6578400	comes from a GameStop apparently in Jacksonville, Florida.
6578400	6584360	Apparently somebody tried to rob this GameStop, but it wasn't for money.
6584360	6591720	No, he wanted the employee to fill the bag with games, copies of Madden NFL 10.
6591720	6595200	The robber went into a GameStop on a Monday night, unfortunately the guy's not named otherwise
6595200	6600440	we named him by name, was pretending he wanted a 360, but then whipped out a gun and demanded
6600440	6607100	copies for Madden NFL 10 and any other 360 games that would fit in the bag.
6607100	6615480	Apparently he made off with 23 games, $1,300 is what that's valued at, two 360s as well.
6615480	6616480	Yikes.
6616480	6617480	FU.
6617480	6630200	My FU goes to, it's sort of a pseudo-FU just because I'm kind of happy about it at the
6630200	6637760	same time, to 250th Anniversary Guinness, FU to being delicious, because I want to go
6637760	6640980	back and drink more of you.
6640980	6642480	A lot more of you.
6642480	6644960	It was very, very freaking good.
6644960	6647440	That's it.
6647440	6652680	FU to having to go to work tomorrow.
6652680	6653680	It sucks.
6653680	6656360	Well I just don't want to go to work.
6656360	6660040	I like the weekends.
6660040	6666160	My FU goes to people that can't see the faults in themselves and like to blame other people
6666160	6671960	for things that they did, that think they can do no wrong, and some folks need to learn
6671960	6678960	to accept responsibility, and yeah, need to learn how to take a break.
6678960	6680920	That's it.
6680920	6682280	Let's move on to some more gaming news.
6682280	6688880	Just a couple more and then we're going to get to your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6688880	6693960	While there's something kind of, I don't know if it's really super interesting, but it made
6693960	6698880	it into the gaming Guinness Book of World Records, which having thumbed through the
6698880	6702720	Guinness Book of World Records for games, pretty much anything can make it in there,
6702720	6708680	but Arkham Asylum has now set the record for being the most critically acclaimed superhero
6708680	6710980	game ever.
6710980	6712180	So what's that mean?
6712180	6717720	It was a superhero game that didn't suck.
6717720	6722440	But I mean really, like, what superhero games have been that awesome?
6722440	6726040	I mean, did they say what it took the- Marvel Ultimate Alliance is pretty damn awesome.
6726040	6732120	Well, they're basically saying that it's gotten the highest Metacritic review average, I guess,
6732120	6735920	among all the superhero games, but that's just like, that's almost as bad as saying
6735920	6739960	it's the most critically acclaimed superhero game starring Batman that's ever appeared
6739960	6741880	on the consoles.
6741880	6744160	Who cares?
6744160	6745280	Why is that a record?
6745280	6746560	That's not a record.
6746560	6747860	That's just people's opinions.
6747860	6754360	It's not like, you know, it's- I'm sorry, but like this game book is just really kind
6754360	6757800	of watering down all the other records.
6757800	6761160	Like, okay, being the tallest person, I mean, yeah, that's not really much of an achievement,
6761160	6765760	that's just your DNA, but still, that's a physical, you know, achievement that you have
6765760	6766760	there.
6766760	6767760	I mean, you're that tall.
6767760	6771800	You know, this is just subjective stuff, like if, you know, if we all wanted to get together
6771800	6774680	with all the reviewers and make a game, you know, the highest rated game ever, they could
6774680	6776040	easily do that and rig it.
6776040	6780240	I mean, it's just, it is a little weird that Metacritic is being used by Guinness.
6780240	6781480	That's just weird.
6781480	6783520	I don't know if I like that.
6783520	6785160	And this is just an odd title.
6785160	6788480	Doesn't this reek of like, hi, we're going to pay these guys a lot of money to get this
6788480	6790160	title so we can use it in our marketing?
6790160	6791920	I mean, I don't know.
6791920	6800220	You want to hear something that I just thought of just now that's kind of a little fishy?
6800220	6803360	Batman Arkham Asylum was published by Eidos, which is owned by Warner games.
6803360	6807400	Warner games also published a game called Guinness Book of World Records, the game.
6807400	6812720	Gee, don't have close ties with them, do they?
6812720	6813720	Conflict of interest?
6813720	6814720	Never.
6814720	6815720	Yes, exactly.
6815720	6816720	I didn't even think of that.
6816720	6817720	That's a good little comparison.
6817720	6821200	I just thought of that.
6821200	6822200	So yeah.
6822200	6826080	Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get to the Skype line,
6826080	6829620	your phone calls, and your opinions on the latest and greatest in gaming news.
6829620	6836040	And what you're going to hear in the background here, oh yes, you know that old classic song.
6836040	6837960	This is a Guitar Hero 5 ad.
6837960	6841800	This is a new one that's airing on TV.
6841800	6847360	And it features Playboy bunnies, yes, 10 of them, all rocking out to Guitar Hero wearing
6847360	6848360	no pants.
6848360	6850320	It's like the risky business.
6850320	6853200	Oh yeah, it's kind of like the ads, and then there's half variety.
6853200	6858420	83 bands, all kinds of rock, buy in September and get the unreleased Guitar Hero Van Halen
6858420	6859420	on the house.
6859420	6864640	And that was the thing that caught my eye about the ad is that they're selling that
6864640	6869080	whole Guitar Hero Van Halen thing on the house.
6869080	6870080	Not free.
6870080	6873840	Well, it does say, look at the little red text at the bottom of the screen though.
6873840	6877080	It just says, buy one, get one, but it doesn't say free.
6877080	6881840	Can't say free because it'll get sued.
6881840	6882840	Very interesting.
6882840	6884540	That's a very interesting way around it.
6884540	6886000	But yeah, I thought that was interesting.
6886000	6890840	They're working that whole Van Halen giveaway into it, and you know, whatever, the half
6890840	6891840	thing.
6891840	6892840	That's funny.
6892840	6893840	Dude, it's half.
6893840	6895120	He's a cultural icon.
6895120	6896120	It's pretty cool.
6896120	6897120	They got everybody involved.
6897120	6903320	But really, they really do need to come up with a new ad for the whole Guitar Hero thing.
6903320	6904320	I don't know.
6904320	6907720	I think there'd be plenty of guys that would argue with you that they could do 10 Playboy
6907720	6912240	playmates running around without pants on all day long and they'll never get old.
6912240	6913240	Next time, a trampoline though.
6913240	6914240	How about that?
6914240	6922360	We need trampoline hero to come out just for that little ad to come out.
6922360	6925320	Only if we get pantsless rage.
6925320	6928520	Of course, I'm sure there are some ladies that would like to see maybe some guys mixed
6928520	6929520	in with no pants on.
6929520	6930520	I don't know.
6930520	6931520	Dark Sakura.
6931520	6932520	I have no problem with that.
6932520	6933520	All right.
6933520	6934520	There you go.
6934520	6939200	So maybe they need to just have no pants day in honor of Guitar Hero.
6939200	6942960	I don't know how that works, but the marketing folks at Activision should get right on that.
6942960	6944320	I am totally down with that.
6944320	6946720	Hey, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
6946720	6951920	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if
6951920	6952920	you want to give us a call.
6952920	6955640	It seems like the show is kind of a little short tonight, but there just hasn't been
6955640	6957420	a whole lot of gaming news this week.
6957420	6961540	It's been a little bit slow and I think it's probably one of the whole fact that a lot
6961540	6963560	of folks are going back to school right now.
6963560	6966800	And so we're kind of just like a little bit of lull before we're going to get slammed
6966800	6967800	with game releases.
6967800	6971560	Well, also, they're trying to kind of keep it quiet as far as news goes because we just
6971560	6979120	had Gamescom and Blizzcon and now they have to save up some announcements for, you know,
6979120	6980120	PAX.
6980120	6981120	Makes sense.
6981120	6982120	Yeah.
6982120	6983120	That's true.
6983120	6987080	I guess we are kind of in a lull because probably all the secrets that are yet to be announced
6987080	6989360	are going to be coming through on PAX pretty soon.
6989360	6990580	Hey, let's go to the phones.
6990580	6991580	We have a call.
6991580	6992580	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6992580	6993580	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
6993580	6994580	Who's this?
6994580	6995580	Hi, this is Ray Iyanami.
6995580	6996580	Hi, Ray Iyanami.
6996580	6997580	What's on your mind?
6997580	6998580	Yo.
6998580	7006760	Hi, I guess DJ Maxx told you a few weeks ago, I don't know if I should talk about it since
7006760	7008640	the game's like eight months old.
7008640	7011120	Eh, so what?
7011120	7012120	So it's a little old.
7012120	7018320	Sometimes we like to look at the games past and things that might be in the bargain bin
7018320	7019320	at this point.
7019320	7020320	What's up?
7020320	7021320	Under the radar?
7021320	7022320	Yeah.
7022320	7029280	Anyways, so DJ Maxx Trilogy is kind of like the old DJ Maxx Online or kind of like O2
7029280	7030280	Jammery.
7030280	7035840	It's kind of like being a maniac, but instead of using a proprietary controller, you use
7035840	7039200	the PC keyboard.
7039200	7044040	And there's a bunch of button modes in it, but there's one thing I really don't like
7044040	7050960	about it that the other new DJ Maxx games have, and it's a feature called Autocorrect.
7050960	7055800	Now what, so this is an online game that you can download, kind of like O2 Jam you said?
7055800	7062080	No, actually it's, you have to buy the physical copies and then you have to install it from
7062080	7069240	the DVD raw inside, but once you get it set up you don't need to get it anymore.
7069240	7071920	And it's offline, but there's an online mode.
7071920	7077800	Is this something that you can only import, or is this available in the US?
7077800	7083440	It's import only, but it has an English language option, though it's really crappy English.
7083440	7085120	But enough to get you through the game.
7085120	7087000	Yeah, pretty much.
7087000	7090360	What do you think would attract music game fans to this game?
7090360	7094440	What makes this game good enough to check out for music game fans?
7094440	7103520	Oh, I can get to that later, because, but anyways, I don't know, I think just the fact
7103520	7108840	that like, DJ Maxx online has been dead for two years now, so this kind of gives you a
7108840	7115560	chance to play a ribbon game that isn't set on the PC again.
7115560	7123000	And there's a feature I wanted to rant about in this game.
7123000	7125120	What's this feature?
7125120	7129320	I'm Autocorrect, where basically you can hit the wrong node, but at the right time you'll
7129320	7131440	still get credit for it.
7131440	7141280	Like, I suppose it hit the J key, but if it hit K, you'll still get the full judgment
7141280	7142280	score for it.
7142280	7146040	Well, not really the score, you still get 100%, but you have a little bit of a score
7146040	7151240	penalty, but for me, that's better enough to be okay with the feature.
7151240	7155340	That seems kind of easy, like what's to stop somebody from hitting the key the same the
7155340	7159040	whole time, just because your score will be a little bit lower in the end?
7159040	7167000	Yeah, but a lot of people have songs that you normally would not be able to pass up
7167000	7168000	this feature.
7168000	7170880	I mean, even guitar hero and rock band don't have this feature.
7170880	7182360	I just unlocked a new key mode, and I'm trying to learn it, but when you have this feature
7182360	7185400	turned on, it makes it confusing to learn, because I don't know if I'm hitting the correct
7185400	7186400	keys or not.
7186400	7190960	Hey, I'd rather be penalized for hitting the wrong key, because at least I know that'll
7190960	7197440	treat me to hit the right key, instead of just guessing which keys I'm hitting incorrectly.
7197440	7202580	Okay, well I guess it sounds like a feature that can maybe help make the game more accessible
7202580	7203580	to some.
7203580	7205840	Alright, well do you have any other thoughts for us?
7205840	7208160	No, not really.
7208160	7212520	Alright, we're going to go ahead and let you go, but have a good one buddy, alright?
7212520	7213520	We'll talk to you later.
7213520	7214520	Alright, see ya.
7214520	7215520	Later.
7215520	7219240	Alright, so, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us
7219240	7220840	a call on this lovely Sunday evening.
7220840	7224360	Do we have any last minute stories while we're waiting for calls?
7224360	7228920	I don't think we have a lot tonight, we kind of covered everything, didn't we?
7228920	7232520	Apparently there is some sort of deal going on with Best Buy that they're offering, buy
7232520	7235040	one get one half off for 360 games.
7235040	7237920	Hmm, let me get a, we have another call, we can come back to this in a minute.
7237920	7238920	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7238920	7239920	Hi, this is President Nader.
7239920	7240920	Hi, President Nader, what's on your mind tonight?
7240920	7254200	Yeah, couple things, first off, I just got off of WhatUp.com and I saw a story on there
7254200	7256280	that I think you may be interested in.
7256280	7257280	Go ahead, shoot.
7257280	7265200	I just sent a picture to your profile for you to check it out later on.
7265200	7266200	What is this?
7266200	7274480	Apparently there's coming, there's going to be a new Xbox 360 bundle coming out soon and
7274480	7279000	according to this picture they're calling it the Super Elite.
7279000	7282160	Is this the 250 gigabyte system we talked about earlier in part A?
7282160	7289480	Actually, I'm not sure what you talked about in part A, I missed a little bit of the show,
7289480	7298320	so I just happened to see this on OneUp.com, so I thought I'd mention it.
7298320	7301560	Well, what are your, well, assuming it's the same deal, what are your thoughts on it?
7301560	7306660	Is this something that's necessary for Microsoft to do or do you think this is just more, yet
7306660	7310320	another skew out there in the marketplace to confuse me?
7310320	7320360	I'd say, I don't know, it's kind of a toss up, if you don't already have a 360 or your
7320360	7329640	360 is basically dead then maybe, yeah, you could use it, otherwise, no.
7329640	7334800	You may be able to make use of the hard drive.
7334800	7339480	What exactly, and I kind of pointed this on the PlayStation 3 too, we keep hearing bigger
7339480	7343920	hard drives, bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives, but on both the 360 and the PS3, for
7343920	7345240	what?
7345240	7348320	What do we need these huge hard drives for?
7348320	7356160	Well, at least for, with the bulk of systems, they're constantly coming out with arcade
7356160	7364200	games and, you know, assuming that you buy a lot of the arcade games for your system
7364200	7373560	or playing a game like a lot of TV shows or at least on the PlayStation 3 buying the movies,
7373560	7376640	then you're talking to them now.
7376640	7381480	That sounds more like it, room to buy more movies and spend more money on their store.
7381480	7382480	That I can agree with.
7382480	7385400	Anything else you have in mind tonight, Spazinator?
7385400	7386400	Yeah.
7386400	7394400	I don't know if you saw my response to your tweet about performing at the club, but yeah,
7394400	7405200	I'd be interested in joining your ORR club or should be on PSN for the rest of the evening.
7405200	7407200	You know, I'll probably get to those later this evening.
7407200	7412280	A lot of folks, I mean, I know your PSN name matches your Twitter, but a lot of folks asked
7412280	7415760	to be added and I don't think their PSN names match up to their Twitter, so I'm probably
7415760	7419400	going to put out another call this evening for folks, but we'll try to get folks added
7419400	7421240	this evening or at least tomorrow at the latest.
7421240	7423640	All right, well, thanks for your call, Spazinator.
7423640	7426680	Have a good one and we'll see you probably next week.
7426680	7428840	All right, have a good one.
7428840	7429840	Later.
7429840	7430840	1877 game OLR.
7430840	7433440	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
7433440	7434800	Loki, what was the rest of this?
7434800	7436560	Buy one, get one half off?
7436560	7444440	Apparently this week we will have the opportunity to get one game and, you know, another game
7444440	7448480	for half off at Best Buy and there's a bunch of different games that they're offering that
7448480	7451960	and so you just purchase one of the qualifying games and get another one for 50% off.
7451960	7452960	All right, let's go to the phones.
7452960	7453960	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7453960	7454960	Who's this?
7454960	7455960	Misty.
7455960	7456960	Misty?
7456960	7457960	It's Misty.
7457960	7458960	Hi.
7458960	7459960	Hello.
7459960	7460960	Hi.
7460960	7465080	Now, you are on the road to Cali right now, correct?
7465080	7466080	That's right.
7466080	7471160	I don't know exactly how far I have to go, but I'm somewhere outside of Salt Lake City
7471160	7472160	right now.
7472160	7473160	I'm so sorry.
7473160	7479160	I think you're about 15 hours away.
7479160	7480760	Well, let's see.
7480760	7481760	It's an hour and a half to Reno.
7481760	7483240	I think about another eight.
7483240	7486560	She's probably about, well, considering the bus has to stop everywhere.
7486560	7487560	Yeah.
7487560	7489120	But I think she's taking the Reno route.
7489120	7490120	Gotcha.
7490120	7491120	Okay.
7491120	7492120	Yeah.
7492120	7493120	Yeah.
7493120	7494120	You got to go through Nevada, which is going to be very boring.
7494120	7495120	Well, how's the trip been so far?
7495120	7503240	Mostly boring, especially once I got out to the mountains, it's been like Illinois only
7503240	7505480	not left, in my opinion.
7505480	7508160	Are you occupying your time with any video games?
7508160	7511160	Did you bring a DS or a PSP, something to play?
7511160	7517400	Not because I broke this, but I am playing... I've got my netbook, so I'm playing random
7517400	7520200	like real arcade games on that.
7520200	7521200	You've got your what?
7521200	7522200	I'm sorry?
7522200	7523200	Netbook.
7523200	7525320	My netbook, that computer I took to ASEN.
7525320	7526320	Oh, yeah.
7526320	7527320	Yeah.
7527320	7528320	Your little netbook.
7528320	7529320	Okay.
7529320	7530320	Cool.
7530320	7531320	Okay.
7531320	7532320	That works.
7532320	7533320	Yeah.
7533320	7534320	A little PC gaming on the way.
7534320	7535320	Yeah.
7535320	7536320	I remember that from ASEN.
7536320	7537320	Okay.
7537320	7538320	Very cool.
7538320	7539320	What kinds of stuff are you looking forward to seeing when you get here to Sacramento?
7539320	7546200	At the moment, the main thing is an actual Para Para Para because it's been so fucking
7546200	7548960	long since I've seen one.
7548960	7551120	Do we have a Para Para in town?
7551120	7552120	I hope to disappoint.
7552120	7553120	I've got one nearby.
7553120	7555760	There is one in an arcade close to Jamie's house.
7555760	7557840	Oh, that sunrise thing.
7557840	7559040	I haven't been to in forever.
7559040	7560040	I haven't been there either.
7560040	7561040	Yeah.
7561040	7562040	I know what she's talking about.
7562040	7563040	Okay.
7563040	7564040	Okay.
7564040	7566640	Well, I'm hoping we can make your trip fun.
7566640	7571240	You're a real trooper for taking the long way out here, but you know what?
7571240	7575040	I've driven cross country, and even though some parts are really boring, it's a beautiful
7575040	7576040	experience.
7576040	7580080	I think definitely enjoy the time on the way out here.
7580080	7581080	Definitely.
7581080	7582080	Definitely.
7582080	7584680	Well, we will be seeing you soon, Misty.
7584680	7585680	Take care.
7585680	7587880	Be safe, and don't talk to strangers.
7587880	7590720	I'll try and ask you.
7590720	7591720	All right.
7591720	7592720	Take care, Misty.
7592720	7593720	We'll see you tomorrow.
7593720	7597600	Hey, give me a text when you hit Reno.
7597600	7598880	I was planning on it.
7598880	7599880	Okay, cool.
7599880	7600880	All right.
7600880	7603240	It sounds like I'll be seeing you either tomorrow night or Tuesday for sure.
7603240	7604240	So take care.
7604240	7605240	Hopefully.
7605240	7608880	Hopefully tomorrow night compared to your unprotected six video.
7608880	7609880	We shall see.
7609880	7611480	I'm pretty sure we can make that happen.
7611480	7612480	All right.
7612480	7613480	Take care.
7613480	7614480	All right.
7614480	7615480	Later.
7615480	7616480	All right.
7616480	7617480	Bye.
7617480	7618480	You know what, Rob?
7618480	7620040	I think tomorrow night we should take Misty to Mungo Chow.
7620040	7621040	We can probably arrange that.
7621040	7622040	That might be fun.
7622040	7623040	Yeah.
7623040	7624040	All right.
7624040	7625040	All right.
7625040	7626040	Well, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line for tonight.
7626040	7630280	Sorry for those folks that didn't get through, but I don't think anyone should be too disappointed
7630280	7632200	seeing the names that were popping up.
7632200	7634200	It's all people that have been on every week.
7634200	7639640	So anyhow, but try again next week, guys, and especially sorry for the new folks that
7639640	7641120	can't get through.
7641120	7647040	Unfortunately, I used to be able to see who was calling in, and I tried to rotate it,
7647040	7651200	but Skype changed it so that you can't, like if multiple people are calling in, only the
7651200	7653120	fastest dialer gets through.
7653120	7654940	So we just kind of take the calls as they get in.
7654940	7659800	So if you're a new caller, my biggest advice to you is just keep trying or, you know, write
7659800	7664840	an email or a Twitter and do it that way if you haven't learned how to get fast on the
7664840	7665840	phones yet.
7665840	7666840	So.
7666840	7667840	All right.
7667840	7670640	Do we have any other last minute stories here tonight?
7670640	7671640	No.
7671640	7677680	Sonic Adventure DX is getting another remake, apparently.
7677680	7679120	Oh, goody.
7679120	7685960	This is coming from the Australian Classification Board, has a new listing for Sonic Adventure
7685960	7695960	DX Director's Cut and suggests that apparently it might be getting ported to new systems
7695960	7702440	and no word on what it, you know, which ones it's going to be ported to, but I don't know,
7702440	7706560	speculation's up in the air, but at least it's been classified, so it probably means
7706560	7707560	it's coming.
7707560	7708560	Oh, boy.
7708560	7713960	All right, well, I guess if that's it for last minute stories tonight, it's time to
7713960	7717400	go around and get everybody's final thought, because we're getting pretty close to wrapping
7717400	7718400	up the show tonight.
7718400	7721120	I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but it's just been a slower week.
7721120	7724120	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
7724120	7727020	I wish I really lived in this house.
7727020	7728020	My Sim house.
7728020	7729020	New Sim house.
7729020	7730460	It's really awesome.
7730460	7735580	My final thought is coffee is awesome.
7735580	7736580	It is.
7736580	7738080	If I had more cream, I'd make you some more.
7738080	7739080	That's all right.
7739080	7740480	The cup I had earlier was delicious.
7740480	7741480	Thank you very much.
7741480	7742480	Loki, your final thought?
7742480	7747360	I wish they were still selling Blue Shark DDR pads, but they're not, so that's too bad.
7747360	7748360	All right.
7748360	7750920	Well, believe it or not, folks, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch
7750920	7751920	Radio.
7751920	7755200	As always, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into us and supporting
7755200	7756200	it.
7756200	7758440	If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or two about the show.
7758440	7759920	Help us spread the word.
7759920	7764760	That's really how we succeed is through word of mouth, so that's what we really want is
7764760	7769220	just to help us spread the word, because we don't have big advertising dollars or a magazine
7769220	7774080	behind us or anything like that, so it really is up to you guys to help spread the word.
7774080	7778180	But we'll be here to do it all again next week on a, I guess you could say, Penny Arcade
7778180	7781420	edition of Orange Launch Radio, where we're hoping we'll at least hear from some of our
7781420	7783640	listeners making the trek out to Penny Arcade.
7783640	7787480	Sadly, we will not be there this year, but you guys will, and so we want to hear your
7787480	7789480	voices next week on Orange Launch Radio.
7789480	7792960	We'll see you next week at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio.
7792960	7795000	Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.
7795000	7824840	She's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out!
7825000	7827120	See you next week!
