7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and LocoCade
14000	16000	Tonight, August 16th, 2009
16000	18000	Is there a wee cushion on the horizon?
18000	21000	Will the Playstation 3 soon see you laughing?
21000	25000	And could you soon be able to take a trip to Silent Hill for real?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Well hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice
38000	43000	Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
43000	46000	With you for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts
46000	48000	And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only
48000	52000	Happiest bunny on the farm, as I used to call her every day on this week
52000	55000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
55000	57000	Wait, how did that get started anyway?
57000	59000	I don't even remember
59000	61000	Oh, because I had my happy bunny stuff for a while
61000	63000	You used to be obsessed with happy bunny if I remember right
63000	65000	And now I think happy bunny is kind of stupid
65000	68000	Oh really? Well, happy bunny kind of jumped the shark a little bit
68000	70000	Now you see happy bunny everywhere on everything
70000	72000	Happy bunny was cool when no one knew about it
72000	73000	Exactly
73000	76000	And also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
76000	77000	Hello
77000	78000	How are you doing, Loki?
78000	79000	Fine
79000	80000	Not the happiest bunny on the farm, Loki
80000	82000	No, I'm not a bunny on a farm
82000	84000	You're very quiet tonight, Loki, what is going on?
84000	86000	Nothing, I'm trying to remember a password
86000	88000	And I think I got it
88000	89000	And I got it
89000	92000	Oh, I'm trying to see what you're trying to log into
92000	93000	Alright
93000	96000	Imani Sowz is what I'm logging into
96000	98000	Not the download torrents, but to read their forms
98000	99000	I see
99000	101000	What's so important on their forms?
101000	104000	Nothing, I want to see if some guy returned my PM
104000	105000	And he didn't
105000	106000	He's a bastard
106000	108000	I thought they said read their porn, so
108000	112000	If you are corresponding with Loki, you should write him back, ass
112000	113000	No, it's alright
113000	118000	I was second in line for a system 573 board, but I didn't
118000	120000	I probably don't need it now, so it's alright
120000	123000	You are very quiet tonight, and I can't figure out why
123000	125000	Let's try turning up your mic a little bit
125000	126000	The beauty of live radio, boys and girls
126000	130000	Oh, I thought you meant like I wasn't saying a lot, not that I was quiet
130000	132000	No, like you were actually quiet on the mic, now you were too loud
132000	133000	I think we're good now
133000	134000	Alright
134000	135000	So there we go
135000	139000	The joy of live radio as we tape live here on Sunday nights at All Games Radio
139000	142000	www.allgames.com, live after The Bobby Black Wolf Show
142000	143000	I have an announcement
143000	144000	You have an announcement, yes
144000	145000	Rob had chicken for dinner
145000	146000	I did, it was delicious
146000	147000	He didn't get me any
147000	148000	Grilled chicken
148000	150000	I had chicken and a biscuit
150000	152000	It still smells like chicken in this room, and it's driving me nuts
152000	155000	Look, I was hungry, I literally had nothing to eat today
155000	157000	I'm gonna make my husband bring me some food
157000	158000	You should do that, that's why you got married, right?
158000	160000	Yeah, so that it'd be my man servant
160000	161000	I too had chicken for dinner
161000	162000	Did you?
162000	163000	Yes
163000	164000	What kind of chicken did you have?
164000	167000	I had chicken covered with Ritz cracker bits
167000	170000	Have you been, since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio
170000	171000	We'll get into our gaming week in just a moment
171000	173000	But since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio
173000	174000	Have you been to that new restaurant?
174000	176000	And I think, you know, we're an international show
176000	178000	So I'm sure this place exists, other places
178000	179000	But it's new to Sacramento
179000	180000	Have you been to Wingstop?
180000	181000	No
181000	183000	It's pretty interesting
183000	184000	I refuse to eat there
184000	185000	Why is that?
185000	187000	Because it's attached to Pizza Hut
187000	188000	No, that's Wing...
188000	189000	No, Wing Street
189000	190000	That's a different one
190000	192000	No, Wingstop is a new one that they have here
192000	194000	Where they just, you know, they serve wings, obviously
194000	196000	In all these different flavors
196000	199000	And I don't think I've ever had, like, food worse for you
199000	201000	Probably that food at Wingstop
201000	203000	Hooters wings are worse for you
203000	204000	Are they?
204000	205000	But Hooters wings are good
205000	206000	No they're not
206000	207000	No they're not
207000	208000	I think Hooters wings are good
208000	209000	Everything at Hooters sucks
209000	210000	Even the women suck
210000	212000	Everything at Hooters is awful
212000	214000	What is wrong with this picture?
214000	215000	I'm gonna keep the dirty comment down
215000	217000	What is wrong with this picture?
217000	219000	I love Hooters more than anyone else in this room
219000	222000	Their food, I have given their food, like, three different chances
222000	227000	And, like, not only is their food bad, but their service is worse
227000	229000	It's just, it's absolutely crap
229000	231000	Their hostels taste like too much vinegar
231000	234000	For example, I went in one time and I decided
234000	236000	Okay, I'm gonna get a burger and what the hell
236000	240000	Let's get, order the wings because everyone's raving about the wings and stuff
240000	243000	Order the burger, the burger took an hour for me to get at my table
243000	248000	The wings, mind you, which is their staple food that they serve there
248000	251000	Took two hours to get to me
251000	253000	Now Loki's too loud
253000	256000	And they tasted like shit, okay
256000	257000	Get him angry, then he'll be louder
257000	262000	And not only that, okay, so I tried normal, like, their normal hot wings or whatever
262000	263000	They tasted like shit
263000	265000	I tried them, like, a different flavor
265000	267000	It's a different flavor of shit
267000	270000	It's just, it's, it's awful
270000	272000	There is nothing good at that place
272000	276000	All their food sucks and if you go for the ambiance, you're stupid
276000	277000	You can get better food at a strip club
277000	278000	Are you kidding?
278000	280000	I just, the last time I went to Hooters was Victoria and I
280000	282000	We were like, where should we go eat?
282000	283000	Let's go to Hooters!
283000	285000	And we went, we had fun, we were laughing the whole time
285000	288000	Our waitress had big boobies and we were, you know, making fun of her
288000	290000	But in a positive way, like, you know
290000	293000	Seriously, okay, strip club food is not very good
293000	295000	It was better than Hooters
295000	296000	And you know what?
296000	299000	At a strip club, I'm not gonna just have to imagine naked boobies
299000	301000	I can see them firsthand
301000	306000	So, you know, I'm sorry, it's just not worth my time
306000	308000	Here's my, here's my question about Hooters
308000	310000	Do you remember that E3?
310000	313000	It was probably 2004, 2005
313000	317000	When we were staying at the ghetto, ghetto ghetto ghetto
317000	319000	Motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard
319000	321000	Like, I don't know what inspired us to stay there
321000	323000	I ought to be young and in our 20s again
323000	326000	But to be staying at that ghetto Motel 6
326000	329000	And we had to walk up Hollywood Boulevard
329000	334000	Through a concert that Jimmy Kimmel Live was doing or something
334000	336000	To get to Hooters, because we were like
336000	338000	Hadn't you never been there at that point?
338000	339000	I've never been there
339000	340000	That's right, and I was like, Loki!
340000	343000	You're like a manly man and you've never been to Hooters
343000	346000	I'm like, don't tell me you're gonna make a gay man take you to Hooters
346000	349000	So eventually a gay man did have to take him to Hooters
349000	350000	So we went to Hooters
350000	352000	And, you know, it was, it was our first experience
352000	354000	Well, his first experience at Hooters
354000	356000	And I guess it wasn't favorable
356000	359000	Well, just also getting there took us like 30 minutes
359000	361000	When it was just like a block up the street
361000	365000	We could see it, but it took a half an hour to get there
365000	367000	So, anyhow
367000	370000	But it wasn't crowded, because everybody was out in the street watching the concert
370000	374000	And then once the concert was over, oh damn, did that place fill up fast
374000	375000	It's crazy
375000	378000	Alright, anyhow, sorry, we'll stop talking about Hooters
378000	379000	And talk about our gaming week!
379000	381000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
381000	382000	What types of games have you been playing this week?
382000	385000	It was actually busy, believe it or not
385000	387000	I've really been getting into Blue Dragon
387000	390000	Which, yeah, it took me long enough, but shut up
390000	397000	And I really like it for its classic RPG-ocity
397000	399000	You know, it's been pretty fun for me
399000	405000	And I also played through Raiden Fighters Aces
405000	412000	And nearly beat the game, except that I was in a lot of pain when I was playing it
412000	417000	Well, I was, it was really more that I was just gonna play for a little bit of it
417000	420000	And then, you know, put it aside
420000	424000	But I actually played all the way through
424000	426000	And then I kept getting to the last stage
426000	430000	And because my hand hurt so bad, I couldn't hit the fire button fast enough
430000	433000	So I kept also not counteracting the fire that was coming at me
433000	434000	And kept dying
434000	440000	And it turns out that when you have to continue, it starts you off from the beginning of the stage
440000	444000	And I just said, you know what, fuck a bunch of this
444000	446000	And, you know, I'm not gonna do it
446000	452000	So I put it down and then promptly went to go put my hand in a big thing of ice water
452000	454000	Because it really, really hurt
454000	462000	And then I also played a lot of the Namco Museum package that we picked up
462000	469000	And, you know, just some Galaga and some Pac-Man
469000	471000	Wait, is this the 360 compilation?
471000	476000	Okay, so this is like the Galaga Resurrection and some of the arcade titles they've put out over the past couple years
476000	479000	They kind of butchered the Galaga one
479000	483000	I like, I had more fun going back and playing Galaga 98, uh, Galaga 88
483000	489000	So, you know, Dan and I were actually talking about, you know, this is more fun on TurboGrafx
489000	492000	So, um, it's not a bad collection, it's a really good collection
492000	495000	And I love Namco, yay Namco, kiss kiss
495000	497000	But, eh
497000	504000	And then, um, we were gonna play some Symphony of the Night and as it turned out that Dan hasn't authorized our Xbox yet
504000	506000	So I can't play it
506000	509000	Even though we have it on his account, I can't play it
509000	511000	And I was like, ugh, ugh, ugh
511000	513000	So, um, so then I started playing a lot of Blue Dragon
513000	516000	And I love, love, love, love, love Blue Dragon
516000	518000	And I just got back to their village
518000	520000	If anyone who's played the game knows where that is
520000	522000	What part of the game I'm at
522000	529000	Now that game took a lot of shit for being kind of generic, for being kind of, like, not that impressive
529000	532000	Some people have said for considering who all's behind it
532000	535000	You know what? They can bite me
535000	537000	Okay then
537000	543000	Because the thing that I like about it is that it has the classic RPG feel
543000	545000	It has a good solid story
545000	548000	And yeah, maybe it's not, ooh, innovative
548000	550000	Maybe it doesn't have the stigma of being Final Fantasy
550000	554000	But I bet if you slapped a Final Fantasy name on it and changed the characters, I bet you'd love it
554000	556000	Seriously
556000	559000	But I mean, it has the charm of, uh
559000	563000	I've noticed this typically about games that Toriyama designs
563000	566000	That they tend to have that charm that comes with his art style
566000	568000	And I loved that
568000	570000	That was fantastic for me
570000	573000	And Uematsu's music, I mean, oh my god, Uematsu
573000	575000	It made me happy
575000	579000	See, I get that, but I'm way more about Lost Odyssey than I was Blue Dragon
579000	583000	I didn't think Blue Dragon was as terrible as a lot of folks made it out to be
583000	586000	But I just thought it was, eh, it's aight
586000	588000	It's aight
588000	589000	Did you just say it's aight?
589000	591000	Yeah
591000	592000	Stop
592000	596000	It's classic, it's new and classic at the same time
596000	598000	You know what I mean?
598000	603000	It's a new story, it's something to play through, but something that you can pick up that will automatically be familiar to you
603000	610000	So for me, it's been filling my must-play Super Nintendo with a more comfortable controller
610000	612000	Alright
612000	614000	And of course I've been playing Sims 3
614000	617000	I started another family because the game decided to fart on one of mine
617000	621000	Well, technically what happened is that, um
621000	626000	Someone turned off my computer while I was in the middle of a game
626000	628000	And didn't save said game
628000	631000	So it was either the Spouse or Windows Updates
631000	634000	Which I thought I had turned those off too
634000	636000	So, whatever
636000	638000	And um, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
638000	640000	Oh, I've also been playing on Gaia
640000	642000	I like the booty grab
642000	646000	Uh, going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com for questions and comments
646000	649000	Ray Iyanami asked Dark Sakura, hold it
649000	653000	Which game on RFA, which Raiden fighters, and was it on one credit?
653000	658000	Um, actually no because like I said, my hand hurt a lot
658000	660000	So I played the first one
660000	662000	Um
662000	664000	And
664000	666000	You know, I was really just gonna sit down and see what it was like
666000	670000	Cause I hadn't played the Aces ones
670000	672000	So I played through and
672000	674000	Yeah, I was
674000	677000	I really don't have the fine control that I used to
677000	679000	Because I've, you know, like I said
679000	682000	My hand has been, um, sticking with a suture in it
682000	684000	And my tendons are healing themselves
684000	686000	So I haven't really been able to play
686000	688000	Like I might have, you know
688000	690000	A few years ago
690000	693000	So, uh, no I didn't do it on one credit
693000	695000	But hopefully in a couple months that'll be all better, right?
695000	698000	Yeah, well when it's all better I'm gonna be going back to R-Type
698000	700000	Alright
700000	702000	Loki, how about you and your gaming week?
702000	704000	I played DDR, that was it
704000	706000	That's all I played is DDR
706000	709000	Or, not DDR, what the hell am I talking about? I didn't play any DDR
709000	711000	I'm a DDR freak, so you know
711000	713000	Really? This is actually kind of noteworthy
713000	716000	I'm like, you actually started exercising
716000	718000	What is this?
718000	720000	Eventually I will, but no
720000	722000	I'm a green DDR freak, so
722000	724000	No, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto all the week
724000	726000	All week long, and we have
726000	728000	Been recording our, like, multiplayer game
728000	731000	Because Grand Theft Auto and DDR have so much in common
731000	733000	Okay, it's a three letter acronym
733000	736000	I was looking to say, and I was staring at DDR freak
736000	738000	That's why I made the slip, okay?
738000	740000	So, whatever
740000	742000	With all due respect to the many friends I made on there
742000	744000	Including you guys
744000	746000	Since when was DDR freak relevant again?
746000	748000	It's not, I'm looking at
748000	750000	I'm trying to, okay
750000	752000	Because I have my pads that I've built
752000	755000	You remember when I built them? Hell, it was that long ago
755000	757000	I've used them since
757000	759000	No, I haven't used them since then
759000	762000	So, I have them sitting in my garage
762000	765000	And I'm just seeing if it's going to be more
765000	767000	Agentageous to actually
767000	769000	Purchase some
769000	771000	Already pre-done arcade style pads
771000	773000	For DDR
773000	776000	Or should I just fix it?
776000	778000	Because right now I have to ground
778000	781000	The pads because the static electricity being built up
781000	783000	By the Lexan
783000	784000	Arrows
784000	786000	It causes the
786000	788000	Thing I have it attached to
788000	789000	To interpret the keys
789000	790000	To short out
790000	792000	Because it just builds up static electricity
792000	794000	And then, like, shocks it
794000	795000	Which is not good
795000	797000	Because it'll stop working after about two minutes
797000	799000	And then have to reboot the whole computer
799000	801000	So
801000	803000	I need to figure out how to ground them
803000	805000	And one time I read how to do that
805000	807000	And I can't remember now, so
807000	809000	I'm just going to buy new ones
809000	810000	Because it's easier that way
810000	812000	Frisbee in our chat room says
812000	814000	Grand Theft Arrow
814000	816000	No, but Grand Theft Auto
816000	818000	We've been playing quite a bit, of course
818000	820000	I have like
820000	822000	Five hours of footage now
822000	824000	Of us playing Grand Theft Auto
824000	826000	Even a little bit of me playing
826000	828000	Earth Defense Force
828000	830000	Because we decided to switch off to Earth Defense Force
830000	832000	Because our other co-worker decided
832000	834000	He wanted to go play Magic the Gathering with somebody
834000	836000	So we were like, ah, fuck that
836000	838000	But yeah, Grand Theft Auto
838000	840000	It'll be awesome, I just have to
840000	842000	Edit it down now to
842000	844000	Something funny
844000	846000	And set the music
846000	848000	Good, because the Orange Launch Radio channel needs more content
848000	850000	It's in HD, so it'll be awesome
850000	852000	Yeah, because that new capture thing I have
852000	854000	Is awesome, it works so well
854000	856000	So it'll make things a lot easier
856000	858000	For capturing video to put on the site
858000	860000	And
860000	862000	Good, we need to do some mystery science
862000	864000	Theatering to video games
864000	866000	That's what we need to do
866000	868000	There's actually some old school talk going on in the chat room right now
868000	870000	Yeah
870000	872000	What's it called?
872000	874000	Block Box
874000	876000	So we brought up Tetranet
876000	878000	You remember Tetranet?
878000	880000	I remember Tetranet, I used to play that stuff all the time
880000	882000	Sorry to interrupt
882000	884000	And I'm getting an arcade cabinet
884000	886000	Really?
886000	888000	Is it an actual game, or what is it?
888000	890000	It's an arcade cabinet
890000	892000	Just the cabinet?
892000	894000	For what?
894000	896000	What do you plan to put on it?
896000	898000	Maim, DDR
898000	900000	It's a candy cabinet
900000	902000	Do you know what a candy cabinet is?
902000	904000	I haven't the slightest idea what that is
904000	906000	You know those cabinets that line Arcade Infinity?
906000	908000	The really small ones?
908000	910000	Oh, yeah, like the ones you sit down and play?
910000	912000	Yes, that's a candy cabinet
912000	914000	Oh, those are pretty cool
914000	916000	There's a deal going on
916000	918000	There's the Neo Geo forums
918000	920000	I found it looking for something else
920000	922000	Because at one time
922000	924000	I wanted to buy a DDR machine
924000	926000	But then I had to scale down
926000	928000	my wishes
928000	930000	Because a DDR machine would cost me at least $2500
930000	932000	Probably more than that
932000	934000	And that's just not affordable
934000	936000	So a candy cab
936000	938000	I'm looking at a
938000	940000	new Astro City machine
940000	942000	Which is a Sega made one
942000	944000	And um
944000	946000	It's supposed to run somewhere around $450
946000	948000	I think
948000	950000	And they're basically doing a big bulk shipment
950000	952000	And they have some extras available
952000	954000	They're being shipped to San Francisco
954000	956000	So um
956000	958000	Hopefully, I'm trying to get the guy to
958000	960000	send me a personal message again
960000	962000	So I can actually put down the deposit for it
962000	964000	Because they're supposed to be coming
964000	966000	Between now and September, so
966000	968000	That'd be awesome
968000	970000	Because then I'm gonna put a
970000	972000	To become like a
972000	974000	Little, short, stubby
974000	976000	DDR machine
976000	978000	Are you sure it's actually DDR and not Grand Theft Auto?
978000	980000	It can be both
980000	982000	Actually, we were thinking about
982000	984000	Getting one of those for all of our Neo Geo
984000	986000	Well, you should act on this
986000	988000	I mean, 400 bucks
988000	990000	And they're shipping them already
990000	992000	Actually, they're already on a boat
992000	994000	They're already on a boat on the way here
994000	996000	Yes, they're on a motherfucking boat
996000	998000	So they're already on their way over
998000	1000000	It's just, um
1000000	1002000	You know, he's trying to sell 30 of them
1002000	1004000	Otherwise, he's gonna keep them
1004000	1006000	And sell them for higher
1006000	1008000	I should ask the spouse, just
1008000	1010000	He could pay for it out of pinball money
1010000	1012000	We're having a hard time hearing you, DarkSakura
1012000	1014000	Make sure that mic's really good
1014000	1016000	Thank you, much better
1016000	1018000	And then I'm having a milkshake
1018000	1020000	And my stomach feels like it's gonna explode
1020000	1022000	Because I have lots of milkshake in me
1022000	1024000	Well, there you go
1024000	1026000	Let's see my gaming week
1026000	1028000	Wednesday
1028000	1030000	We all got a patch on Xbox Live, right?
1030000	1032000	And everybody, you know, had to update
1032000	1034000	To this new patch that
1034000	1036000	You know, added all this new stuff in Netflix
1036000	1038000	And blah, blah, blah
1038000	1040000	Kind of changed some things with the achievements and so on
1040000	1042000	So I'm gonna download that and I'm messing with the achievements and stuff for a little bit
1042000	1044000	Thought I'd look at Netflix
1044000	1046000	And I like the fact that you can add the movies
1046000	1048000	From the Netflix channel now
1048000	1050000	You can kind of browse through what new movies are out and things
1050000	1052000	I thought that was pretty awesome
1052000	1054000	Then I turn it off and I'm off doing other things for a while
1054000	1056000	And then I'm bored
1056000	1058000	So I put a tweet up on Twitter that says
1058000	1060000	Hi, I'm bored, who wants to play Rock Band?
1060000	1062000	So a couple of the OLR listeners are like, me, me, me
1062000	1064000	So they invite me into a game
1064000	1066000	We're playing some Rock Band, da, da, da, da, da
1066000	1068000	I have to step away for a little bit because I gotta do some other errands real quick
1068000	1070000	And I got other things I gotta do
1070000	1072000	But then I go back after about 20 minutes
1072000	1074000	Turn on the Xbox 360 again and then
1074000	1076000	It starts doing all
1076000	1078000	That's actually the sound it makes
1078000	1080000	It just starts throwing up everywhere
1080000	1082000	Making all these, like, jaggeds on the screen
1082000	1084000	And looks very ugly
1084000	1086000	And it'll happen in the middle of a game
1086000	1088000	It'll happen when I'm trying to boot up and so forth
1088000	1090000	So, of course, what do I instantly blame?
1090000	1092000	The patch that went out on Wednesday
1092000	1094000	I'm like, oh my god, my system got borked by the patch
1094000	1096000	I'm becoming a statistic
1096000	1098000	I'm like, this happened before, right?
1098000	1100000	And we have a ton of people that got their Xboxes screwed up because of the patch
1100000	1102000	Well, turns out
1102000	1104000	There's a handful of people on Twitter
1104000	1106000	Who claim that happened, but
1106000	1108000	I made this whole YouTube and I posted it to the
1108000	1110000	Orange Ons Radio channel and most people are telling me
1110000	1112000	Just have lucky timing
1112000	1114000	And your system's about to red ring
1114000	1116000	Well, I can fucking tell that
1116000	1118000	It's obviously about to red ring
1118000	1120000	It's broken already
1120000	1122000	I mean, it's not getting past a certain point, red ring or not
1122000	1124000	So, congratulations me, my Xbox is broke
1124000	1126000	And, once you know it
1126000	1128000	I'm just outside the three year warranty thing
1128000	1130000	That means I get to open it up
1130000	1132000	I'm like three years and six months after it
1132000	1134000	That means I get to open it up
1134000	1136000	You wanna open it up?
1136000	1138000	We'll see, we can fix it
1138000	1140000	I've had a few
1140000	1142000	Oh, goodie
1142000	1144000	Hey, 50% is better than zero percent
1144000	1146000	Sounds like my trauma center record, look
1146000	1148000	I don't know, I'm kind of all about fixing it
1148000	1150000	But at the same time, I'm like
1150000	1152000	And there's a story later on about price cuts
1152000	1154000	And I'm like, maybe I'll just wait and get the elite system
1154000	1156000	Because I kinda want the new stuff
1156000	1158000	But, hold on a minute
1158000	1160000	Why am I allowing myself to think this way?
1160000	1162000	Why do I even need to be worrying about repairs and so on in the first place?
1162000	1164000	What the hell kind of system
1164000	1166000	Fries itself after three years?
1166000	1168000	Really?
1168000	1170000	Video game systems
1170000	1172000	Most of them have been pretty stable
1172000	1174000	Most people have old school Nintendos that still work
1174000	1176000	Granted, you have to blow on the cartridge and so on
1176000	1178000	But, not bad for like 25 years old
1178000	1180000	Eh?
1180000	1182000	You're preaching to the choir, okay?
1182000	1184000	I have five systems that have died, okay?
1184000	1186000	My Dreamcast is 10 years old and still works
1186000	1188000	We've been celebrating the Genesis
1188000	1190000	On Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight
1190000	1192000	He was talking a lot about that
1192000	1194000	That just celebrated his 20th anniversary
1194000	1196000	Those still work
1196000	1198000	That are older than most of our listeners ages combined
1198000	1200000	In the back room of my house
1200000	1202000	That, guess what?
1202000	1204000	Still work!
1204000	1206000	Except for the Atari 7800, but it still has an hour supply
1206000	1208000	So, let's not talk about that
1208000	1210000	It's just stupid
1210000	1212000	Like, and I just
1212000	1214000	You know, it's just kind of funny
1214000	1216000	The response I was getting was a lot of people was like, yep
1216000	1218000	You're Red Ringing 2
1218000	1220000	Oh yeah, oh yeah, I've been there
1220000	1222000	And, you know, I couldn't help but think
1222000	1224000	I'm so grateful that everybody's letting me know
1224000	1226000	I'm not alone
1226000	1228000	On the other hand, I'm thinking
1228000	1230000	What the hell kind of gaming society have we become
1230000	1232000	That this is even borderline acceptable
1232000	1234000	That we've just chalked this up to
1234000	1236000	Eh, it happens
1236000	1238000	Oh yeah, oh yeah
1238000	1240000	Those Xbox 360s
1240000	1242000	Totally unreliable
1242000	1244000	I guess I'll have to get another one
1244000	1246000	I'm just thinking to myself
1246000	1248000	Where did we go wrong?
1248000	1250000	Where did we allow this to be acceptable?
1250000	1252000	Why is Microsoft doing as well as they are?
1252000	1256000	To bring in a more sociological aspect to it
1256000	1258000	Sorry, this is the way the world is
1258000	1260000	Because your initial systems were broken
1260000	1262000	I was sort of doing something
1262000	1264000	Um
1264000	1266000	It's the fact that people would rather be complacent
1266000	1268000	Than put any effort into changing a situation
1268000	1270000	In general
1270000	1272000	And so, enough people just let it go
1272000	1274000	And they can get away with it
1274000	1276000	But, you know, enough people complain about something
1276000	1278000	And something might eventually happen
1278000	1280000	You know
1280000	1282000	If they think that they can get away with it this long
1282000	1284000	They're just gonna keep getting away with it
1284000	1286000	Until enough people hold them accountable
1286000	1288000	That's all there is to that
1288000	1290000	Well, all I have to say is that
1290000	1292000	It just sucks
1292000	1294000	Like, the whole thing just sucks
1294000	1296000	And Microsoft sucks
1296000	1298000	And, you know, you suck for not making more of a stink about it
1298000	1300000	Not you specifically
1300000	1302000	But you as gamers in general
1302000	1304000	And I suck for not realizing this before
1304000	1306000	And everything sucks
1306000	1308000	And the fact that I'm gonna have to buy a new 360
1308000	1310000	Sucks too
1310000	1312000	Or I guess I could get this one fixed
1312000	1314000	I'm having offers for fixing
1314000	1316000	And apparently Loki has an awesome 50% fixed record
1316000	1318000	And the other one was just unfixable
1318000	1320000	I tried everything, okay
1320000	1322000	It was just too far gone
1322000	1324000	Oh, who knows
1324000	1326000	And actdeft is apologizing to me in chat
1326000	1328000	But you don't need to apologize, it's not your fault
1328000	1330000	Stop apologizing
1330000	1332000	People who apologize for things that aren't their fault
1332000	1334000	Sucks
1334000	1336000	Well, that's actually the big thing
1336000	1338000	That I think
1338000	1340000	Is the problem with the industry
1340000	1342000	As it is now
1342000	1344000	With almost anything actually
1344000	1346000	Is that
1346000	1348000	Too many people are just
1348000	1350000	More willing to
1350000	1352000	Oh, I don't wanna conflict
1352000	1354000	I don't wanna put the effort into it
1354000	1356000	I don't wanna do this about it
1356000	1358000	Oh, well that's just how it is
1358000	1360000	That's how things are gonna be
1360000	1362000	You know
1362000	1364000	Everyone get off your asses
1364000	1366000	And complain if you've got something wrong
1366000	1368000	This is the thing
1368000	1370000	Here's what I want, I'm gonna put a challenge
1370000	1372000	Out there
1372000	1374000	This would make me happy
1374000	1376000	I will spend the $300 on a new elite
1376000	1378000	Or whatever I have to do when the price drop comes down
1378000	1380000	I will do all this stuff
1380000	1382000	And continue to just let Microsoft
1382000	1384000	Rate me in the butt as they're doing right now
1384000	1386000	I will continue to allow this
1386000	1388000	If my challenge goes responded to
1388000	1390000	By the media and the gaming industry
1390000	1392000	I know there's some of you insider folk that listen
1392000	1394000	And don't wanna admit it
1394000	1396000	I know there's some of you that work for gaming companies and so forth
1396000	1398000	That listen and probably don't wanna admit it to your employer
1398000	1400000	But look, this is the one thing I want
1400000	1402000	That will make me happy
1402000	1404000	Because in 3 or 4 years Microsoft is gonna come out
1404000	1406000	And tout their new console
1406000	1408000	Their Xbox 720
1408000	1410000	Or whatever you wanna call it
1410000	1412000	Or hell, there's talk that there might be a slim down
1412000	1414000	360
1414000	1416000	This is what I want
1416000	1418000	This is what I want every media outlet
1418000	1420000	This is what I want every gamer
1420000	1422000	To ask Microsoft
1422000	1424000	About their new system
1424000	1426000	Will it last more than 3 years?
1426000	1428000	Yeah
1428000	1430000	Does this system red ring
1430000	1432000	Those are the questions I want Microsoft
1432000	1434000	To be asked to their face
1434000	1436000	And have to answer
1436000	1438000	Why should I trust you
1438000	1440000	That your system is not another pile of poop
1440000	1442000	I do it
1442000	1444000	Okay, so this hasn't been done yet
1444000	1446000	I think that what we should do also
1446000	1448000	Is, and this is actually something
1448000	1450000	As a community
1450000	1452000	Have you ever heard of a site called
1452000	1454000	Starbucked.com?
1454000	1456000	No, but does this have to do with Battlestar Galactica?
1456000	1458000	No, it's about a person who had
1458000	1460000	Such a horrible customer service experience
1460000	1462000	With Starbucks
1462000	1464000	That he created a consumer advocacy site
1464000	1466000	So that people could voice their concerns regarding
1466000	1468000	Problems they've had with Starbucks
1468000	1470000	And his problem is actually something
1470000	1472000	That could have been fixed
1472000	1474000	If one person had gotten off their ass and helped him properly
1474000	1476000	So, um
1476000	1478000	I think that I should make a site
1478000	1480000	And don't nobody make it for me
1480000	1482000	Unless you want to make me an admin of it
1482000	1484000	Is a red ringed, you know
1484000	1486000	Oh, there's got to be a site like that already
1486000	1488000	I looked, there wasn't
1488000	1490000	Really?
1490000	1492000	You know, to make a big, you know
1492000	1494000	Hi, this is a picture of our red ringed system
1494000	1496000	This is what was done about it
1496000	1498000	And keep a running tally
1498000	1500000	Of all of these
1500000	1502000	And start, you know, sending
1502000	1504000	Up and go, hey look
1504000	1506000	Here's where you guys have screwed up
1506000	1508000	Here's our tally this week, here's our tally this week
1508000	1510000	Here, just search Twitter, seriously
1510000	1512000	Search Twitter, R-R-O-D, watch
1512000	1514000	I even, I was at work
1514000	1516000	On Friday and I mentioned, we had some
1516000	1518000	Down time because our systems were down
1518000	1520000	And I mentioned, oh yeah, my Xbox
1520000	1522000	And people I never suspected even played
1522000	1524000	Video games, like outside of like
1524000	1526000	Madden and stuff were saying, oh you got the
1526000	1528000	Red rings, huh? Yeah, I got that too
1528000	1530000	And like everybody in class was piping up
1530000	1532000	Yeah, the red rings, oh I know the red rings
1532000	1534000	Well you know what, then why not, let's
1534000	1536000	Let's, um, if I pulled up
1536000	1538000	Everything on Twitter that had
1538000	1540000	Red ring of death, printed it out
1540000	1542000	In black and white because I don't want to save my color cartridges
1542000	1544000	And emailed the stack
1544000	1546000	Not emailed, but mailed the stack
1546000	1548000	Of papers to
1548000	1550000	Microsoft and go, look
1550000	1552000	I don't think they do anything
1552000	1554000	Because people are still buying 360's
1554000	1556000	But what's it do? So it doesn't boot up now?
1556000	1558000	Or is it just not play your games?
1558000	1560000	It does a blalalala thing after
1560000	1562000	It's been on like two minutes
1562000	1564000	Sometimes during the boot, sometimes while I'm in the middle of the game
1564000	1566000	Doesn't matter
1566000	1568000	To be honest, I haven't really tried it since that one night
1568000	1570000	So
1570000	1572000	That's where I'm at
1572000	1574000	To be perfectly honest though
1574000	1576000	I mean, I think we're on
1576000	1578000	What, our third
1578000	1580000	360, but keep in mind
1580000	1582000	We have an advantage
1582000	1584000	I just want the history of gaming to put
1584000	1586000	A black mark on, excuse me
1586000	1588000	A red mark on Xbox
1588000	1590000	A red ring around the Xbox
1590000	1592000	A red ring on the Xbox 360
1592000	1594000	For this travesty
1594000	1596000	And the fact that they're covering it up very well
1596000	1598000	I mean, has there been any console
1598000	1600000	In history
1600000	1602000	That has the hardware issues that the 360 has?
1602000	1604000	The reason why
1604000	1606000	They, I think are being able
1606000	1608000	To keep their head afloat regarding everything
1608000	1610000	Is the fact that they've been so quick to replace
1610000	1612000	Systems too
1612000	1614000	Like, I know, honestly Rob
1614000	1616000	I think you should still give a call, give a try
1616000	1618000	You know, say hey
1618000	1620000	I bought this, you know, before
1620000	1622000	All this was going on
1622000	1624000	You guys owe me
1624000	1626000	You know, see what happens
1626000	1628000	You know, if they want to keep your business as a customer
1628000	1630000	They're gonna bend over backwards
1630000	1632000	Bobby says the PS2, Bobby actually says a lot in chat
1632000	1634000	Let me read some of the comments from chat
1634000	1636000	Bobby says they know
1636000	1638000	Sorry, Microsoft knows
1638000	1640000	They know, they won't admit it, but they know
1640000	1642000	And
1642000	1644000	Yeah, he says his original
1644000	1646000	Xbox still works, so does mine
1646000	1648000	Mine does too
1648000	1650000	And he goes on to say the difference between the PS2 and the 360
1650000	1652000	Is that there were no blogs when the PS2s
1652000	1654000	Were failing in mass, and you know, that's
1654000	1656000	Certainly a legitimate viewpoint
1656000	1658000	I don't know, see here's the thing though
1658000	1660000	I don't know anyone that had a PS2 that failed
1660000	1662000	Outside of people I've met on the internet
1662000	1664000	Like, when I was gaming
1664000	1666000	I didn't know anybody that had a failed PS2
1666000	1668000	Mine didn't fail, I know like 50 people that have
1668000	1670000	360s fail
1670000	1672000	My Japanese PS2, guess what?
1672000	1674000	It still works!
1674000	1676000	Yeah, my Japanese PS2 still works too
1676000	1678000	I mean, first release model
1678000	1680000	We got ours way back when
1680000	1682000	We had this like
1682000	1684000	Cause I wanted Tekken that bad
1684000	1686000	So we got our
1686000	1688000	We have a Japanese PS3
1688000	1690000	There was I think a PS2, sorry
1690000	1692000	If I'm right, it was a demo system
1692000	1694000	Back from when Game Masters
1694000	1696000	Was still open
1696000	1698000	And that was years ago
1698000	1700000	And I'm on my fifth PS2 and you met me in person
1700000	1702000	I guess that's true
1702000	1704000	But you know what I mean, like, you know
1704000	1706000	My Japanese PS2 still works perfectly
1706000	1708000	And those are the ones that were
1708000	1710000	Definitely having problems back in the day
1710000	1712000	My PS2 that I have now
1712000	1714000	Works perfectly
1714000	1716000	I'm just annoyed
1716000	1718000	What else did we get in chat?
1718000	1720000	I do have a stack of PS1s by the way
1720000	1722000	I want to get onto other stuff in my gaming week
1722000	1724000	Cause I did more than just bitch about my
1724000	1726000	Bork to Xbox 360, but let's see, what else was there
1726000	1728000	I think I posted a chat from Wiki
1728000	1730000	In response to the November 2006 update
1730000	1732000	Error that bricked his console
1732000	1734000	A California man filed a class action lawsuit against
1734000	1736000	Microsoft in Washington federal court in early December
1736000	1738000	2006, the lawsuit seeks
1738000	1740000	5 million in damages and the free repair of any
1740000	1742000	Console rendered unusable by the update
1742000	1744000	This will be the second such lawsuit filed against
1744000	1746000	Microsoft, the first having been filed in 2005
1746000	1748000	Shortly after the... etc
1748000	1750000	Unfortunately not enough
1750000	1752000	People had their consoles borked by this update
1752000	1754000	And people are, you know, telling me up and down
1754000	1756000	That it wasn't the update
1756000	1758000	All I know is that, you know
1758000	1760000	It sure is convenient timing for this to happen
1760000	1762000	Have you tried bringing it without the hard drive?
1762000	1764000	I haven't, should I try that?
1764000	1766000	Yes
1766000	1768000	Ok, I'll try that, see what happens
1768000	1770000	Because it could be something corrupted on the hard drive
1770000	1772000	Do you have Rock Band 2 installed to your hard drive?
1772000	1774000	I do, but the thing will crap out before
1774000	1776000	Even playing Rock Band 2
1776000	1778000	But you have it installed to your hard drive
1778000	1780000	Cause it just reads your disc for a second
1780000	1782000	And then it runs it off the hard drive
1782000	1784000	Ok, I'll try that
1784000	1786000	That would certainly be better, but we'll see
1786000	1788000	Alright, anyhow
1788000	1790000	Other stuff I played my gaming week
1790000	1792000	Cause I have much more in my gaming week than just
1792000	1794000	Abort 360 that I still, by the way
1794000	1796000	My resolution right now is I'm not doing anything
1796000	1798000	Till this rumored price drop will get to later in the show
1798000	1800000	Maybe I'll get it repaired
1800000	1802000	I don't know, right now I'm leaning
1802000	1804000	Right now I'm leaning towards just getting a new
1804000	1806000	360
1806000	1808000	Get a new one and make sure it's a new elite, not an older elite
1808000	1810000	That people have been sitting on forever
1810000	1812000	Or, yeah, that's what I'll try and do
1812000	1814000	But anyhow
1814000	1816000	What I wanted to get into elsewhere in my gaming week
1816000	1818000	Because this is something that deserves
1818000	1820000	Positive talk and not negative talk
1820000	1822000	Is Ion Online I played a little more of
1822000	1824000	They had their next closed beta
1824000	1826000	I guess the final one, it's the second closed beta
1826000	1828000	I've participated in
1828000	1830000	And I got to play the game a lot more than
1830000	1832000	Two weeks ago, the first time I played the beta for Ion Online
1832000	1834000	I still feel like I've only really
1834000	1836000	Scratched the surface of the game
1836000	1838000	And I was having a lot of problems with
1838000	1840000	Graphics stuff
1840000	1842000	The game doesn't work too hot with
1842000	1844000	Vista, but I found if I ran in full screen windowed mode
1844000	1846000	I was able to get a much better frame rate
1846000	1848000	So, you know, just you have to really
1848000	1850000	Tinker with those settings and at least they've made it very
1850000	1852000	Customizable in the graphics and so on
1852000	1854000	The game is a very good looking game
1854000	1856000	It's a very smooth game
1856000	1858000	It's kind of fun, it's wow-ish
1858000	1860000	It definitely, you can feel the
1860000	1862000	Wow inspiration there, but one thing I liked
1862000	1864000	That WoW doesn't have is the
1864000	1866000	Whole chained combat
1866000	1868000	Meaning that there are moves that you can do
1868000	1870000	That only open up after you do
1870000	1872000	A first move, like maybe you do a
1872000	1874000	Special little thing with your mace, then you can make
1874000	1876000	A lightning bolt fall down or whatever
1876000	1878000	It's branching combos
1878000	1880000	Ragnarok Online has that
1880000	1882000	Yeah, Monk class, you have your combos
1882000	1884000	Well that's every class in this game has something like that
1884000	1886000	But I mean, I'm saying that Ragnarok Online certainly
1886000	1888000	Thought of, you know, implementing stuff like that
1888000	1890000	Well sure, I'm sure a lot of what
1890000	1892000	Can be thought of has been thought of in MMOs
1892000	1894000	Who knows, there could be more though
1894000	1896000	I only got my character to level 8
1896000	1898000	Which is like scratching the surface of the game
1898000	1900000	I didn't even get into any PVP or instances or what have you
1900000	1902000	So can I fairly review this game?
1902000	1904000	No, but off the closed beta
1904000	1906000	Can I say I'm interested?
1906000	1908000	The game was fun enough
1908000	1910000	Where I would feel like I could buy the game
1910000	1912000	And I won't be getting ripped off
1912000	1914000	Yes, I think it's worth checking out
1914000	1916000	So that's what I plan to do in September
1916000	1918000	And then hopefully I'll be able to spend some more time with it
1918000	1920000	And tell you my final thoughts on it
1920000	1922000	So there you go
1922000	1924000	And I've been playing a priest
1924000	1926000	So, there it is
1928000	1930000	I wanna play
1930000	1932000	Anyhow
1934000	1936000	Hold on, I'm reading comments from chat here
1938000	1940000	About, yes
1940000	1942000	To publicly acknowledge it
1942000	1944000	Because it keeps going back and forth in chat
1944000	1946000	I am aware that CC Gaming
1946000	1948000	Repairs 360s
1948000	1950000	And would also take the 360 for scrap
1950000	1952000	I just haven't decided what I want to do yet
1952000	1954000	You know, because I'd have to ship it
1954000	1956000	Which is gonna be money, but
1956000	1958000	You know, I don't know
1958000	1960000	I want some time to think and try these
1960000	1962000	Other solutions too before I just
1962000	1964000	Commit to one particular solution
1964000	1966000	Certainly that's something I'm heavily considering
1966000	1968000	But we'll see
1968000	1970000	Alright
1970000	1972000	That's it for our gaming weeks
1972000	1974000	Let's get into
1974000	1976000	What's this present? Ooh, present
1976000	1978000	Some of my more obscure Bimani stuff
1978000	1980000	You burned me a DVD mini
1980000	1982000	Yeah, I remember you used to use CD
1982000	1984000	Minis all the time, now it's DVD Minis
1984000	1986000	Well that's because it was, they were
1986000	1988000	Cheap by the spindle and
1988000	1990000	You know, the pre-shift fit on them
1990000	1992000	Perfectly, all my stuff was just fine
1992000	1994000	But the next one I'm gonna burn you is an actual DVD
1994000	1996000	Alright, uh
1996000	1998000	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight
1998000	2000000	Of which we don't have a lot, but we will continue to plug our
2000000	2002000	Twitter at OLR and then of course we're on
2002000	2004000	Facebook as the OLR me
2004000	2006000	We have a MySpace supposedly too
2006000	2008000	Is anyone on MySpace anymore? No, we had some friend requests
2008000	2010000	There the other day, so I guess we do
2010000	2012000	And yeah, LiveJournal
2012000	2014000	Orange launch MySpace is so 2005
2014000	2016000	It really is, okay
2016000	2018000	Let's get into some gaming news then and we'll
2018000	2020000	Start with Loki
2020000	2022000	Yes, there is a couple of rumors
2022000	2024000	Regarding some Wii software
2024000	2026000	One of which is of course
2026000	2028000	Wii Fit, there is a rumored price point
2028000	2030000	For it, which of course
2030000	2032000	Not too surprising, they have the
2032000	2034000	Bundle at the
2034000	2036000	$99.99 price point
2036000	2038000	Which is, you know
2038000	2040000	Or I should say $99.99 price point
2040000	2042000	I think that's a little higher, that's kinda weird
2042000	2044000	But anyways, it's pretty close to what the
2044000	2046000	Normal Wii Fit bundle is
2046000	2048000	Then of course the rumor is the standalone
2048000	2050000	Game is gonna be $29.99 as well
2050000	2052000	No word exactly on
2052000	2054000	When those are gonna be officially announced
2054000	2056000	But I don't know
2056000	2058000	That sounds about right to me
2058000	2060000	You know, $29.99 for a game that's
2060000	2062000	Not too different than the original
2062000	2064000	Sounds fair, I guess
2064000	2066000	Maybe
2066000	2068000	The other weird thing though
2068000	2070000	That they have
2070000	2072000	And this is also coming from
2072000	2074000	A marketing survey, apparently
2074000	2076000	They have a slide
2076000	2078000	That shows
2078000	2080000	What appears to be some
2080000	2082000	Sort of new peripheral that's gonna be
2082000	2084000	With a game that's
2084000	2086000	Like a bicycling game and the peripheral
2086000	2088000	Itself actually looks like one of those
2088000	2090000	Oh
2090000	2092000	Gosh
2094000	2096000	I forget the kind of bike
2096000	2098000	The exercise bike?
2098000	2100000	Stationary?
2100000	2102000	Recumbent bike
2102000	2104000	I think, something like that
2104000	2106000	It's really interesting because
2106000	2108000	It almost looks like a Wii Fit type of
2108000	2110000	Game
2110000	2112000	You can definitely see Miis in the pictures
2112000	2114000	And stuff like that, but I don't think it's
2114000	2116000	Necessarily something from
2116000	2118000	Nintendo themselves
2118000	2120000	Because
2120000	2122000	Some of the other characters don't necessarily look like
2122000	2124000	Miis, but they have different things like
2124000	2126000	Road races, you can walk
2126000	2128000	Your dog in the game, you can do
2128000	2130000	Almost like a prop copter type thing
2130000	2132000	You can
2132000	2134000	Rotate one of the things
2134000	2136000	Spin a rotisserie barbecue
2136000	2138000	Downhill
2138000	2140000	Racing, you name it
2140000	2142000	And of course the usual
2142000	2144000	Calorie tracking and that kind of
2144000	2146000	Stuff, but I mean it looks kind of cool
2146000	2148000	And definitely something I could see on
2148000	2150000	The Wii, so
2150000	2152000	No word on what that is, I'm guessing it's probably a third
2152000	2154000	Party putting that out, probably someone like Ubisoft
2154000	2156000	Or EA or something
2156000	2158000	Well it wouldn't surprise me too if one of these
2158000	2160000	Bicycling things got picked up because it seems
2160000	2162000	Like at E3, remember when there was a
2162000	2164000	Kenshi Hall and everything? We would see something
2164000	2166000	Like this demoed, like a
2166000	2168000	Bicycling exercise game
2168000	2170000	There's some companies exploring this, have been
2170000	2172000	For a long time
2172000	2174000	I wouldn't be surprised if it even was Nintendo doing it or something
2174000	2176000	Just maybe that one screenshot
2176000	2178000	Is kind of misleading because the one character
2178000	2180000	Doesn't look like a Mii, but
2180000	2182000	Everything doesn't have to look like a Mii in the games
2182000	2184000	But who knows
2184000	2186000	The other thing is, it sort of looks like an island
2186000	2188000	Setting, and I know that they've talked about
2188000	2190000	Putting the other games on that stupid island
2190000	2192000	That they created for Wii Fit
2192000	2194000	In Wii Sports Resort
2194000	2196000	Wii Fit's on an island?
2196000	2198000	Well they have like, the jogging
2198000	2200000	Is on an island
2200000	2202000	So I don't know if it's the same island
2202000	2204000	But it's very similar
2204000	2206000	Skinny Island, what would the name of that island be?
2206000	2208000	It's WooHoo Island or something
2208000	2210000	WooHoo Island? I think that's what they called it
2210000	2212000	WooHoo, I'm not fat anymore, yay
2214000	2216000	Or Sex Island, as Sims would call it
2216000	2218000	WooHoo Island
2218000	2220000	WooHoo! Whoopee
2220000	2222000	I don't know
2222000	2224000	It's neat
2224000	2226000	I would be more excited about the pedal thing than I would be
2226000	2228000	The Wii Fit balance board, because at least the pedal thing
2228000	2230000	You know, it seems like exercise
2230000	2232000	Whereas the balance board, you're just kind of
2232000	2234000	Standing there, leaning back and forth
2234000	2236000	You know, back and forth
2236000	2238000	I don't know
2238000	2240000	Again, our good friend Bobby is just piping up with all sorts of trivia tonight
2240000	2242000	Saying Miyamoto wants that to become
2242000	2244000	One of the new characters that is indeed
2244000	2246000	WooHoo Island
2246000	2248000	Is the name of where all this takes place
2248000	2250000	Well I don't want to see any other games with the island
2250000	2252000	You know, running around doing stuff
2252000	2254000	You know, Mario at WooHoo Island
2254000	2256000	You know, killing Koopas
2256000	2258000	Oh wait for it, it'll happen
2258000	2260000	There's a new Smash Brothers game with WooHoo Island
2260000	2262000	As a playable character
2262000	2264000	That'll be a stage, it'll be a stage
2264000	2266000	No, it'll be a character
2266000	2268000	The island will be a character
2268000	2270000	He said it himself, the island's a character
2270000	2272000	Spoiler right there
2272000	2274000	I mean, how do you face off against a whole island?
2274000	2276000	You can't
2276000	2278000	X-Men did it
2278000	2280000	Giants has X-Men number one
2280000	2282000	Uh huh
2282000	2284000	Oh my gosh
2284000	2286000	Told you I'm a geek
2286000	2288000	Um, so uh
2288000	2290000	I don't know, what do you guys think of this?
2290000	2292000	Is this bicycle peripheral something that would interest you guys?
2292000	2294000	Or no?
2294000	2296000	It'd be interesting to see it, but
2296000	2298000	Once again, I'd probably use it about as much as I do Wii Fit
2298000	2300000	Wii Fit though, it fills the space
2300000	2302000	Underneath my TV stand
2302000	2304000	That's it
2304000	2306000	You should lend it to me
2306000	2308000	It's all about price to me
2308000	2310000	I actually use Wii Fit once in a while
2310000	2312000	I haven't lately, I've been slacking off
2312000	2314000	And I need to stop doing that
2314000	2316000	It's summer, it's too hot in the summer
2316000	2318000	The price would be $89.99
2318000	2320000	Including the peripheral, it's about the price of a Wii Fit
2320000	2322000	For the bike and the game?
2322000	2324000	That's not terrible
2324000	2326000	If the game was fun and the bike thing actually worked
2326000	2328000	Cause she's actually sitting on the couch
2328000	2330000	Or something, right?
2330000	2332000	And the bike is kinda there
2332000	2334000	If that is actually sturdy
2334000	2336000	Then that might be cool
2336000	2338000	I don't know though
2338000	2340000	We'll have to see
2340000	2342000	I like exercise bikes and stuff
2342000	2344000	You know what, I can go to my gym
2344000	2346000	And play my Gameboy on a bike
2346000	2348000	But that's also how much a month?
2348000	2350000	I don't pay a whole lot for my gym
2350000	2352000	I'm out of contract
2352000	2354000	I see
2354000	2356000	Alright, moving on to some other news
2356000	2358000	Talking about something on the DS
2358000	2360000	As opposed to the Nintendo Wii
2360000	2362000	Dragon Quest IX of course
2362000	2364000	Was a huge game over in Japan when it came out
2364000	2366000	As all Dragon Quest games are
2366000	2368000	And so of course the question is
2368000	2370000	When is it going to come out over here?
2370000	2372000	Well apparently there was a Q&A session
2372000	2374000	This week with investors
2374000	2376000	And the president of Squeenix
2376000	2378000	Yoishi Wada said that they are
2378000	2380000	Considering releasing Dragon Quest IX
2380000	2382000	Overseas
2382000	2384000	And still deciding which regions are actually
2384000	2386000	Going to get it
2386000	2388000	And they don't plan to release it until after April
2388000	2390000	Of 2010
2390000	2392000	They're assholes is basically what it is
2392000	2394000	I'm serious, it's just like
2394000	2396000	Eh, why do we feel like it?
2396000	2398000	You'll be lucky and be pleased when you get it
2398000	2400000	It's just like
2400000	2402000	You know, they see the fans of the series
2402000	2404000	Over here just as like
2404000	2406000	Beggars on the street that they
2406000	2408000	May casually throw down their
2408000	2410000	Money so that they can bask in the glory
2410000	2412000	Of Dragon Quest
2412000	2414000	They can go fuck themselves because I don't give a shit
2414000	2416000	About their fucking game
2416000	2418000	Dragon Quest is a horrible series in my opinion
2418000	2420000	Oh, now come on, now you're just being petty
2420000	2422000	Because Dragon Quest VIII was awesome
2422000	2424000	No it wasn't
2424000	2426000	And Dragon Quest VIII
2426000	2428000	Sold about half a million copies here in North America
2428000	2430000	That isn't any
2430000	2432000	Small number, I mean is it a blockbuster?
2432000	2434000	No
2434000	2436000	Is it pretty decent? Yeah
2436000	2438000	So why not?
2438000	2440000	And look, I'm going to say something that I know is going to piss
2440000	2442000	Some people off but I kind of don't care because I'm just
2442000	2444000	Keeping it real, okay
2444000	2446000	This is the case when I support piracy
2446000	2448000	Honestly
2448000	2450000	When these foreign companies are too stubborn
2450000	2452000	To release the games over here
2452000	2454000	I say you know what
2454000	2456000	Then if you can understand Japanese
2456000	2458000	Copy the Japanese one and get it
2458000	2460000	Why do you have to worry about that? Because they have people that will
2460000	2462000	Translate it and then they'll add a patch
2462000	2464000	To the ROM and boom it's in English
2464000	2466000	And I know I'm going to take some flack for that comment
2466000	2468000	But I kind of don't care because I was doing that with
2468000	2470000	DDR years ago when they
2470000	2472000	Refused to release that over here and you know
2472000	2474000	When they finally released it over here I bought
2474000	2476000	Every single one even when they were crap
2476000	2478000	For quite a while
2478000	2480000	And Konami thanks you for that by releasing even
2480000	2482000	Crappier games
2482000	2484000	The lesson we learned there that doesn't matter
2484000	2486000	But I just
2486000	2488000	This kind of news that like they just
2488000	2490000	I'm all about like
2490000	2492000	I understand resources and that there's
2492000	2494000	Other games they want to do
2494000	2496000	And maybe they want to do some things that are outside the box
2496000	2498000	And so forth but I don't know
2498000	2500000	This thing kind of just reeks of
2500000	2502000	And we just don't feel
2502000	2504000	Like it right now
2504000	2506000	Type thing
2506000	2508000	And some folks in chat GameGuru says
2508000	2510000	Mother 3 in Act F speaks up
2510000	2512000	With the Mother 3 fan translation
2512000	2514000	Yeah
2514000	2516000	I'm all for that too
2516000	2518000	You know
2518000	2520000	I'm just
2520000	2522000	I don't understand why they just won't
2522000	2524000	I can't imagine it takes that
2524000	2526000	Long to translate a game especially when
2526000	2528000	You have fans that translate it
2528000	2530000	For you
2530000	2532000	I mean that's got to be the ultimate kick in the pants
2532000	2534000	When you have these fan companies
2534000	2536000	Beating you to it
2536000	2538000	People that are paid 40 hours
2538000	2540000	A week to do this
2540000	2542000	I don't know
2542000	2544000	Keep in mind though that when
2544000	2546000	They do it themselves
2546000	2548000	Not only do they have to pay
2548000	2550000	Translator, they have to
2550000	2552000	Pay writer
2552000	2554000	They have to take the time to change
2554000	2556000	Anything in game
2556000	2558000	Graphically that has
2558000	2560000	They need to
2560000	2562000	Translate from one language to another
2562000	2564000	They have to pay
2564000	2566000	Someone to localize it
2566000	2568000	To make the jokes come across
2568000	2570000	I played through a
2570000	2572000	Fan done copy of Final Fantasy 5
2572000	2574000	And there were just a few things in there
2574000	2576000	That I got because I had
2576000	2578000	Studied some Japanese for a while
2578000	2580000	That I don't know that other people
2580000	2582000	Might have gotten because the joke
2582000	2584000	Is
2584000	2586000	It was actually a pun
2586000	2588000	So
2588000	2590000	There are things that are lost in translation
2590000	2592000	That you do have to
2592000	2594000	Go through
2594000	2596000	Reorganizing for the cultural element
2596000	2598000	To make it something that would be
2598000	2600000	Understood by your audience
2600000	2602000	So there is actually a good deal of cost
2602000	2604000	That comes in with
2604000	2606000	The translation process
2606000	2608000	When you are paying for it
2608000	2610000	For the fans
2610000	2612000	For them, it's a labor of love
2612000	2614000	It's something that they enjoy doing
2614000	2616000	But when the company brings it out, they have to pay
2616000	2618000	Somebody to do this
2618000	2620000	And even if someone says, oh I'll do it for free
2620000	2622000	I'm sorry that doesn't work, you still have to pay them
2622000	2624000	Because there are labor laws
2624000	2626000	And then there is marketing
2626000	2628000	There is
2628000	2630000	Production cost
2630000	2632000	In the actual physical copies of the game
2632000	2634000	There's
2634000	2636000	You know, shipment
2636000	2638000	You have to deal with a lot of the money
2638000	2640000	That they would make back on Dragon Quest 9?
2640000	2642000	But when they also
2642000	2644000	And again, I'm doing this straight from a business
2644000	2646000	Perspective, they have to look at previous sales
2646000	2648000	And look at what their overhead was
2648000	2650000	Versus how much they actually made
2650000	2652000	The last few games that they have localized over here
2652000	2654000	At least on the 360 and stuff, haven't done that great
2654000	2656000	I mean, Star Ocean, Last Hope wasn't all that great
2656000	2658000	The Last Remnant
2658000	2660000	Was not that great at all
2660000	2662000	The game itself wasn't that great
2662000	2664000	And then the one before that, which I don't remember
2664000	2666000	The name off the top of my head
2666000	2668000	But that didn't do that well either
2668000	2670000	It's just, I don't know
2670000	2672000	Was that Infinite on Discovery?
2672000	2674000	Yes, Infinite on Discovery
2674000	2676000	But there's just a lot of weird stuff that they're doing
2676000	2678000	Like, Chrono Trigger did alright
2678000	2680000	Shit, dude, it's just a ROM
2680000	2682000	That they're basically running off an emulator
2682000	2684000	I mean, that's basically all they did
2684000	2686000	You can't tell me that they programmed the engine
2686000	2688000	From scratch and rebuilt the game
2688000	2690000	I'm sorry, I don't buy that at all
2690000	2694000	And I could totally see them going the route of like
2694000	2698000	You know, the Final Fantasy 4 after years stuff
2698000	2700000	Where they just take the ROM and kind of edit it
2700000	2702000	And add some new stuff to it
2702000	2704000	And boom, new game, let's resell it
2704000	2706000	And even the stuff that they've done online
2706000	2708000	Like Final Fantasy 4 and whatnot
2708000	2710000	I mean, My Life as a King is kind of eh
2710000	2712000	When they had download content
2712000	2714000	That probably should have been included in the game to begin with
2714000	2716000	And My Life as a Dark Lord was kind of eh
2716000	2718000	It was alright, I guess
2718000	2720000	And their tactical
2720000	2722000	I don't remember the other Final Fantasy tactical game
2722000	2724000	That they had
2724000	2726000	The Tower Defense one
2726000	2728000	Is kind of just
2728000	2730000	This is alright, but they haven't really been having
2730000	2732000	That many good hits lately
2732000	2734000	And other than Final Fantasy 4 and 3 and stuff like that
2734000	2736000	On DS
2736000	2738000	When they actually remade them
2738000	2740000	And that was kind of cool
2740000	2742000	Because there's effort put into it
2742000	2744000	And it's Final Fantasy
2744000	2746000	But I don't know, maybe they're just worried
2746000	2748000	That it's not going to do as well
2748000	2750000	And why pay the money to have it, you know, translated
2750000	2752000	But it's a major release for them
2752000	2754000	I don't see why they wouldn't do it
2754000	2756000	They're probably going to do it
2756000	2758000	And it'll just take some time
2758000	2760000	Because, you know, as history has shown
2760000	2762000	Square is really slow
2762000	2764000	When it comes to finishing their games
2768000	2770000	I'm looking at some comments in chat
2770000	2772000	Gripper01
2772000	2774000	Says
2774000	2776000	Plus with fan translations they are not censored
2776000	2778000	Like the early Final Fantasy translations
2778000	2780000	Hmm
2780000	2782000	Apparently
2782000	2784000	GameGuru is saying
2784000	2786000	Atlas even offered to publish Mother 3 for Nintendo
2786000	2788000	And Nintendo of Japan denied it
2788000	2790000	And I guess this whole back and forth
2790000	2792000	Is that because of all the parity
2792000	2794000	In the games
2794000	2796000	Nintendo of America is afraid of getting sued
2796000	2798000	So they want to make some changes
2798000	2800000	And Nintendo of Japan won't let them
2800000	2802000	It's just weird, that whole mess
2802000	2804000	So why don't they release it in, well
2804000	2806000	Do they, have they released it like on
2806000	2808000	Virtual console or something like that?
2808000	2810000	Mother 3 is a DS game, so no
2810000	2812000	It's a Game Boy Advance game
2812000	2814000	But they could still do it
2814000	2816000	I don't know, I mean it's basically Super Nintendo
2816000	2818000	I don't, they
2818000	2820000	In theory I think it could be done
2820000	2822000	Actually I need to find the translated ROM
2822000	2824000	Because I am going to play the translated ROM
2824000	2826000	People
2826000	2828000	I'm saying this now
2828000	2830000	Because I don't care
2830000	2832000	But yeah, actually something that brings the other thing
2832000	2834000	Going back to what I was saying
2834000	2836000	Is you also have to deal with distribution
2836000	2838000	And with dealing with the companies
2838000	2840000	That you're going to be releasing the game through
2840000	2842000	Money, it all comes down to money
2842000	2844000	I guess
2844000	2846000	Alright, well let's move on
2846000	2848000	With some more news while I steam over
2848000	2850000	Not having Dragon Quest 9, I guess
2850000	2852000	It's not that bad, because this is a DS game
2852000	2854000	And I don't have the attention span for DS games
2854000	2856000	So whatever
2856000	2858000	Well, how about something else that you'd have
2858000	2860000	To have a bit of an attention span if you plan on
2860000	2862000	Finishing it at all
2862000	2864000	Mega Man 9
2864000	2866000	There's new download content, and guess what it does
2866000	2868000	It makes the game harder
2868000	2870000	Why?
2870000	2872000	You have Super Hero Mode
2872000	2874000	Which costs a dollar
2874000	2876000	A whole dollar
2876000	2878000	A whole dollar, it's 80 Microsoft points
2878000	2880000	And
2880000	2882000	It basically
2882000	2884000	Just keeps, it increases the number of
2884000	2886000	Enemies that you're going to see on screen
2886000	2888000	At any given time in the game
2888000	2890000	So yeah, it's for all you
2890000	2892000	People who want the next big challenge
2892000	2894000	It's basically for people who like asshole Mario
2894000	2896000	Or who have like those
2896000	2898000	Leftover points that you just can't seem
2898000	2900000	To get rid of, because everything is
2900000	2902000	Everything is in multiples
2902000	2904000	Of 100, except rock band songs
2904000	2906000	See, that would be kind of cool
2906000	2908000	If they did that for like Super Mario Brothers
2908000	2910000	Like re-release Mario Brothers
2910000	2912000	With a level editor or something like that
2912000	2914000	And then have it where you could share levels online
2914000	2916000	Of course that would be innovative and use online
2916000	2918000	So Nintendo would never buy that
2918000	2920000	A perfect example of something you could do
2920000	2922000	Simple, you don't have to actually program
2922000	2924000	Really a whole ton to it
2924000	2926000	Release it
2926000	2928000	People would love it
2928000	2930000	And you'd get a lot of money back
2930000	2932000	You'd put a lot of effort in
2932000	2934000	Because Nintendo certainly doesn't do that
2934000	2936000	Yeah, but then they'd get sued for copying
2936000	2938000	Little Big Planet
2938000	2940000	Yeah, I'm in the camp that's like
2940000	2942000	Isn't Mega Man 9 hard enough?
2942000	2944000	I guess there's definitely the hardcore fans
2944000	2946000	I haven't played it yet, I bought it a long time ago
2946000	2948000	But I still haven't played it
2948000	2950000	I only was able to beat like 3 or 4 of the robots
2950000	2952000	Before I was like, okay I'm spent
2952000	2954000	I'm done
2954000	2956000	You know what I'd like to see?
2956000	2958000	I'd actually like to see a new
2958000	2960000	That would make me happy
2960000	2962000	How about some Mega Man 9 easy mode content?
2962000	2964000	I'd pay a dollar for that
2964000	2968000	Actually I had an idea of something that I would like to see
2968000	2970000	And that's called like
2970000	2972000	Like Uber Man
2972000	2974000	Where it's Mega Man and you have to fight through
2974000	2978000	All of the 1 through 9 robots
2978000	2980000	And then do the Uber Wily stage
2980000	2984000	I think that's every Mega Man fan's dream game
2984000	2986000	Just Mega Man orgy
2986000	2990000	Where it's like all 81 master robots
2990000	2992000	Or however many they've had over the series
2992000	2994000	Not even counting X
2994000	2996000	I'm not even going to throw the X series into it
2996000	2998000	Because that could be like the sequel when this game does well
2998000	3000000	But Mega Man orgy would just be a game
3000000	3002000	Where it's like all 81 robots
3002000	3004000	Going at it at once
3004000	3006000	And then do it Metroid style
3006000	3008000	Which is a very interesting orgy
3008000	3010000	Considering one of those robots is a woman
3010000	3012000	And the other 80 are men
3012000	3014000	Just do it all Metroid style
3014000	3016000	And make the dungeons like Mega Man Legends
3016000	3018000	Tie that in there
3018000	3020000	Oh that would be hot
3020000	3022000	But it has to remain 2D
3022000	3024000	It has to remain 2D
3024000	3026000	I was thinking of a game that just had all 81 stages in it
3026000	3028000	And playable at once
3028000	3030000	But I like your idea of a
3030000	3032000	Metroidvania style Mega Man game
3032000	3034000	With all the robots
3034000	3036000	That's pretty cool
3036000	3038000	And if you totally used the escape velocity thing
3038000	3040000	Then you would be able to
3040000	3042000	Go back to your last save point
3042000	3044000	You know, location
3044000	3046000	Do weird warps like that
3046000	3048000	And then Samus would come out and kick Mega Man's ass
3048000	3050000	So you totally took my game
3050000	3052000	But that actually is
3052000	3054000	Ok we're putting that under Dream Games
3054000	3056000	And 4 player co-op because that would be awesome
3056000	3058000	Just for fun
3058000	3060000	That's under Dream Games now for Orange Knowledge Radio
3060000	3062000	It's an official Dream Game
3062000	3064000	What Mega Man orgy?
3064000	3066000	Yeah Mega Man orgy
3066000	3068000	I like what ActDeft calls it in chat
3068000	3070000	Mega 10 RGY
3070000	3072000	So the 0 is an o in orgy
3072000	3074000	I like that
3074000	3076000	Ok
3076000	3078000	You are now marketing director of this game
3078000	3080000	Congratulations on your promotion
3080000	3082000	You now get a non-existent job
3082000	3084000	So add that to the wiki
3084000	3086000	That's going on the list
3086000	3088000	And at the end
3088000	3090000	There's a big butt
3090000	3092000	What?
3092000	3094000	Are you high?
3094000	3096000	It's an easter egg
3096000	3098000	You know like when you can hold the buttons down
3098000	3100000	And the stars turn into chickens
3100000	3102000	Why would you just put a big butt
3102000	3104000	At the end of the game?
3104000	3106000	Are you like high?
3106000	3108000	Because it's on our list
3108000	3110000	Are you 5 years old?
3110000	3112000	Way to take a perfectly awesome game
3112000	3114000	And just literally shit on it
3114000	3116000	Because it's on our list
3116000	3118000	It would have a caption
3118000	3120000	Kiss our ass Capcom
3120000	3122000	No you don't do that
3122000	3124000	That's wrong
3124000	3126000	Oh come on you should look at our other games on our list
3126000	3128000	Exactly
3128000	3130000	This is why it doesn't need to be on the list
3130000	3132000	Because that list is just ridiculous stuff
3132000	3134000	This is ridiculous it's never gonna happen
3134000	3136000	Well it's just because it's never gonna happen
3136000	3138000	It's just I don't have
3138000	3140000	I'm sure there's people out there that have done custom Mega Man games
3140000	3142000	And it wouldn't be that difficult
3142000	3144000	The chat room would like to point out that what you're describing
3144000	3146000	Could be Guts Man's ass
3146000	3148000	It could be
3148000	3150000	Easter egg in the game you know
3150000	3152000	Guts Man with a certain number of life left
3152000	3156000	And you get a butt
3156000	3158000	What is wrong with you?
3158000	3160000	What is wrong with me for finding this funny?
3160000	3162000	How old am I? Like five?
3162000	3164000	Seriously?
3164000	3166000	It doesn't matter it's all for fun
3166000	3168000	Fun does not require an age
3168000	3170000	Alright but fun requires a new story real quick
3170000	3172000	Here before this story or before this show
3172000	3174000	Literally goes down the crapper
3174000	3176000	Speaking of your butt
3176000	3178000	Nintendo has patented a brand new
3178000	3180000	Inflatable cushion that you would use
3180000	3182000	For a horseback riding game
3182000	3184000	Why?
3184000	3186000	Just that's the most retarded thing
3186000	3188000	I have ever heard
3188000	3190000	It looks absolutely awful
3190000	3192000	It basically their picture that they have
3192000	3194000	First off looks like this like grown man
3194000	3196000	Dressed up like a little kid
3196000	3198000	Which is creepy enough if you ask me
3198000	3200000	And then the actual cushion itself
3200000	3202000	Is literally just like an inner tube
3202000	3204000	That they have strapped the Wii remote to
3204000	3206000	And you rock back and forth
3206000	3208000	I think that's supposed to be a kid
3208000	3210000	I understand it's supposed to be a kid
3210000	3212000	But it looks like a man child
3214000	3216000	So what is this for?
3216000	3218000	For a finally arcade perfect port
3218000	3220000	Of Final Furlong or what is this?
3220000	3222000	It's for I don't know
3222000	3224000	Sitting on your butt
3224000	3226000	It's for those racing games that they have
3226000	3228000	Where you sit on the Wii balance board
3228000	3230000	But if you have hemorrhoids you can't do it
3230000	3232000	So then you can sit on the cushion
3232000	3234000	Is this where your butt gets a little tickle
3234000	3236000	If you do well on the game?
3236000	3238000	This is stupid I mean seriously
3238000	3240000	You know what this reminds me of?
3240000	3242000	Do you remember that episode of South Park
3242000	3244000	With the bicycle that was powered
3244000	3246000	Like it was something like when everything
3246000	3248000	Was going green or whatever
3248000	3250000	And they would sit down on the thing
3250000	3252000	That was just basically a giant dildo
3252000	3254000	And then they had to blow on this thing
3254000	3256000	To make it go that looked like they were
3256000	3258000	Sucking cock
3258000	3260000	That's what this Wii inflatable cushion
3260000	3262000	Reminds me of like I'm gonna have that
3262000	3264000	In my living room
3264000	3266000	Let me describe how this works first off
3266000	3268000	Thank you wild wacky action bike
3268000	3270000	Thank you
3270000	3272000	As if it wasn't completely obvious
3272000	3274000	It's an inflatable air cushion
3274000	3276000	Or other type of seat
3276000	3278000	With pockets for the Wii remote
3278000	3280000	It's for simulating horseback riding
3280000	3284000	Or riding of other animals real or imagined
3284000	3286000	Or even vehicles
3286000	3288000	For example
3288000	3290000	You can indicate the gait of a horse
3290000	3292000	By gently
3292000	3296000	By gently moving forward and backward
3296000	3298000	On the cushion
3298000	3300000	To go slow
3300000	3302000	Or fast forward and backward
3302000	3304000	Rocking motions to gallop
3304000	3306000	So basically this game
3306000	3308000	Will adjust your speed based on
3308000	3310000	How fast you hump the cushion
3310000	3312000	Awesome
3312000	3314000	That seems completely useless
3314000	3316000	And not only that
3316000	3318000	But I mean really is this practical
3318000	3320000	I mean seriously
3320000	3322000	We had a problem with the Wii balance board
3322000	3324000	Only holding 300 pounds
3324000	3326000	People got pissed off
3326000	3328000	Because I'm a fatty
3328000	3330000	And I want to do Wii Fit
3330000	3332000	But I can't play it
3332000	3334000	What about riding the horse
3334000	3336000	I pop the cushion
3336000	3338000	You don't even have to be fat
3338000	3340000	To pop the cushion
3340000	3342000	Or let's say you're getting too into this game
3342000	3344000	And you're rocking back and forth
3344000	3346000	Or even you have special piercings
3346000	3348000	I can just see
3348000	3350000	This is the whole rocking back and forth
3350000	3352000	The whole thing deflates
3352000	3354000	While you're playing it
3354000	3356000	Like how sad
3356000	3358000	Is this for real
3358000	3360000	It's for real
3360000	3362000	Is this Nintendo making the patent
3362000	3364000	Or whatever this is
3364000	3366000	You know what this thing kind of looks like to me
3366000	3368000	You know those
3368000	3370000	Okay
3370000	3372000	You know at the gym they have the inflatable
3372000	3374000	Balls and they have the ones that are half
3374000	3376000	Size
3376000	3378000	Which makes me think of those with another rocking
3378000	3380000	You know thing put on it
3380000	3382000	This one also looks really um
3382000	3384000	It looks like a wacky action bike
3384000	3386000	It's not necessary
3386000	3388000	I mean seriously how many games
3388000	3390000	Are you going to play where you're riding
3390000	3392000	A horse
3392000	3394000	It's absolutely not necessary
3394000	3396000	And why the hell would they patent this
3396000	3398000	Well keep in mind though
3398000	3400000	It's a good idea to
3400000	3402000	They could patent something and not actually bring it out
3402000	3404000	But it keeps someone else from doing it
3404000	3406000	GameGuru in chat says we find out
3406000	3408000	Why it's called WooHoo Island
3410000	3412000	Great
3412000	3414000	So we're going to get WooHoo biking and WooHoo horse riding
3414000	3416000	With this thing
3416000	3418000	It's just strange
3418000	3420000	I mean why can't you
3420000	3422000	Although if this is legit
3422000	3424000	If this is a real thing that Nintendo is planning
3424000	3426000	You know you can't wait for that
3426000	3428000	Press conference when Reggie Fils-Aime
3428000	3430000	Comes out of one of these
3430000	3432000	Like
3432000	3434000	It's next year's E3 press conference
3434000	3436000	When you're just like oh my god Nintendo is seriously
3436000	3438000	Just fucking lost it this time
3438000	3440000	Like just the last two years of press conferences
3440000	3442000	Were bad but now when Reggie Fils-Aime
3442000	3444000	Comes rolling out on one of these things
3444000	3446000	You're just going to be like oh my god
3446000	3448000	This is just difficult to watch
3448000	3450000	I would love to go there and just walk out
3450000	3452000	Walk out right at that
3452000	3454000	Well that's it I'm done
3454000	3456000	I'm done
3456000	3458000	I give up
3458000	3460000	This is absolutely stupid
3460000	3462000	Can somebody please do that at E3
3462000	3464000	Somebody who's special enough to get
3464000	3466000	Invited in Nintendo's conference
3466000	3468000	Somebody who doesn't mind
3468000	3470000	Getting blacklisted a little bit
3470000	3472000	That's it I'm done
3472000	3474000	This is so stupid I'm out of here
3474000	3476000	See ya
3476000	3478000	I am done D-U-N
3478000	3480000	Done
3484000	3486000	And get up and walk out
3486000	3488000	There is no practical use for this whatsoever
3488000	3490000	It's a giant device that holds a remote
3490000	3492000	That shakes it back and forth
3492000	3494000	How difficult would it be to take this
3494000	3496000	Same horse riding game and just
3496000	3498000	Shake the remote slow to go slow
3498000	3500000	Shake it faster to go faster
3500000	3502000	Oh my god look at that I didn't have to buy
3502000	3504000	Any more peripherals
3504000	3506000	Can you imagine the size of the box
3506000	3508000	This game is going to come in if it's just this
3508000	3510000	Giant device
3510000	3512000	Well you probably have to inflate it yourself
3512000	3514000	It probably comes in a small box and
3514000	3516000	You
3516000	3518000	You have to inflate it yourself
3518000	3520000	You know what the whole talk about
3520000	3522000	The cushion thing just sort of made my brain
3522000	3524000	Shut off so I decided to look at Teriyaki Doritos
3524000	3526000	Instead
3526000	3528000	Will you stop being so random
3528000	3530000	First you want our Mega Man game to have
3530000	3532000	A butt then you say I don't
3532000	3534000	Care about inflatable Nintendo cushion
3534000	3536000	This could be the biggest joke of the year
3536000	3538000	I want Teriyaki Doritos
3538000	3540000	Really
3540000	3542000	I really want Teriyaki Doritos right now
3542000	3544000	This is going to be one of those
3544000	3546000	Shows where it's like
3546000	3548000	I'm sorry the whole concept of this
3548000	3550000	Cushion thing literally made
3550000	3552000	My brain shut off
3552000	3554000	For like a minute
3554000	3556000	And then by the time
3556000	3558000	I came back to consciousness I was looking
3558000	3560000	At Teriyaki Doritos
3560000	3562000	You know the best part about this is
3562000	3564000	I bet you the Wii remote is not sensitive enough
3564000	3566000	To sense these little rocking motions
3566000	3568000	That would be the
3568000	3570000	Punchline to the whole thing
3570000	3572000	Let's see some comments
3572000	3574000	Frisbee says
3574000	3576000	My name is Reggie I'm about kicking ass
3576000	3578000	Taking names and fucking a pillow
3582000	3584000	Boy oh boy
3584000	3586000	Gripper01 in chat says
3586000	3588000	Is this something we need to be teaching our kids
3588000	3590000	Hold on shush
3590000	3592000	Gripper01 says I'm still waiting for Excitebots to be released
3592000	3594000	In the UK Nintendo hates Europe
3594000	3596000	Well hey at least you'll have this peripheral
3596000	3598000	Possibly
3598000	3600000	So is this going to break certain girls' hymens
3600000	3602000	I mean are they going to become women
3602000	3604000	Just from playing this game
3604000	3606000	That's what I want to know
3606000	3608000	Because this game sounds
3608000	3610000	Oh my god
3610000	3612000	Just chalk that up to the list of Wii injuries
3612000	3614000	Broken lamp
3614000	3616000	Shattered television screen
3616000	3618000	Broken hymen
3618000	3620000	Just add that to the list
3620000	3622000	Oh my god Loki why did you go there
3622000	3624000	Because that's horseback riding
3624000	3626000	Hello
3626000	3628000	It was on topic
3628000	3630000	Hymen Breaker Wii 2009
3630000	3632000	Ok I think we can
3632000	3634000	Pretty much just you know
3634000	3636000	Sum it up this is a horrible idea
3636000	3638000	You know what
3638000	3640000	Is it Nintendo horrible
3640000	3642000	You know what here's the thing
3642000	3644000	It's kind of interesting
3644000	3646000	In all honesty all jokes
3646000	3648000	Aside like
3648000	3650000	To see somebody putting you know
3650000	3652000	A respectable reputable game company
3652000	3654000	Behind an inflatable pillow
3654000	3656000	That will move
3656000	3658000	You really have to wonder
3658000	3660000	Like where are they going with this
3660000	3662000	It could be interesting
3662000	3664000	I see potential modifications involving the res vibrator
3664000	3666000	I just you know
3666000	3668000	It is hard for me to be serious about this Rob
3668000	3670000	I think if anything this is a sign of hope
3670000	3672000	Because it gives me hope
3672000	3674000	That at any conference that
3674000	3676000	You know they hold from now on
3676000	3678000	I'm hoping that I see this
3678000	3680000	What's her name
3680000	3682000	That new one
3682000	3684000	What's her name Piper
3684000	3686000	Is that her name
3686000	3688000	I want her to come out on one of these
3688000	3690000	No
3690000	3692000	She autographed an Xbox supposedly
3692000	3694000	That's doing horrible things for my imagination right now
3694000	3696000	Alright
3696000	3698000	Let's move on please
3698000	3700000	To another story
3700000	3702000	And we're going to talk about
3702000	3704000	Hey other Nintendo Wii news but this one
3704000	3706000	Is actually a lot more serious I'm sorry to say
3706000	3708000	32 gigabyte SD cards
3708000	3710000	Will soon be usable in Wiis
3710000	3712000	Actually I think they already take the 32 gigabyte
3712000	3714000	Or sorry gigabyte
3714000	3716000	Yeah gigabyte cards right
3716000	3718000	They take them now but here's the thing is that
3718000	3720000	Apparently
3720000	3722000	Right now if you want
3722000	3724000	To use download content
3724000	3726000	You basically you can store it on the card but you have to
3726000	3728000	Copy it over basically to the actual
3728000	3730000	Wii console every time you want to use it
3730000	3732000	But not for much longer
3732000	3734000	Apparently pretty soon
3734000	3736000	You will be able to play your download content
3736000	3738000	Directly off of the SD cards
3738000	3740000	Which will finally justify
3740000	3742000	Nintendo's
3742000	3744000	Choice to not put a hard drive in these things
3744000	3746000	Because as you can change out the cards and so on
3746000	3748000	That's kind of cool
3748000	3750000	But apparently
3750000	3752000	There's a new IGN report
3752000	3754000	Saying that all the tricks used for both
3754000	3756000	Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the past
3756000	3758000	Leaving internal memory open is gone
3758000	3760000	Instead straight up booting off the SD card
3760000	3762000	Is available and that means easier downloads
3762000	3764000	Larger expansions and quicker
3764000	3766000	Loads when bringing in song data from the
3766000	3768000	SD card into Guitar Hero
3768000	3770000	Nintendo 5 and apparently that's the first game
3770000	3772000	And no support from Nintendo
3772000	3774000	So they just figured this out on themselves
3774000	3776000	On their own
3776000	3778000	Interesting
3778000	3780000	So
3780000	3782000	I'm curious to see if any other developers are going to use this
3782000	3784000	Other than companies that are just trying to mirror
3784000	3786000	What they're doing on the 360 and the PS3
3786000	3788000	It does piss me off though that they haven't
3788000	3790000	You know done any download content
3790000	3792000	Other than I guess Animal Crossing
3792000	3794000	But Animal Crossing you don't really actually
3794000	3796000	Buy the download content I don't think
3796000	3798000	It's kind of something that comes in the mail
3798000	3800000	Just like you get used to
3800000	3802000	It's probably already in the game anyways
3802000	3804000	I'm kind of pissed off that they aren't
3804000	3806000	Actually doing any expansions
3806000	3808000	And stuff for these new games that they're putting out
3808000	3810000	And even still like
3810000	3812000	Let's support the MP3 stuff
3812000	3814000	Before on the SD cards and then
3814000	3816000	Now with the newer games
3816000	3818000	Sorry we're not going to do that anymore
3818000	3820000	You're taking a step backwards come on
3822000	3824000	Well
3824000	3826000	I'm glad to hear that they're putting in that functionality
3826000	3828000	That really should have been there from the get go
3828000	3830000	But hey better late than never right?
3830000	3832000	So
3832000	3834000	You know ironically enough though I haven't bought really
3834000	3836000	A lot of virtual console games in a long
3836000	3838000	Long time
3838000	3840000	There's some stuff coming up later in the show
3840000	3842000	That I find interesting but
3842000	3844000	As far as you know virtual console stuff
3844000	3846000	There really hasn't been a lot lately I've been interested in
3846000	3848000	Except the Final Fantasy IV
3848000	3850000	WiiWare games
3850000	3852000	What about the WiiWare game that's
3852000	3854000	I haven't heard of this what's that?
3854000	3856000	Next quest that used to be called
3856000	3858000	Ikiran something or whatever
3858000	3860000	It's like Kid Icarus basically
3860000	3862000	Oh neat no I hadn't heard of this
3862000	3864000	They changed it because apparently
3864000	3866000	Ikiran quest or whatever it was called
3866000	3868000	Is too close to Kid Icarus and Nintendo got pissed
3868000	3870000	Interesting
3870000	3872000	When's this coming out is it already out?
3872000	3874000	No I hadn't heard of this game
3874000	3876000	I don't know that last WiiWare game I downloaded
3876000	3878000	Was so terrible that BitBoy or whatever it was called
3878000	3880000	I think I'm turned off to WiiWare games for a little while
3880000	3882000	I mean that's how awful this game was
3882000	3884000	So awful
3884000	3886000	Anyhow more gaming stories
3886000	3888000	And then release dates coming up soon
3888000	3890000	And of course the classic game of the week before we end part 8 at night
3890000	3892000	Well how about some more Wii stuff
3892000	3894000	Wii?
3894000	3896000	Wii sing actually
3896000	3898000	That is going to have a four
3898000	3900000	Player karaoke mode
3900000	3902000	As in four mics
3902000	3904000	Four people singing at one time
3904000	3906000	It says
3906000	3908000	That there's actually not
3908000	3910000	A full track list out yet
3910000	3912000	But they are working with EMI
3912000	3914000	Warner Universal and a few independent
3914000	3916000	But there are thirty
3916000	3918000	Songs available already
3918000	3920000	Pokerface, Locomotion
3920000	3922000	Delilah
3922000	3924000	There's also
3924000	3926000	Viva La Vida
3926000	3928000	You know some stuff from
3928000	3930000	That album
3930000	3932000	And then
3932000	3934000	But the big thing Rob that should make you happy
3934000	3936000	Is if there's Abba
3936000	3938000	Yes
3938000	3940000	You get four part harmony
3940000	3942000	Awesome
3942000	3944000	Yeah but I'm kind of done on the karaoke games
3944000	3946000	I mean is there really room in the marketplace right now
3946000	3948000	For yet another karaoke game
3948000	3950000	Well I would play this one though because
3950000	3952000	It wouldn't be me singing by myself
3952000	3954000	I guess it's cool that
3954000	3956000	You know cause the Wii doesn't really have
3956000	3958000	A lot of karaoke games that I know of
3958000	3960000	I think there's some overseas
3960000	3962000	Like they have a karaoke channel right
3962000	3964000	And then the Konami's karaoke revolution
3964000	3966000	Is coming out, there are new ones out on Wii
3966000	3968000	They have American Idol's on Wii
3968000	3970000	Oh do they? Well that's the same thing
3970000	3972000	Konami just lost their American Idol license
3972000	3974000	Or whatever, their new series of karaoke
3974000	3976000	Games don't have that branding on it
3976000	3978000	So I consider that the same series
3978000	3980000	Is that the only series available on Wii right now?
3980000	3982000	There's Disney Sing It
3982000	3984000	That's the other series that's available
3984000	3986000	That's got a narrow
3986000	3988000	Audience, that's not something I can
3988000	3990000	Break out at a party
3990000	3992000	Yeah
3992000	3994000	Um
3994000	3996000	Rock band
3996000	3998000	Yeah I guess you saw that
3998000	4000000	I don't know it just seems to me that the karaoke marketplace
4000000	4002000	Is kind of oversaturated right now
4002000	4004000	I mean is there really room for all these games to be doing well
4004000	4006000	From what I understand, and I could be completely wrong
4006000	4008000	But my understanding was that Lips
4008000	4010000	The Xbox 360 one was not doing that well
4010000	4012000	Lips is ugh
4012000	4014000	Which is too bad cause it's by the guys who did
4014000	4016000	Elite Beat Agents
4016000	4018000	Yet they're still doing another one though
4018000	4020000	Are they really?
4020000	4022000	I remember that
4022000	4024000	I was under the impression that Sing Star
4024000	4026000	Was actually doing better than Lips
4026000	4028000	But maybe that's just because Europe
4028000	4030000	Sing Star is the karaoke game in Europe
4030000	4032000	You know
4032000	4034000	I like Sing Star
4034000	4036000	I don't know, they have a lot of versions coming out
4036000	4038000	You actually got me to play that
4038000	4040000	Sing Star's fun, I like Sing Star
4040000	4042000	Which is weird, I wouldn't consider myself
4042000	4044000	Like oh I'm a rabid Sing Star fan
4044000	4046000	But yet I have Sing Star volume 1, volume 2
4046000	4048000	And ABBA all on PS3 and I want Sing Star Queen
4048000	4050000	I would get that
4050000	4052000	We should do another Sing Star Party
4052000	4054000	I think it'd be fun, Sing Star Party
4054000	4056000	Ok, I'll bring people
4056000	4058000	We'll have to make that happen, maybe later
4058000	4060000	I'll bring someone who's listening right now
4060000	4062000	Since I'm not going to PAX, I'm thinking Sing Star Party
4062000	4064000	This might have to happen
4064000	4066000	Let's have our own PAX
4066000	4068000	Call it O-O-O-O-O-O-O
4068000	4070000	Tampax
4070000	4072000	No, you need to
4072000	4074000	Call it Tampax
4074000	4076000	Well what time is, or when's
4076000	4078000	We got BlizzCon this year
4078000	4080000	It's right before PAX, right?
4080000	4082000	This next weekend is BlizzCon
4082000	4084000	Well, you could just become part of
4084000	4086000	The second annual QQCon
4086000	4088000	Ah, QQCon, I like this idea
4088000	4090000	That's right, I remember QQCon last year
4090000	4092000	But this year I'm not sad
4092000	4094000	That I'm not going to BlizzCon
4094000	4096000	Because I'm over WoW now
4096000	4098000	And WoW got spoiled anyways, we're going to get to it a little bit later
4098000	4100000	You know what, it just occurred to me
4100000	4102000	We could actually rent
4102000	4104000	Like
4104000	4106000	Like an office room or something
4106000	4108000	And have just
4108000	4110000	Systems set up and just do O-L-R-Con
4110000	4112000	First year O-L-R-Con
4112000	4114000	Just some little office
4114000	4116000	That's how they start
4116000	4118000	I guess that's true
4118000	4120000	Airport Hilton
4120000	4122000	No, we used to do
4122000	4124000	Actually, we used to have
4124000	4126000	Ground Zero Con in Mobile
4126000	4128000	And they held it at college
4128000	4130000	In the student center
4130000	4132000	I like Frisbee's idea, PAX in the back yard
4132000	4134000	PAX yard
4134000	4136000	Nice
4136000	4138000	We haven't had it, remember we used to do
4138000	4140000	The old Baymani parties way back when
4140000	4142000	That should be the same thing, just be
4142000	4144000	Gamer nerd syndrome party
4144000	4146000	NerdCon at my house, dude, I've got pinball
4146000	4148000	I wonder how much it would cost
4148000	4150000	Her in a small space just for the day
4150000	4152000	Oh, look into this
4152000	4154000	You should, you've got time off because of your hand right now
4154000	4156000	You need to find us a place to have a con
4156000	4158000	Quick poll of chat
4158000	4160000	Who would come to O-L-R-Con?
4160000	4162000	Y or N
4162000	4164000	You would check out for O-L-R-Con
4164000	4166000	And your response must be either a Y or an N
4166000	4168000	Spelled out W-H-Y
4168000	4170000	Or E-N
4170000	4172000	Like I said in random today
4174000	4176000	Alright
4176000	4178000	We might have to make that happen
4178000	4180000	Anyhow, let's get to some release dates
4180000	4182000	While we ponder the idea of an O-L-R-Con
4182000	4184000	We can host it at an Olive Garden
4184000	4186000	They can cater
4186000	4188000	Catered by Olive Garden
4188000	4190000	You know what, fuck that
4190000	4192000	I cook better than Olive Garden
4192000	4194000	I will cook
4194000	4196000	What about doing one of those really
4196000	4198000	No offense to
4198000	4200000	SacAnime, but remember how they used to have
4200000	4202000	SacAnime at Sunrise Mall
4202000	4204000	You know, the really ghetto mall that we have around here
4204000	4206000	Wouldn't it be funny to do O-L-R-Con
4206000	4208000	At Sunrise Mall
4208000	4210000	At the mall?
4210000	4212000	With the one room that they have that's
4212000	4214000	They had movies playing at
4214000	4216000	A closed down
4216000	4218000	McDonald's
4218000	4220000	I remember that
4220000	4222000	That was the strangest
4222000	4224000	AnimeCon I'd ever seen in my life
4224000	4226000	Was the one that was at the mall
4226000	4228000	Where the closed stores served as screening rooms
4228000	4230000	And then you'd just see random people in costumes
4230000	4232000	Throughout the mall
4232000	4234000	Meanwhile there's people trying to go to Macy's
4234000	4236000	You know, it's just so strange
4236000	4238000	It's the most awkward thing I've ever seen
4238000	4240000	In my life
4240000	4242000	Alright, anyhow
4242000	4244000	Anyways, this week
4244000	4246000	Not a whole lot coming out
4246000	4248000	There are some pretty good games, but it's still
4248000	4250000	Kind of that slow part of the summer
4250000	4252000	This week on DS Core
4252000	4254000	Game from Graffiti
4254000	4256000	It's a first person shooter
4256000	4258000	It's been delayed forever
4258000	4260000	But finally making its way out
4260000	4262000	Still Life 2 on PC
4262000	4264000	Coming out this week as well
4264000	4266000	My friends on
4266000	4268000	DS
4268000	4270000	Because
4270000	4272000	Apparently if you play this game you have no friends
4272000	4274000	So you need
4274000	4276000	Your friends on the DS
4276000	4278000	War Leaders, Clash of Nations
4278000	4280000	On PC this week
4280000	4282000	Sudoku Ball Detective
4282000	4284000	Yes, it's a
4284000	4286000	Game that you solve detective
4286000	4288000	Mysteries by playing games of
4288000	4290000	Sudoku
4290000	4292000	Awesome
4292000	4294000	My Makeup
4294000	4296000	A game for girls
4296000	4298000	Delta Force Extreme 2
4298000	4300000	They have that coming out
4300000	4302000	As well as Plants vs. Zombies
4302000	4304000	The packaged version
4304000	4306000	Is making its way out this week as well
4306000	4308000	Wolfenstein
4308000	4310000	On PC, Xbox 360, and PS3
4310000	4312000	Coming out this week
4312000	4314000	Spectrobes Origins
4314000	4316000	Pretty good
4316000	4318000	Roleplaying game
4318000	4320000	From Disney Interactive
4320000	4322000	Making its way out to the Wii this week
4322000	4324000	My Dress Up also goes with
4324000	4326000	The My Makeup thing
4326000	4328000	Also for girls
4328000	4330000	ATV Quad Kings from Zoo
4330000	4332000	Games
4332000	4334000	That's the most generic ATV off-road racing
4334000	4336000	Game I've ever seen
4336000	4338000	Joint Operations
4338000	4340000	Combined Arms
4340000	4342000	Coming out on PC this week
4342000	4344000	And that is it
4344000	4348000	Let me move on to
4348000	4350000	Japan in Japanese
4350000	4352000	Release dates
4352000	4354000	About the My Makeup thing
4354000	4356000	Could also be for the occasional
4356000	4358000	Cross-dresser
4358000	4360000	I guess
4360000	4362000	Don't say something is just for girls
4362000	4364000	Because some boys might be into that
4364000	4366000	My character in Ion looks like a drag queen
4366000	4368000	Your character in Ion has a fan
4368000	4370000	She has a fan, how amazing is that
4370000	4372000	I do have to mention this because I think it is
4372000	4374000	On Steam, but it's an awesome name
4374000	4376000	For a game
4376000	4378000	Pizza Morgana, Monsters and Manipulations
4378000	4380000	In the Magical Forest
4380000	4382000	Pizza Morgana
4382000	4384000	It's an adventure game
4384000	4386000	That's kind of a gothic
4386000	4388000	Hot topic looking type thing
4388000	4390000	Interesting
4390000	4392000	Games coming out in Japan, not a lot
4392000	4394000	There is nothing new on the
4394000	4396000	Playstation 3 or the Xbox 360
4396000	4398000	There is a new game coming out on the 20th
4398000	4400000	On Playstation 2, it's called Melty Blood
4400000	4402000	Actress Again
4402000	4404000	Yes, that is really the name of it
4404000	4406000	Melty Blood Actress Again
4406000	4408000	It's a fighting game
4408000	4410000	Bringing a whole new level to the 2D fighting world
4410000	4412000	Three different fighting styles
4412000	4414000	A larger moveset and new characters
4414000	4416000	I guess this is continuing
4416000	4418000	In the Melty Blood series
4418000	4420000	Is that an anime or something?
4420000	4422000	Or is this just a video game series I've never heard of
4422000	4424000	L2 Love Cross Loop
4424000	4426000	Is also a game coming out of Japan on the
4426000	4428000	Playstation 2 this week
4428000	4430000	On the Nintendo DS
4430000	4432000	Live Battle Card
4432000	4434000	Is the only new release this week
4434000	4436000	It's a very slow release week over in Japan
4436000	4438000	There is on the Sony PSP
4438000	4440000	Heart no Kunen no Alice
4440000	4442000	Comes out, as well as
4442000	4444000	Ukame Kakushi comes out from
4444000	4446000	Konami this week
4446000	4448000	I'm trying to see what kind of game this is
4448000	4450000	But it doesn't look like any of their series
4450000	4452000	It just looks like
4452000	4456000	It's O-O-K-A-M-I
4456000	4458000	Is what it is
4458000	4460000	So I'm not sure what series
4460000	4462000	I think that's a new one
4462000	4464000	Great God something says Dark Sakura
4464000	4466000	It's a big sight
4466000	4468000	Exactly
4468000	4470000	For something like that actually that would be something
4470000	4472000	I'd have to see the kanji for because I should know
4472000	4474000	Both of those kanji, aha
4474000	4476000	Well there you go that's really all there is in
4476000	4478000	Japan this week
4480000	4482000	For our
4482000	4484000	For our buddies in the UK actually
4484000	4486000	We've got a number of releases
4486000	4488000	If you've been able to ignore Madden
4488000	4490000	That game
4490000	4492000	Has touched my life because Dan
4492000	4494000	Had to go for a minute opening
4494000	4496000	On the 19th we have Shadow Complex
4496000	4498000	On Xbox 360
4498000	4500000	Did you make a yay?
4500000	4502000	No I said how do you share me?
4502000	4504000	The cat's hanging around
4504000	4506000	She's about to be dinner in a moment
4506000	4508000	On the 20th Tales of Monkey Island
4508000	4510000	The Siege of Spinner City
4510000	4512000	And the 21st DJ Star
4512000	4514000	And Raven Squad
4514000	4516000	Supercar Challenge and then Wolfenstein
4516000	4518000	Oh it's a Dworkenstein
4518000	4520000	Anyway
4520000	4522000	That's it
4522000	4524000	Alright well there's a new patent
4524000	4526000	Submitted by Sony
4526000	4528000	Apparently it's a device
4528000	4530000	Or
4530000	4532000	A program to
4532000	4534000	Interpret whether you
4534000	4536000	Or different emotions that you are feeling
4536000	4538000	While playing I guess the PS3
4538000	4540000	One example
4540000	4542000	That they show is laughter
4542000	4544000	Which apparently they have this
4544000	4546000	Really weird looking guy laughing at a
4546000	4548000	Video of somebody
4548000	4550000	Kicking themselves in the ass with a machine
4550000	4552000	That they're powering with their own
4552000	4554000	Hands
4554000	4556000	Will it sense boredom?
4556000	4558000	Yes
4558000	4560000	Well apparently
4560000	4562000	They make that joke too
4562000	4564000	Actually they're saying that
4564000	4566000	Not necessarily sure what it would do
4566000	4568000	But it would be able to sense laughter
4568000	4570000	As well as other emotions
4570000	4572000	Sadness, excitement, anger, joy, interest
4572000	4574000	And boredom
4574000	4576000	They say perhaps if the game detects boredom
4576000	4578000	They have enemies on screen, if it detects anger
4578000	4580000	The difficulty can go down and finally
4580000	4582000	If it detects sadness
4582000	4584000	And they're punchline to the joke
4584000	4586000	It will tell you just to stop playing
4586000	4588000	Lair
4588000	4590000	I'm wondering though if it's gonna
4590000	4592000	Detect me laughing when they make an announcement
4592000	4594000	About like some new PS3 system or something
4594000	4596000	Like that that's gonna be more expensive than the
4596000	4598000	Previous one just like the PSP Go
4598000	4600000	Because that would be hilarious
4600000	4602000	So yeah you think I'm gonna buy that?
4602000	4604000	Nope
4604000	4606000	You know um this peripheral
4606000	4608000	Should go with the Nintendo one
4608000	4610000	Like they needed to combine their forces so that
4610000	4612000	It can sense me giggling when I'm riding
4612000	4614000	The inflatable
4614000	4616000	Wii sack or whatever it's called
4616000	4618000	The Wii sack
4618000	4620000	I like that
4620000	4622000	That'll be the name
4622000	4624000	Alright then it's called the Wii sack until we get a
4624000	4626000	Real name for it
4626000	4628000	That seems kind of a
4628000	4630000	Dumb technology because like
4630000	4632000	All I had to do was act angry
4632000	4634000	Or something like
4634000	4636000	Grrr I'm angry
4636000	4638000	You know and the game gets easier
4638000	4640000	I don't know
4640000	4642000	What if it doesn't tell you
4642000	4644000	That this is in the game
4644000	4646000	Like it's just something that is kind of there
4646000	4648000	People will find out
4648000	4650000	They have ways of finding out
4652000	4654000	It's probably something that they're not really gonna use
4654000	4656000	But they wanna you know
4656000	4658000	In case PS3
4658000	4660000	Wants to do a Milo you know
4660000	4662000	Something like that
4662000	4664000	They can detect laughter and all what not
4664000	4666000	Something so they have the technology
4666000	4668000	Before Microsoft does maybe?
4668000	4670000	Yeah something so they can say hey we patented
4670000	4672000	That we sue you now
4672000	4674000	Hmm
4674000	4676000	Well I don't know
4676000	4678000	It could be
4678000	4680000	Interesting but I really would have to see
4680000	4682000	The application of how this is used
4682000	4684000	Like I'm into this a lot
4684000	4686000	More than I am the Wii sack
4686000	4688000	But this is
4688000	4690000	You know it could be hokey
4690000	4692000	It could be kind of neat you know I like the idea
4692000	4694000	Of a game you know because you all know those
4694000	4696000	People that get so angry when they're playing the games
4696000	4698000	Not that there's anyone in this room like that Loki
4698000	4700000	That they're throwing controllers on the ground
4700000	4702000	I never throw controllers
4702000	4704000	I never throw controllers because controllers
4704000	4706000	Are expensive and there's no reason to get pissed off
4706000	4708000	But you get angry you do get very angry
4708000	4710000	When playing games no come on
4710000	4712000	I've heard you do that
4712000	4714000	Well okay if I was playing Grand Theft Auto
4714000	4716000	Or something like that and the game
4716000	4718000	Glitches out on me or something like that
4718000	4720000	Like uh
4720000	4722000	You know I fire six sniper rounds
4722000	4724000	The game retarded
4724000	4726000	I fire six sniper rounds into the back of someone's
4726000	4728000	Head and then they're like oh hey someone's
4728000	4730000	Shooting at me and they turn around and fire a pistol
4730000	4732000	And kill me and they're like come on
4732000	4734000	My favorite is when Loki will go
4734000	4736000	And then the game's all like I don't know what I'm doing
4736000	4738000	What the fuck
4738000	4740000	Exactly because it's retarded
4742000	4744000	My favorite is when Loki impersonates
4744000	4746000	The game
4746000	4748000	I do that to people too
4750000	4752000	It's fun all around
4752000	4754000	Alright something that is
4754000	4756000	Gonna be impersonated all over again
4756000	4758000	Blizzard for
4758000	4760000	WoW's fifth anniversary
4760000	4762000	Onyxia is making a return
4762000	4764000	Y'all Onyxia was a level
4764000	4766000	60 raid of course in old school
4766000	4768000	Warcraft where 40 of you would
4768000	4770000	Fight the dragon Onyxia once
4770000	4772000	And now it's kind of a bit of a joke like people
4772000	4774000	Will go run the Onyxia thing because you can totally
4774000	4776000	Solo Onyxia now or at least
4776000	4778000	Duo it
4778000	4780000	Very easy and kind of take her
4780000	4782000	Down and do that whole quest where you get the
4782000	4784000	Onyxia's head in the middle of Orgrimmar
4784000	4786000	Or whatever it is that you're at
4786000	4788000	So they're gonna go back
4788000	4790000	For the fifth anniversary and basically
4790000	4792000	Redo Onyxia's lair and the Onyxia
4792000	4794000	Boss as a 10 man
4794000	4796000	And heroic 25 man as all
4796000	4798000	The raids in WoW are now long gone
4798000	4800000	Are the days of the 40 man dungeons
4800000	4802000	Apparently there's gonna be loot
4802000	4804000	And the cool thing about the loot if you're a WoW player
4804000	4806000	Is that she's gonna drop
4806000	4808000	The same stuff she did before
4808000	4810000	But it's all been
4810000	4812000	Scaled to level 80 gear
4812000	4814000	So meaning that like the
4814000	4816000	Stats that was on the
4816000	4818000	Gear before was for 60 they're scaling it up to
4818000	4820000	80 so it's like you can have tier 2
4820000	4822000	Gear that's just as cool as some of the gear they
4822000	4824000	Have now that's pretty cool
4824000	4826000	Also there's gonna be a
4826000	4828000	310% speed flying mount
4828000	4830000	Modeled after Onyxia that's gonna be
4830000	4832000	A rare drop so that'll be something
4832000	4834000	A lot of folks are after
4834000	4836000	Hopefully it's not glitched out like the dragon was at one time
4836000	4838000	During Final Fantasy 11
4838000	4840000	Where you couldn't kill the dragon
4840000	4842000	Remember that?
4842000	4844000	Oh yeah I heard about that
4844000	4846000	That was after we were playing but yeah I remember hearing about that
4846000	4848000	No no it was while we were playing
4848000	4850000	But it was hilarious
4850000	4852000	Also some WoW news this week
4852000	4854000	Of course Blizzcon's coming up this next weekend
4854000	4856000	And some details have apparently
4856000	4858000	Been leaked about what they are gonna be talking about
4858000	4860000	At Blizzcon. Cataclysm is supposedly
4860000	4862000	The name of the new WoW expansion
4862000	4864000	I don't even know if the name's been confirmed yet
4864000	4866000	It's a registered trademark from them now
4866000	4868000	Alright well anyway
4868000	4870000	So despite the name possibly getting out
4870000	4872000	Apparently some of the information about the game
4872000	4874000	Has leaked out too
4874000	4876000	You will be able to go to 85
4876000	4878000	In this new expansion
4878000	4880000	Which is different because usually
4880000	4882000	WoW has been doing the 10 level increments
4882000	4884000	Burning Crusade lets you go to 10
4884000	4886000	Or sorry lets you go to 70
4886000	4888000	Which was 10 up from 60
4888000	4890000	Wrath of the Lich King lets you go up to 80
4890000	4892000	And now you can go up to 85
4892000	4894000	In Cataclysm
4894000	4896000	Also the other interesting thing about Cataclysm
4896000	4898000	It's not really a new world
4898000	4900000	They're not launching a new world
4900000	4902000	There's no Outlands or Northrend type thing
4902000	4904000	No what this is gonna be is improvements
4904000	4906000	To the old world
4906000	4908000	Which is kind of interesting because
4908000	4910000	I don't know how they're gonna be able to do that
4910000	4912000	Yeah isn't that something everybody benefits from
4912000	4914000	Because that's a big thing that WoW does now
4914000	4916000	Is the whole phasing element
4916000	4918000	So maybe you can only get phased if you have the Cataclysm expansion
4918000	4920000	Otherwise you're stuck in the old WoW
4920000	4922000	I don't know
4922000	4924000	I don't know what they're doing with this
4924000	4926000	Also some new races are rumored for the game
4926000	4928000	Worgen will be the new Alliance class
4928000	4930000	And Goblins will be the new Horde class
4930000	4932000	And the other interesting thing
4932000	4934000	Is that some new job
4934000	4936000	Race combinations are opening up
4936000	4938000	For instance now you can be a Tauren Paladin
4938000	4940000	Or Troll Druid
4940000	4942000	That's a big one because Druids you had to be
4942000	4944000	Tauren or Night Elf to be
4944000	4946000	But apparently now Trolls can be Druids too
4946000	4948000	And assumably Worgens
4948000	4950000	Since nothing else on the Alliance side opened up for Druids
4950000	4952000	So interesting
4952000	4954000	You'll be able to fly in some parts of old world now too
4954000	4956000	Which was a thing that was being requested
4956000	4958000	I don't know though
4958000	4960000	For me honestly as somebody who recently left
4960000	4962000	WoW this isn't really
4962000	4964000	Cool enough sounding for me to want to go back
4964000	4966000	I have to be honest
4966000	4968000	The improvements sound neat and sound needed
4968000	4970000	But I'm not seeing anything where I'm like
4970000	4972000	Oh damn
4972000	4974000	Well I'm sure that's not all the details about it
4974000	4976000	True
4976000	4978000	They usually put a little more effort into their expansions
4978000	4980000	I would think a new heroic job class would be in there too
4980000	4982000	Like Death Knight
4982000	4984000	Like I was hoping for the next heroic class would be cool
4984000	4986000	I'm sure there's
4986000	4988000	I don't know
4988000	4990000	It'd be interesting
4990000	4992000	It could all be speculation too
4992000	4994000	It could be like one of those you know
4994000	4996000	Culmination of all the rumors that are on there
4996000	4998000	The new name of the expansion
4998000	5000000	Because of the registered trademark
5000000	5002000	The rumor of the new classes
5002000	5004000	Based on the Halloween masks
5004000	5006000	That appeared or whatever
5006000	5008000	And some other crap
5008000	5010000	You know I'm
5010000	5012000	I don't know
5012000	5014000	We'll find out next week I guess
5014000	5016000	I mean seriously
5016000	5018000	We'll find out in a week
5018000	5020000	But all of it sounds plausible
5020000	5022000	I mean nothing that's being announced sounds unplausible
5022000	5024000	But I think the new race job combinations
5024000	5026000	That's going to be very interesting
5026000	5028000	Alright let's get into a segment here we like to do on
5028000	5030000	Orange Lawns Radio called the classic video game
5030000	5032000	Of the week
5032000	5034000	It's a moment where we take a minute to reflect back on
5034000	5036000	Games history and
5036000	5038000	Dark Sakura likes to take a trip to the vault
5038000	5040000	And find a game that she thinks you know what you guys
5040000	5042000	Ought to be playing this game this week
5042000	5044000	So Dark Sakura
5044000	5046000	What is the classic video game
5046000	5048000	Of the week?
5048000	5050000	I'm going for another series this time Rob
5050000	5052000	How dare you?
5052000	5054000	Sorry we can't get the music volume down
5054000	5056000	There we go
5056000	5058000	Raiden you say?
5058000	5060000	Alright let's cue up some music from Raiden here
5060000	5062000	Well
5062000	5064000	Basically yeah this one goes through the whole PlayStation screen
5064000	5066000	Launch up thing sorry
5066000	5068000	But basically for anyone who doesn't know
5068000	5070000	Raiden is
5070000	5072000	A scrolling shooter
5072000	5074000	It's put out by Seibu Kairatsu
5074000	5076000	And it was
5076000	5078000	In the arcades
5078000	5080000	And I think we got it by Fabtech
5080000	5082000	Over here in the states
5082000	5084000	Also supposed to be
5084000	5086000	Kind of hard to emulate because of
5086000	5088000	The way that they changed the game boards
5088000	5090000	For them
5090000	5092000	But it came out
5092000	5094000	On PlayStation as the
5094000	5096000	Raiden project
5096000	5098000	Well at least Raiden 1 and 2 did
5098000	5100000	And then we got
5100000	5102000	It came out on Amiga, Atari Jaguar
5102000	5104000	The TurboGrafx
5104000	5106000	It came out on the duo
5106000	5108000	As Super Raiden
5108000	5110000	Atari Lynx, Super Nintendo
5110000	5112000	Came out for PC, Genesis
5112000	5114000	And there's actually a mobile phone version too
5116000	5118000	Seibu Kairatsu did
5118000	5120000	All of the ones that came out
5120000	5122000	Until 98 and then
5122000	5124000	Moss Limited did the games
5124000	5126000	That came out since 2005
5126000	5128000	And the games since 2005 also came out
5128000	5130000	On the Taito Type X boards
5130000	5132000	Which were supposed to be
5132000	5134000	They were pretty hard to duplicate the emulation for
5134000	5136000	So anyway
5136000	5138000	The world was taken over by aliens
5138000	5140000	And the world says screw you aliens
5140000	5142000	And fights back, that's the story
5144000	5146000	So you also had
5146000	5148000	You could play one player
5148000	5150000	Or have two players and play together
5150000	5152000	You also had a variety of different weapons
5152000	5154000	You know
5154000	5156000	That you would get through different power ups
5156000	5158000	My favorite being the little electric
5158000	5160000	Thingy weapon which
5160000	5162000	In fact it's on the screen right now in the example
5162000	5164000	Showing where you would fire this
5164000	5166000	Continuous stream of energy that would
5166000	5168000	Lock on to
5168000	5170000	Certain enemies and then wrap around them
5170000	5172000	And you know
5172000	5174000	Pull towards them, it's kind of like how
5174000	5176000	You know those electric globe
5176000	5178000	Things where you put your hand on it
5178000	5180000	And all the energy goes to where your hand is
5180000	5182000	That's my favorite weapon in the game
5184000	5186000	And the games that came out in the series were
5186000	5188000	Raiden, Raiden 2, Raiden DX
5188000	5190000	Raiden 3, and Raiden 4. Raiden DX
5190000	5192000	Of those is probably my favorite
5192000	5194000	There were also spin off games
5194000	5196000	That were
5196000	5198000	I'm sure
5198000	5200000	Actually we talked about them
5200000	5202000	Recently
5202000	5204000	When I was going over my
5204000	5206000	Gaming week
5206000	5208000	It was Viper Phase 1
5208000	5210000	Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet
5210000	5212000	So
5212000	5214000	Big, big, big, big, big
5214000	5216000	Big, big, big series of games
5216000	5218000	And
5218000	5220000	It's actually probably one of
5220000	5222000	My favorite shooters to this date
5222000	5224000	It's also
5224000	5226000	It can get pretty hard
5226000	5228000	Because you get a lot of
5228000	5230000	Bullets and a lot of enemies on the screen
5230000	5232000	And they're big and
5232000	5234000	It's just a lot of fun
5234000	5236000	Definitely a lot of fun
5236000	5238000	Plus the music is great
5238000	5250000	I'll turn it up here a little bit
5250000	5252000	I think the clip that I gave you
5252000	5254000	Is actually from Raiden Project
5254000	5256000	I have a story about Raiden Project
5256000	5258000	What's that?
5258000	5260000	I remember being completely
5260000	5262000	Intoxicated on Everclear
5262000	5264000	And beating this game
5264000	5266000	Nice
5266000	5268000	That was the same night that I ended up having so much
5268000	5270000	Everclear how close I needed
5270000	5272000	I was 19
5272000	5274000	No, I take that back, I was 20
5274000	5276000	You say that proudly
5276000	5278000	Yeah, I was 20
5278000	5280000	Alright, well there you have it folks
5280000	5282000	Your classic game of the week
5282000	5284000	Raiden, the whole dang series
5284000	5286000	Because Dark Soccer said the series
5286000	5288000	So that's what you get
5288000	5290000	Alright, well thank you very much Dark Soccer
5290000	5292000	We'll look forward to see what you pick for us next week
5292000	5294000	But in the meantime we're going to take a quick break
5294000	5296000	We're going to do some Twitter and so forth
5296000	5298000	But we have plenty more show to come
5298000	5300000	When we come back from a break
5300000	5302000	Twitter topics
5302000	5304000	Something new we're trying tonight
5304000	5306000	We've been trying to incorporate Twitter into the show for a long time now
5306000	5308000	So we're going to do some Twitter topics when we come back
5308000	5310000	Rapid fire news and some more discussions
5310000	5312000	Including Silent Hill
5312000	5314000	A chance for you to go visit
5314000	5316000	Like real Silent Hill
5316000	5318000	Not really, but as close as it's going to get
5318000	5320000	We're going to talk about that
5320000	5322000	And it sounds kind of cool
5322000	5324000	So stay tuned
5328000	5330000	And welcome back everybody
5330000	5332000	To more of Orange Lounge Radio
5332000	5334000	Here on this lovely Sunday evening
5334000	5336000	August the 16th of 2009
5336000	5338000	Where we are taping live
5338000	5340000	Our what, 334th
5340000	5342000	Episode of Orange Lounge Radio
5342000	5344000	Slightly more than half evil
5344000	5346000	Yes, it just keeps on going
5346000	5348000	And no signs of quitting anytime soon
5348000	5350000	We're coming back this segment
5350000	5352000	We're going to get into some Twitter topics here shortly
5352000	5354000	And if you wanted to submit a topic
5354000	5356000	You could do that earlier
5356000	5358000	By joining our Twitter
5358000	5360000	You can't send it now, it's too late
5360000	5362000	Because we already have picked what we want to talk about tonight
5362000	5364000	But if you want to do that for future weeks
5364000	5366000	You can send those to us at OLR on Twitter
5366000	5368000	And if you're not following us on Twitter yet
5368000	5370000	Why not? You should be there
5370000	5372000	I wanted to mention one game
5372000	5374000	I didn't mention it during my gaming week
5374000	5376000	Because it wasn't really my gaming week
5376000	5378000	And not a game I've been playing
5378000	5380000	Non-stop
5380000	5382000	Just been obsessed with it
5382000	5384000	I think he's racked up like 15-16 hours
5384000	5386000	Just this week alone
5386000	5388000	It's an iPhone game, believe it or not
5388000	5390000	And the iPhone game is called
5390000	5392000	Zenonia is the name of the game
5392000	5394000	Z-E-N-O-N-I-A
5394000	5396000	And it's a game I probably need to look at and check out
5396000	5398000	I guess there's a free demo available out there
5398000	5400000	But if you want to play more than a certain amount of time
5400000	5402000	You have to pay money for it
5402000	5404000	But I guess it's like a
5404000	5406000	The best way I can describe it from what I saw
5406000	5408000	Is a style game
5408000	5410000	Kind of like the role playing game
5410000	5412000	But more of the action style
5412000	5414000	Like Secret of Mana is
5414000	5416000	With the multiple quests going on at once
5416000	5418000	Like WoW has
5418000	5420000	And I guess you can be good or evil in the game
5420000	5422000	John was trying to tell me a little bit about the game
5422000	5424000	I thought it was interesting enough to give a mention here on the show
5424000	5428000	Because iPhones have some pretty interesting games on it
5428000	5430000	Some of the games I didn't even mention
5430000	5432000	That I played this week were on the iPhone
5432000	5434000	There's a new Space Invaders game on the iPhone
5434000	5436000	That I checked out that's kind of interesting
5436000	5438000	Because you can use your own music collection in some of the stages
5438000	5442000	And there's also Civilization Revolution got a release on the iPhone this week
5442000	5444000	Which is a pretty neat port I got to say
5444000	5446000	I didn't play it a whole lot
5446000	5448000	So I don't want to give it a full review
5448000	5450000	But I was fairly impressed with the port of the game I must say
5450000	5452000	I played Peggle
5452000	5454000	Did you play Peggle? Good times on the iPhone
5454000	5456000	It's not bad on the iPhone
5456000	5458000	It's the only version of it I have
5458000	5460000	Good stuff
5460000	5462000	Alright let's get into some Twitter topics
5462000	5464000	Tell us some things you want us to talk about tonight
5464000	5466000	Deathwishing says
5466000	5468000	Starcraft 2 petition has over 100k signatures
5468000	5470000	For LAN support
5470000	5472000	Discuss that
5472000	5474000	Remember we were talking about
5474000	5476000	Was this the one where we said people need to get over it?
5476000	5478000	I don't think it was this actually though
5478000	5480000	I think it was something else
5480000	5482000	I would think because LAN is a big part of Starcraft
5482000	5484000	I know how they have tournaments
5484000	5486000	It's really huge over in Asia
5486000	5488000	And the regions over there
5488000	5490000	But it's just
5490000	5492000	I don't know why they would
5492000	5494000	I think the reason why they want to take out
5494000	5496000	LAN because
5496000	5498000	One, piracy
5498000	5500000	Because they want all their online play
5500000	5502000	Or all the multiplayer to go through
5502000	5504000	I want to say BattleNet
5504000	5506000	Yeah BattleNet
5506000	5508000	But
5508000	5510000	I always thought it was for statistical purposes
5510000	5512000	They want to
5512000	5514000	Log every game that's played by folks
5514000	5516000	And keep track of statistics and so forth
5516000	5518000	But yeah piracy is a nice little bonus
5518000	5520000	Basically piracy is what it is
5520000	5522000	I mean it makes sense because
5522000	5524000	You're making these people buy
5524000	5526000	Three different versions of the same damn game
5526000	5528000	Because you're just saying
5528000	5530000	Oh well
5530000	5532000	The campaigns are separate
5532000	5534000	When any other RTS
5534000	5536000	Game out there
5536000	5538000	Command and Conquer
5538000	5540000	How even the original Starcraft had all the campaigns
5540000	5542000	Right there from the get go
5542000	5544000	It's kind of a little bit
5544000	5546000	I don't know milking it a bit
5546000	5548000	So yeah I can see how
5548000	5550000	Some people might be a little pissed off by that
5550000	5552000	And you know what
5552000	5554000	And I'm just going to say this now because
5554000	5556000	We're going to be reporting on it later on I'm sure
5556000	5558000	They're going to crack this
5558000	5560000	It's going to happen
5560000	5562000	People want to play this in LAN
5562000	5564000	And you know what's going to happen
5564000	5566000	Is they're just going to tunnel it just like they do with the PSP
5566000	5568000	And the Wii or the Gamecube and all that stuff
5568000	5570000	You know warp pipe was mentioned earlier
5570000	5572000	But they're just going to find a way to tunnel this
5572000	5574000	With some third party software
5574000	5576000	Why don't we just give them
5576000	5578000	The benefit of the doubt right now that
5578000	5580000	It'll be secure for about a week and then
5580000	5582000	It'll be broken again
5582000	5584000	Actdeftinchat says online petitions
5584000	5586000	Never work for a few exceptions
5586000	5588000	And you know that's kind of true too
5588000	5590000	If you want to, if you really want to make a statement
5590000	5592000	Guys, put your money where your mouth is
5592000	5594000	Don't buy the game when it comes out
5594000	5596000	Because if there's 100,000 people
5596000	5598000	That dent in their first week sales
5598000	5600000	Of the game, that'll be heard loud and clear
5600000	5602000	But this online petition
5602000	5604000	That can be swept under the rug
5604000	5606000	At the end of the day, do you still buy the game?
5606000	5608000	If yes, then
5608000	5610000	They had no reason to put it back in
5610000	5612000	You need to send physical mail instead of like
5612000	5614000	You know, just a petition
5614000	5616000	You send a letter
5616000	5618000	Because 100,000 letters
5618000	5620000	Look a lot better than 100,000 emails
5620000	5623000	And definitely a lot better than 100,000 signatures
5623000	5625000	Or do both
5625000	5627000	Do all three
5627000	5629000	Surtur, I might be saying that wrong
5629000	5632000	Or Surtur, Surtur, S-U-R-T-U-R
5632000	5635000	On Twitter says please discuss the PS3 slim
5635000	5637000	I'd like to get a PS3 but they're too expensive
5637000	5639000	I assume the slim will be cheaper or there'll be a price cut
5639000	5641000	What is this slim that you're talking about
5641000	5643000	There's no slim, they denied it
5643000	5645000	Denied, denied, denied
5645000	5647000	You know what's interesting though
5647000	5649000	Surtur, if I'm saying your name right
5649000	5652000	Just because, you know, we've made that assumption before
5652000	5654000	That just because they are remaking the system
5654000	5656000	Means it's going to be cheaper
5656000	5658000	Not true, look at the PSP
5658000	5660000	See they're going to be cheaper, I guarantee it's not gonna be cheaper
5662000	5664000	It's not gonna be cheaper
5664000	5666000	This is their MO
5666000	5668000	They basically take the console or whatever
5668000	5670000	They drop the price of the old system
5670000	5672000	Which is something that we're starting to see a little bit
5672000	5674000	And then
5674000	5676000	They basically release the new system at the same price the old system was
5676000	5679000	I would hope that they would drop the price of the system
5679000	5682000	Because I think it would be something that is in their best interest
5682000	5684000	Because their sales are hurting
5684000	5686000	And they're definitely not getting better anytime soon
5686000	5695000	And yeah, the slim PS3 might be appealing to some people, because hey, it's new, it looks different, it's nicer looking, we're assuming.
5695000	5703000	And whatnot, maybe some backwards compatibility is added in. I think that's kind of wishful thinking there, but we'll have to see.
5703000	5713000	They're going to announce it next week, I'm sure, at Gamescom. It's going to happen. I mean, that's the rumors right now, and they're definitely prepping for it.
5713000	5726000	And between the birds and you guys, I guess, it's definitely happening. I mean, it's just a matter of time whenever they decide to announce it.
5726000	5736000	Gripper01 in chat says, the PS2 Slim was more expensive than the Fat. Was it? I think I remember a comment earlier, though, he's overseas, so maybe it could be different from region to region.
5736000	5749000	I don't think it was more expensive. I think it was probably the same price, if not cheaper. But hey, that seems to be the trend nowadays. Let's release a new system with less features for more money.
5749000	5756000	And Frisbee says, this tiny enemy crab... I like that. Funny.
5756000	5772000	It's a matter of time. It's just a waiting game until they announce it, and no one's going to be surprised by it. If I were Sony right now, I'd be probably pissed off, because they can't fucking keep a secret for anything.
5772000	5781000	They really... I mean, even though it kind of hurts our business a bit with the moles and everything, they really need to root out those moles if they want to keep some secrets.
5781000	5793000	What you need to do, not that I endorse this in any manner, what you need to do is you tell one person something different, and you see what gets reported, and then you know who your mole is.
5793000	5805000	Dr. Noir says, free tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour, and then gives us a link to an article that talks about new Guitar Hero World Tour tracks that are coming out. Apparently there's an Activision track pack that came out.
5805000	5817000	Apparently it is... folks that work for Activision, they're bands, so you get these bands Awaken, H is Orange, and 100 Reasons, and these songs that... hey, they're free!
5817000	5826000	It's very hard to complain about free things, but I would probably... I don't own Guitar Hero World Tour. I would probably get to Guitar Hero 5, though.
5826000	5827000	Free tracks are good, I mean...
5827000	5836000	It's hard to complain about free tracks, but honestly, very rarely would I probably play them. I mean, I look at the Rock Band tracks, very few of those do I play.
5836000	5848000	But at the same time, there's one or two that I do enjoy, and considering they were free, you know, and I had to sift through 20 to find one or two that I like, it's still free, you know, so it's very hard to complain about free things.
5848000	5851000	You can download it, and guess what, if you don't like it, you can always delete it later.
5851000	5852000	Yes you can.
5852000	5853000	And it's free.
5853000	5858000	So when do those come out? Those are coming out this week? Yeah, today, or they just came out this past week.
5858000	5863000	So check that out in the Guitar Hero World Tour store right now.
5863000	5876000	If you want to send us a topic to talk about on Twitter, we'll open up Twitter topics next week, just a little bit before the show, but probably if we already are covering your topic somewhere else in the show, sadly you probably didn't make it tonight, but always try again next week.
5876000	5883000	Let's do some rapid fire news quickly. We don't want to talk about this news a long time, but we want to get it across anyway. So Loki, how about some rapid fire news?
5883000	5894000	So this is a total shock, but apparently Activision is offering Guitar Hero 5, and then if you buy Guitar Hero 5, you get Guitar Hero Van Halen free.
5894000	5907000	Totally new news to me, but yeah, so that is the offer. It's all through the month of September, and basically you purchase your game. There's apparently codes in the back of the manual.
5907000	5912000	I think that's the way it was with World Tour as well, and there's some other stuff that goes along with that.
5912000	5929000	But using those codes, you enter them in online to prove that you've purchased the game, and then you can get your free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen. Not only will you get it free, you will get it weeks early, because it takes six weeks to ship to you, and the game doesn't come out until December 22nd.
5929000	5936000	Which I gotta imagine their sales on that game are going to be crap, unless they're going to count the free copies of the sale.
5936000	5939000	I am totally surprised and shocked by this news.
5939000	5947000	I am shocked. It's like a hypothetical situation come true. It's just so weird.
5947000	5949000	There you go.
5949000	5963000	Some other interesting stuff. Also rumors, of course, that the Elite is going to be getting a price cut at the end of this month, and apparently this is coming from a leak of a Myers catalog.
5963000	5966000	Good, because I know someone who needs a new 360.
5966000	5976000	It's a catalog that's going to be hitting stands on August 30th. It shows that the Elite model has a new price of $299.
5976000	5988000	And of course, that kind of goes along with the whole rumor that the Pro system is going away, because on the new arcades, the box art only shows the arcade and Elite systems.
5988000	5998000	No Pro system to be found at all, so the rumor is that that SKU is going away and is being replaced by the Elite system for $299.
5998000	6004000	Makes sense to me. Probably will happen. Might even get announced next week, so wouldn't be a big surprise.
6004000	6014000	And then, last but not least, there is another rumor that white and pink DSIs are coming to America.
6014000	6020000	And apparently these were found in a Toys R Us database, listing both color schemes.
6020000	6028000	I don't know, that sounds totally false to me. I don't believe that that's ever going to happen, especially not in September.
6028000	6036000	Okay, fine. Some rapid fire news I've got for you guys.
6036000	6041000	Hey DDR fans, there's finally a point to those USB slots in the DDRX machines.
6041000	6048000	That's right, Konami this week opened up the new DDR Edit website. It's DDREdit.KonamiOnline.com.
6048000	6054000	You can actually go in there and open up a little editor and make your own steps to various songs in the game, except not all of them.
6054000	6059000	I actually went in there and played with it a little bit. It looks like there's only about seven or eight songs you can edit, at least right now.
6059000	6062000	Maybe they're doing it in waves or what have you, but you use this little, it's all a web tool.
6062000	6068000	It's not something you download. It's all online in Flash or whatever, and it runs horribly, at least on my computer it did.
6068000	6069000	It was all out of sync and everything.
6069000	6072000	I miss the days of edit mode and doing hell edits.
6072000	6078000	I miss that too. We would actually get the Japanese games that you could edit the songs and take them into the arcade because it all matched up.
6078000	6079000	Yeah.
6079000	6080000	Fun times.
6080000	6084000	Or we'd edit hack them to add freeze arrows to songs that didn't have freeze arrows.
6084000	6085000	That's right, I remember that.
6085000	6086000	Yeah, fun times.
6086000	6087000	Fun times.
6087000	6090000	I remember you giving away the boxes of movies.
6090000	6091000	That's right, it was make edit, get porn.
6091000	6092000	Yes.
6092000	6093000	Good times.
6093000	6094000	Epic times.
6094000	6097000	Whatever happened to that kid that won? Dave, remember him? Whatever happened to him?
6097000	6098000	He became a man that day.
6098000	6099000	Did he?
6099000	6106000	Well, I got the box full of anime and stuff that one time, which eventually went back to, which went to Dimple.
6106000	6107000	Funny.
6107000	6113000	Hey, live at QuakeCon 2009 has been spotted some new games on Xbox Live Arcade.
6113000	6116000	Doom 2 has been spotted out there on the show floor apparently.
6116000	6124000	And Quake Live, both for Xbox 360's arcade, were both apparently out there on a floor, on the floor.
6124000	6129000	I guess, let me actually clarify, I guess only Doom 2 was out there actually playable on the floor,
6129000	6136000	but somebody actually had like a shirt that said Quake Arena Arcade or what have you, and they've got some pictures and so forth.
6136000	6138000	Lies! They're all lies!
6138000	6140000	I don't believe it, one second.
6140000	6145000	I don't know, I just had to be the counterpoint to that.
6145000	6149000	There's somebody, there's like a picture of somebody playing Doom 2 on Xbox with an Xbox controller.
6149000	6151000	It's photoshopped, it's a lie.
6151000	6152000	Shut up.
6152000	6160000	Lastly from me tonight, there's a brand new game coming out for an old system, and the old system, the Atari Lynx.
6160000	6162000	What? I have one of those.
6162000	6165000	There's a new game called Zaku coming out for the Atari Lynx.
6165000	6172000	Yes, it is named after one of OLR's infamous callers is getting his own game on the Atari Lynx.
6172000	6173000	I'm getting this.
6173000	6178000	It's the same people that brought you, do you remember Baker Prince that came out on the Genesis in 2006?
6178000	6179000	Kind of.
6179000	6181000	The Legend of Wukong also.
6181000	6185000	Now those are actually like localized games from Taiwan that I guess just came out or whatever,
6185000	6191000	but this is something I guess that was built on the development kit for the Atari Lynx on an Amiga, of all things,
6191000	6197000	and is actually coming out and supposedly has pretty kick butt graphics for a Lynx, that is.
6197000	6202000	It's too other than not bringing it out in other systems because, I don't know, I don't have a Lynx simulator.
6202000	6204000	I have a Lynx, but I just don't...
6204000	6206000	Are they actually doing a cartridge for it?
6206000	6209000	That's what the plan is, it looks like.
6209000	6211000	I think I might have to pick this up.
6211000	6215000	They did one for Baker Prince, I know, and they charged a lot of money for it.
6215000	6217000	This looks like a lot of fun.
6217000	6218000	Those carts were expensive.
6218000	6220000	Well here's an idea of what it's all about.
6220000	6226000	It's a horizontal shooter and it is a hero who dons her rocket shoes and power gloves
6226000	6231000	and sets off on a journey to retrieve stolen development tools being used to flood the market with bad games.
6231000	6232000	There you go.
6232000	6234000	I'm actually signing it for the mailing list right now.
6234000	6236000	Sounds like a cause that you can believe in.
6236000	6240000	Well DarkSakura, don't sign up for the mailing list just yet because you have to give us some rapid fire news.
6240000	6242000	Do I? Well crap, okay.
6242000	6244000	Well here's some news.
6244000	6246000	I really like corn chips. No, for real.
6246000	6253000	The actual news, there is an addition to the PAL PSN updates.
6253000	6262000	They're getting Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which will be 11.99 euro, 14.99 pound.
6262000	6264000	It has a free trial.
6264000	6271000	And also are getting Call of Juarez Bound in Blood demo and more content for Red Faction Guerrilla.
6271000	6276000	Also, Rock Band Unplugged is getting some Iron Maiden songs.
6276000	6282000	The Trooper and Number of the Beast for 99 pounds of pop.
6282000	6284000	So that's pretty good.
6284000	6290000	And also there's stuff for NHL 10 and Little Big Planet, blah blah blah.
6290000	6292000	Oh, and one last thing.
6292000	6297000	For that one, Fat Princess is getting a connectivity patch.
6297000	6304000	Moving forward, Tecmo is getting a few games on the Virtual Console.
6304000	6309000	Ninja Gaiden and Rygar are to be coming out.
6309000	6316000	Also, I think they were talking about, Tecmo Bowl already did come out.
6316000	6323000	I really like Ninja Gaiden, but also Solomon's Key is being added to that too.
6323000	6329000	I like the old school arcade Rygar. That was an awesome game.
6329000	6337000	Also, this makes me a very very very infinity happy girl, is Loom.
6337000	6339000	There's news about Loom.
6339000	6347000	Telltale is talking about considering doing another Loom game.
6347000	6352000	Which I will be all over happy happy happy if that actually happens.
6352000	6362000	It was actually said that the game itself was about two and a half hours long.
6362000	6368000	And that they're trying to do two and a half hour long games and Loom fits quite well with that little strategy.
6368000	6372000	I like Loom. I have Loom. I should actually start playing it.
6372000	6375000	Loom is cool. I'd be down with a Loom remake.
6375000	6378000	There's definitely a lot of nostalgia behind that.
6378000	6382000	Alright, let's get back into some discussion topics tonight.
6382000	6385000	Yes, apparently there's a new deal.
6385000	6402000	This is coming from the Raven software designer Manveer Har, who has tweeted that apparently he's going to offer to reimburse you for your copy of Wolfenstein.
6402000	6405000	If you purchase Wolfenstein, obviously. Keep your receipt.
6405000	6415000	If, and this is the big ifs, if they beat out Madden 10 in this month in NPD sales.
6415000	6416000	Ha!
6416000	6422000	So the offer only applies to sales in August. The NPD figures will be used to calculate the totals.
6422000	6426000	You have to follow the guy on Twitter.
6426000	6435000	And in case you really wanted to do that, his name is Manveer Har is his Twitter name.
6435000	6439000	And limit one copy per person.
6439000	6441000	Let me go ahead and restate that again.
6441000	6443000	Ha!
6443000	6450000	I mean, no disrespect, but come on. Madden 10 is like, you know, it's not the type of game we usually talk about here on this show.
6450000	6454000	But I can clearly recognize the impact that that game has on, you know,
6454000	6459000	I have co-workers who came into work dead tired on Friday.
6459000	6462000	Like, I have students in my class who came in dead tired on Friday.
6462000	6464000	And I'm like, what's going on? What gives?
6464000	6466000	And they're like, oh, Madden came out yesterday.
6466000	6467000	And I'm like, I should know that.
6467000	6470000	Like, I do a video game show on the internet.
6470000	6475000	I don't like to tell my students that because I don't want their teacher, you know, them to download and hear their teacher saying fuck on the internet.
6475000	6480000	But, you know, I just, I'm thinking in the back of my mind like, oh, duh, you should kind of know that.
6480000	6482000	But Madden 10 is a huge game.
6482000	6486000	That's the point I'm trying to make. It's a landmark event game.
6486000	6490000	Well, your husband probably had to work like till 3 a.m. that day, huh?
6490000	6496000	I am so confident this will never happen that will this apply to the Tingle thing as well?
6496000	6499000	What? You just extended the Tingle bet?
6499000	6501000	No, no, no, no, no. It's a different bet.
6501000	6502000	It's a different bet altogether.
6502000	6505000	Hold on, hold on. Hit record, everybody. Hit record. Here we go.
6505000	6507000	It's a different bet altogether.
6507000	6515000	Not only will he give you free copies of Wolfenstein, I will dress up like Tingle playing Madden. Or Wolfenstein, I guess, that would be appropriate.
6515000	6518000	But it's never gonna happen. Never.
6518000	6521000	Tingle with the gun, speaking German.
6521000	6526000	So, if, I just want to clarify the terms of the bet, just in case, because you never know what might happen.
6526000	6534000	So if Wolfenstein, the new Wolfenstein, should outsell Madden in the first month of release, you'll dress up as Tingle here on the show.
6534000	6538000	If this gentleman has to reimburse all his customers, you too will dress up like Tingle here on the show.
6538000	6542000	Alright, but not, you will not set fire and Bobby Black will fire a judgement on it.
6542000	6545000	No, that's just, that's a judgement, because...
6545000	6548000	But instead, you will play Wolfenstein.
6548000	6554000	Yes, and this isn't like we're adding the numbers of Wolfenstein to the millionth. No, that is not gonna happen.
6554000	6558000	Completely different bet, and you all wanted, you all wanted something to come back.
6558000	6563000	You all wanted something where Loki would be willing to dress up as Tingle again, so here it is.
6563000	6567000	It's not gonna happen. I only make bets that I'm confident in that I'm gonna win, so...
6567000	6571000	I mean, come on. Really? Something's gonna outsell Madden?
6571000	6575000	I know, from selling Madden, that that's not gonna fucking happen, so...
6575000	6579000	But hey, let's hope for the wishful thinking there.
6579000	6585000	Hey, and the guys behind Wolfenstein thank you, because you just upped their sales by, you know, how many people listen to the show?
6585000	6586000	Two.
6586000	6588000	Oh yeah, two. There you go.
6588000	6596000	I mean, anyone with the same mind knows that there's no way, it's just like him, he knows there's no way that's gonna happen, but hey, it makes him look nice.
6596000	6601000	So there you go, you're just nice. You're offering the Tingle thing again.
6601000	6606000	One of these days, man, you know, some day this show is gonna have to end. Some day.
6606000	6610000	And I hope before it's over we get you in a Tingle costume one way or another.
6610000	6614000	Nope, never gonna happen. Had to lose a bet, and unfortunately, uh...
6614000	6617000	My judgement's not selling.
6617000	6620000	Alright, anyhow, we're being made anymore.
6620000	6628000	Let's move on to something else. Hey, maybe Loki could dress up as this. This is a little more manly. He could dress up as Pyramid Head or something out of Silent Hill.
6628000	6633000	Uh, hey, Silent Hill, actually we'll have a lot of people dressing up in the name of Silent Hill.
6633000	6643000	Apparently there's going to be an actual Silent Hill haunted house, or as they're calling it, a haunted attraction coming to South California, Southern California.
6643000	6648000	Orange County, to be specific. The OC is going to be getting this Silent Hill haunted house.
6648000	6653000	And, uh, yeah, I'm guessing that it's actually going to be like a haunted house that you walk through.
6653000	6659000	Apparently they did like a Saw one last year that was really scary based off the movie Saw, which, you know, you already know how we feel about that.
6659000	6666000	But Silent Hill's cool. So, you know, they'll have probably people dressed up like the nurses, and they'll probably have a giant Pyramid Head.
6666000	6675000	Like, you could get raped by Pyramid Head IRL. That would be awesome. Sadly, this haunted house or whatever probably isn't going to be that awesome, but whatever.
6675000	6680000	It might still be worth a look, especially if you're in the area. Hey, if you're in Southern California, you should probably go check this out.
6680000	6688000	Although it does sound like it's going to be a little bit pricey. I think I was looking at the website, and it was something like 20-something bucks. I don't remember. It was kind of expensive.
6688000	6696000	That's about normal for, like, a haunted house. Like, the last haunted house we went to, which was... I'm going to bring up the site. It might make music, guys, because I think it makes music. Sorry, guys.
6696000	6706000	Oh, by the way, it's also the slowest loading site. Oh, that was weird. Ooh, it makes Silent Hill music. Ooh. Yeah, there's two mazes, and the other one's called Fear.
6706000	6713000	This looks scary, Jamie. Are you sure you want to go? Not to Silent Hill. Single admission, $13.
6713000	6720000	God, we are doing this. So, anyway, sorry. Sorry for the Silent Hill music, but it gives you a little ambience there.
6720000	6726000	That would be fun, actually, to go down there and go to the haunted house and go to Disneyland. I think we might have to make that happen.
6726000	6730000	I had a Saw attraction one time. That was pretty cool. Yeah, that was a year ago, right? Yeah.
6730000	6735000	Yeah, but I'm not into Saw. You already know how I feel about Saw. Torture porn. Silent Hill, cool. Saw, torture porn.
6735000	6740000	Saw is too hard to figure out what's going on nowadays. It's like trying to figure out what's going on in Crank 2.
6740000	6746000	It's a twist. And... Tigerclaw says if you guys go, you will need to record it on video. They won't let you.
6746000	6749000	They probably won't let us in there with a video camera. Plus, I don't need... Hat cam!
6749000	6755000	I don't need me screaming like a girl out there on YouTube, because Jamie will be able to testify to this after.
6755000	6761000	Maybe she already can. I don't know. But I will scream like a girl in this attraction the minute I see something that is scary.
6761000	6766000	You want to know how I won't be scared? How you can tell if I won't be scared? Huh. Because I won't be saying anything.
6766000	6772000	You've been in scary situations with me, and you know what I do. I shut up. And I'm really quiet.
6772000	6778000	I will scream obscenities, even if there are children around. My voice will get even higher than it's ever gotten on the radio.
6778000	6781000	Yes, it will. Yeah, you've seen me on rides. Yes.
6781000	6788000	You should just put a mic or turn on your phone to record just the audio, because that would be hilarious.
6788000	6793000	We're getting requests from chatters wanting us to pick them up on the way to the haunted house.
6793000	6797000	We should just tell people when we're going, and then we'll have like, we'll all go in together.
6797000	6804000	It'll be a big, because I know like, Jimmy, who used to do the show, what the hell was the show he did with John?
6804000	6807000	STFU. That was the show they did. The one that's based off that sports show.
6807000	6811000	He lives in OC. Like, they live in that area, so I know he would come.
6811000	6817000	We should get a whole bunch of us to go, and I'll meet up, and then you can all hear me scream like a girl in person, laugh, ha ha ha.
6817000	6822000	And then we could at least film before and after. And then I'll be like, white as a ghost, and so forth.
6822000	6827000	Ospher in chat says, Rob, reciprocate that high voice, please.
6827000	6833000	I'm not going to do that here on the radio. I can't. Like, I legitimately cannot do the screaming like a little girl obscenities.
6833000	6835000	I'm going to do my imitation of scared Rob.
6835000	6836000	Oh, God.
6836000	6841000	Okay, let me take a breath. Get in character. Oh, my God.
6841000	6845000	When have I ever said, oh, my God, y'all.
6845000	6846000	You do that when you're teasing.
6846000	6847000	Oh, my God.
6847000	6848000	You do that when you tease people.
6848000	6849000	Fine.
6849000	6854000	Oh, my God. That's Rob, by the way.
6854000	6859000	He's pretty close, a little higher. Needs more swearing. Needs more swearing.
6859000	6865000	Well, I, you know, wasn't going to, but that's Rob. And, yeah, it is high enough to break glass.
6865000	6870000	You know who else lives in L.A. that we should challenge to come to this with us?
6870000	6871000	Uh-oh.
6871000	6873000	Is our friends from All Games Interactive.
6873000	6875000	Oh.
6875000	6880000	Yeah, that's what we need to do. We need to get Lawrence. We need to get Scott.
6880000	6883000	We need to get Jessica and all of them to come with us.
6883000	6886000	And we should have, like, a scare off or something.
6886000	6888000	Becky says she'll come with us.
6888000	6891000	I'm, oh, this needs to happen now. This needs to happen.
6891000	6897000	Is anybody from All Games Interactive listening? Let's throw down. Let's have a scare off.
6897000	6901000	I don't know how a scare off works.
6901000	6909000	You should have to hold a glass of water. And if you spill the glass of water.
6909000	6911000	I want to know why Oscar's thanking me.
6911000	6915000	I like this idea. I really like this idea.
6915000	6923000	Have to hold something that shows, or, like, hook something up to our body. The Wii Vitality Sensor.
6923000	6925000	Too bad it won't be out in time.
6925000	6932000	God damn it. Just when I found a use for the Wii Vitality Sensor to see who gets more scared here, me or Jessica, right?
6932000	6935000	The damn thing isn't going to be out in time.
6935000	6937000	Too bad they don't have...
6937000	6938000	I want to do it very drunk, Rob.
6938000	6941000	Do they have, like, a portable heart rate monitor or something like that?
6941000	6942000	Yeah. They make those.
6942000	6943000	Do they?
6943000	6947000	Or, actually, the iPhone has an app that's a heart rate monitor where you just tap in time with your heartbeat.
6947000	6948000	No, that wouldn't work.
6948000	6949000	Yeah.
6949000	6950000	I'm afraid...
6950000	6952000	Actual heart rate monitor is, like, 69 bucks a piece.
6952000	6956000	I'm afraid that I will be trying to contain my scary...
6956000	6959000	Like, I'll be trying to fight it because I'm very competitive.
6959000	6961000	Like, I am a very competitive person. I'll admit it.
6961000	6965000	That, like, if I'm going against somebody from All Games Interactive in a scare-off or whatever,
6965000	6973000	that I will somehow, like, between being actually scared and trying to, like, hold it in, like, I'm not going to scream, I'm not going to scream,
6973000	6977000	that I will shit my pants in the middle of the haunted house.
6977000	6978000	You know, it should do.
6978000	6979000	And I don't want that to happen.
6979000	6980000	That's anonymous.
6980000	6982000	You should have judges go with you.
6982000	6989000	Have three judges go one time with you and one time with her, and then rate the scare detection factor.
6989000	6990000	I don't know why I'm picking on Jessica.
6990000	6996000	I feel for some reason she's the easiest target of who's most likely to get scared from the All Games Interactive crew.
6996000	7000000	But for all I know, Mary Young is the target, or Scott, for I don't know.
7000000	7003000	Okay, so who would you pick, then, to do in a least likely to be scared?
7003000	7008000	I need an All Games Interactive expert to tell me who is most likely to get scared at Silent Hill,
7008000	7012000	because I have an experience that I can challenge to a scare-off.
7012000	7013000	Jessica's no longer a part of All Games.
7013000	7015000	Well, she was, though, right?
7015000	7021000	Well, who, then, would you think would be best off for a least likely to be scared?
7021000	7024000	A what? And then a scare-off with you?
7024000	7028000	I don't know if it would be me that would be least likely to be scared.
7028000	7032000	Okay, the Tower of Terror scared the shit out of me.
7032000	7038000	But then again, I've also been in an elevator when it's fallen.
7038000	7042000	The chat is suggesting Derek H. Does he even live in LA? I don't think he does.
7042000	7045000	Isn't he, like, in the Midwest or something? I don't know. I could be wrong.
7045000	7047000	All right, anyhow.
7047000	7050000	Look, I'm going to stop picking on our friends at All Games Interactive and just, you know,
7050000	7052000	we're just going to go to this and have fun.
7052000	7054000	And if they want to come, hey, great.
7054000	7057000	But I'm down for going to this Silent Hill haunted house.
7057000	7059000	I love Silent Hill. It would be fun. Super fun.
7059000	7063000	And Silent Hill loves you for dinner.
7063000	7065000	Let's move on with some more stories.
7065000	7068000	And then your phone call is coming up later this hour.
7068000	7078000	Well, this is a definite bit of not really a surprise, but it's sort of happy and not happy at the same time.
7078000	7085000	Sega doesn't have any plans to do anything to commemorate the Dreamcast launch,
7085000	7090000	because Dreamcast launch happened 9-9-99, so they're not doing anything 9-9-09.
7090000	7095000	But they said unofficially that there should be some celebrations and some parties,
7095000	7101000	things to mark, you know, such a momentous day in gaming.
7101000	7109000	But that they don't really have any plans to celebrate the U.S. launch.
7109000	7119000	However, there is some talk about putting up some of the potential digital downloads of Dreamcast games.
7119000	7125000	It's just the limiting factor being how large they are right now.
7125000	7130000	Unfortunately, I think a lot of people aren't going to realize that they're going to have a 10th anniversary.
7130000	7137000	To me, the Dreamcast right now is going to be like the Cabela's game during the Halo 3 launch.
7137000	7147000	Whereas the Dreamcast's anniversary is going to be the Cabela's game to the Beatles' catalog being re-released on the 9th.
7147000	7150000	So a lot of people are going to think, Beatles? No Dreamcast.
7150000	7153000	You know what? We need to do something on Wednesday.
7153000	7156000	We need to come over here and play Dreamcast.
7156000	7158000	Because of the anniversary that day?
7158000	7159000	And record it.
7159000	7164000	You know, it's a lot of Sega anniversaries this week. It's not just the Dreamcast, but the Genesis.
7164000	7169000	I mean, Bobby talked a lot about this on his show tonight, so go download that if you want to check it out.
7169000	7172000	But the 20th anniversary of Genesis was this week too.
7172000	7175000	And then, of course, Dreamcast is coming up very soon.
7175000	7177000	So it's just lots and lots of stuff.
7177000	7184000	I remember sitting in that line outside the damn mall and getting so bored that we went over and bought books at Barnes & Noble and came back and got in line.
7184000	7190000	The launch of the Dreamcast was during the period where, believe it or not, I wasn't playing a lot of video games.
7190000	7194000	Like, the years I was living in Chico, kind of away at college, I kind of fell out of video gaming.
7194000	7197000	My love of gaming for a while. So I kind of missed the launch of the Dreamcast.
7197000	7204000	But in retrospect, I was able to, you know, kind of catch up on it and see just, like, how awesome of a system it was.
7204000	7208000	This was back in the day when Dan and I were like, we're going to wait for the US system. We're going to wait. We're going to less import it.
7208000	7211000	So we already were playing our Dreamcast for a while.
7211000	7220000	We even did the Sonic Adventure rental where you could rent a Dreamcast and a special release of Sonic Adventure.
7220000	7229000	Nice. I'm kind of surprised, though, that Sega's not even at the bare minimum, like, releasing Crazy Taxi on Xbox Live Arcade or something.
7229000	7233000	You know, like, you know how Sega loves to re-release their old nostalgia stuff.
7233000	7236000	You know, give us a little something some Dreamcast love.
7236000	7245000	I mean, I guess, though, okay, now granted, before somebody in chat mentions it, which I'm sure they will, they do have the poll going on right now for the Genesis game that's going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade.
7245000	7255000	Did you guys hear about this? They're, like, doing a poll at, what is it, genesispoll.com or something like that to see what game should be the next one they release on Xbox Live Arcade.
7255000	7265000	And I think right now Earthworm Jim is winning by a landslide, which is too bad, because, like, Wonder Boy and ToeJam and Earl and Revenge of Shinobi are all in that.
7265000	7267000	Revenge of Shinobi are all in that poll as well.
7267000	7269000	It'd be nice if it actually load.
7269000	7270000	Did the whole thing not load?
7270000	7271000	No.
7271000	7275000	That's weird. You should see a poll in the middle there with the options of the game that would come out next.
7275000	7278000	That's weird that it's not showing up for you. Show it up for me at home.
7278000	7280000	Maybe the poll's over? I don't know.
7280000	7281000	Maybe.
7281000	7282000	Weird.
7282000	7287000	But Earthworm Jim was kicking all the other game's ass. That's the one that's going to win.
7287000	7288000	Yeah.
7288000	7289000	So.
7289000	7292000	Earthworm Jim was actually a really good game.
7292000	7298000	And I'm sure that they're probably all slated to come out. It's just, which one do we want to release first?
7298000	7301000	Exactly. I'm sure they're all being worked on right now.
7301000	7309000	Which is kind of cool, because, you know, it's nice to know we'll get all those games eventually, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Genesis remakes on Xbox Live Arcade.
7309000	7315000	Although, oddly enough, I do love the Mega Collection, because I think the Mega Collection's a really, really good value.
7315000	7324000	But I think the ones by themselves don't bring that much to the table outside of achievements and, you know, just being a rehashed version of the old game.
7324000	7328000	But, heck, same thing as Virtual Console, I guess.
7328000	7330000	If we want to put it that way.
7330000	7338000	Alright, so too bad that we won't see more Dreamcast 11 on September 9th of 2009, but I guess it was just ahead of its time.
7338000	7340000	I don't know what else to chalk it up to.
7340000	7342000	Let's move on with some more news.
7342000	7351000	Alright. Well, we talked a little bit before about Guitar Hero 5 and the free game.
7351000	7354000	Well, now you can do some song imports into it as well.
7354000	7358000	Kind of a feature that, you know, Rock Band 2 started off with.
7358000	7365000	But now it's nice, at least, Guitar Hero 5 will allow you to import your tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.
7365000	7372000	And, apparently, Guitar Hero Smash Hits as well.
7372000	7377000	I guess the newer games now are coming with a code in the manual that basically has...
7377000	7389000	It's like a code in the back of the manual that's individual to each game that you can basically plug in to get, you know, your, I guess, authorization to download them.
7389000	7392000	For costs, of course, just like Rock Band was five bucks.
7392000	7395000	No pricing, though, has been announced yet for it.
7395000	7403000	But the options, though, for PS3 and Xbox 360, you can download the whole lump of songs, or you can pick and choose which ones you want.
7403000	7418000	And, apparently, most of the tracks will be available, including, I guess, 152 of the 158 tracks that are available right now for download content for Guitar Hero World Tour will be compatible with Guitar Hero 5.
7418000	7427000	The other cool thing, though, is, apparently, Band Hero also will be backwards compatible with these other games as well.
7427000	7433000	So, that's kind of cool. No word, though, on if you can import the Band Hero songs into Guitar Hero 5 or vice versa.
7433000	7437000	Isn't, literally, Band Hero just a different skinned version of Guitar Hero 5, though?
7437000	7438000	Yes.
7438000	7439000	Like, literally?
7439000	7440000	Literally, it is.
7440000	7442000	Just different skinned version with different songs?
7442000	7448000	And it's different track lists. It's more geared towards kids, supposedly, but it's just basically...
7448000	7449000	In other words, I like it more.
7449000	7453000	It's another excuse to put out, you know, another version of the game.
7453000	7460000	It's another thing that they can go, hey, look, you know, Guitar Hero's out selling Rock Band, like, ten times over.
7460000	7463000	Yeah, because you're releasing ten times more games, stupid!
7463000	7466000	I don't know. It's just, it's getting ridiculous now.
7466000	7473000	Thankfully, I think a lot of people are seeing that, and they've figured out, hey, you know what? I don't want to buy all these games.
7473000	7479000	And, you know, before I used to pick up some of the Guitar Hero games, even though I didn't really play them.
7479000	7486000	Not anymore. I'm not really touching them, because I do realize that they're just all stuff that could be available for, you know...
7486000	7489000	They're download content. They only have a few tracks to come out each month.
7489000	7492000	Rock Band has a few tracks to come out each week.
7492000	7496000	And it's a real bummer. It's a real bummer that my Xbox died when it did.
7496000	7502000	Because I had just downloaded Janus Joplin, Piece of My Heart, which I was so looking forward to playing.
7502000	7507000	And the Gorillaz Pack, too. And never got to play them, because of my Xbox dying.
7507000	7512000	But anyhow, you know what, though? Loki, I actually think I'm going to pick up Guitar Hero 5.
7512000	7515000	Because the song list looks pretty awesome.
7515000	7519000	And I skipped World Tour, though. I didn't buy World Tour, ever.
7519000	7525000	I probably will get Guitar Hero World 5. At least the game by itself.
7525000	7527000	I probably won't get the whole... I don't need the drums and all that bullshit.
7527000	7530000	And you know what you can do? Pro tip here?
7530000	7536000	Just go rent World Tour and get the code from the back, and hopefully no one else has thought of that.
7536000	7539000	Hopefully. Hopefully.
7539000	7544000	Eh, it's a big deal. I'm sure the game will come down in price, big time, used at some point.
7544000	7546000	Well, then again, I won't be able to get the code, huh?
7546000	7550000	Well, no. If it's used, you may still will, too.
7550000	7554000	Because the codes really don't mean anything right now. They aren't used for anything.
7554000	7558000	So if you do happen to find it used, you can still use it.
7558000	7560000	You know, there's still probably kind of price to use.
7560000	7565000	And I don't know if I... I don't think there were any songs in World Tour I wanted that badly.
7565000	7569000	And then the other thing, too...
7569000	7574000	Rock Band 2 right now is $99 for the bundle. Which is not bad, I mean, if you haven't picked up.
7574000	7577000	Okay, that's a funny thing right here.
7577000	7582000	There's the Beatles Rock Band bundle that they have right now.
7582000	7588000	We found out that the title's going to be heavily allocated, which means they're only going to release limited quantities to distributors.
7588000	7590000	And, you know, retail stores are probably going to get them.
7590000	7593000	Because they're going to be really hard to find, basically.
7593000	7600000	It's actually cheaper to buy Rock Band 2, the bundle, and then buy Beatles Rock Band the game only.
7600000	7605000	You'll literally save almost $100 and you'll get two games instead of one.
7605000	7609000	I mean, if it's that important that your instruments look like the Beatles' instruments...
7609000	7612000	I mean, we're talking a plastic guitar here...
7612000	7615000	If it's really... is it $100 important?
7615000	7622000	I mean, seriously, if you really want to spend the extra $100, you can buy another guitar that looks...
7622000	7626000	You know, one of the two separate guitars that they have available as well.
7626000	7632000	But, I mean, seriously, if you're just holding out for that bundle, just buy Rock Band 2 and then get the other game.
7632000	7637000	But aren't they going to phase out the Rock Band 2 bundles eventually?
7637000	7641000	Probably not, because not everyone's going to want Beatles Rock Band.
7641000	7644000	I'm sure Rock Band 2 will be around for a while until Rock Band 3.
7644000	7646000	Probably Rock Band 3 will be coming out probably next year.
7646000	7650000	So they'll probably keep Rock Band 2 around until 3 comes out.
7650000	7653000	I wonder what 3 will do that really ups the ante.
7653000	7659000	Probably offer the same stuff that they did in Beatles Rock Band, like the 3-part harmonies.
7659000	7665000	Maybe some sort of... I don't really know.
7665000	7672000	I'm hoping, though, it at least does the whole thing where your Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2 library can be exported,
7672000	7675000	and you're just going to have this gigantic jukebox of songs available.
7675000	7677000	Definitely. I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.
7677000	7684000	The only thing that they may have is obviously the older songs won't support the 3-part harmonies, but who cares?
7684000	7686000	You don't need to have that.
7686000	7688000	And they could always maybe patch it in.
7688000	7690000	Yeah, I doubt they'll do it, but they could.
7690000	7691000	They could.
7691000	7693000	Probably the songs they release going forward will all have that.
7693000	7700000	And who knows, if they know that that's coming, maybe some of the songs that come out over the next year are going to secretly have it in there.
7700000	7703000	I would think, but maybe not. I don't know.
7703000	7704000	Maybe?
7704000	7707000	Did you talk about Roadie Battle?
7707000	7709000	No, not yet.
7709000	7718000	What's kind of neat, though, with the Wii version, they're actually doing something called Roadie Battle, which, surprisingly enough, is actually something innovative.
7718000	7723000	What it's going to be is it's a mode that you use with your DS.
7723000	7730000	Basically, you need two DSs to do this, I guess, if you're playing with two humans using the DS.
7730000	7736000	And then the other two people will play a versus battle on Guitar Hero and on the Wii.
7736000	7740000	And so during that time, you have little mini-games that you play on the DS.
7740000	7745000	Like, for example, you're sabotaging the other player, so you unscrew the amp.
7745000	7752000	So you actually make the little motions like you're screwing in something, and basically that will screw up the other person.
7752000	7756000	Or they'll have one where you have to reset the soundboard.
7756000	7762000	And so they have little marks where the sliders need to be, and you have to slide your stylus to move the sliders.
7762000	7764000	I think that's kind of cool.
7764000	7771000	And I think that would be kind of cool as a standalone multiplayer game or something like that on the Wii for Guitar Hero 5.
7771000	7777000	Just say you want to play a little mini-game or something like that. Different. That would be kind of neat.
7777000	7781000	I guess any new future is kind of cool, I guess, if nothing else.
7781000	7786000	If you don't have two people, you know, you don't have two DSs or something like that, you can actually play against a computer.
7786000	7788000	But it's neat.
7788000	7790000	All right. Very cool.
7790000	7800000	Hey, a lot of things that, or I should say, a lot of complaints have been made about the Xbox 360's friends list and the fact that it's limited to basically 100 friends.
7800000	7804000	Well, and people are wondering, why doesn't Xbox just up the friends list?
7804000	7808000	And, you know, honestly, guys, it's not as easy as just flipping a switch, you know.
7808000	7812000	Probably this is, you know, takes a lot of work on the server ends and so forth.
7812000	7816000	You know, if things were built a certain way, then they're kind of stuck that way.
7816000	7820000	But apparently, a lot of this dates back to Halo 2.
7820000	7828000	Apparently, original Xbox games were coded to be limited to 100 friends, and that limit was brought into the current generation.
7828000	7834000	And this has to do with a report from G4, I guess, talked to a high level Microsoft source.
7834000	7840000	The real reason why they cannot up the friends list is because more people are still playing Halo 2.
7840000	7844000	So if you want the friends list to be upped, Halo 2 has to go away, I guess.
7844000	7848000	Or they're going to have to make some major fixes to Halo 2. I don't know if they can really do that.
7848000	7853000	So it's probably going to take a long time for that limit to go away.
7853000	7859000	But really, I mean, I've found myself struggling with the 100 friend limit.
7859000	7866000	But at the same time, I just kind of will remove people I've never talked to since the day they add me or never have played a game with or what have you.
7866000	7868000	And that seems to work okay.
7868000	7871000	I just remove people after they've been offline for like 30 days.
7871000	7873000	Yeah, then you kind of figure they're not coming back.
7873000	7875000	And if they do, it's no big deal.
7875000	7881000	Or, you know, obviously if it's my friends or something like that that I know in real life, you know, I won't take them off there.
7881000	7886000	But, you know, for the most part, I will take people that are not on there for 30 days.
7886000	7892000	And the thought is maybe some folks will get off of Halo 2 once Halo 3 ODST comes out in September.
7892000	7897000	But you know what? I don't know. I think there's always going to be some people playing Halo 2.
7897000	7902000	When they pull the plug on Halo 2 someday, there are going to be some pissed off gamers.
7902000	7907000	But the question is, you know, how many are they willing to risk pissing off to do it?
7907000	7919000	Or why can't they just like, I don't know, limit your friends list to show just the first 100 in Halo 2 and then just have it later, you know, more later or something like that.
7919000	7921000	Just limit it to the first 100.
7921000	7926000	Alright. Well, let's get into the mailbag.
7926000	7929000	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7929000	7935000	And the lovely DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and picks a few of her favorite emails to read here on the program.
7935000	7941000	So, who's emailed us this week? mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. DarkSakura.
7941000	7949000	We have one from Mark who says, I'm a new fan of your show and I added your video game talk show to my podcast to my Yahoo RSS feed so I can hear you all the time.
7949000	7952000	Now, what are all your PlayStation 3 PSN names?
7952000	7954000	I don't have one because I don't play on it.
7954000	7958000	Wouldn't that buy me a game of your favorite PS3 games?
7958000	7960000	What? No, your PSN name.
7960000	7966000	Oh, PSN name? Um, Green Sky but IE instead of Y.
7966000	7972000	Loki, OLR, caps. I can't remember if there's a space though in between Loki and OLR.
7972000	7974000	Mine's all one word, all lowercase.
7974000	7982000	Mine's, I think on the PlayStation Network, he caps spaces. So, maybe you can.
7982000	7987000	I think, I don't remember. It's in the forums. Go look in the forums.
7987000	7991000	Next email. Oh, it's by the same person.
7991000	7994000	Well, I'm not going to read one by the same person twice.
7994000	7996000	Well, I don't know.
7996000	7997000	Read it at the end.
7997000	8000000	Well, I'm actually closing it right now.
8000000	8004000	This one comes from Redertainment.
8004000	8011000	Hi, I'm a resident of Utah and frequent the Best Buy store where the pilot program that was discussed last week is taking place.
8011000	8016000	I didn't ask the manager about it under the guise of doing a story for a gaming site.
8016000	8022000	What I learned is that they are taking the trade in values from the Gamestop website.
8022000	8027000	Also, not all the games are subject to this program, just ones that are out of print and are hard to sell.
8027000	8030000	I couldn't get any other details as I am not an employee.
8030000	8033000	Also, Super Mormon Brothers, really? Come on, you can come up with better.
8033000	8045000	For instance, Grand Theft Auto, LDS and City, Sim Missionary, DDR Mormon, Tabernacle Choir Mix, and Are You Smarter Than a Member of the Quorum of the Seventy?
8045000	8047000	That's all I have.
8047000	8050000	Staycare? Redertainment.
8050000	8056000	This message brought to you by the Utah State Legislature where racism, classism, and homophobia are not just encouraged, it's rewarded.
8056000	8061000	That is so funny that we actually did have a listener in that town that we were talking about last week's show. That's great.
8061000	8063000	This is from Robert M.
8063000	8066000	Interesting you mentioned Johnny Cash in Guitar Hero 5.
8066000	8071000	I love the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, Lisa 1 and 2, especially the soundtracks of those games.
8071000	8074000	It seems to lose focus creatively and musically with Underground and Underground 2.
8074000	8079000	The later of which containing such random artists as Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and, yes, Cash.
8079000	8086000	I can accept such an eclectic variety of artists in a music slash rhythm game more readily than in a skating game, though.
8086000	8094000	I'm not sure how I feel about the character model in 5 yet, excuse me, nor have I made up my mind about Hendrix being in World Tour.
8094000	8097000	We just had commentary from Shermy.
8097000	8106000	To play freaking morons advocate, I get the feeling that Mr. Kotick meant to say that he felt retail costs, I think we discussed this,
8106000	8112000	may need to increase as project budgets marketing increase. Of course, if that's what you mean, say that.
8112000	8123000	In an ideal world, which this isn't, Bobby wouldn't trip over a scorpion and fall into an alligator pit and be replaced with Gary Kitchens and or David Crane after a merger with their company Skyworks Technologies.
8123000	8126000	Moving forward. Yes, I'm reading at rapid speed.
8126000	8129000	This is from Jeff.
8129000	8130000	Hi Jeff.
8130000	8136000	Hey guys, I'm a new listener, love your show. I wanted to know if all of your episodes can be downloaded off iTunes or only a certain amount.
8136000	8143000	Also, my condolences to Loki and his wife for their loss. I also wanted to know if any of you are looking forward to Uncharted 2 or Ratchet and Clank.
8143000	8146000	Uncharted 2, in my opinion, is going to be a big seller for the PS3.
8146000	8153000	The PS3 is coming into its own finally. Big name titles coming their way for the system. Thanks guys and keep up the great podcast.
8153000	8162000	I've heard good things about Uncharted 2. I haven't checked it out myself. I need to get the demo for it, which I will probably do now that I'm Xbox-less for a little while until I figure out what I'm going to do to replace that.
8162000	8170000	What was the first part of that? Something about iTunes. Oh, only the last 10 episodes are available on iTunes.
8170000	8185000	OLR PSP.com, you can get the last 20. It's the one site where it goes back a little further, but unfortunately we don't really offer any further back than that. I do know some OLR listeners have scrounged up old episodes.
8185000	8202000	Just because of server load and space, every show is 90 megabytes. It's a huge amount of bandwidth, so we can't offer every show. We have a bunch of listeners who have old shows and there's this OLR archive.
8202000	8217000	I tried to go to it today, though, and I got a bunch of spam, so I don't know if the link is no longer good, but apparently they dug up the old, old episodes. Episode 1 even, I think. I don't know if folks in the chat room can confirm it tonight.
8217000	8222000	Did you find all the old stuff? I think that's the old ones. Did you put it? I haven't burned them yet.
8222000	8235000	Somebody said season 1 is on the OLR archive now, but you have to remember, just remember, if you're going to go back and download episode 1, episode 2, it was a totally different show 7 years ago.
8235000	8245000	We grew. It was less mature. Totally different. Just warning you. And I had a migraine the whole first episode, just warning everyone. And then I think that was, wasn't that when I went to go sleep in the Harry Potter room?
8245000	8262000	That was later, I think. That was later, yeah. I slept in a little bed under the stairs. Jason and Raichan found the old episodes. They had them somehow. I must have burned them off for Raichan when I sent her the ferret years ago. I bet I did. How funny.
8262000	8275000	So, moving forward now. And actually, this is one of those weeks where I've actually had to pick different emails because we've got so many. So, if your emails aren't getting read, I'm sorry. It's just we really do have to move through here.
8275000	8291000	Shook here, or is it Shookay? I don't know. Lately, I've been thinking about getting Final Fantasy X on PS2 for my 13th birthday on October 17th. The thing is, my old man, who's just about as heartless as a grizzled non-vet, won't let me get what he calls quote pussy jab stuff. End quote. Ew.
8291000	8304000	That's not racist at all. No, not at all. Could you give me some advice as to coercing him into letting me get it? It'd be much appreciated. Tell him it's localized for American audiences.
8304000	8319000	That's about it. Or do what I used to do in sneak. Buy it yourself. It's Final Fantasy X for the PS2? Yeah. Dude, that's like 20 bucks now. You can do it. Sell back some old games to GameStop and just buy the game yourself.
8319000	8330000	And, dude, Final Fantasy X had Blitzball. That's pretty hardcore. And thank you for being a lot more open-minded than your father. No insult's intended towards your father, but he sounds bigoted.
8330000	8341000	He sounds like an asshole and complete ill-will meant towards your father. Sorry. Ill-will meant. I mean, I don't like to insult people's parents. Yeah, I know.
8341000	8352000	Because even though our parents may be, you know, my dad is fairly racist and thick-headed, but I still love my dad. Well, when my mom and dad say stupid shit, I call them on it.
8352000	8363000	But that's just the way we are in our family, you know? They call me on stuff, I call them on stuff. So, what can you do? Is Shermie smelling the microphone? I'm trying to get her to say something. No.
8363000	8373000	Oh, you almost strangled poor Shermie. Poor Shermie. Go sit on Dan's desk. She likes people, she just is nervous, okay?
8373000	8382000	Yeah, tell your dad, you know, to get with the times. Ooh, this one's for me from Cheeseburger.
8382000	8395000	Jamie, what's a good starter pinball machine for under $1,000? Oh, and post more videos on YouTube, they're great. Just for the record, T-H-E-R-E is for location. T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E is what you intended.
8395000	8405000	Good pinball tables under $1,000. Good look on eBay and Craigslist, seriously. You're gonna pick up a beater, just so that you know, typically for that low.
8405000	8418000	But you can, it's a good way to get started, you know. If you pick up a beater machine that needs a little bit of work, and start putting the work into it yourself, you can trade it later on for other tables for things that you want better.
8418000	8437000	Yeah, those are really, also, there's a, Dan's not here for me to get the name of it from him, but there's a Sacramento Pinball Group actually puts up a purchase stuff every so often, and that's a group that my husband's a part of.
8437000	8451000	But eBay and Craigslist, really, you just need to make sure that you look for, you know, everything works, or, you know, if there's a problem with it, don't make sure there's no, like, board problems.
8451000	8463000	You know, something that you're gonna have to instantly get into soldering up a board together, you know. Playfield, you know, if you see cabinet damage, playfield damage, at least make sure that it's in good working condition before you get it.
8463000	8470000	Cabinet damage and playfield damage can be repaired. And if they can't, let you just buy a new one later on.
8470000	8472000	So, last email?
8472000	8473000	Okay.
8473000	8489000	From Geekboi2424, Hey guys, with the summer of Arcade coming to an end, and Rob's obsession with Super Metroid, I wanted to know if you're interested in Shadow Complex. What makes it look good to you, or makes it look bad? Thanks for the opinions, and I love the show. Logan, aka Geekboi2424.
8489000	8501000	I have to be honest, I don't know much about the game, and especially because my Xbox 360 fried this week, I don't think I'll be getting this anytime soon, but I love the idea of a game influenced by Super Metroid, and I'm all about that.
8501000	8515000	You know, I'll check it out, at least the demo, just based on that alone. Just the fact that it's that whole exploration and power-ups, and I just love that kind of design. You know I love my Super Metroid, and I just love the design of that game. I loved Castlevania, too.
8515000	8521000	The Symphony of the Night, of course. So, I'm all about at least checking it out, if nothing else.
8521000	8522000	Alright.
8522000	8523000	Sounds good to me.
8523000	8548000	Get your mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us more emails to read in the future. In the meantime, it's time to get into our FUs of the week. Thankfully, there wasn't a lot of stupidity out there on the internet last week, at least we didn't find any, so we don't really have anything to dedicate this week's FUs to. Oh, except for the fact that my Xbox 360 fried itself.
8548000	8564000	My FU goes to how much my hand hurts and the freaking suture that was left in it. The end.
8564000	8585000	Lucky. FU goes to all the drinks that I just had because I feel really full, and also to the guy that's on the Neo Geo forums that's selling all the candy cabinets that won't get back to me. I know a lot of people are antsy because they're waiting here back for them, and I want to put back my deposit to guarantee my cabinet. That's it.
8585000	8601000	I don't know. I don't really have a lot of FUs. FUs to the fact that I nap too much. That's my FU this week. FU to napping. Although, actually napping is awesome. I shouldn't say FU to it because it's really cool, actually. I just do it too much. That's the problem.
8601000	8602000	I like naps.
8602000	8617000	Naps are cool. Unless you nap all the time like me. Alright, just a couple more stories, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. But we have a few more stories before we get to that. So, Loki.
8617000	8639000	Are you a girl and a gamer who wishes that there were more girl gamer perspectives for you? Yes, yes I am. Well, you're in luck because now there's the Gamers Girl, which is a brand new blog that you can find at thegamersgirl.blogspot.com, and it's a website geared towards women who are dating gamers.
8639000	8655000	And they have interesting little articles. One of them that they're highlighting, of course, is the Gamer Widow. Basically, a woman that has lost their boyfriend to gaming.
8655000	8671000	They offer tips for gamers to keep their significant other from resenting or interrupting their game time needlessly. Like, for example, setting aside a half an hour right when you get home from work to lavish affection on your partner before you switch on the 360.
8671000	8692000	And I gotta tell you, from my own experience, that does work. So, you might want to follow that advice. But yes, it's neat, I guess. I also found out from a spam ad that popped up on Go Nintendo the other day that there's actually a gamer and geek dating site.
8692000	8702000	Geek to geek? I've seen sites like that before. I don't think that was the particular one I'd seen before. It's like GK to GK? Yeah, there's some of those out there.
8702000	8713000	Well, there's some for everybody, I guess. Yep. Alright, hey, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna go to the Skype line, and this story has to do with something that women and men and everybody can bond over.
8713000	8726000	Pokemons! Let me show you them. There are some new Pokemans games coming out this spring. The Heart Gold version and the Soul Silver version.
8726000	8738000	And what these are, these are remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver, and they'll now be on the DS. So, yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know, right? They're coming out Spring 2010.
8738000	8750000	Let's see, what is the little quote here? Announcing these much anticipated game launches at the Pokemon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokemon.
8750000	8761000	We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first, but of course now we all know. That quote, by the way, from JC Smith, the Pokemon Company International's Director of Marketing.
8761000	8774000	So, there you go, remakes coming for the DS. As far as what features and so forth on them, don't know yet, but there's a trailer out there, and it looks like it does have Wi-Fi battling going on on it, so that's kind of cool, I guess.
8774000	8784000	I actually had, um, was it Gold and Silver I had? No, the last one I think I had was Ruby. I think it was the last one I had. It was an advanced game.
8784000	8791000	But I'm kind of, I'm kind of not into Pokemon anymore. You don't want to show people your Pokemans? Not anymore. I'm not as into them as I used to be.
8791000	8799000	I think I remember you playing that, or maybe it was Shane playing that on the Game Boy Advance thing for the GameCube.
8799000	8809000	I was playing Ruby on that one for a while. I think I had Ruby and he had Sapphire and we were doing the training thing for a little bit.
8809000	8815000	I was playing Pearl for a while when I would go to the gym and play Pokemans.
8815000	8819000	I don't know, Pokemon's just so repetitive to me. That's my problem with it. It just got too repetitive.
8819000	8823000	You know what, nothing will ever top Pokemon Snap in terms of coolness.
8823000	8829000	Awesome. I love Pokemon Snap. I still play that on Virtual Console once in a great while, but it happens.
8829000	8836000	Hey, how about that Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go ahead and open it up and take your calls.
8836000	8842000	While we wait for your calls, how about some last minute stories? Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8842000	8852000	Yes, RedBox is test marketing video game rentals in their kiosk for $2 a night. They're testing this right now in their Reno, Nevada market.
8852000	8855000	Okay, we got a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8855000	8857000	Hey, it's Ranma. What's going on, everyone?
8857000	8861000	You always seem to get through, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?
8861000	8870000	Not too much. Once again, I take another one for the team. I went out, I dropped $5 on Rock Revolution.
8870000	8878000	I heard about this insane price drop for Rock Revolution, that it was coming way down in price, so you actually picked this up, huh?
8878000	8887000	Yes, actually it was retailing for $16.99 at most places. It's a place right across from my job price match GameStop for me, which was pretty cool.
8887000	8891000	Nice. So, uh, well?
8891000	8897000	If I paid more than $5.99, I mean $4.99, I would have thrown it across the room.
8897000	8902000	Well, since you only paid $5, doesn't that make it eligible to be thrown across the room?
8902000	8911000	The fact that it has twisted scissors, we're not going to take it. It slides because of that. Any song, any game that has that song works for me.
8911000	8912000	Wait, isn't that a cover?
8912000	8914000	Yeah, aren't they all bad covers?
8914000	8918000	I don't care. It's still awesome.
8918000	8931000	So, I mean, but how's the game itself? I mean, how's the interface? How does it run? I mean, are we just picking on Rock Revolution because it's, you know, the bastard child of music games, or what's the reason to really hate this game?
8931000	8938000	Because it's nothing more than, like, Guitar Freak's Drum Mania hyped up on some really bad coke and steroids.
8938000	8940000	How so?
8940000	8950000	Okay, first off, when playing with the drums, I keep forgetting that there is an actual cymbal for the foot pedal instead of the lines. I keep forgetting about that.
8950000	8960000	Overall, the game plays where three songs, your song goes, the album goes gold. If you complete five songs, the album goes platinum.
8960000	8969000	And there are options, one of the objectives is, where you play one of the songs, it goes up in three levels of difficulty as you're playing, but it tells you on the screen what level you're at.
8969000	8978000	And another one is where you practice a certain part of the song, and you have to play it back fully memorized.
8978000	8981000	That is kind of weird.
8981000	8990000	Well, after two albums, you get the pick of an arena, no, they give you an arena, you pick three songs and you play it right through, which is not so bad.
8990000	8994000	Wow, but having to play them from memory, that's kind of dumb.
8994000	9004000	I know it is, but it's only for like, not the whole song, it's maybe like 30 seconds of the song. It goes through with you twice, and then it goes over again from memory.
9004000	9006000	I guess that's not terrible.
9006000	9008000	That's not so bad.
9008000	9018000	I don't know, I actually am thinking of trying to find this game and pick it up. I mean, it's only $5. I mean, whatever, I've spent more than that on crappy Xbox Live arcade games.
9018000	9022000	I think that describes most of us.
9022000	9030000	AJ Mixon Chat says, if you're going to buy Rock Revolution for $5 just for the Bomani Pack, stop. Do not.
9030000	9043000	Believe it or not, much as I enjoy playing drums, I am more really curious about going on eBay and getting the drum kit, because I Best Buy has an outlet store on eBay, and the auction starts at like $30.
9043000	9049000	Unfortunately, it comes with the game, so knowing me, I buy the drum kit and just give the game away to somebody.
9049000	9057000	Can't you still get the drums for Rock Revolution somewhere? And keep in mind, they're not compatible with anything. Aren't the drums in Rock Revolution not compatible with any of the other games?
9057000	9059000	Pretty much, yeah.
9059000	9064000	I do, active have me worried saying that, oh, the Rock Band drums don't work with the game.
9064000	9074000	You know what, look on Harmonix, we talked about this last week, Harmonix's website has a compatibility chart that includes Rock Band, and it will tell you right there, so take a look.
9074000	9075000	Works for me.
9075000	9078000	So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9078000	9081000	Um, no, not all fan.
9081000	9083000	Alright. Have a good one, Raman, thanks for calling.
9083000	9085000	No problem. Later.
9085000	9093000	GameGuru says, Rock Revolution is like a train wreck, you can't look away. That comment, of course, with all our other chat comments at chat.orangelandsradio.com.
9093000	9096000	Rock Revolution, the Yaris of music games.
9096000	9098000	Aw, that was sad. I almost feel kind of bad for it.
9098000	9115000	No, I don't. I don't feel bad, because they had their opportunity, for like years they had their opportunity, but they decided, you know what, we're just going to license the rights to our guitar peripherals or whatever, we're going to license those for the guitar hero arcade game.
9115000	9118000	And they only embarrassed themselves at E3 a few years ago, didn't they?
9118000	9119000	Yes.
9119000	9122000	Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lands Radio, who's this?
9122000	9125000	This is DS Master 25.
9125000	9127000	Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?
9127000	9137000	Uh, not much, just you guys talking Rock Revolution, um, I've actually, I've had the ROM for like, probably about two days now.
9137000	9143000	You're not supposed to tell people we have ROMs.
9143000	9155000	This is translated, and it's really crappy on DS, other than it has one part of the game that is missing from the console versions.
9155000	9157000	What's that?
9157000	9158000	The singing.
9158000	9163000	That's right, the console versions don't even have the singing, because they're covers, huh, so they can't really match up.
9163000	9170000	But yeah, you, uh, you, now I can't think of a lot of DS games where you do that, you actually sing in the microphone, right?
9170000	9174000	Yeah, it has the pitch bars, you know how Karaoke Revolution works, right?
9174000	9175000	Yeah.
9175000	9187000	Basically, it's that interface, so it's a little bit iffy, unless you have the DS headset, then you're fine, so don't use the mic on the DS.
9187000	9188000	I see.
9188000	9195000	Well, here's my question about it, and this is the will it blend question of gaming, because you know, you can always ask, but will it blend?
9195000	9200000	Here's my question, but is it fun?
9200000	9209000	Uh, this thing, part in drumming, was about as fun as it got. The bass, I saw it first, because I had the Guitar Hero peripheral for the DS.
9209000	9227000	So I figured, oh, they might have something, you know, along the lines of Guitar Freaks, when you're getting this sort of spiel, so I plugged it in expecting, you know, like the down, the upward note chart going on, but that wasn't the case, it was just like strum up, strum down, strum up, strum down.
9227000	9231000	Same thing for the bass, but with the four strings. It's stupid.
9231000	9238000	So, basically, to sum it up, it's about as fun as dark grey notes on a black background.
9238000	9240000	Have you heard, though, Konami's not giving up?
9240000	9241000	Pretty much.
9241000	9248000	Guitar Freaks has a new version coming out in Japan, and apparently now they've finally caught on to the five fret thing, they're going to go up to five frets.
9248000	9254000	I do not like that idea. What the, ugh.
9254000	9268000	You know what's funny? Do you remember this? Do you remember this years ago? Years and years ago, do you remember when Red Octane, before Guitar Hero came out, their business was making money off of peripherals for Konami games.
9268000	9280000	They actually released a controller, like, seven, six, five, I don't remember, five, six years ago, before Guitar Hero was out, they released a controller for Guitar Freaks with five buttons on it.
9280000	9291000	And everybody always asked, why the hell are there five buttons on this controller? Oh, there must be a new Guitar Freaks game coming out with five buttons, and then it turns out, well, it was a precursor to them putting out Guitar Hero.
9291000	9301000	Probably the fact, probably Konami's not revitalizing their series kind of probably drove Red Octane to do it themselves, and ended up being very successful with it.
9301000	9314000	Yeah, but I could not, see, but I was a Guitar Freaks player before I played Guitar Hero, and my uncle kept telling me, like, start going up on medium, use that fourth and fifth button.
9314000	9324000	I'm like, I can't, I'm too used to the three button pressing system that was on Guitar Freaks, I'm so used to the Japanese guitar game.
9324000	9334000	It takes time, you just practice and it takes time. Four isn't as hard to do, because you can do four without really moving your hand, it's five that gets tricky because you have to learn how to move your hand back and forth.
9334000	9344000	That's when it gets really hard, but four, most Guitar Freaks players can do four pretty easy because it's still one hand, you just have to get your pinky, you have to do pinky exercises every day, and you'll get better.
9344000	9356000	See, and actually get this, my school, for fundraisers for the music program, they've been having Guitar Hero tournaments all these years, and actually they finally had a rock band last year.
9356000	9376000	Now it's just a matter of time before they, because with DJ Hero coming out, do you think, I think you guys might have heard this before, but it still makes me think, because I've been working on this whole mod with Disney rock songs on Guitar Freaks, kind of like how people have been modding Guitar Hero tracks for a while.
9376000	9391000	I've been doing it with Guitar Freaks, but now it's all Disney stuff because they haven't done a Disney Guitar Freaks for Drummania, so basically, why haven't they done Disney with anything else other than DDR and Poppin?
9391000	9410000	Don't give them ideas, because Disney has their own studio, Disney has their own gaming studio, and for whatever reason, well because DDR is Konami's thing, Disney can't really rip it off for themselves, but Konami, as you can see, does not have the locks on guitar games, so if Disney wants to do their own guitar game, they will. That's probably the reason behind it.
9410000	9433000	But here's one thing I kind of figure, around the lines, no one helped operate the Jonas Brothers that are just speaking Disney. I was actually at a Demi concert, and there was this supposed preview coming up with the Jonas Brothers talking Guitar Hero, and possibly an expansion pack for them.
9433000	9445000	I could see that happening, and well, you look at the way that Gabe stopped, instead of teenage boys, you're going to be seeing tween girls in one line.
9445000	9451000	As Kevin Smith says, in six years, those girls will be 18.
9451000	9457000	Alright, DS Master, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, alright?
9457000	9460000	Alright, just one last question.
9460000	9470000	Do you think, especially with DJ Hero and Scratch coming out, do you ever think there's ever going to be a revitalization for Beatmania, period?
9470000	9477000	Sadly, the closest you're going to get is these knockoff games coming out. Not the DJ Hero, but the other one, the Scratch Ultimate DJ.
9477000	9482000	Scratch is as close to Beatmania as you're going to get, and it is pretty damn close to Beatmania.
9482000	9489000	Konami just doesn't care about Bomani anymore, and a lot of that has to do with the closure of their Northern California office. Sorry to say.
9489000	9490000	Which sucks.
9490000	9493000	It does suck, but there's not a lot we can do.
9493000	9496000	Alright, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.
9496000	9498000	Peace out, and keep the shows rocking.
9498000	9499000	We'll try.
9499000	9506000	1877 Game OLR username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call, try to get through here on the line.
9506000	9510000	We'll probably take maybe one more call, and then we'll probably be done here.
9510000	9514000	DarkTit2, you want to remind us that 2DX17 is coming out.
9514000	9515000	Oh, right there.
9515000	9517000	Jesus Christ, I didn't even say hello.
9517000	9521000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Let me guess, this Legend of Zaku.
9521000	9524000	Of course, how would you have guessed?
9524000	9529000	Did you, because you cut me off, did you know that they are releasing an Atari Lynx game named after you?
9529000	9530000	Really?
9530000	9531000	Yes.
9531000	9533000	Oh wow.
9533000	9537000	I'm not kidding, there's an Atari Lynx game coming out called Zaku. Check it out.
9537000	9543000	Better not be, better not rip off a Gundam or anything like that.
9543000	9552000	Well, the only thing I'm going to warn you is that Zaku is a chick, so somehow something got misinterpreted, so you'll have to go take it up with them.
9552000	9557000	Whatever, anyways, something just came up to my attention recently.
9557000	9564000	I don't know if you noticed, but apparently Sega is pulling the plug on the ChromaHounds 360 servers.
9564000	9578000	In other words, the $50 that we pay for Xbox Live every year isn't really helping us, isn't really keeping the servers on for an unlimited amount of time.
9578000	9586000	In other words, we're paying $50 and yet our servers are more likely not going to, they don't look like they're going to be safe.
9586000	9591000	Because if Sega could pull the plug on that, what's going to stop other companies from doing the same thing?
9591000	9598000	Is this really news, though? Because I thought, at least on the original Xbox, that servers were being shut down for the old sports games.
9598000	9600000	Am I correct or am I wrong on that?
9600000	9601000	No, they were.
9601000	9607000	So this has happened before, it's just I think this is the first time we've heard of this happening on the Xbox 360.
9607000	9617000	And the fact that it's a non-sports title that, you know, ages, you know, the ages gets old and replaced with a new sports title, you know, that both kind of plays into it, too.
9617000	9621000	I mean, it sucks, but it's also kind of not the first time.
9621000	9627000	But I mean, I understand your point, you know, what are we paying $50 for if it's not for the maintenance of these servers?
9627000	9643000	I mean, I don't get it that we're paying that much money and we're getting, you know, the fact of the matter is this, just getting shafted for, I don't know, I guess it's because it has the, you know, the potential to set precedent.
9643000	9651000	And Sega could do it that anyone else has the potential to just say, oh, we'll pull the plug on the server, even though you're paying $50 a year.
9651000	9655000	I can understand them pulling the plug on the server if literally no one is using it.
9655000	9660000	I mean, even if it's just a handful of people, I mean, are there listeners?
9660000	9663000	I mean, honestly, I want an honest poll of the listeners.
9663000	9668000	Is anyone still playing ChromeHounds online at least once a week?
9668000	9673000	I mean, I don't know, you know, and again, I understand what you're saying about precedent and all that stuff.
9673000	9686000	But I can also understand that if they need to close down this server to make room for a new game that, you know, there is a finite amount of space out there and an amount of bandwidth that maybe they just need to get rid of.
9686000	9689000	Does it suck, especially considering we're paying for it? Yeah.
9689000	9709000	I mean, the fact of the matter is that we're pretty much paying $50 for dedicated servers, and then all of a sudden we find out that aside from the sports games, which are seasonal, I bet, you know, which are obviously seasonal, and it's expected that they close out a few servers for an outdated Madden game, for example.
9709000	9719000	But for something like ChromeHounds, which is completely non-sports, just to have the servers close and we're still paying for it, it's just, I don't know, it's just mind-boggling.
9719000	9728000	Deathwishing in chat says he plays. I find matches every night. Yeah, I think he's called in about ChromeHounds before, so that kind of doesn't surprise me. I don't think I see anyone else, though.
9728000	9740000	Hmm. Well, you know, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. I mean, unfortunately, I think it's one of those things where they'll just take a chance on pissing off a few people to make room for some new game they've got coming out.
9740000	9751000	It's Sega Sky. I doubt they would even have the ability to follow up on ChromeHounds unless, of course, they were financially inclined to do so.
9751000	9763000	It's a recurring theme, though, tonight, though, is that we keep getting screwed on all these things, yet we just kind of seem to take it. The Xbox Red ringings, the servers getting shut down.
9763000	9770000	At least for PSN, I kind of expect the servers will go down because they're free, so they're only up for a limited amount of time.
9770000	9781000	Except for popular games, but we expected that in the older PS2 days when a server is free, but not for something that we pay for.
9781000	9789000	Hmm. I don't know if there's an easy answer, Zaku. We have to speak with our wallets. The Starcraft thing. That was the other thing I was going to mention.
9789000	9792000	Alright, Zaku, do you have anything else for listeners today before we go and wrap it up?
9792000	9811000	Alright, I don't know. Is it just me that I've noticed that Quake Live, apparently John Carmack actually said over the weekend in QuakeCon, is that that free online version of Quake, Quake Live, can't really sustain itself on ads.
9811000	9814000	I'm not surprised.
9814000	9827000	Which brings me to the point, is there even chance or any room for a viable business model for a game that just relies heavily on ad revenues?
9827000	9835000	Because I think if Quake Live proves one thing, is that even in a tight economy, this one was hemorrhaging money.
9835000	9849000	Hence the need for them to actually start releasing premium content. Or actually, no, I take that back. It's like a premium subscription where you actually create your own servers.
9849000	9853000	I think in order to answer that question, you have to ask yourself, how often do you click on ads?
9853000	9861000	Well, it's not that you click on the ads. It's that the ads are actually strewn all over the actual maps in the game.
9861000	9862000	I see.
9862000	9884000	So it's not necessarily clicking the ads. It's just the fact that, I guess, if it's something nostalgic like Quake, and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't even enough even on ads to break even, then I don't know if it might be viable for future business models with that same type.
9884000	9886000	I don't know.
9886000	9903000	I don't think there is enough money to be made there, because I don't think people really act on that stuff. I don't know. I think the business model is going to have to be incorporating some paid content into it for the hardcore section of it.
9903000	9914000	I mean, EA managed to get some sort of assurance in the fact that with Battlefield Heroes, at least that paid content is for the most part optional.
9914000	9923000	I remember reading before tonight's show about this and that Quake Live, they're actually going to do a paid thing where you will be able to set up your own private rooms and so forth.
9923000	9934000	Right. I mean, with Battlefield Heroes, it's kind of like the other side of the coin where EA is not forcing you to buy certain content in order to play the game.
9934000	9946000	It's just mostly aesthetics and just to level up your character a lot quicker. So you can pretty much sustain without having to resort to buying DLC.
9946000	9953000	So I don't know if that's a viable model that could supplement ad revenues as well.
9953000	9956000	Well, one way to find out. We'll see.
9956000	9959000	Alright, Zaku, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?
9959000	9960000	Alright, have a good one.
9960000	9961000	You too.
9961000	9967000	And he needs to check out that Atari Lynx game thing going on. We have a conference call coming in.
9967000	9969000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9969000	9971000	Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D.
9971000	9972000	Hi.
9972000	9974000	I'll let everyone else introduce themselves, I guess.
9974000	9976000	And who do you want, sir?
9976000	9977000	And it's Shadowclaw.
9977000	9986000	So we have a conference call coming in. We usually don't take these very often, but my curiosity has peaked tonight. So what do we owe the conference call tonight?
9986000	9995000	Honestly, most of it is because I wanted to call in and we were talking on Skype at the time, so we just decided to, instead of actually editing the conference call, to just call in.
9995000	9998000	Awesome. Well, hello everybody. What's on your mind, Rob?
9998000	10005000	Well, I thought I'd talk about my interesting experience at the Chicago Comic Con last week.
10005000	10007000	Please.
10007000	10023000	So I went there. They wanted to get some anime and manga programming in, so I figured, you know, I'd submit a panel. I actually wanted to do a panel about localizing American comics in Japan, which you can talk about a lot there, like the Spider-Man manga, the Spider-Man live-action show, and stuff like that.
10023000	10034000	And, yeah, it turns out they didn't actually advertise any of the anime and manga panels anywhere at the convention, so I ended up getting one person to come in on Sunday.
10034000	10040000	Wow. Oh, I think I read about this in your journal. This is that same convention. Like, horrible signage and stuff, right?
10040000	10050000	Yeah. Well, you've been there. It's the same place that ASEN was at, so imagine if everything was at the convention center where you registered and they didn't have any signs pointing toward the hotel at all.
10050000	10052000	Like, who would go there?
10052000	10056000	Wow. Okay. Did the convention actually have a lot of people?
10056000	10068000	Yeah. I don't know exactly how many. In 2006, they got, I think, 60,000 people. I have no idea how many they got this year. I'm sure it's been down a lot since then. I mean, the convention itself was pretty much just a garage sale full of bootlegs and old comics.
10068000	10071000	Was it in the program or anything?
10071000	10077000	There was a two-page spread in the program with no schedule and no panels in there.
10077000	10078000	Wow.
10078000	10079000	No descriptions in there.
10079000	10082000	Someone really made you the bastard child of the convention.
10082000	10083000	Pretty much.
10083000	10098000	I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. I mean, for those who haven't been to that little area in Chicago, you have to, I mean, that walkway is no short trip either to get from one to the other, so if you don't know where to go, I mean, during ASEN, you can figure it out because there's tons of people traveling through there all the time.
10098000	10103000	But, yeah, if it's not being trafficked, people don't know where to go.
10103000	10111000	And just to make this gaming related, they had a ton of gaming bootlegs there, too. Like, people were selling full sets of ROMs on the floor. They had a main cabinet going with a couple tournaments throughout the day.
10111000	10112000	That's pretty bold.
10112000	10124000	There was a gaming section. Actually, it was kind of funny. They had a Street Fighter IV tournament, or they were supposed to, and they wanted people to pay $20 to enter, and of course, no one did, so they didn't end up having it.
10124000	10125000	Huh.
10125000	10131000	It was an interesting convention. I can't say I'd want to go back, and if I didn't get a free badge, I don't think I would have gone.
10131000	10142000	But at least, you know, now you know, and at least it wasn't, like, that wasn't the focus. I mean, you know, for, I guess, maybe a comic book convention, they probably did all right, but that's unfortunate, though.
10142000	10143000	Mm-hmm.
10143000	10144000	Kind of a waste of time.
10144000	10149000	Can I complain about King of Fighters XII a little bit, or do you want to end the Skype?
10149000	10153000	Of course you can. I wanted to give the other guys a chance to say something, too, if they wanted to say anything.
10153000	10156000	It's fine. You can go on.
10156000	10157000	All right. King of Fighters then.
10157000	10159000	We're busy playing World of Warcraft, actually.
10159000	10160000	Nice.
10160000	10163000	We're installing Windows 7, which is going fun.
10163000	10164000	Much better than Vista.
10164000	10169000	Shadow's Light got me hooked on World of Warcraft. It's the default.
10169000	10175000	I'm telling you, Ion Online's pretty cool. If you're a Warcraft fan, I got to say, Ion Online, I'm liking that.
10175000	10181000	Dude, I keep hearing so many good things about Ion Online. I'm going to give it a try, like, in a couple of days.
10181000	10183000	It's worth a look. Dark Soccer?
10183000	10189000	I was actually wondering if his impressions of King of Fighters XII were the same as mine.
10189000	10195000	I think it's got a great foundation. I like the fighting in it, and I like the graphics, but unfortunately, SNK didn't really...
10195000	10200000	I guess they didn't have enough time to animate everything, because too many characters are missing. Half the moves are missing.
10200000	10204000	It's kind of like making a foundation for a skyscraper and putting up a lemonade stand.
10204000	10210000	Well, did you notice what they did, though, with the characters themselves is that they're sprite-wrapped 3D.
10210000	10218000	It was very interesting, but it also causes some really weird... just things that don't look right graphically with the characters themselves.
10218000	10221000	And on top of that, there's, like, no story.
10221000	10227000	Yeah, I love the animation in the game, though. I mean, it's got the best animation of any game I've seen since Street Fighter III, really.
10227000	10237000	But the advantage, though, for them doing it in that manner is that if they want to change anything visually about the character, they can map it over the 3D model without changing movesets.
10237000	10246000	I'm just hoping we actually get those movesets back, for the most part. I mean, I'm a Clark Steel player, and he's got two moves, literally.
10246000	10249000	Is it just me, or is he over-roided?
10249000	10258000	Oh, yes. It's going to be impossible for me to cosplay as Clark from now on, certainly in that style, unless I decide to go shopping with Hulk Hogan or Barry Bonds sometime soon.
10258000	10262000	I also didn't like that they did Athena in the cutesy anime style.
10262000	10269000	I don't mind that so much. Actually, that one's warmed up to me. The change... I'm a little bit iffy on Kenzo so far.
10269000	10279000	Yeah. Well, I like, though, that it seems that... I like his outfit in that, though. It seems like they're doing more towards the Psycho-Soldier outfit.
10279000	10283000	What's up with no Mai? That's a thing. Isn't that weird?
10283000	10285000	I don't...
10285000	10295000	Well, the other thing that gets me is that there's no interaction between the characters. Like, for example, if you had Leona versus Heidern in the old game, she'd come out and salute him because he raised her in the storyline.
10295000	10299000	And, you know, you'd have the Mai and Andy thing about her taunting him over wanting a baby or something.
10299000	10305000	Uh-oh. Are we losing you guys? Hello?
10305000	10306000	Oh, hello. Sorry.
10306000	10307000	Hi.
10307000	10309000	Sorry. I think my Skype hiccup's a little bit there.
10309000	10310000	That's alright.
10310000	10315000	But, I don't know. People didn't really play as Mai that much to begin with. I mean, they were watching her bounce, for the most part.
10315000	10316000	I liked Mai.
10316000	10320000	Mai is actually a staple of my team because I'm really good with her.
10320000	10321000	Fair enough.
10321000	10330000	Alright, well guys, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for the call and have fun with all your respective games. Windows 7 and WoW and whatever you're playing these days, Rob.
10330000	10334000	Right now I'm playing a lot of Bladesblue, actually. That's what I've been playing all night and training.
10334000	10336000	Have fun with that. Hope your Xbox 360 doesn't fry.
10336000	10340000	You'll be getting your TurboGrafx as soon as we get a paycheck in.
10340000	10342000	Yay! I look forward to it.
10342000	10344000	Alright. Take care, guys. Have a good one, everybody.
10344000	10345000	You too, guys.
10345000	10346000	Later.
10346000	10347000	See ya.
10347000	10348000	Later, everybody.
10348000	10351000	That's funny. We don't get conference calls very often, but...
10351000	10352000	That was fun.
10352000	10353000	That was fun.
10353000	10360000	One of these days I just want every single person listening to all make a mass Skype conference call and then call us. It'll be complete chaos.
10360000	10362000	We can do SkypeCon all on Twitter.
10362000	10364000	I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio!
10364000	10371000	Alright, let's start to wrap up, guys, tonight, because it's already after 9 o'clock and we want to get out of here before it's too late.
10371000	10374000	But more last minute stories. Loki, I don't know if you have anything else.
10374000	10375000	I have nothing else.
10375000	10380000	Really? Wow. It was kind of a slow news week this week. Compared to other weeks, it was a little slow this week.
10380000	10382000	And nothing else I wanted to talk about. Let me put it that way.
10382000	10385000	There was other things to talk about, but there's nothing I wanted.
10385000	10387000	But nothing that big. Alright. Fine. Be that way.
10387000	10390000	I'm fighting spyware and it's just pissing me off.
10390000	10391000	Oh, how annoying.
10391000	10395000	Well, it's stuff I got to do at safe mode and I don't feel like doing it right now, so...
10395000	10396000	Ugh.
10396000	10404000	It's just searching for crap and then I get a wrong page and then it locks your system up because it wants to download spyware and it's a pain in the ass.
10404000	10407000	You know what's funny, since everybody's talking about this Skype thing.
10407000	10412000	I remember for a while, I don't know what ever happened with it, but they were talking about doing another show on All Games after us.
10412000	10414000	Like a late night show or what have you.
10414000	10419000	And I think what would be cool is somebody should just host a Skype thing.
10419000	10424000	Like an OLR post show that's just a massive orgy of people on Skype after the show.
10424000	10425000	I think that would be kind of fun.
10425000	10428000	And people can talk about the inside jokes from the show and tonight.
10428000	10430000	That would be fun.
10430000	10434000	So, alright. That's it. We're going to wrap up. Go around and give everybody's final thought.
10434000	10438000	DarkSakura, if you have no last minute stories tonight, then why don't you give us your final thought?
10438000	10446000	My final thought is my dinner was really good but I still want meat.
10446000	10448000	Tasty, tasty death.
10448000	10450000	My final thought is I want yogurt.
10450000	10452000	Ooh, robins.
10452000	10454000	But all the yogurt places close Sunday.
10454000	10456000	But Baskin-Robbins is open.
10456000	10458000	We'd have to like not do Afterbirth.
10458000	10460000	No, they close at 10.
10460000	10462000	We'd have to hurry through Afterbirth.
10462000	10464000	Let's do Afterbirth anyway. I don't care.
10464000	10466000	I'm thinking of the grocery store.
10466000	10469000	It's totally selfish of me but I'm thinking of...
10469000	10474000	Because the arcade cabinet is technically my birthday gift because the wife is letting me have it.
10474000	10476000	And that's a gift alone.
10476000	10485000	But I am going to open up the unofficial Loki's Greedy Bastard birthday gift fund for arcade cabinet use.
10485000	10488000	So links will be in the form.
10488000	10494000	I will donate and then I can feel guilt-free when I don't get you anything else.
10494000	10496000	That's fine. You don't have to get me anything at all anyways.
10496000	10498000	That's what everyone says.
10498000	10503000	Alright, let's go ahead and close up guys and call it a night.
