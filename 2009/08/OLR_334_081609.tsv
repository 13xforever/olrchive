13848	18372	Tonight, August 16, 2009, is there a Wii cushion on the horizon?
18652	21214	Will the PlayStation 3 soon see you laughing?
21634	24877	And could you soon be able to take a trip to Silent Hill for real?
31684	35927	Well, hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35947	42951	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43291	54478	With you for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, as I used to call her every day on this week, DarkSakra, Jamie Summers.
55596	56836	How did that get started anyway?
57176	57996	I don't even remember.
58016	60337	Oh, because I had my Happy Bunny stuff for a while.
60437	63137	You used to be obsessed with Happy Bunny, if I remember right.
63217	64798	And now I think Happy Bunny's kind of stupid.
65178	65578	Oh, really?
65918	68178	Well, Happy Bunny kind of junked the shark a little bit.
68258	70079	Now you see Happy Bunny everywhere on everything.
70319	71879	Happy Bunny was cool and no one knew about it.
72099	72479	Exactly.
73279	76220	And also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
76380	76640	Hello.
76880	77500	How are you doing, Loki?
77640	77880	Fine.
78080	79560	Not the happiest bunny on the farm, Loki.
80200	81461	No, I'm not a bunny on a farm.
81961	83261	You're very quiet tonight, Loki.
83301	83941	What is going on?
84796	86558	I'm trying to remember a password.
86918	88279	And I think I got it.
88459	88899	And I got it.
89720	91461	I'm trying to see what you're trying to log into.
92422	95885	RomaniSows is what I'm logging into.
95965	97947	Not to download torrents, but to read their forms.
98507	98867	I see.
99428	101009	What's so important on their forms?
101630	101830	Nothing.
101870	103391	I want to see if some guy returned my PM.
104132	105092	And he didn't.
105112	105633	He's a bastard.
106073	107354	I thought he said read their porn.
108595	110957	If you are corresponding with Loki, you should write him back.
111658	111818	Ass.
112158	112879	No, it's alright.
112899	113319	It's fine.
113863	120425	I was second in line for a System 573 board, but I probably don't need it now, so it's alright.
120825	123086	You are very quiet tonight, and I can't figure out why.
123166	124707	Let's try turning up your mic a little bit.
124727	126287	The beauty of live radio, boys and girls.
126427	129969	Oh, I thought you meant like I wasn't saying a lot, not that I was quiet.
130129	131489	No, like you were actually quiet on the mic.
131529	132169	Now you were too loud.
132309	132930	I think we're good now.
133230	133470	Alright.
133490	133870	So there we go.
135458	158617	The joy of live radio as we tape live here on Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com live after the Bobby Blackwolf show I have an announcement You have an announcement, yes Rob had chicken for dinner I did, it was delicious You didn't get me any Grilled chicken I had chicken and a biscuit It still smells like chicken in this room and it's driving me nuts I was hungry, I literally had nothing to eat today I'm gonna make my husband bring me some food You should do that, that's why you got married, right?
158858	162020	Yeah, so it'd be my manservant I too had chicken for dinner Did you?
162301	163882	Yes What kind of chicken did you have?
164122	167447	I had chicken covered with Ritz cracker bits
182344	185128	I refuse to eat there.
185729	187230	Because it's attached to Pizza Hut.
187931	189353	No, Wing Street.
189573	190274	Oh, never mind.
200327	201728	Probably that food at Wings Stop.
201748	203109	Hooters' wings are worse for you.
203169	203490	Are they?
203670	204731	But Hooters' wings are good.
205051	205952	No, they're not.
206112	206993	No, they're not.
207033	207933	I think Hooters' wings are good.
207993	209234	Everything at Hooters sucks.
209395	210496	Even the women suck.
210716	212297	Everything at Hooters is awful.
213498	214319	What is wrong with this picture?
214339	215780	I'm going to keep the dirty comment down.
215900	216981	What is wrong with this picture?
217141	219183	I love Hooters more than anyone else in this room.
219343	222846	Their food, I have given their food like three different chances, and...
224423	227544	Like, not only is their food bad, but their service is worse.
227944	229345	It's just, it's absolute crap.
229385	231505	Their hot sauce tastes like too much vinegar.
231826	240168	For example, I went in one time and I decided, okay, I'm gonna get a burger and what the hell, let's get, order the wings because everyone's raving about the wings and stuff.
240749	243590	Ordered the burger, the burger took an hour for me to get at my table.
243810	251112	The wings, mind you, which is their staple food that they serve there, took two hours to get to me.
251212	252192	And they're neon orange.
252533	253513	Now Loki's too loud.
253653	253833	Okay.
254173	255916	and they tasted like shit.
256136	256417	Okay.
256457	257558	Get him angry then he'll be like.
257598	258319	And not only that.
258379	258600	Okay.
258640	262365	So I tried the normal like their normal hot wings or whatever.
262605	263707	They tasted like shit.
263787	265369	I tried them like a different flavor.
265790	267372	It's a different flavor of shit.
267533	267913	It's just.
268053	268173	It's.
269035	269155	It's.
269695	270056	Awful.
270476	272458	There is nothing good at that place.
273058	276161	All their food sucks, and if you go for the ambience, you're stupid.
276361	277802	You can get better food at a strip club.
277822	278542	Are you kidding?
278583	281625	The last time I went to Hooters was Victoria and I. We were like, where should we go eat?
281905	282846	Let's go to Hooters!
282886	283226	And we went.
283246	283827	We had fun.
283867	285008	We were laughing the whole time.
285348	289752	Our waitress had big boobies, and we were making fun of her, but in a positive way.
290492	291253	Seriously, okay?
291553	293374	Strip club food is not very good.
293575	295176	It was better than Hooters.
295436	295997	And you know what?
296278	299444	At a strip club, I'm not going to just have to imagine naked boobies.
299704	301147	I can see them firsthand.
301748	302750	So, you know...
303979	307280	I'm sorry, it's just not worth my time.
307740	308761	Here's my question about Hooters.
308781	310741	Do you remember that E3?
310981	319584	It was probably 2004, 2005, when we were staying at the ghetto motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard.
319924	321405	I don't know what inspired us to say there.
321425	322785	I ought to be young and in our 20s again.
323226	329808	But to be staying at that ghetto motel 6, and we had to walk up Hollywood Boulevard,
330168	335412	Through a concert that Jimmy Kimmel Live was doing or something to get to Hooters.
335432	337814	Because we were like, hadn't you never been there at that point?
337834	338334	I've never been there.
338354	338594	That's right.
338614	342997	And I was like, Loki, you're like a manly man and you've never been to Hooters.
343197	345999	I'm like, don't tell me you're going to make a gay man take you to Hooters.
346220	348461	So eventually a gay man did have to take him to Hooters.
348781	349522	So he went to Hooters.
350062	352444	And, you know, it was our first experience.
352464	353865	Well, his first experience at a Hooters.
353985	355847	And I guess it wasn't favorable.
356127	356207	Yeah.
356808	361157	Well, just also getting there took us like 30 minutes when it was just like a block up the street.
361277	363642	We could see it, but it took a half an hour to get there.
365446	366007	So anyhow.
367520	368101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
392441	397503	I really like it for its classic RPG-osity.
397583	399984	It's been pretty fun for me.
400805	411690	I also played through Raiden Fighters Aces and nearly beat the game, except that I was in a lot of pain when I was playing it.
412509	423755	Well, it was really more that I was just going to play for a little bit of it and then put it aside, but I actually played all the way through.
424115	433680	And then I kept getting to the last stage, and because my hand hurt so bad, I couldn't hit the fire button fast enough, so I kept also not counteracting the fire that was coming at me and kept dying.
434381	439604	And it turns out that when you have to continue, it starts you off from the beginning of the stage.
440845	454760	and I just said you know what fuck a bunch of this and you know I'm not gonna do it so I uh I put it down and then promptly went to go put my hand in a big thing of ice water cause it really really hurt and um
456101	461263	Then I also played a lot of the Namco Museum package that we picked up.
462224	468526	And, you know, just some Galaga and some Pac-Man.
468746	470567	Wait, is this the 360 compilation?
470607	476509	Okay, so this is like the Galaga Resurrection and some of the arcade titles they've put out over the past couple years.
476549	478050	They kind of butchered the Galaga...
479150	503919	I had more fun going back and playing Galaga 88 Dan and I were actually talking about this is more fun on TurboGrafx It's not a bad collection, it's a really good collection I love Namco, yay Namco, kiss kiss We were going to play some Symphony of the Night and as it turned out, Dan hasn't authorized our Xbox yet
504779	505839	So I can't play it.
506439	509060	Even though we have it on his account, I can't play it.
509160	513260	And I was like... So then I started playing a lot of Blue Dragon.
513320	516001	And I love, love, love, love, love Blue Dragon.
516361	518021	And I just got back to their village.
518601	520382	If anyone who's played the game knows where that is.
520862	521702	What part of the game I'm at.
522142	531564	Now that game took a lot of shit for being kind of generic, for being kind of not that impressive, some people have said, for considering who all's behind it.
532424	532964	You know what?
533484	534084	They can bite me.
535791	537072	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
556689	565751	But I mean, it has the charm of... I've noticed this typically about games that Toriyama designs, that they tend to have that charm that comes with his art style.
566731	568251	And I love that.
568311	569672	That was fantastic for me.
569952	573252	And Uematsu's music, I mean, oh my god, Uematsu.
574153	574693	It made me happy.
575053	579214	See, I get that, but I'm way more about Lost Odyssey than I was Blue Dragon.
579714	585575	I didn't think Blue Dragon was as terrible as a lot of folks made it out to be, but I just thought it was, eh, it's aight.
592135	602263	It's a new story, something to play through, but something that you can pick up that will automatically be familiar to you.
603064	609769	So for me, it's been filling my must-play Super Nintendo with a more comfortable controller.
612016	613237	and of course I've been playing Sims 3.
613457	617080	I started another family because the game decided to fart on one of mine.
617881	627608	Well, technically what happened is that someone turned off my computer while I was in the middle of a game and didn't save said game.
628889	633692	So it was either the spouse or Windows updates, which I thought I had turned those off too.
634993	636374	So, whatever.
638896	639977	Oh, I've also been playing on Gaia.
640782	641623	I like the booty grab.
642984	646627	Going to the chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com for questions and comments.
646948	653514	Ray Ayanami asked DarkSakura, hold it, which game on RFA, which is Raiden Fighters, and was it on one credit?
655064	659970	Um, actually, no, because like I said, my hand hurt a lot, so I played the first one.
661352	671504	Um, and, you know, I was really just gonna sit down and see what it was like, because I hadn't played the Aces ones, so I played through and...
672913	689883	Yeah, I really don't have the fine control that I used to because, like I said, my hand has been sticking with a suture in it, and my tendons are healing themselves, so I haven't really been able to play like I might have a few years ago.
690824	693245	So, no, I didn't do it on one credit.
693345	695046	But hopefully in a couple months that'll be all better, right?
695506	697848	Yeah, well, when it's all better, I'm going to be going back to R-Type.
699589	699889	All right.
700289	701590	Loki, how about you and your gaming week?
702145	703126	I played DDR, that was it.
704467	705769	That's all I played is DDR.
706269	707631	Not DDR, what the hell am I talking about?
707671	708972	I didn't play any DDR.
708992	711575	I'm a DDR freak, so, you know.
711595	711775	Really?
711815	713517	This is actually kind of noteworthy.
713557	716380	I'm like, you actually started exercising.
716480	716921	What is this?
718246	721947	Eventually I will, but no, I'm a green DDR freak, so.
722207	728109	No, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto all week long, and we have been recording our multiplayer games.
728129	731050	Because Grand Theft Auto and DDR have so much in common.
731090	737732	Okay, it's a three-letter acronym I was looking to say, and I was staring at DDR Freak, that's why I made the slip, okay?
737932	739433	So, whatever.
739893	745795	With all due respect to the many friends I made on there, including you guys, since when was DDR Freak relevant again?
746534	747074	It's not.
747214	749595	I'm looking at... I'm trying to... Okay.
749895	751536	Because I have my pads that I've built.
752536	753637	You remember when I built them?
753697	754997	Hell, it was that long ago.
755698	759279	I've used them since... No, I haven't used them since then.
759419	761640	So, I have them sitting in my garage.
763561	772644	And I'm just seeing if it's going to be more advantageous to actually purchase some already pre-done arcade-style pads for DDR.
773665	773745	Um...
775137	776118	or should I just fix it?
776138	793087	Because right now I have to ground the pads because the static electricity being built up by the Lexin arrows, it causes the thing I have it attached to to interpret the keys to short out because it just builds up static electricity and shocks it.
794167	796549	Which is not good because it'll stop working after about two minutes.
797609	798690	And then I have to reboot the whole computer.
800151	800371	So...
801616	803538	Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto
820236	821277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
842572	858645	something funny and set the music as good because the Orange Launch Radio channel needs more content it's in HD so it'll be awesome yeah because that new capture thing I have is awesome it works so well so it'll make things a lot easier for capturing video to put on the site
860146	861447	I'm getting an arcade cabinet.
885880	886320	Really?
886541	888502	Is it an actual game or what is it?
888582	889703	It's an arcade cabinet.
890103	890743	Just the cabinet?
891224	891484	Yes.
891744	892164	For what?
892565	894026	What do you plan to put on it?
894186	894586	Mame.
895046	895347	Mame.
895367	895987	DDR.
896688	897168	Alright.
897868	899089	It's a candy cabinet.
899209	900850	Do you know what a candy cabinet is?
900950	902451	I haven't the slightest idea what that is.
902472	906074	You know those cabinets that line Arcade Infinity?
907255	908796	Oh yeah, like the ones you sit down and play?
908816	908956	Yes.
909336	909656	Oh, okay.
909696	910477	That's a candy cabinet.
910497	910657	Oh, cool.
910677	911658	The Japanese style ones.
911698	911958	Yeah.
912538	913239	Well, those are pretty cool.
913519	914919	Yes, there's a deal going on.
914979	917060	There's the Neo Geo forums or whatever.
917240	919741	I found it looking for something else, actually.
920181	923422	Because at one time I wanted to buy a DDR machine.
924742	929884	But then I had to scale down my wishes because a DDR machine would cost me at least $2,500.
931104	931824	Probably more than that.
932385	933565	And that's just not affordable.
934125	939647	So a candy cab, actually, I'm looking at was a new Astro City machine.
940347	965733	which is a Sega made one and it's supposed to run somewhere around $450 I think and they're basically doing a big bulk shipment and they have some extras available they're being shipped to San Francisco so hopefully I'm trying to get the guy to send me a personal message again so I can actually put down a deposit for it because they're supposed to be coming between now and September so
967435	974541	That'd be awesome, because then I'm going to hook it up to become like a little, short, stubby DDR machine.
975681	977803	You sure it's actually DDR and not Grand Theft Auto?
978784	979324	It can be both.
980991	984212	Actually, we were thinking about getting one of those for all of our Neo Geo.
984532	986012	Well, you should act on this.
986092	988753	I mean, 400 bucks and they're shipping them already.
988893	990773	Actually, they're already on a boat.
990934	991754	They're on a boat?
992034	993434	They're already on a boat on the way here.
993634	996135	Yes, they're on a motherfucking boat.
997035	998295	So they're already on their way over.
998535	1001756	It's just, you know, he's trying to sell 30 of them.
1003337	1004837	Otherwise, he's going to keep them and sell them for higher.
1005336	1008120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1022977	1023958	Let's see my gaming week.
1024698	1029621	Okay, so Wednesday, we all got a patch on Xbox Live, right?
1029841	1036965	And everybody had to update to this new patch that added all this new stuff in Netflix and blah, blah, blah.
1037045	1039066	Kind of changed some things with the achievements and so on.
1039106	1042148	So I'm going to download that and I'm messing with the achievements and stuff for a little bit.
1042308	1047371	Thought I'd look at Netflix and I like the fact that you can add the movies from the Netflix channel now.
1047411	1049812	You can kind of browse through what new movies are out and things.
1050152	1051113	I thought that was pretty awesome.
1052013	1054135	Then I turn it off and I'm off doing other things for a while.
1054215	1058177	And then I'm bored, so I put a tweet up on Twitter that says, Hi, I'm bored.
1058197	1059138	Who wants to play Rock Band?
1059578	1061620	So a couple of the OLR listeners are like, Me, me, me.
1061660	1063021	So they invite me into a game.
1063401	1064501	We're playing some Rock Band.
1064542	1065162	Da-da-da-da-da.
1065722	1068604	I have to step away for a little bit because I've got to do some other errands real quick.
1068644	1069725	And I've got other things I've got to do.
1069745	1076649	But then I go back after about 20 minutes, turn on the Xbox 360 again, and then... It starts doing... That's actually the sound it makes.
1077210	1079912	It just starts throwing up everywhere and making all these like...
1080512	1080892	and DarkSakura.
1102612	1112696	There's a handful of people on Twitter who claim that happened, but I made this whole YouTube and I posted it to the Orange Entree channel and most people are telling me, nah, you just have lucky timing and your system's about to red ring.
1112757	1114137	Well, I can fucking tell that.
1114337	1115498	It's obviously about to red ring.
1116298	1117439	It's broken already.
1117639	1120360	I mean, it's not getting past a certain point, red ring or not.
1120840	1123841	So, congratulations me, my Xbox is broke.
1124121	1128083	And, wouldn't you know it, I'm just outside the three year warranty thing.
1128103	1129424	That means they can open it up.
1129684	1131785	I'm like three years and six months after it.
1132165	1133196	That means I get to open it up.
1133216	1133964	You want to open it up?
1134497	1134777	We'll see.
1134857	1135377	We can fix it.
1135537	1137758	I fixed one out of two.
1138439	1138939	I've had a few.
1140580	1140980	Oh, goody.
1141560	1142781	Hey, 50% is better than 0%.
1142841	1144321	Sounds like my trauma center record.
1144362	1146302	Look, I don't know.
1146683	1155166	I'm kind of all about fixing it, but at the same time, I'm like, you know, and there's a story later on about price cuts, and I'm like, maybe I'll just wait and just get the elite system because I kind of want the new stuff.
1155246	1156347	But hold on a minute.
1156927	1158528	Why am I allowing myself to think this way?
1158588	1162330	Why do I even need to be worrying about repairs and so on in the first place?
1162970	1163730	Thanks for watching!
1179616	1180957	You're preaching to the choir, okay?
1181117	1183119	I have five systems that have died, okay?
1183379	1185780	My Dreamcast is ten years old and still works.
1186141	1189163	We've been celebrating the Genesis on Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight.
1189203	1190304	He was talking a lot about that.
1190344	1192025	That just celebrated its 20th anniversary.
1192465	1194006	And, you know, those still work.
1194026	1201831	I have a room full of consoles that are older than most of our listeners' ages combined in the back room of my house that, guess what?
1202472	1203152	Still work!
1203572	1206915	Except for the Atari 7800, but it's the hour supply, so let's not talk about that.
1207495	1208215	It's just...
1209577	1210918	Thank you for watching!
1228200	1229801	And I'll see you in the next one.
1253647	1256708	to bring in a more sociological aspect to it.
1257389	1258669	Sorry, this is the way the world is.
1258789	1263331	Because your initial systems were broken.
1264852	1270134	It's the fact that people would rather be complacent than put any effort into changing a situation in general.
1271034	1274556	And so enough people just let it go and they can get away with it.
1274576	1277837	But enough people complain about something and something might eventually happen.
1278518	1278818	You know...
1280301	1283269	If they think that they can get away with it this long, they're just going to keep getting away with it.
1284453	1286398	Until enough people hold them accountable.
1286839	1287582	That's all there is to that.
1289950	1292852	All I have to say is that it just sucks.
1292872	1298655	The whole thing just sucks, and Microsoft sucks, and you suck for not making more of a stink about it.
1299215	1301456	Not you specifically, but you as gamers in general.
1301596	1305818	And I suck for not realizing this before, and everything sucks.
1306418	1307839	And the fact that I'm going to have to buy a new 360 sucks too.
1313883	1325010	Actdeft is apologizing to me in chat, but you don't need to apologize.
1325050	1325690	It's not your fault.
1325991	1326911	Stop apologizing.
1327792	1330153	People who apologize for things that aren't their fault sucks.
1331554	1332055	Just kidding.
1332595	1337018	But the fact that it broke during a Rock Band 2 OL Army session nonetheless sucks.
1337745	1361724	Well, that's actually the big thing that I think is a problem with the industry as it is now, with almost anything actually, is that too many people are just more willing to, oh, I don't want a conflict, I don't want to put the effort into it, I don't want to do this about it, oh, well, that's just how it is, that's how things are going to be, you know?
1361744	1361824	Yeah.
1362978	1363658	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1385939	1387040	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1412398	1413259	This is what I want.
1413319	1415561	This is what I want every media outlet.
1415581	1417302	This is what I want every person.
1417582	1422727	This is what I want every gamer to ask Microsoft about their new system.
1423708	1426110	Will it last more than three years?
1427371	1428952	Does this system red ring?
1429312	1434497	Those are the questions I want Microsoft to be asked to their face and have to answer.
1435477	1439381	Why should I trust you that your system is not another pile of poop?
1440342	1440762	I do it.
1441023	1443805	Okay, so this hasn't been done yet.
1443885	1452474	I think that what we should do also is, and this is actually something as a community, have you ever heard of a site called starbucked.com?
1453284	1455426	No, but is this stuff to do with Battlestar Galactica?
1455686	1455786	No.
1456326	1467553	It's about a person who had such a horrible customer service experience with Starbucks that he created a consumer advocacy site so that people could voice their concerns regarding problems they've had with Starbucks and other things.
1468514	1473757	And his problem was actually something that could have been fixed if one person had gotten off their ass and helped him properly.
1474257	1481602	So I think that I should make a site, and don't nobody make it for me unless you want to make me an admin of it, is a red-ringed
1482723	1484164	Oh, there's gotta be a site like that already.
1512429	1518771	I was at work on Friday and I mentioned we had some downtime because our systems were down and I mentioned, oh yeah, my Xbox.
1519151	1526694	And people I never suspected even played video games like outside of like Madden and stuff were saying, oh, you got the Red Rings, huh?
1526754	1527834	Yeah, I got that too.
1527914	1530836	And like everybody in class was piping up, oh yeah, the Red Rings.
1530916	1531856	Oh, I know the Red Rings.
1532383	1534585	Well, you know what?
1535365	1544993	If I pulled up everything on Twitter that had Red Ring of Death, printed it out in black and white, because I want to save my color cartridges, and mailed the stack of papers to Microsoft and go, look!
1550649	1553812	I don't think they do anything, because people are still buying 360s.
1553852	1554553	But what's it do?
1554613	1557275	So it doesn't boot up now, or does it just not play your games?
1558696	1561099	It does a blblbl thing after it's been on like two minutes.
1561779	1564121	Sometimes during the boot, sometimes while I'm in the middle of a game.
1564362	1564762	Doesn't matter.
1566143	1568405	To be honest, I haven't really tried it since that one night.
1568886	1571168	So, that's where I'm at.
1572975	1580781	To be perfectly honest though, I think we're on our third 360, but keep in mind we have an advantage.
1581281	1587726	I just want the history of gaming to put a black mark on, excuse me, a red mark on Xbox.
1587786	1588747	A red ring around the Xbox.
1588787	1592650	A red ring on the Xbox 360 for this travesty.
1593370	1595672	And the fact that they're covering it up very well.
1596775	1602339	I mean, has there been any console in history that has the hardware issues that the 360 has?
1603379	1611164	The reason why they, I think, are being able to keep their head afloat regarding everything is the fact that they've been so quick to replace systems, too.
1612225	1615787	Honestly, Rob, I think you should still give a call, give a try.
1617428	1618889	Say, hey, I bought this before...
1621590	1623912	All this was going on, you guys owe me.
1623972	1624592	See what happens.
1625332	1628775	If they want to keep your business as a customer, they're going to bend over backwards.
1629295	1630356	Bobby says the PS2.
1630616	1631957	Bobby actually says a lot in chat.
1632017	1633658	Let me read some of the comments from chat.
1633998	1641723	Bobby says, Microsoft knows, they know, they won't admit it, but they know.
1643084	1645565	Yeah, he says his original Xbox still works.
1645605	1645885	So does mine.
1645905	1646506	Mine does too.
1647799	1653120	And he goes on to say the difference between the PS2 and the 360 is that there were no blogs when the PS2s were failing in mass.
1653200	1655220	And, you know, that's certainly a legitimate viewpoint.
1655581	1655861	I don't know.
1656641	1657341	See, here's the thing, though.
1657701	1662422	I don't know anyone that had a PS2 that failed outside of people I've met on the internet.
1662462	1665763	Like, when I was gaming, I didn't know anybody that had a failed PS2.
1665783	1666383	Mine didn't fail.
1666523	1668483	I know, like, 50 people that have had 360s fail.
1668523	1670664	However, I have a first model Japanese PS2.
1670984	1671504	Guess what?
1672064	1672724	It still works.
1673004	1674425	Yeah, my Japanese PS2 still works too.
1697421	1700425	Bobby says, I'm on my fifth PS2 and you met me in person.
1700645	1701326	I guess that's true.
1701707	1702508	But you know what I mean.
1704050	1710839	My Japanese PS2 still works perfectly and those are the ones that were definitely having problems back in the day.
1711079	1713142	My PS2 that I have now works perfectly.
1714867	1718751	I do have a stack of PS1s, by the way.
1737011	1741614	The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages and the free repair of any console rendered unusable by the update.
1741974	1748438	This will be the second such lawsuit filed against Microsoft, the first having been filed in 2005, shortly after the da-da-da, etc.
1749499	1754662	Unfortunately, not enough people had their consoles borked by this update, and people are telling me up and down it wasn't the update.
1755122	1760145	All I know is that it sure is convenient timing for this to happen.
1760325	1761706	Have you tried running it without the hard drive?
1762707	1763127	I haven't.
1763307	1763968	Should I try that?
1764108	1764288	Yes.
1764888	1766009	Okay, I'll try that and see what happens.
1766530	1767270	I'll see you next time.
1787458	1798409	Alright, anyhow, other stuff I played my gaming week, because I have much more in my gaming week than just Abort360 that I still... By the way, my resolution right now is I'm not doing anything until this rumored price drop we'll get to later in the show.
1799210	1800691	Maybe I'll get it repaired, I don't know.
1801212	1803995	Right now I'm leaning towards just getting a new 360.
1804115	1809320	Get a new one and make sure it's a new Elite, not an older Elite that people have been sitting on forever that...
1810185	1812227	That's what I'll try and do.
1813188	1822095	But anyhow, what I wanted to get into elsewhere in my gaming week, because this is something that deserves positive talk and not negative talk, is Ion Online I played a little more of.
1822536	1825158	They had their next closed beta, I guess the final one.
1825198	1827420	It's the second closed beta I've participated in.
1827860	1851972	and I got to play the game a lot more than two weeks ago the first time I played the beta for Ion Online I still feel like I've only really scratched the surface of the game and I was having a lot of problems with graphics stuff the game doesn't work too hot with Vista but I found if I ran in full screen windowed mode I was able to get a much better frame rate so you know just you have to really tinker with those settings and at least they've made it very customizable in the graphics and so on
1852612	1852992	Guess what?
1853032	1853873	Ragnarok Online has that.
1878646	1880327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1906115	1906535	I want to play.
1906595	1906715	Yeah.
1934640	1936260	Hold on, I'm reading comments from chat here.
1939246	1950393	Yes, to publicly acknowledge it because it keeps going back and forth in chat, I am aware that CC Gaming repairs 360s and would also take the 360 for scrap.
1950793	1953435	I just haven't decided what I want to do yet.
1953455	1957237	Because I'd have to ship it, which is going to be money, but I don't know.
1957978	1963601	I want some time to think and try these other solutions too before I just commit to one particular solution.
1963681	1966443	So certainly that's something I'm heavily considering.
1967264	1967644	But we'll see.
1969982	1972124	All right, that's it for our gaming weeks.
1972945	1974006	Let's get into... Here, I have a present for you.
1974366	1975127	What's this present?
1975187	1975747	Ooh, present.
1976408	1978109	Some of my more obscure Bimani stuff.
1978269	1980171	You burned me a DVD mini.
1980711	1980972	Yeah.
1980992	1982873	I remember you used to use CD minis all the time.
1982913	1983754	Now it's DVD minis.
1984194	1990480	Well, it's because they were cheap by the spindle, and the pre-show fit on them perfectly.
1990680	1992281	All my stuff was just fine.
1992642	1994103	But the next one I'm going to burn you is an actual DVD.
1994123	1994243	Okay.
1995322	2003307	All right, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, of which we don't have a lot, but we will continue to plug our Twitter at OLR, and then, of course, we're on Facebook as the OL Army.
2003787	2005328	We have a MySpace, supposedly, too.
2006088	2007089	Is anyone on MySpace anymore?
2007149	2009350	No, we had some friend requests there the other day, so I guess we do.
2010391	2012372	And, yeah, LiveJournal, Orange Launch.
2012472	2014033	MySpace is so 2005.
2014293	2014673	It really is.
2015173	2019196	Okay, let's get into some gaming news, then, and we'll start with Loki.
2019716	2026581	Yes, there is a couple rumors regarding some Wii software, one of which is, of course, Wii Fit.
2026741	2031465	There is a rumored price point for it, which, of course, not too surprising.
2031525	2034447	They have the bundle at the $89.99 price point, which is...
2036929	2039371	or I should say $99.99 price point.
2039671	2040932	That's a little higher, that's kind of weird.
2041293	2044835	But anyways, that's pretty close to what the normal Wii Fit bundle is.
2045836	2050059	Then of course, the rumor is the standalone game is going to be $29.99 as well.
2050900	2056825	No word exactly on when those are going to be officially announced, but I don't know, it sounds about right to me.
2056845	2064210	$29.99 for a game that's not too different than the original, sounds fair, I guess.
2065371	2065632	Maybe.
2066748	2074110	The other weird thing, though, that they have... And this is also coming from a marketing survey, apparently.
2074970	2085233	They have a slide that shows what appears to be some sort of new peripheral that's going to be with a game that's like a bicycling game.
2085253	2092235	And the peripheral itself actually looks like one of those... Oh, gosh, what's...
2094753	2095656	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2101325	2102025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2127581	2130282	You can do almost like a prop copter type thing.
2130903	2136085	You can rotate one of the things to spin a rotisserie barbecue.
2136986	2139767	They have downhill racing, you name it.
2139787	2144449	And then, of course, the usual calorie tracking and that kind of stuff.
2144929	2148751	But, I mean, it looks kind of cool and definitely something I could see on the Wii.
2149351	2150992	So, no word on what that is.
2151092	2152833	I'm guessing it's probably a third party putting that out.
2152873	2154474	Probably someone like Ubisoft or...
2155234	2183364	EA or something well it wouldn't surprise me too that if one of these like bicycling things got picked up because it seems like at E3 remember when there was like Kensha Hall and everything we would see something like this demoed down there like a bicycling exercise game so there's some companies exploring this have been for a long time I wouldn't be surprised if it even was Nintendo doing it or something just maybe that one screenshot's kind of misleading because the one character doesn't look like a me but I mean everything doesn't have to look like a me in the games but who knows yeah
2184064	2193228	The other thing is, it sort of looks like an island setting, and I know that they've talked about, you know, putting the other games on that stupid island that they created for Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort.
2194289	2195309	Wii Fit's on an island?
2196129	2198830	Well, they have, like, the Jogging is on an island.
2199011	2200031	Oh, yeah, that's right, okay.
2200451	2203072	So, I don't know if it's the same island, but it's very similar.
2204313	2206314	Skinny Island, what would the name of that island be?
2206414	2207654	It's Woohoo Island or something.
2207694	2208515	Woohoo Island?
2209035	2209955	I think that's what they called it.
2210055	2211536	Woohoo, I'm not fat anymore, yay!
2213993	2215935	or Sex Island as Sims would call it.
2217517	2218017	Wow.
2219459	2220720	I don't know.
2221982	2222422	It's neat.
2224084	2234055	I would be more excited about the pedal thing than I would be the Wii Fit balance board because at least the pedal thing, you know, it seems like exercise whereas the balance board, you're just kind of standing there leaning back and forth.
2234075	2234375	I don't know.
2237631	2247201	Again, our good friend Bobby just piping up with all sorts of trivia tonight saying Miyamoto wants that to become one of the new characters that is indeed Woohoo Island is the name of where all this takes place.
2247402	2252107	Well, I don't want to see any other like games with the island, you know, running around doing stuff, you know.
2252748	2256909	Mario at Woohoo Island, you know, killing Koopas, or... Oh, wait for it.
2257009	2257529	It'll happen.
2257709	2258849	Or the new Smash Bros.
2258909	2260890	game with Woohoo Island as a playable character.
2260910	2261390	Oh, I betcha.
2261610	2262290	That'll be a stage.
2262370	2262950	It'll be a stage.
2263170	2263990	No, it'll be a character.
2264010	2265391	The island is a character.
2265411	2266431	The island will be a character.
2266491	2268491	He said it himself, that the island's a character.
2269192	2270112	Spoiler right there.
2271372	2274373	I mean, how do you face off against a whole island?
2275213	2275733	You can't.
2277182	2277743	X-Men did it.
2278183	2279344	Giant Size X-Men number one.
2279964	2280244	Uh-huh.
2281065	2281845	Oh my gosh.
2283687	2284828	Told you I'm a geek.
2286829	2288430	So, I don't know.
2288470	2289891	What do you guys think of this?
2289951	2292893	Is this bicycle peripheral something that would interest you guys, or no?
2293574	2297917	It'd be interesting to see it, but once again, I'd probably use it about as much as I do Wii Fit.
2298277	2301299	Wii Fit, though, it fills the space underneath my TV stand.
2303501	2304021	That's it.
2304141	2304962	You should lend it to me.
2305509	2306090	Thanks for watching!
2323123	2329627	If the game was fun and the bike thing actually worked, because she's actually sitting on the couch or something, right?
2329647	2330808	Yeah, she's sitting on the couch using the pedal.
2330828	2332328	And the bike is kind of there.
2332388	2335550	If that is actually sturdy, then that might be cool.
2336571	2337051	I don't know, though.
2337912	2338472	We'll have to see.
2339313	2340833	I like exercise bikes and stuff.
2341254	2342074	It might be a fun way to do it.
2342094	2342434	You know what?
2342494	2346017	I can go to my gym and play my Game Boy on the bike.
2346517	2348058	But that's also how much a month?
2349619	2350599	I don't pay a whole lot for my gym.
2351059	2351760	I'm out of contract.
2352591	2352871	I see.
2354052	2360374	Alright, moving on to some other news, talking about something on the DS as opposed to the Nintendo Wii.
2360754	2366036	Dragon Quest IX, of course, was a huge game over in Japan when it came out, as all Dragon Quest games are.
2366536	2369597	And so, of course, the question is, when is it going to come out over here?
2370138	2378581	Well, apparently, there was a Q&A session this week with investors, and the president of Squeenix, Yoishi Wada, said that they are considering...
2379201	2384765	releasing Dragon Quest IX overseas and still deciding which regions are actually going to get it.
2385225	2388967	And they don't plan to release it until after April of 2010.
2389047	2391109	They're assholes is basically what it is.
2391229	2391869	I'm serious.
2391929	2392450	It's just like...
2393886	2394646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2417231	2418312	Dragon Quest VIII
2437980	2442662	Look, I'm going to say something that I know is going to piss some people off, but I kind of don't care because I'm just keeping it real.
2443763	2446764	This is the case when I support piracy, honestly.
2447444	2453627	When these foreign companies are too stubborn to release the games over here, I say, you know what?
2453907	2457308	Then if you can understand Japanese, copy the Japanese one and get it.
2457328	2458589	Why do you even have to worry about that?
2458889	2464092	Because they have people that will translate it, and then they'll add a patch to the ROM, and boom, it's in English.
2464272	2471636	And I know I'm going to take some flack for that comment, but I kind of don't care, because I was doing that with DDR years ago, when they refused to release that over here.
2471716	2472236	And you know what?
2472256	2477239	When they finally released it over here, I bought every single one, even when they were crap, for quite a while.
2477679	2480561	And Konami thanks you for that by releasing even crappier games.
2480661	2481401	I know, I know.
2481761	2482762	And the lesson we learned there?
2483282	2484003	That doesn't matter.
2484403	2487745	But I just... This kind of news that, like, they just...
2489035	2497222	I'm all about, like, I understand resources and that there's other games they want to do and maybe they want to do some things that are outside the box and so forth, but I don't know.
2497602	2504628	This thing kind of just reeks of, and we just don't feel like it right now, type thing.
2505829	2513315	And some folks in chat, GameGuru says, Mother 3 in Actdeft speaks up with the Mother 3 fan translation.
2513675	2515457	Yeah, I'm all for that too.
2520063	2529029	I don't understand why they just won't take... I can't imagine it takes that long to translate a game, especially when you have fans that translate it for you.
2529549	2532411	I mean, that's got to be the ultimate kick in the pants.
2533011	2535092	When you have these fan companies beating you to it.
2536193	2538814	People that are paid 40 hours a week to do this.
2539455	2539975	You know what I mean?
2540435	2540736	I don't know.
2542928	2551171	Keep in mind, though, that when they do it themselves, not only do they have to pay translator, they have to pay writer.
2551611	2562095	They have to take the time to change anything in-game graphically that they need to translate from one language to another.
2562515	2565976	They have to pay someone to localize it.
2566536	2571399	I don't know that other people might have gotten because the joke is... It was actually a pun, you know?
2586747	2599294	So, really, there are things that are lost in translation that you do have to go through reorganizing for the cultural element to make it something that would be understood by your audience.
2599755	2607960	So, there is actually a good deal of cost that comes in with the translation process when you are paying for it.
2609000	2609581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2629455	2632417	Production cost in the actual physical copies of the game.
2632937	2635379	There's shipment.
2635519	2636760	You have to deal with a lot of money.
2636800	2638881	That they would make back on Dragon Quest IX?
2639221	2649007	But when they also, and again I'm doing this straight from a business perspective, they have to look at previous sales and look at what their overhead was versus how much they actually made.
2649167	2653931	Yeah, because their last few games that they've localized over here, at least on the 360 and stuff, haven't done that great.
2653971	2657294	I mean, Star Ocean, Last Hope wasn't all that great.
2657514	2659576	The Last Remnant was not that great at all.
2659896	2661537	The game itself wasn't that great.
2661998	2666662	And then the one before that, which I don't remember the name off the top of my head, but that didn't do that well either.
2667202	2667523	It's just...
2668607	2669027	I don't know.
2669047	2670589	Was that Infinite Undiscovery?
2670769	2671930	Yes, Infinite Undiscovery.
2672390	2674932	But there's just a lot of weird stuff that they're doing.
2675092	2678715	Like, you know, Chrono Trigger did alright, but I mean, shit, dude.
2678795	2681698	It's just a ROM that they're basically running off an emulator.
2682058	2683179	I mean, that's basically all they did.
2683359	2687883	You can't tell me that they programmed the engine from scratch and rebuilt the game.
2687923	2689344	I'm sorry, I don't buy that at all.
2691566	2693828	And I could totally see them going the route of like,
2695185	2697087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2717987	2722330	and their tactical... I don't remember the other Final Fantasy tactical game that they had.
2723631	2732018	The Tower Defense one is kind of just... This is alright, but they haven't really been having that many good hits lately.
2732198	2739663	And other than Final Fantasy 4 and 3 and stuff like that on DS, when they actually remade them, that was kind of cool.
2740044	2742446	Because there's effort put into it, and it's Final Fantasy...
2743422	2744662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2768154	2769434	I'm looking at some comments in chat.
2769494	2777777	Gripper01, excuse me, I'm chewing ice here, says, plus with fan translations, they are not censored like the early Final Fantasy translations.
2780959	2788141	Apparently, GameGuru is saying, Atlus even offered to publish Mother 3 for Nintendo, and Nintendo of Japan denied it.
2788681	2792543	And I guess this whole back and forth is that because of all the parody in the games...
2793652	2799134	Nintendo of America is afraid of getting sued, so they want to make some changes, and Nintendo of Japan won't let them.
2801155	2802296	It's just weird, that whole mess.
2802736	2807658	Have they released it on a virtual console or something like that?
2808338	2809899	Mother 3 is a DS game, so no.
2810899	2812980	It's a Game Boy Advance game, but they could still do it.
2814021	2814381	I don't know.
2814861	2816582	I mean, it's basically a Super Nintendo game.
2818203	2819744	Money, it all comes down to money.
2843780	2844261	I guess.
2844761	2849505	Alright, well, let's move on with some more news while I steam over not having Dragon Quest IX.
2849546	2854350	I guess it's not that bad because this is a DS game and I don't have the attention span for DS games, so whatever.
2856132	2861617	Well, how about something else that you'd have to have a bit of an attention span if you plan on finishing it at all?
2863018	2863559	Mega Man 9.
2864340	2865481	There's new download content.
2865661	2866382	And guess what it does?
2866903	2867743	It makes the game harder!
2868284	2868725	Why?
2869525	2871528	You have superhero mode!
2871988	2873029	Which costs a dollar.
2874992	2875813	A whole dollar?
2875833	2876593	A whole dollar.
2876653	2877775	It's 80 Microsoft points.
2880362	2887829	and it basically just keeps it increases the number of enemies that you're going to see on screen at any given time in the game.
2888769	2891892	So yeah, it's for all you people who want the next big challenge.
2892212	2894274	It's basically for people who like Asshole Mario.
2894833	2898776	Or who have those leftover points that you just can't seem to get rid of.
2898976	2901118	Dude, I have leftover points that I can't seem to get rid of.
2901138	2904320	Everything is in multiples of 100, except rock band songs.
2904540	2907682	That would be kind of cool if they did that for Super Mario Bros.
2907982	2909664	Like re-release Mario Bros.
2909764	2913146	with a level editor or something like that, and then have it where you can share levels online.
2913646	2916629	Of course, that would be innovative and used online, so Nintendo would never buy that.
2916669	2919270	But a perfect example of something you can do...
2920336	2920736	Simple.
2920916	2923418	You don't have to actually program really a whole ton to it.
2923978	2924478	Release it.
2925399	2926399	People would love it.
2927420	2928520	And you'd get a lot of money back.
2929481	2930561	You don't have to put a lot of effort in.
2931262	2933083	Because Nintendo certainly doesn't do that.
2933383	2935824	Yeah, but then they'd get sued for copying LittleBigPlanet.
2937017	2940038	Yeah, I'm in the camp that's like, isn't Mega Man 9 hard enough?
2940478	2943179	I guess there's definitely the hardcore fans that have the whole pattern.
2943199	2943779	I haven't played it yet.
2944039	2946800	I bought it a long time ago, but I still haven't heard it.
2947100	2947660	It's hard.
2947720	2951941	I only was able to beat three or four of the robots before I was like, okay, I'm spent.
2952141	2952501	I'm done.
2952781	2953821	You know what I'd like to see?
2954641	2957842	I'd actually like to see a new Rockman and Forte.
2959363	2960243	That would make me happy.
2960283	2963024	How about some Mega Man 9 easy mode content?
2963124	2964404	I'd pay a dollar for that.
2965936	2967297	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2981249	3003017	I think that's every Mega Man fan's like dream game is like just Mega Man orgy where it's like all what 81 master robots or however many they've had over the series not even counting X I'm not even going to throw the X series into it because that could be like the sequel when this game does well but the Mega Man orgy would just be a game where it's like all 81 robots going at it at once
3003257	3023772	and then do it like Metroid style which is a very interesting orgy considering one of which considering one of those robots is a woman and there are other 80 year men just do it do it all Metroid style and make the legends like Mega Man Legends tie that in there oh that would be hot that would be a good game but it has to remain 2D it has to remain 2D
3024392	3035555	I was thinking of a game that just kind of had all 81 stages in it and playable at once, but I like your idea of a Metroidvania-style Mega Man game with all the robots.
3035616	3036296	That's pretty cool.
3036936	3049640	And if you totally used the escape velocity thing, then you would be able to go back to your last save point location, do weird warps like that, and then Samus would come out and kick Mega Man's ass.
3050865	3052046	So you totally took my game.
3053046	3056228	But that actually is... Okay, we're putting that under Dream Games.
3056248	3058369	And four-player co-op because that would be awesome.
3058649	3059249	Just for fun.
3059389	3060009	Just for fun.
3060210	3062851	That's under Dream Games now for Orange Lounge Radio.
3062891	3064071	It's an official Dream Game.
3064232	3065052	What, Mega Man Orgy?
3065572	3066613	Yeah, Mega Man Orgy.
3066933	3071355	Or as I like what Actdeft calls it in chat, Mega 10 RGY.
3071395	3074136	So the zero is an O in orgy.
3074316	3074737	I like that.
3075317	3075637	Okay.
3075657	3076958	I like that one.
3076978	3078739	You are now marketing director of this game.
3078999	3079239	Okay.
3080250	3082151	Congratulations on your promotion.
3082771	3084452	You now get a non-existent job.
3086233	3088494	So add that to the wiki that's going on the list.
3088754	3091695	Oh, and at the end, there's a big butt.
3093356	3093676	What?
3094737	3095457	Are you high?
3096658	3097638	It's an easter egg.
3098639	3101100	You know, like when you can hold the buttons down and the stars turn into chickens.
3102799	3103299	DarkSakura.com
3126934	3127694	Exactly.
3127754	3132035	This is why it doesn't need to be on the list, because that list is just ridiculous stuff.
3132215	3133175	This is ridiculous.
3133255	3134216	It's never going to happen.
3134276	3135996	Well, it's just because it's never going to happen.
3136416	3138097	It's just, I don't have, I don't know.
3138317	3141997	I'm sure there's people out there that have done custom Mega Man games, and it wouldn't be that difficult.
3142137	3145818	The chat room would like to point out that what you're describing could be Guts Man's ass.
3146538	3147079	It could be.
3147899	3152820	Easter egg in the game, you know, beat Guts Man with a certain number of life left, and you get a butt.
3157363	3158463	What is wrong with you?
3158543	3160384	What is wrong with me for finding this funny?
3160744	3161424	How old am I?
3161484	3162324	Like five?
3162504	3163145	Seriously?
3164085	3164685	It doesn't matter.
3164745	3165485	It's all for fun.
3166466	3167586	Fun does not require an age.
3168086	3173527	Alright, but fun requires a new story real quick here before this show literally goes down the crapper.
3173667	3182510	Speaking of your butt, Nintendo has patented a brand new inflatable cushion that you would use for a horseback riding game.
3183757	3184237	Why?
3184738	3187400	That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
3188321	3189822	It looks absolutely awful.
3190523	3195547	Basically, their picture that they have, first off, looks like this grown man dressed up like a little kid.
3195908	3197909	Which is creepy enough, if you ask me.
3198390	3206737	And then, the actual cushion itself is literally just like an inner tube that they have strapped the Wii Remote to and you rock back and forth.
3207238	3208659	I think that's supposed to be a kid.
3209838	3211799	I understand it's supposed to be a kid, but it looks like a man-child.
3215601	3216522	So what is this for?
3216622	3220364	For a finely arcade perfect port of Final Furlong, or what is this?
3220664	3223006	It's for, I don't know, sitting on your butt.
3223106	3229850	It's for those racing games that they have where you sit on the Wii balance board, but if you have hemorrhoids, you can't do it, so then you can sit on the cushion.
3230310	3233072	Is this where your butt gets a little tickle if you do well on the game?
3233132	3234072	Is that what this is for?
3234132	3234252	Oh.
3235493	3237294	It looks stupid, I mean seriously.
3257604	3260345	That's what this Wii inflatable cushion reminds me of.
3260685	3263286	I'm going to have that in my living room.
3264027	3266027	Let me describe how this works first off.
3266047	3266848	Thank you.
3267148	3268628	Wild, wacky action bike.
3268668	3269089	Thank you.
3269989	3272630	As if it wasn't completely obvious.
3272950	3277472	It's an inflatable air cushion or other type of seat with pockets for the Wii remote.
3277852	3285335	It's for simulating horseback riding or riding of other animals, real or imagined, or even vehicles.
3286115	3305331	For example, you can indicate the gait of a horse by gently moving forward and backward on the cushion to go slow or fast forward and backward rocking motions to gallop.
3306212	3311416	So basically this game will adjust your speed based on how fast you hump the cushion.
3312757	3313158	Awesome.
3314051	3314912	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3321980	3322440	Outro Outro
3347267	3350048	I can just see the whole rocking back and forth.
3351709	3353849	The whole thing deflates while you're playing it.
3354269	3355170	Like, how sad.
3356450	3357430	Is this for real?
3357970	3358751	It's for real.
3359571	3362492	Is this Nintendo making the patent?
3362752	3363512	Or whatever this is.
3364372	3366393	You know what this thing kind of looks like to me?
3366593	3367113	You know those...
3369904	3375446	Okay, you know at the gym they have the inflatable balls and they have the ones that are half size?
3375466	3379388	This sort of makes me think of those just with another rocking thing put on it.
3379928	3384990	This one also looks really... It looks like a wacky action bike, okay?
3385090	3386371	It's not necessary!
3386391	3390612	I mean, seriously, how many games are you going to play where you're riding a horse?
3391313	3394814	It's absolutely not necessary and why the hell would they patent this?
3395462	3403208	Well, keep in mind, though, it's a good idea to... They could patent something and not actually bring it out, but it keeps someone else from doing it.
3404269	3407932	GameGuru in chat says, we find out why it's called WooHoo Island.
3410894	3411295	Great.
3411535	3414898	So we're going to get WooHoo biking and WooHoo horse riding with this thing.
3416559	3418220	It's just strange.
3418240	3419822	I mean, why can't you... Although, although...
3420845	3432169	If this is legit, if this is a real thing that Nintendo is planning, you know you can't wait for that press conference when Reggie Fils-Aimé comes out on one of these.
3432389	3437891	Next year's E3 press conference is when you're just like, oh my god, Nintendo has seriously just fucking lost it this time.
3438411	3447074	The last two years of press conferences were bad, but now when Reggie Fils-Aimé comes rolling out on one of these things, you're just going to be like, oh my god, this is just difficult to watch.
3447094	3449475	I would love to go there and just walk out.
3449875	3450996	and walk out right at that.
3451236	3451997	Well, that's it.
3452237	3452617	I'm done.
3452978	3453378	I'm done.
3456040	3456500	I give up.
3457181	3458402	This is absolutely stupid.
3458482	3459683	That's what I seriously want.
3460023	3462165	Can somebody please do that at E3?
3462225	3465367	Somebody who's special enough to get invited to Nintendo's conference.
3465747	3469090	Somebody who doesn't mind getting blacklisted a little bit.
3469610	3470091	That's it.
3470271	3470711	I'm done.
3470731	3472873	This is so stupid.
3473073	3473714	I'm out of here.
3474434	3475055	See ya.
3475155	3475555	That's it.
3475795	3476536	I am done.
3476616	3478557	D-U-N done.
3483894	3484974	And get up and walk out.
3485114	3487095	There is no practical use for this whatsoever.
3487155	3490276	It's a big device that holds a remote that shakes it back and forth.
3490996	3500319	How difficult would it be to take this same horse riding game and just shake the remote slow to go slow, shake it faster to go faster.
3500459	3501139	Oh my god, look at that.
3501219	3502640	I didn't have to buy any more peripherals.
3504720	3508541	Can you imagine the size of the box this game is going to come in if it's just this giant device?
3510002	3511722	Well, you probably have to inflate it yourself.
3511802	3513543	It probably comes in a small box and...
3516395	3517836	You have to inflate it yourself.
3518837	3519338	You know what?
3519438	3524522	The whole talk about the cushion thing just sort of made my brain shut off, so I decided to look at Teriyaki Doritos instead.
3526363	3527844	Will you stop being so random?
3528445	3530547	First you want our Mega Man game to have a butt.
3530887	3533949	Then you say, I don't care about inflatable Nintendo cushion.
3534290	3536071	This could be the biggest joke of the year.
3536451	3537672	I want Teriyaki Doritos.
3538493	3538793	Really.
3539174	3540655	I really want Teriyaki Doritos right now.
3542632	3569473	this is gonna be one of those shows where it's like this is gonna be one of those shows because I'm sorry the whole concept of this cushion thing literally made my brain shut off for like a minute and then by the time I came back to consciousness I was looking at teriyaki doritos you know the best part about this is is that the I bet you the Wii remote's not sensitive enough to sense these little rocking motions that are in that would be the punchline to the whole thing
3571081	3572402	Let's see, some comments in chat.
3572742	3574564	Frisbee says, my name is Reggie.
3574885	3577348	I'm about kicking ass, taking names, and fucking a pillow.
3583303	3583803	Boy oh boy.
3584143	3587445	Gripper01 in chat says... Seriously, is this something we need to be teaching our kids?
3587505	3588745	I mean... Hold on, shush.
3589325	3592807	Gripper01 says, I'm still waiting for Excitebots to be released in the UK.
3592827	3593888	Nintendo hates Europe.
3594148	3596169	Well, hey, at least you'll have this peripheral, possibly.
3596789	3600271	So is this going to break certain girls' hymens, just like, you know, flashback writing?
3600551	3603172	I mean, are they going to become women just from playing this game?
3603932	3605033	That's what I want to know, because...
3606656	3608277	Oh my god!
3609257	3611558	Just chalk that up to the list of Wii injuries.
3612058	3615959	Broken lamp, shattered television screen, broken hymen.
3616279	3618000	Just add that to the list.
3618900	3620020	Oh my god, Loki.
3620140	3620980	Why did you go there?
3621261	3623101	Because that's horseback riding.
3623161	3625702	Hello.
3625962	3627022	It was on topic.
3628103	3630183	Hymen Breaker Wii 2009.
3630703	3634445	Okay, I think we can pretty much just sum it up.
3634465	3635505	This is a horrible idea.
3637116	3637656	You know what?
3637776	3638897	Is it Nintendo horrible?
3639117	3639537	You know what?
3639577	3640117	Here's the thing.
3642178	3643278	It's kind of interesting.
3643498	3659664	In all honesty, all jokes aside, to see somebody putting a respectable, reputable game company behind an inflatable pillow that will move, you really have to wonder, where are they going with this?
3659764	3661065	It could be interesting.
3661185	3664166	I see potential modifications involving the Rez vibrator.
3665979	3668381	It is hard for me to be serious about this, Rob.
3668761	3677386	I think, if anything, this is a sign of hope because it gives me hope that at any conference that they hold from now on, I'm hoping that I see this.
3679728	3680328	What's her name?
3680388	3681008	That new one?
3681649	3682049	What's her name?
3682089	3682469	Piper?
3682910	3684150	What the heck's her name?
3684170	3684791	That Perrin?
3685051	3685591	Is that her name?
3686632	3689253	I want her to come out on one of these.
3689414	3689874	Palin?
3689934	3690134	No.
3690614	3692155	She autographed an Xbox, supposedly.
3692175	3694737	That's doing horrible things for my imagination right now.
3695214	3695594	Alright.
3698216	3699997	Let's move on, please, to another story.
3700277	3705660	And we're going to talk about, hey, other Nintendo Wii news, but this one is actually a lot more serious, I'm sorry to say.
3706901	3710263	32 gigabyte SD cards will soon be usable in Wiis.
3710343	3715165	Actually, I think they already take the 32 gigabyte, or sorry, gigabyte, yeah, gigabyte cards, right?
3715526	3715726	Yes.
3715806	3716426	They take them now.
3716766	3717667	But here's the thing is that
3719491	3730397	Apparently, right now, if you want to use download content, you can store it on the card, but you have to copy it over to the actual Wii console every time you want to use it.
3730717	3732158	But not for much longer.
3732598	3744484	Apparently, pretty soon, you will be able to play your download content directly off of the SD cards, which will finally justify Nintendo's choice to not put a hard drive in these things.
3744544	3747726	Because as you can change out the cards and so on, that's kind of cool.
3748767	3758075	But apparently, there's a new IGN report saying that all the tricks used for both Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the past, leaving internal memory open, is gone.
3758455	3768063	Instead, straight up booting off the SD card is available, and that means easier downloads, larger expansions, and quicker loads when bringing in song data from the SD card into Guitar Hero 5.
3768443	3770565	And apparently that's the first game that's going to be able to use this.
3770585	3771726	And no support from Nintendo.
3772387	3773668	So they just figured this out on their own.
3776815	3777255	Interesting.
3779536	3785797	I'm curious to see if any other developers are going to use this other than companies that are just trying to mirror what they're doing on the 360 and the PS3.
3786057	3791538	It does piss me off, though, that they haven't done any download content other than, I guess, Animal Crossing.
3791598	3795599	But Animal Crossing, you don't really actually buy the download content, I don't think.
3795659	3798240	It's just kind of something that comes in the mail, just like you get used to.
3798960	3800561	It's probably already in the game anyways.
3800581	3801381	Yeah.
3802608	3808033	I'm kind of pissed off that they aren't actually doing any expansions and stuff for these new games that they're putting out.
3808453	3817160	And even still, let's support the MP3 stuff before on the SD cards, and then now with the newer games, oh, sorry, we're not going to do that anymore.
3817180	3819623	It's like, you're taking a step backwards, come on!
3822185	3829271	Well, at least I'm glad to hear that they're putting in that functionality that really should have been there from the get-go, but hey, better late than never, right?
3829291	3829371	Yep.
3830563	3836387	So, you know, but ironically enough, though, I haven't bought really a lot of virtual console games in a long, long time.
3837628	3848275	There's some stuff coming up later in the show that I find interesting, but as far as, you know, virtual console stuff, there really hasn't been a lot lately I've been interested in, except the Final Fantasy IV WiiWare game.
3848315	3852038	What about the WiiWare game that's that Nick's Quest...
3852694	3853215	I haven't heard of this.
3853255	3853575	What's that?
3853855	3854356	Nick's Quest.
3854416	3857039	It used to be called Icarian something or whatever.
3858061	3859382	It's like Kid Icarus, basically.
3859602	3859943	Oh, neat.
3860383	3861144	No, I hadn't heard of this.
3861445	3868293	They changed it because apparently Icarian Quest or whatever it was called is too close to Kid Icarus and Nintendo got pissed.
3868650	3871552	And of course the classic game of the week before we end Part A tonight.
3890148	3890668	EMI Warner Universal
3920849	3930419	Delilah, there's also Viva La Vida, some stuff from that album.
3931660	3938708	But the big thing, Rob, that should make you happy is if there's ABBA, you get four-part harmony.
3939489	3939809	Awesome.
3941383	3943483	Yeah, but I'm kind of done on the karaoke games.
3943523	3947284	I mean, is there really room in the marketplace right now for yet another karaoke game?
3947364	3951685	Well, I would play this one, though, because it wouldn't be me singing by myself.
3952605	3957286	I guess it's cool that, you know, because the Wii doesn't really have a lot of karaoke games that I know of.
3957326	3958006	I think there's some overseas.
3958026	3958426	Yeah, there is.
3958726	3960147	Like, they have a karaoke channel, right?
3960227	3964847	And then Konami's Karaoke Revolution game is out on Wii or is coming out.
3964867	3965748	Their new one's out on Wii.
3965968	3966848	They have American Idol.
3966868	3967348	It's on Wii.
3967990	3968350	Oh, do they?
3968550	3970252	Yeah, American Idol Encore.
3994298	3995780	Rock Band, Guitar Hero
4009861	4014464	Lips is... Which is too bad because it's by the guys who did Elite Beat Agents.
4014624	4016065	Yet they're still doing another one, though.
4016386	4016946	Are they really?
4017026	4017506	Yeah, remember?
4017606	4019368	Lips number one hits coming out this September.
4019388	4020408	That's right, I remember that.
4022610	4025111	I was under the impression that Singing Star was actually doing better than Lips.
4026132	4030815	Maybe that's just because Europe... Singing Star is the karaoke game in Europe.
4030915	4033337	It's very... I like Singing Star.
4033357	4034538	They have a lot of versions coming out.
4034983	4036684	You actually got me to play that.
4036784	4037364	SingStar's fun.
4037404	4038004	I like SingStar.
4038084	4039764	But I don't like singing.
4040245	4040845	Which is weird.
4041185	4047947	I wouldn't consider myself a rabid SingStar fan, but yet I have SingStar Volume 1, Volume 2, and ABBA all on PS3, and I want SingStar Queen.
4049007	4049988	I would get that.
4050608	4052628	We should do another SingStar party at your house.
4052648	4053209	I think it'd be fun.
4053369	4054029	SingStar party.
4054549	4054770	Okay.
4055431	4055972	I'll bring people.
4056092	4056753	We'll have to make that happen.
4056773	4057414	Maybe later today weekend.
4057434	4058976	I'll bring someone who's listening right now.
4059096	4061420	Since I'm not going to PAX, I'm thinking SingStar Party.
4061901	4062682	This might have to happen.
4062983	4064505	Let's have our own PAX.
4065667	4067790	We'll call it OLR.
4067810	4068411	TAMPAX.
4068772	4069573	We'll call it TAMPAX.
4070476	4074019	No, you need to... We'll call it Tampax.
4074059	4077142	Well, what time is... Or when's BlizzCon this year?
4077242	4078343	It's right before PAX, right?
4078403	4079985	This next weekend is BlizzCon.
4080145	4080405	Okay.
4080785	4081686	Yes.
4081926	4086370	Well, you could just become part of the second annual QQCon.
4086470	4087491	Ah, QQCon.
4087651	4088412	I like this idea.
4088892	4089333	That's right.
4089353	4090734	I remember QQCon last year.
4091074	4094417	But this year I'm not sad that I'm not going to BlizzCon because I'm over WoW now.
4094718	4097340	And WoW got spoiled anyway, so we're going to get to it a little bit later.
4097540	4098060	You know what?
4098341	4099121	It just occurred to me.
4099201	4110211	We could actually rent like an office room or something and have just systems set up and just do OLRCon.
4110471	4111472	First year OLRCon.
4112608	4113789	Just some little office.
4114009	4115269	That's how they start.
4116050	4116710	I guess that's true.
4116730	4117550	Airport Hilton.
4118751	4119611	Airport Hojo.
4120092	4129636	No, we used to do, actually, we used to have Ground Zero Con in Mobile and they held it at college in the student center.
4130176	4131157	I like Frisbee's idea.
4131257	4132517	Packs in the back's yard.
4135259	4135519	Nice.
4136158	4136678	We haven't had it.
4136798	4139219	We remember we used to do the old Baymani parties way back when.
4139239	4139599	Yeah.
4139779	4140880	That'd sort of be the same thing.
4140920	4143121	Just be gamer nerd syndrome party.
4143361	4144321	Nerd con or something.
4144341	4145322	Nerd con at my house.
4145362	4146082	Dude, I've got pinball.
4146422	4146862	We need to think.
4147102	4149764	I wonder how much it would cost her in a small space just for the day.
4150024	4150884	I will look into this.
4151544	4151944	You should.
4151984	4153805	You've got time off because of your hand right now.
4154145	4155886	You need to find us a place to have a con.
4156186	4157207	Quick poll of chat.
4158207	4159487	Who would come to OLR con?
4159848	4160468	Wire N.
4161341	4163683	Y or N, you would check out for OLRCon.
4163963	4169728	And your response must be either a Y or an N. Spelled out W-H-Y or E-N.
4170668	4172690	Because, like I said, I'm random today.
4174672	4174952	Alright.
4175792	4176713	We might have to make that happen.
4176753	4181337	Alright, anyhow, let's get to some release dates while we ponder the idea of an OLRCon.
4181357	4182718	We can host it at an Olive Garden.
4184178	4184739	They can cater.
4184839	4186140	Catered by Olive Garden.
4186260	4188182	OLRCon catered by Olive Garden.
4189443	4189743	You know what?
4189823	4190203	Fuck that.
4190524	4191745	I cook better than Olive Garden.
4191765	4192605	I will cook.
4192625	4192946	At the mall.
4208837	4218623	with the one room you know the one room that they have that's you know just they had like movies playing in a closed down McDonald's they had this yeah I'm just
4219119	4219800	I remember that.
4221461	4231787	That was the strangest anime con I'd ever seen in my life, was the one that was at the mall, where the closed stores served as screening rooms and stuff, and then you'd just see random people in costumes throughout the mall.
4231847	4233889	Meanwhile, there's people trying to go to Macy's.
4233929	4236050	It's just so strange.
4236591	4239072	It's the most awkward thing I've ever seen in my life.
4241745	4242806	All right, anyhow.
4243566	4246008	Anyways, this week, not a whole lot coming out.
4246208	4250350	There are some pretty good games, but it's still kind of that slow part of the summer.
4251491	4255273	This week on DS, Core, a game from Graffiti.
4255293	4256313	It's a first-person shooter.
4256634	4259435	It's been delayed forever, but finally making its way out.
4260216	4263397	Still Life 2 on PC is coming out this week as well.
4264998	4267520	My friends on DS...
4269233	4274117	War Leaders, Clash of Nations Sudoku Ball Detective My Makeup, a game for girls where you do makeup
4296099	4306898	Delta Force Extreme 2 as well as Plants vs. Zombies, the packaged version is making its way out this week as well.
4307938	4313461	Wolfenstein on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 coming out this week.
4314302	4321666	Spectrobes Origins, a pretty good role-playing game from Disney Interactive making its way out to the Wii this week.
4322286	4327689	My Dress Up also goes with the My Makeup thing and also for girls.
4328349	4334773	ATV Quad Kings from Zoo Games and that's the most generic ATV off-road racing game I've ever seen.
4337216	4341097	Joint Operations Combined Arms coming out on PC this week.
4342578	4343879	And that is it.
4347260	4350582	Let me move on to Japan and Japanese release dates.
4350602	4354324	I was actually going to make a comment about the mind makeup thing.
4354384	4356985	It could also be for the occasional cross-dresser.
4358365	4358806	I guess.
4360006	4363688	Don't say something is just for girls because some boys might be into that.
4364335	4366056	My character in Ion looks like a drag queen.
4366436	4368017	Your character in Ion has a fan.
4368077	4368777	She has a fan.
4369018	4369998	How amazing is that?
4370138	4374600	I do have to mention this, though, because I think it is on Steam, but it's an awesome name for a game.
4375001	4375201	What?
4375541	4379003	Pizza Morgana, the monsters and manipulations in the magical forest.
4379703	4381384	Pizza Morgana.
4382385	4383545	It's an adventure game.
4383945	4384846	That's kind of a gothic...
4386257	4387298	Hot Topic looking type thing
4402145	4402745	Thank you for watching!
4421576	4427620	Alright, L2, Love Cross Loop is also a game coming out of Japan on the PlayStation 2 this week.
4428341	4432464	On the Nintendo DS, Live Battle Card is the only new release this week.
4432504	4434665	It's a very slow release week over in Japan.
4434705	4435426	I don't know what gives.
4436287	4444833	There is on the Sony PSP, Heart no Kune no Alice comes out, as well as Ukame Kakushi comes out from Konami this week.
4444853	4448815	I'm trying to see what kind of game this is, but it doesn't look like any of their series...
4449696	4453838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4480600	4498876	for our buddies in the UK actually we've got a number of releases if you've been able to ignore Madden that game has touched my life because Dan had to go for me in that opening anyway let's move on on the 19th we have Shadow Complex on Xbox 360 did you make a yay?
4500828	4502969	Oh, the cat's hanging around.
4504089	4505350	She's about to be dinner in a moment.
4506410	4509232	On the 20th, Tales of Monkey Island, The Siege of Spinner City.
4510032	4516155	And the 21st, DJ Star and Raven Squad, Supercar Challenge, and then Wolfenstein.
4516175	4518717	Oh, it's Wolfenstein.
4518737	4521058	Anyway, that's it.
4522344	4526129	Alright, well there's a new patent submitted by Sony.
4526710	4529073	Apparently it's a device or...
4530774	4538000	A program to interpret whether you... Or different emotions that you are feeling while playing, I guess, the PS3.
4539302	4553134	One example that they show is laughter, which apparently they have this really weird-looking guy laughing at a video of somebody kicking themselves in the ass with a machine that they're powering with their own hands.
4553294	4554355	Will it sense boredom?
4555036	4555296	Yes.
4556397	4556937	Well, apparently...
4558693	4559654	They make that joke too.
4560514	4568218	Actually, they're saying that not necessarily sure what it would do, but it would be able to sense laughter as well as other emotions.
4568918	4572000	Sadness, excitement, anger, joy, interest, and boredom.
4572880	4576842	They say perhaps if the game detects boredom, it could increase the number of enemies on screen.
4576882	4579343	If it detects anger, the difficulty can go down.
4579383	4586327	And finally, if it detects sadness and their punchline to the joke, it will tell you just to stop playing Lair.
4586967	4587027	Um...
4588573	4599359	I'm wondering though if it's going to detect me laughing when they make an announcement about some new PS3 system or something like that that's going to be more expensive than the previous one, just like the PSP Go, because that would be hilarious.
4599859	4601740	It's like, ah, you think I'm going to buy that?
4601860	4602121	Nope.
4603922	4608204	You know, this peripheral should go with the Nintendo one.
4608244	4616028	They needed to combine their forces so that it can sense me giggling when I'm riding the inflatable Wii Sack, or whatever it's called.
4616388	4617189	The Wii Sack.
4618129	4618810	I like that.
4620571	4621352	That'll be the name.
4621872	4624794	Alright, then it's called the Wii Sack until we get a real name for it.
4626696	4635583	That seems kind of a dumb technology because all I had to do was act angry or something like, Grrr, I'm angry!
4636263	4637724	And the game gets easier.
4639466	4639826	I don't know.
4641252	4643996	What if it doesn't tell you that this is in the game?
4644537	4647762	People will find out.
4647822	4649444	They have ways of finding out.
4652209	4654692	It's probably something that they're not really going to use, but they want to...
4657017	4660720	A case PS3 wants to do a Milo, you know, or something like that.
4660860	4664462	They can detect laughter and all whatnot.
4664782	4667604	Something so they have the technology before Microsoft does, maybe?
4667704	4671226	Yeah, something so they can say, hey, we patented that, we sue you now.
4672347	4672607	Hmm.
4675169	4675770	Well, I don't know, I...
4677428	4681872	It could be interesting, but I really would have to see the application of how this is used.
4682313	4687398	Like, I'm into this a lot more than I am the Wii Sack, but this is...
4688750	4691092	It could be hokey, it could be kind of neat.
4691152	4701479	I like the idea of a game because you all know those people that get so angry when they're playing the games, not that there's anyone in this room like that, Loki, that they're throwing controllers on the ground and trying to break things.
4702340	4706043	I never throw controllers because controllers are expensive and there's no reason to get pissed off at the controllers.
4706063	4706903	But you get angry.
4707084	4708645	You do get very angry when playing games.
4709005	4709185	No.
4709305	4710046	Come on!
4710826	4711647	I've heard you do that.
4711787	4712488	Oh, okay, okay.
4712548	4721275	If I'm playing Grand Theft Auto or something like that, and the game glitches out on me or something like that, like, you know, I fire six sniper rounds.
4721295	4722596	The game's retarded!
4722616	4730603	If I fire six sniper rounds into the back of someone's head, and then they're like, oh, hey, someone's shooting at me, and they turn around and fire a pistol and kill me.
4731043	4732504	It's like, come on!
4732544	4736207	My favorite is when Loki will go, and then the game's like, I don't know what I'm doing!
4737889	4739430	Exactly, because it's retarded.
4742694	4751579	My favorite is when Loki impersonates the game I do that to people too It's fun all around
4752623	4756164	Alright, something that is going to be impersonated all over again.
4756704	4762546	Blizzard, for WoW's 5th anniversary, Onyxia is making a return, y'all.
4762926	4770089	Onyxia was a level 60 raid, of course, in old school Warcraft, where 40 of you would fight the dragon Onyxia once.
4770129	4776571	And now it's kind of a bit of a joke, like people will go run the Onyxia thing, because you can totally solo Onyxia now, or at least duo it.
4778772	4779392	and DarkSakura.com
4808621	4809662	and DarkSakura.com
4824718	4830821	Also, there's going to be a 310% speed flying mount modeled after Onyxia that's going to be a rare drop.
4831281	4833062	So that'll be something a lot of folks are after.
4833322	4839625	Hopefully it's not glitched out like the dragon was at one time during Final Fantasy XI where you couldn't kill the dragon.
4841526	4842787	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
4843027	4845468	I was after we were playing, but yeah, I remember hearing about that.
4845568	4846669	No, no, it was while we were playing.
4847728	4850612	Cataclysm is supposedly the name of the new WoW expansion.
4850632	4852674	I don't even know if the name's been confirmed yet.
4852734	4853816	It's a registered trademark from them, though.
4866231	4872835	Alright, well anyway, so despite the name possibly getting out, apparently some of the information about the game has leaked out too.
4873636	4882161	You will be able to go to 85 in this new game, I'm sorry, new expansion, which is different because usually WoW has been doing the 10 level increments.
4882201	4886164	Burning Crusade lets you go to 10, I'm sorry, lets you go to 70, which was 10 up from 60.
4887224	4889065	Wrath of the Lich King lets you go up to...
4890066	4890827	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4905217	4906858	I don't know how they're going to do that.
4924548	4926490	Also some new races are rumored for the game.
4926710	4930754	Worgen will be the new alliance class and Goblins will be the new horde class.
4931375	4936060	And the other interesting thing is that some new job race combinations are opening up.
4936100	4940104	For instance, now you can be a Tauren Paladin or Troll Druid.
4940224	4943307	That's a big one because Druids you had to be Tauren or Night Elf to be.
4943687	4950010	But apparently now trolls can be druids too, and assumably worgens, since nothing else on the Alliance side opened up for druids.
4950471	4951731	So, interesting.
4952412	4956734	You'll be able to fly in some parts of Old World now too, which was a thing that was being requested.
4957414	4964037	I don't know though, for me, honestly, as somebody who recently left WoW, this isn't really cool enough sounding for me to want to go back.
4964278	4964978	I have to be honest.
4965478	4970561	Like, I'm like, the improvements sound neat and sound needed, but I'm not seeing anything where I'm like, oh damn.
4971972	4972753	I'm sure there's, I don't know
4986431	4987071	It'd be interesting.
4987191	4988452	It could all be speculation too.
4988852	4993434	It could be like one of those culmination of all the rumors that are on there and then just put it out all at once.
4993914	4998796	Because I've seen the rumor about the new name of the expansion because of the registered trademark.
4999256	5004678	The rumor of the new classes based on the Halloween masks that appeared or whatever.
5006819	5008019	And some other crap.
5008039	5009960	I don't know.
5011441	5012781	We'll find out next week I guess.
5013081	5013882	I mean seriously.
5014744	5015365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5043228	5046532	So DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week?
5046753	5048475	I'm going for another series this time, Rob.
5048975	5049997	How dare you?
5050878	5051258	Alright.
5051919	5053641	Sorry, I can't get the music volume down.
5053982	5054382	There we go.
5055283	5056205	Raiden, you say?
5056445	5056725	Yes.
5056925	5058748	Alright, let's cue up some music from Raiden here.
5059113	5064575	Okay, well, basically, yeah, this one goes through the whole PlayStation screen launch-up thing, sorry.
5065115	5070937	But basically, for anyone who doesn't know, Raiden is a scrolling shooter.
5071157	5080880	It's put out by Seibu Kaihatsu, and it was in the arcades, and I think we got it by Fabtech over here in the States.
5082600	5088582	Also, it's supposed to be kind of hard to emulate because of the way that they changed the game boards for them.
5089342	5095668	But, um, it came out on PlayStation as the Raiden Project.
5096148	5097750	Well, at least Raiden 1 and 2 did.
5098991	5102975	And then we got, it came out on Amiga, Atari Jaguar, TurboGrafx.
5105211	5107792	It came out on the Duo as a Super Raiden.
5108272	5113394	Atari Link, Super Nintendo came out for PC, Genesis, and there's actually a mobile phone version too.
5116555	5125457	Seibu Kaihatsu did all of the ones that came out until 98, and then Moss Limited did the games that came out since 2005.
5126017	5133900	And the games since 2005 also came out on the Taito Type-X boards, which were supposed to be... They were pretty hard to duplicate the emulation for.
5135166	5141192	Um, so anyway, the world was taken over by aliens, and the world says, screw you aliens, and fights back.
5141392	5141973	That's the story.
5143214	5150001	Um, so you also had, um, uh, you could play one player or have two players and play together.
5150101	5155547	You also had a variety of different weapons, um, you know, that you would get through different power-ups.
5155607	5158670	My favorite being the little electric thingy weapon.
5159350	5172781	which, in fact, is on the screen right now in the example we're showing, where you would fire this continuous stream of energy that would lock on to certain enemies and then wrap around them and, you know, pull towards them.
5172801	5179306	It's kind of like how, um, you know those electric globe things where you put your hand on and all the energy goes to where your hand is?
5179326	5180507	It's the same thing.
5180527	5181628	That's my favorite weapon in the game.
5182288	5189193	Um, and, uh, the games that came out in the series were Raiden, Raiden 2, Raiden DX, Raiden 3, and Raiden 4.
5189273	5192234	Raiden DX, of those, is probably my favorite.
5193235	5197037	Um, there were also spin-off games that were, um...
5198478	5205865	And I'm sure, actually we talked about them recently when I was going over my gaming week.
5206266	5211090	It was Viper Phase 1, Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet.
5211811	5215635	So, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big series of games.
5216135	5216315	And...
5218457	5222420	It's actually probably one of my favorite shooters to this date.
5222520	5232627	It's also, it can get pretty hard because you get a lot of bullets and a lot of enemies on the screen and they're big and it's just a lot of fun.
5232647	5234268	Definitely a lot of fun.
5235068	5235949	Plus the music's great.
5238150	5239191	I'll turn it up here a little bit.
5250471	5253553	I think the clip that I gave you is actually from Riding Project.
5255295	5256656	I have a story about Riding Project.
5256956	5257316	What's that?
5257937	5262681	I remember being completely intoxicated on Everclear and beating this game.
5263381	5263662	Nice.
5265944	5268826	That was the same night that I ended up having so much Everclear I hallucinated.
5270367	5271488	I was 19.
5272189	5272929	No, I take that back.
5272969	5273150	I was 20.
5273390	5274551	You say that proudly.
5275211	5275772	Yeah, I was 20.
5276912	5278013	Alright, well there you have it, folks.
5278033	5279555	Your classic game of the week.
5280175	5280596	Raiden.
5280856	5281817	The whole dang series.
5282357	5283719	Because DarkSakura said the series.
5283979	5284640	So that's what you get.
5285916	5287377	All right, well, thank you very much, DarkSakura.
5287417	5289459	We'll look forward to see what you pick for us next week.
5289820	5294644	But in the meantime, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, a chance for us to stretch, get water, and so forth.
5294705	5296626	But we have plenty more show to come.
5297227	5301231	When we come back from a break, Twitter topics, something new we're trying tonight.
5301531	5305795	We've been trying to incorporate Twitter into the show for a long time now, so we're going to do some Twitter topics when we come back.
5306196	5308858	Rapid-fire news and some more discussions, including...
5309779	5314222	Silent Hill, a chance for you to go visit like real Silent Hill.
5314322	5317003	Not really, but as close as it's going to get.
5317303	5319265	We're going to talk about that and it sounds kind of cool.
5319605	5322607	So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5322647	5323227	So stay tuned.
5329264	5339491	And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 16th of 2009, where we are taping live our, what, 334th episode of Orange Lounge Radio?
5342173	5344074	Slightly more than half evil.
5344254	5347536	Yes, it just keeps on going and no signs of quitting anytime soon.
5348777	5352479	We're coming back this segment and going to get into some Twitter topics here shortly.
5353039	5357561	And if you wanted to submit a topic, you could do that earlier by joining our Twitter.
5357741	5358462	You can't send it now.
5358502	5360743	It's too late because we already have picked what we want to talk about tonight.
5361183	5365866	But if you want to do that for future weeks, you can send those to us at OLR on Twitter.
5365886	5368127	And if you're not following us on Twitter yet, why not?
5370558	5398750	I want to mention one game I didn't mention during my gaming week because it wasn't really my gaming week and not a game I've been playing but a game that my roommate has been playing non-stop like just been obsessed with and playing it like I think he's racked up like 15-16 hours just this week alone it's an iPhone game believe it or not and the iPhone game is called Zenonia is the name of the game Z-E-N-O-N-I-A and it's a game I probably need to look at and check out I guess there's a free demo available out there but if you want to play more than
5399190	5400851	A certain amount of time, you have to pay money for it.
5401192	5407516	But I guess it's like a... The best way I could describe it from what I saw, it's like a Secret of Mana-style game, is what it looked like.
5407576	5412560	Kind of like the role-playing game, but more of the action style, like Secret of Mana is.
5413080	5417343	And with kind of the multiple quests going on at once, like WoW has.
5417683	5419605	And I guess you can be good or evil in the game.
5419885	5421626	John was trying to tell me a little bit about the game.
5422026	5426750	I thought it was interesting enough to give a mention here on the show, because, you know, iPhones...
5427350	5427730	I played Peggle.
5451991	5452593	Did you play Peggle?
5452633	5452894	Yeah.
5452975	5453978	Good times on the iPhone.
5455022	5455785	It's not bad on the iPhone.
5455805	5456768	It's the only version of it I have.
5457149	5457591	Good stuff.
5458578	5460099	Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics.
5460399	5464000	Earlier on Twitter we asked you guys to tell us some things you wanted us to talk about tonight.
5464400	5469362	Deathwishing says, StarCraft 2 petition has over 100k signatures for LAN support.
5469422	5470122	Discuss that.
5470663	5475084	Remember we were kind of talking about that, was this the one where we said people need to kind of get over it?
5475244	5476985	I don't think it was this actually though, was it?
5477005	5477725	I think it was something else.
5478226	5480947	I would think, you know, because LAN's a big part of StarCraft.
5480967	5485048	I know, hell, they have like tournaments and it's really huge over in, you know,
5489311	5504542	I don't know why they would... I mean, I think the reason why they want to take out LAN because, one, piracy, because they want all their online play or all the multiplayer to go through their... I want to say it was Battle.net or whatever.
5504562	5505123	Yeah, Battle.net.
5505163	5505503	Battle.net.
5508343	5510965	Yeah, I always kind of thought it was for statistical purposes.
5511025	5516390	You know, they want to log every game that's played by folks and, you know, kind of keep track of statistics and so forth.
5516410	5519533	But, yeah, piracy is kind of a nice little bonus to that.
5519553	5531943	I mean, it makes sense because you're making these people buy three different versions of the same damn game because you're just saying, oh, well, you know, the campaigns are separate.
5532043	5536247	You know, when any other, you know, RTS game out there, you know, Command & Conquer...
5536747	5537388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5556923	5557724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5582322	5585923	Actdeft in chat says, online petitions never work for a few exceptions.
5586443	5588084	And that's kind of true too.
5588464	5592225	If you really want to make a statement, guys, put your money where your mouth is.
5592565	5593906	Don't buy the game when it comes out.
5594206	5599948	Because if there's 100,000 people that dent in their first week sales of the game, that'll be heard loud and clear.
5600948	5603769	But this online petition, that can be swept under the rug.
5604109	5605989	At the end of the day, do you still buy the game?
5606290	5607210	If yes, then...
5608554	5610295	They had no reason to put it back in, did they?
5610315	5614656	You need to send physical mail instead of just a petition signing.
5614796	5623018	You send a letter because 100,000 letters look a lot better than 100,000 emails and definitely a lot better than 100,000 signatures.
5624179	5624599	Or do both.
5624959	5625419	Do all three.
5627781	5634745	Surtur on Twitter says, Please discuss the PS3 Slim.
5635065	5636926	I'd like to get a PS3, but they're too expensive.
5637006	5639268	I assume the Slim will be cheaper or there'll be a price cut.
5639728	5641329	What is this Slim that you're talking about?
5641369	5642209	There's no Slim.
5642249	5642970	They've denied it.
5643737	5644898	Deny, deny, deny.
5645199	5648302	You know what's interesting though, Sir Truer, if I'm saying your name right?
5649284	5655391	Just because, we've made that assumption before, that just because they are remaking the system means it's going to be cheaper.
5655791	5656292	Not true.
5656852	5657413	Look at the PSP.
5657593	5658434	It's not going to be cheaper.
5658655	5660016	I guarantee it's not going to be cheaper.
5660036	5660857	You don't think it's going to be cheaper?
5660897	5661658	It's not going to be cheaper.
5661858	5662239	Interesting.
5662259	5663841	Because this is their M.O.
5664201	5664702	Thanks for watching!
5677682	5686450	I would hope that they would drop the price of the system because I think it's something that would be in their best interest because their sales are hurting and they're definitely not getting better anytime soon.
5686790	5697339	And yeah, the slim PS3 might be appealing to some people because, hey, it's new, it looks different, it's nicer looking, we're assuming, and whatnot.
5697399	5699521	Maybe some backwards compatibilities added in?
5700302	5703264	I think that's kind of wishful thinking there, but we'll have to see.
5704185	5708188	Now, they're going to announce it next week, I'm sure, at Gamescom.
5708408	5709108	It's going to happen.
5709368	5712811	I mean, that's the rumors right now, and they're definitely prepping for it.
5713251	5721716	And between the birds and you guys, I guess, it's definitely happening.
5721856	5725679	I mean, it's just a matter of time whenever they decide to announce it.
5726379	5727780	Gripper01 in chat says, Was it?
5732242	5733823	I think I remember a comment earlier, though.
5733863	5736264	He's overseas, so maybe it could be different from region to region.
5736284	5737945	I don't think it was more expensive.
5737985	5740666	I think it was probably the same price, if not cheaper.
5741367	5746329	But, hey, that seems to be the trend nowadays.
5746489	5748931	Let's release a new system with less features for more money.
5749151	5751472	And Frisbee says, this tiny enemy crab...
5754369	5754789	I like that.
5755370	5755630	Funny.
5781752	5785894	Dr. Noir says free tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour and then gives us a link to an article that talks about new Guitar Hero World Tour tracks that are coming out.
5785914	5787775	Apparently there's an Activision track pack that came out.
5787795	5788236	Apparently it is...
5807406	5820331	folks that work for Activision they're bands so you get these bands Awaken, H is Orange and 100 Reasons and these songs that hey they're free it's very hard to complain about free things but
5821559	5823940	I would probably... I don't own Guitar Hero World Tour.
5824080	5826221	I would probably get to Guitar Hero 5, though.
5826261	5833223	Free tracks are good, I mean... It's hard to complain about free tracks, but honestly, very rarely would I probably play them.
5833503	5836584	I mean, I look at the rock band tracks, very few of those do I play.
5836864	5844147	But at the same time, there's one or two that I do enjoy, and considering they were free, you know, and I had to sift through 20 to find one or two that I like...
5844927	5846129	It's still free.
5847510	5848692	It's very hard to complain about free things.
5848712	5849673	You can download it, and guess what?
5849773	5851455	If you don't like it, you can always delete it later.
5851595	5852016	Yes, you can.
5852536	5852797	It's free.
5853450	5854631	So when do those come out?
5854691	5856251	Those are coming out this week?
5856411	5856851	Yeah, today.
5857072	5858272	Or they just came out this past week.
5858992	5862994	So check that out in the Guitar Hero World Tour store right now.
5864395	5869497	If you want to send us a topic to talk about on Twitter, we'll open up Twitter topics next week just a little bit before the show.
5869897	5875239	But probably if we already are covering your topic somewhere else in the show, sadly you probably didn't make it tonight.
5875279	5876420	But always try again next week.
5876980	5878081	Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero Van Halen Free
5894963	5896845	Thanks for watching!
5912899	5921842	But, um, using those codes, you enter them in online to prove that you've purchased the game, and then you can get your free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen.
5922202	5929305	Not only will you get it free, you will get it weeks early, because it takes six weeks to ship to you, and the game doesn't come out until December 22nd.
5931085	5936407	Which, I gotta imagine their sales on that game are gonna be crap, unless they're gonna count the free copies of the sale.
5937087	5939148	I am totally surprised and shocked by this news.
5940268	5940869	I am shocked.
5941349	5941469	It's...
5943191	5945132	It's like a hypothetical situation come true.
5945212	5946012	It's just so weird.
5947752	5948172	There you go.
5950073	5951393	Some other interesting stuff.
5951533	5957475	Also rumors, of course, that the Elite is going to be getting a price cut at the end of this month.
5957815	5962756	And apparently this is coming from a leak of a Myers catalog.
5963676	5965057	Good, because I know someone who needs a new 360.
5965097	5968977	It's a catalog that's going to be hitting stands.
5971338	5975642	On August 30th, it shows that the Elite model has a new price of $2.99.
5977084	5988114	And, of course, that kind of goes along with the whole rumor that the Pro system is going away because on the new arcades, the box art only shows the arcade and Elite systems.
5988514	5990716	No Pro system to be found at all.
5990856	5996361	So the rumor is that that SKU is going away and is being replaced by the Elite system for...
5997882	6004084	299, makes sense to me, probably will happen, might even get announced next week, so wouldn't be a big surprise.
6005085	6019850	And then, last but not least, there is another rumor that white and pink DSIs are coming to America, and apparently these were found in a Toys R Us database, listing both color schemes.
6022023	6024284	I don't know, that sounds totally false to me.
6024384	6025945	I don't believe that that's ever going to happen.
6026426	6027586	Especially not in September.
6030968	6031329	Okay.
6032569	6032850	Fine.
6034270	6036352	Some rapid fire news I've got for you guys.
6036412	6041075	Hey DDR fans, there's finally a point to those USB slots in the DDRX machines.
6041735	6045697	That's right, Konami this week opened up the new DDR Edit website.
6045757	6047839	It's ddredit.konamionline.com
6048639	6050200	I miss the days of edit mode and doing hell edits.
6072902	6073502	I miss that too.
6073902	6078384	We would actually get the Japanese games that you could edit the songs and take them into the arcade because it all matched up.
6078564	6078804	Yeah.
6078844	6079424	Fun times.
6079664	6084466	Or we'd hack them to add freeze arrows to songs that didn't have freeze arrows.
6084486	6085146	That's right.
6085166	6085786	I remember that.
6085806	6086506	Yeah, fun times.
6086546	6087006	Fun times.
6087646	6089747	I remember you giving away the boxes of movies.
6090487	6090787	That's right.
6090807	6091828	It was make, edit, get porn.
6091928	6092208	Yes.
6092388	6092808	Good times.
6093428	6093888	Epic times.
6093908	6095469	Whatever happened to that kid that won, Dave?
6095489	6095909	Remember him?
6096493	6097054	Whatever happened to him?
6097134	6098035	He became a man that day.
6098135	6098335	Did he?
6100517	6106143	Well, I got the box full of anime and stuff that one time, which eventually went to Dimple.
6106763	6106983	Funny.
6107864	6113810	Hey, live at QuakeCon 2009 has been spotted some new games on Xbox Live Arcade.
6113850	6116213	Doom 2 has been spotted out there on the show floor, apparently.
6116893	6117054	And...
6117634	6137255	Quake Live, both for Xbox 360's Arcade were both apparently out there on a floor on the floor I guess, let me actually clarify I guess only Doom 2 was out there actually playable on the floor but somebody actually had like a shirt that said Quake Arena Arcade or what have you and they've got some pictures and so forth Lies!
6137335	6138196	They're all lies!
6139017	6140118	I don't believe it one second
6142426	6145149	I don't know, I just had to be the counterpoint to that.
6145189	6149993	There's somebody, there's like a picture of somebody playing Doom 2 on Xbox with an Xbox controller.
6150033	6151634	It's photoshopped, it's live.
6151654	6152055	Shut up.
6153733	6158297	Lastly from me tonight, there's a brand new game coming out for an old system.
6158337	6159078	And the old system?
6159478	6160659	The Atari Lynx.
6160980	6161140	What?
6161160	6161540	That's right.
6161960	6162541	I have one of those.
6162561	6165884	There's a new game called Zaku coming out for the Atari Lynx.
6166244	6172469	Yes, it is named after one of OLR's infamous callers is getting his own game on the Atari Lynx.
6172710	6173330	I'm getting this.
6173390	6177794	It's the same people that brought you, do you remember Beggar Prince that came out on the Genesis in 2006?
6177834	6177974	Right.
6179468	6206534	The Legend of Wukong also now those are actually like localized games from Taiwan that I guess just came out or whatever but this is something I guess that was built on the development kit for the Atari Lynx on an Amiga of all things and is actually coming out and supposedly has pretty kick butt graphics for a Lynx that is it's too bad they're not bringing it out in other systems because I don't know I don't have a Lynx simulator I have a Lynx but I just don't are they actually doing a cartridge for it?
6206994	6208655	that's what the plan is it looks like
6209606	6211127	I think I might have to pick this up.
6211988	6215131	They did one for Baker Prince, I know, and they charged a lot of money for it.
6215231	6216732	This looks like a lot of fun.
6216912	6218293	Those carts were expensive.
6218573	6219914	Well, here's an idea of what it's all about.
6219954	6230863	It's a horizontal shooter, and it is a hero who dons her rocket shoes and power gloves and sets off on a journey to retrieve stolen development tools being used to flood the market with bad games.
6232633	6234074	I'm actually signing up for the mailing list right now.
6259101	6261163	11.99 euro, 14.99 pound.
6261183	6262825	It has a free trial.
6263986	6270633	And also are getting Call of Juarez Bound in Blood demo and more content for Red Faction Guerrilla.
6271634	6281324	Also, Rock Band Unplugged is getting some Iron Maiden songs, The Trooper and Number of the Beast for 99 pounds a pop.
6282284	6309670	so that's pretty good and also there's stuff for NHL 10 and LittleBigPlanet blah blah blah oh and one last thing for that one, Fat Princess is getting a connectivity patch moving forward Tecmo is getting a few games on the virtual console Ninja Gaiden and Rygar are to be coming out also
6312003	6317688	I think they were talking about... Tecmo Bowl already did come out.
6317788	6324073	I really like Ninja Gaiden, but also Solomon's Key is being added to that too.
6325394	6327295	I like the old school arcade Rygar.
6327315	6328116	That was an awesome game.
6329449	6337171	Also, this makes me a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very infinity happy girl is Loom.
6337411	6339612	There's news about Loom.
6339672	6351755	Telltale is talking about considering doing another Loom game, which I will be all over happy, happy, happy if that actually happens.
6352755	6355016	It was actually said that...
6358498	6367322	That the game itself was about two and a half hours long and that they're trying to do two and a half hour long games and Loom fits quite well with that little strategy.
6368523	6369003	I like Loom.
6370744	6371224	I have Loom.
6371484	6372384	I should actually start playing it.
6372584	6373205	Loom is cool.
6373865	6375065	I'd be down with a Loom remake.
6376186	6378187	There's definitely a lot of nostalgia behind that.
6379397	6380198	If, and this is the big ifs,
6409182	6415564	If they beat out Madden 10 in this month in MPD sales.
6415864	6416224	Ha!
6416724	6419485	So the offer only applies to sales in August.
6419805	6422266	The MPD figures will be used to calculate the totals.
6422626	6425827	You have to follow the guy on Twitter.
6426627	6428628	In case you really wanted to do that.
6428728	6434389	His name is M-A-N-V-E-E-R-H-E-I-R is his Twitter name.
6435169	6436970	And limit one copy per person.
6439517	6440020	I'll see you next time.
6444102	6444282	Madden 10
6470340	6470440	What?
6470460	6470540	What?
6497437	6499098	You just extended the Tingle bet?
6499118	6500218	No, no, no, no.
6500458	6502319	It's a different bet.
6502379	6503000	Hold on, hold on.
6503020	6504280	Hit record, everybody.
6504360	6504900	Hit record.
6505260	6505601	Here we go.
6505961	6506941	It's a different bet altogether.
6507221	6511023	Not only will he give you free copies of Wolfenstein, I'll dress up like Tingle playing Madden.
6512283	6513244	Or Wolfenstein, I guess.
6513484	6514624	That would be appropriate.
6514985	6517265	But it's never gonna happen.
6517846	6518246	Never.
6518326	6520687	Tingle with a gun speaking German.
6522075	6525777	I just want to clarify the terms of the bet, just in case, because you never know what might happen.
6526517	6533820	So if Wolfenstein, the new Wolfenstein, should outsell Madden in the first month of release, you will dress up as Tingle here on the show.
6534060	6538161	If this gentleman has to reimburse all his customers, you too will dress up like Tingle here on the show.
6539022	6541803	But you will not set fire and Bobby Black will fire Tingle.
6541923	6542883	No, that's just... No, that's gone.
6542903	6544784	That's my judgment, because... Okay.
6545324	6546945	But instead, you will play...
6548545	6552888	Yes, and this isn't like we're adding the numbers of Wolfenstein to the million.
6553028	6554609	No, that is not going to happen.
6554649	6558270	Completely different bet, and you all wanted something to come back.
6558330	6562853	You all wanted something where Loki would be willing to dress up as Tingle again, so here it is.
6563013	6563953	It's not going to happen.
6564033	6566435	I only make bets that I'm confident in that I'm going to win.
6567515	6568335	I mean, come on.
6568836	6569156	Really?
6569356	6570717	Something's going to outsell Madden?
6571597	6574619	I know from selling Madden that that's not going to fucking happen, so...
6575695	6578496	But hey, let's hope for the wishful thinking there.
6579796	6585577	Hey, and the guys behind Wolfenstein, thank you, because you just upped their sales by, you know, how many people listen to the show?
6585617	6586077	Oh yeah, two.
6589718	6591899	I mean, anyone who's seen mine knows that there's no way.
6592279	6592859	It's just like him.
6592919	6595860	He knows there's no way that's going to happen, but hey, it makes him look nice.
6597180	6598040	So there you go.
6598260	6598920	You're just nice.
6599421	6600721	You're offering the tingle thing again.
6601835	6605257	One of these days, man, you know, someday this show is going to have to end.
6605337	6605878	Someday.
6606518	6610180	And I hope before it's over we get you in a Tingle costume one way or another.
6610240	6610380	Nope.
6610600	6611281	Never going to happen.
6611841	6612502	Had to lose a bet.
6612942	6616784	And unfortunately, I have judgments not selling.
6617745	6618045	All right.
6618165	6618485	Anyhow.
6618805	6619726	Or being made anymore.
6621061	6622222	Let's move on to something else.
6622262	6624505	Hey, maybe Loki could dress up as this.
6624545	6625766	This is a little more manly.
6625826	6628228	He could dress up as Pyramid Head or something out of Silent Hill.
6629069	6632853	Hey, Silent Hill, actually we'll have a lot of people dressing up in the name of Silent Hill.
6633334	6640982	Apparently there's going to be an actual Silent Hill haunted house, or as they're calling it, a haunted attraction coming to South...
6641462	6642243	SILENTHILL HAUNTED HOUSE
6671024	6672205	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6700396	6701857	We would make Silent Hill music.
6702618	6703820	Yeah, there's two mazes.
6704741	6706022	And the other one's called Fear.
6707003	6708065	This looks scary, Jamie.
6708145	6708966	Are you sure you want to go?
6709486	6710387	I'll do Silent Hill.
6711689	6712390	Single admission, $13.
6712430	6713170	We are doing this.
6717332	6720054	Sorry for the Silent Hill music, but it gives you a little ambiance there.
6721314	6725356	That would be fun, actually, to go down there and go to the haunted house and go to Disneyland.
6725596	6726477	I think we might have to make that happen.
6726497	6727897	They had a Saw attraction one time.
6728318	6729438	Yeah, that was a year ago, right?
6729658	6729898	Yeah.
6730038	6731499	Yeah, but I'm not into Saw.
6731519	6732860	You already know how I feel about Saw.
6733020	6733620	Torture porn.
6733820	6734641	Silent Hill, cool.
6734821	6735441	Saw, torture porn.
6735461	6737422	Saw is too hard to figure out what's going on nowadays.
6737842	6740043	It's like trying to figure out what was going on in Crank.
6740143	6740563	It's a twist!
6742506	6745428	TigerClaw says if you guys go, you'll need to record it on video.
6745488	6746008	They won't let you.
6746028	6747709	They probably won't let us in there with a video camera.
6747729	6749209	Plus, I don't need me... Hat cam!
6749430	6755353	I don't need me screaming like a girl out there on YouTube because Jamie will be able to testify to this after.
6755373	6756193	Maybe she already can.
6756213	6756533	I don't know.
6756833	6761035	But I will scream like a girl in this attraction the minute I see something that is scary.
6761055	6762576	You want to know how I won't be scared?
6762996	6764177	How you can tell if I won't be scared?
6764277	6764477	Huh.
6764617	6765858	Because I won't be saying anything.
6766358	6769460	You've been in scary situations with me and you know what I do.
6769480	6769540	Yes.
6770180	6772042	I shut up and I'm really quiet.
6772122	6774645	I will scream obscenities even if there are children around.
6775606	6778009	My voice will get even higher than it's ever gotten on the radio.
6778289	6778749	Yes, it will.
6779550	6781232	You've seen me on rides.
6781352	6787439	You should just put a mic or turn on your phone to record just the audio because that would be hilarious.
6788018	6793220	We're getting requests from chatters wanting us to pick them up on the way to the haunted house.
6793660	6797281	We should just tell people when we're going, and then we'll all go in together.
6797381	6803883	It'll be a big – because I know Jimmy, who used to do the show – what the hell was the show he did with John?
6804323	6804723	STFU.
6805083	6805644	Thanks for watching!
6823726	6826767	Osfer in chat says, Rob, reciprocate that high voice, please.
6827287	6828727	I'm not going to do that here on the radio.
6828767	6829267	I can't.
6829867	6832848	I legitimately cannot do the screaming like a little girl.
6832968	6835068	I'm going to do my imitation of scared Rob.
6835228	6835709	Oh, God.
6835909	6836989	Okay, let me take a breath.
6837389	6838489	Let me get in character.
6839229	6839769	Oh, my God.
6842230	6844610	When have I ever said, oh, my God, y'all?
6845030	6845931	You do that when you're teasing.
6845951	6846431	Oh, my God.
6846851	6847931	You do that when you tease people.
6847991	6848231	Fine.
6848411	6850432	Oh, my God.
6850792	6852212	That's Rob, by the way.
6856090	6857152	Needs more swearing
6858942	6860503	Well, I, you know, wasn't gonna.
6860803	6861743	But that's Rob.
6862623	6865284	And yeah, it is high enough to break glass.
6865684	6870286	You know who else lives in LA that we should challenge to come to this with us?
6871066	6872886	Is our friends from All Games Interactive.
6873967	6874187	Oh!
6875067	6877188	Ah, yeah, that's what we need to do.
6877628	6883370	We need to get Lawrence, we need to get Scott, we need to get Jessica, and all of them to come with us.
6883910	6886551	And we should have like a scare-off or something.
6886611	6887511	Becky says she'll come with us.
6889229	6890470	Oh, this needs to happen now.
6891070	6893451	Is anybody from All Games Interactive listening?
6893952	6894692	Let's throw down.
6894752	6895673	Let's have a scare-off.
6897934	6899615	I don't know how a scare-off works.
6901155	6903296	You should have to hold a glass of water.
6904877	6907819	And if you spill the glass of water...
6909269	6910809	I want to know why Osfer's thanking me.
6910929	6911810	I like this idea.
6911950	6913130	I really like this idea.
6915090	6918811	Have to hold something that shows or like hook something up to our body.
6919451	6921411	The Wii Vitality Sensor.
6923432	6924792	Too bad it won't be out in time.
6925252	6925912	God damn it.
6926332	6931733	Just when I found a use for the Wii Vitality Sensor to see who gets more scared here, me or Jessica, right?
6932373	6934674	The damn thing isn't going to be out in time.
6935959	6938061	I want to do it very drunk, Rob.
6938161	6940823	Do they have like a portable heart rate monitors or something like that?
6940903	6942204	Yeah, they make those.
6942244	6942624	Do they?
6942924	6947188	Or actually, iPhone has an app that's a heart rate monitor where you just tap in time with your heartbeat.
6947388	6948188	No, that wouldn't work.
6949009	6949749	I'm afraid.
6950030	6951931	Actual heart rate monitors are like 69 bucks a piece.
6952111	6958653	I'm afraid that I will be trying to contain my scare, like, I'll be trying to fight it because I'm very competitive.
6958913	6960754	Like, I am a very competitive person, I'll admit it.
6961054	6976379	That I, like, if I'm going against somebody from All Games Interactive in a scare-off or whatever, that I will somehow, like, between being actually scared and trying to, like, hold it in, like, I'm not going to scream, I'm not going to scream, that I will shit my pants in the middle of the haunted house.
6976819	6977820	You know what you should do?
6977840	6978721	And I don't want that to happen.
6978741	6979621	That's an automatic loss.
6979661	6981703	You should have judges go with you.
6982503	6988867	Have three judges go one time with you and one time with her and then rate the scare detection factor.
6988907	6990549	I don't know why I'm picking on Jessica.
6990609	6996473	I feel for some reason she's the easiest target of who's most likely to get scared from the All Games Interactive crew.
6996493	6998494	But for all I know, Mary Young is the target.
6998554	6999014	Or Scott.
6999475	6999915	I don't know.
7000135	7003077	Okay, so who would you pick then to do in a least likely to be?
7003277	7010881	I need an all-games interactive expert to tell me who is most likely to get scared at Silent Hill, the experience that I can challenge to a scare-off.
7011702	7013162	Jessica is no longer a part of all-games.
7013182	7014603	Well, she was, though, right?
7014843	7019046	Well, who do you think would be best off for a least likely to be scared?
7021307	7021727	Is it what?
7021787	7022988	And then a scare-off with you?
7024168	7026910	I don't know if it would be me that would be least likely to be scared.
7026930	7027170	I don't know.
7028560	7031882	Okay, the Tower of Terror scared the shit out of me.
7031902	7033583	I think we're going to lose.
7033663	7036804	I've also been in an elevator when it's fallen.
7038285	7041186	The chat is suggesting Derek H. Does he even live in LA?
7041206	7041927	I don't think he does.
7042087	7043928	Isn't he like in the Midwest or something?
7044228	7044748	I could be wrong.
7045628	7046249	Alright, anyhow.
7047349	7047629	SILENT HILL
7068635	7077879	Well, this is a definite bit of... Not really a surprise, but it's sort of happy and not happy at the same time.
7078659	7085222	Sega doesn't have any plans to do anything to commemorate the Dreamcast launch.
7085242	7089824	Because Dreamcast launch happened 9-9-99, so they're not doing anything 9-9-09.
7090144	7094046	But they said unofficially that there should be some celebrations and some...
7094486	7098827	Parties, things to mark, you know, such a momentous day in gaming.
7101828	7107129	But that they don't really have any plans to celebrate the US launch.
7109649	7119311	However, they were talking, there is some talk about putting up some of, doing potential digital downloads, I think, of Dreamcast games.
7119331	7123012	It's just the limiting factor being is just how large they are right now.
7124545	7126245	But... You know what?
7126285	7127206	We need to do something on Wednesday.
7153672	7158954	we need to come over here and play Dreamcast because of the anniversary that day and record it
7159718	7165643	I remember sitting in that line outside the damn mall and getting so bored that we went over and bought books at Barnes & Noble and came back and got in line.
7184915	7189958	The launch of the Dreamcast was during the period where, believe it or not, I wasn't playing a lot of video games.
7190338	7197342	The years I was living in Chico, kind of away at college, I kind of fell out of video gaming, my love of gaming for a while, so I kind of missed the launch of the Dreamcast.
7197382	7203805	But in retrospect, I was able to kind of catch up on it and see just how awesome of a system it was.
7204045	7205947	Sonic Adventure Rental Dreamcast Special Release Sonic Adventure
7220522	7229166	I'm kind of surprised though that Sega's not even at the bare minimum releasing Crazy Taxi on Xbox Live Arcade or something.
7229226	7233228	You know how Sega loves to re-release their old nostalgia stuff.
7233288	7236270	Give us a little something, some Dreamcast love.
7236590	7245753	I mean, I guess, though, okay, now, granted, before somebody in chat mentions it, which I'm sure they will, they do have the poll going on right now for the Genesis game that's going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade.
7245793	7246553	Did you guys hear about this?
7246853	7255776	They're, like, doing a poll at, what is it, GenesisPoll.com or something like that to see what game should be the next one they release on Xbox Live Arcade.
7255816	7263659	And I think right now Earthworm Jim is winning by a landslide, which is too bad, because, like, Wonder Boy and ToeJam & Earl...
7264559	7266761	and Revenge of Shinobi are all on that poll as well.
7267121	7268402	It'd be nice if it actually load.
7268582	7269623	Did the whole thing not load?
7270624	7270744	Nope.
7270824	7271244	That's weird.
7271264	7275347	You should see a poll in the middle there with the options of the game that would come out next.
7275387	7276608	That's weird that it's not showing up for you.
7276708	7277729	It showed up for me at home.
7279050	7279870	Maybe the poll's over?
7280050	7280350	I don't know.
7280571	7280931	Maybe.
7281251	7281491	Weird.
7283393	7285714	But Earthworm Jim was kicking all the other games' ass.
7285734	7286635	That's the one that's gonna win.
7287616	7289857	Yeah.
7290057	7291578	Earthworm Jim was actually a really good game.
7292319	7292459	So...
7293942	7296264	And I'm sure that they're probably all slated to come out.
7296284	7298045	It's just which one do we want to release first?
7298185	7298725	Exactly.
7298765	7315036	I'm sure they're all being worked on right now, which is kind of cool because, you know, it's nice to know we'll get all those games eventually, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Genesis remakes on Xbox Live Arcade, although, oddly enough, I do love the Mega Collection because I think the Mega Collection is a really, really good value.
7315977	7321661	But I think the ones by themselves don't bring that much to the table outside of achievements and, you know...
7322386	7324447	Just being a rehashed version of the old game.
7324947	7327647	But, heck, same thing as Virtual Console, I guess.
7328528	7329388	If we want to put it that way.
7331328	7337710	Alright, so, too bad that we won't see more Dreamcast 11 on September 9th of 2009, but I guess it was just ahead of its time.
7338470	7339751	I don't know what else to chalk it up to.
7341351	7342311	Let's move on with some more news.
7343132	7343452	Alright.
7345484	7346404	Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero World Tour
7368849	7370370	Guitar Hero Smash Hits
7385040	7388803	You know, your, I guess, authorization to download them.
7389344	7391725	For cost, of course, just like Rock Band was $5.
7392786	7395248	No pricing, though, has been announced yet for it.
7395649	7403255	But the options, though, for PS3 and Xbox 360, you can download the whole lump of songs, or you can pick and choose which ones you want.
7403995	7409039	And apparently, most of the tracks will be available, including, I guess...
7410487	7427263	152 of the 158 tracks that are available right now for download content for Guitar Hero World Tour will be compatible with Guitar Hero 5 the other cool thing though is apparently Band Hero also will be backwards compatible with these other games as well
7428586	7432930	No word though on if you can import the Band Hero songs into Guitar Hero 5 or vice versa.
7433390	7437413	Isn't literally Band Hero just a different skinned version of Guitar Hero 5 though?
7437593	7437753	Yes.
7437813	7439054	Like literally?
7439254	7439915	Literally it is.
7440335	7442236	Just different skinned version with different songs?
7442256	7443617	And it's different track lists.
7443697	7446279	It's more geared towards kids, supposedly.
7446359	7449301	But it's just basically... In other words, I'll like it more.
7449441	7452584	It's another excuse to put out another version of the game.
7453124	7459450	It's another thing that they can go, Hey, look, Guitar Hero's out selling Rock Band like ten times over.
7460011	7462653	Yeah, because you're releasing ten times more games, stupid.
7463474	7463854	I don't know.
7464274	7465876	It's just getting ridiculous now.
7466336	7470881	Thankfully, I think a lot of people are seeing that, and they've figured out, Hey, you know what?
7471701	7473243	I don't want to buy all these games.
7473783	7477387	And, you know, before I used to pick up some of the Guitar Hero games, even though...
7478550	7479410	I didn't really play them.
7480030	7480470	Not anymore.
7480991	7487552	I'm not really touching them because I do realize that they're just all... So they could be available for... They're download content.
7487572	7489493	They only have a few tracks that come out each month.
7489753	7491713	Rock Band has a few tracks that come out each week.
7492193	7493294	And it's a real bummer.
7493374	7505817	It's a real bummer that my Xbox died when it did because I had just downloaded Janis Joplin, Peace of My Heart, which I was so looking forward to playing, and the Gorillaz pack too, and never got to play them because of my Xbox dying.
7506681	7508302	Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5
7529197	7535780	Pro tip here, just go rent World Tour and get the code from the back and hopefully no one else has thought of that.
7535860	7536461	Hopefully.
7537221	7537981	And there you go.
7539042	7539882	Eh, it's no big deal.
7539962	7543404	I mean, I'm sure the game will come down in price big time used at some point.
7543764	7546546	Well, then again, then I won't be able to get the code, huh?
7547106	7547486	Well, no.
7547606	7552288	If it's used, you may still be able to because the codes really don't mean anything right now.
7552508	7553909	They aren't used for anything.
7553949	7555470	So if you do happen to find it used...
7556403	7557304	You can still use it.
7558204	7559806	It's still probably kind of pricey used.
7559946	7563488	I don't think there were any songs in World Tour I wanted that badly.
7564829	7573516	And then the other thing too, Rock Band 2 right now is $99 for the bundle, which is not bad if you haven't picked up.
7574336	7575377	That's the funny thing right here.
7576738	7580521	There's the Beatles Rock Band bundle that they have right now.
7582338	7592281	We found out that the title is going to be heavily allocated, which means they're only going to release limited quantities to distributors and retail stores are probably going to get them because they're going to be really hard to find, basically.
7593801	7599763	It's actually cheaper to buy Rock Band 2, the bundle, and then buy Beatles Rock Band, the game only.
7599803	7603624	You will literally save almost $100 and you'll get two games instead of one.
7604813	7614115	I mean, if it's that important that your instruments look like the Beatles instruments, I mean, we're talking a plastic guitar here, if it's really, is it $100 important?
7615296	7624918	I mean, seriously, if you really want to spend the extra $100, you can buy another guitar that looks, you know, one of the two separate guitars that they have available as well.
7625998	7632320	But, I mean, seriously, if you're just holding out for that bundle, just buy Rock Band 2 and then get the other game.
7632588	7636090	But aren't they going to phase out the Rock Band 2 bundles eventually?
7637851	7640472	Probably not because not everyone's going to want Beatles Rock Band.
7640932	7643453	I'm sure Rock Band 2 will be around for a while until Rock Band 3.
7643874	7645615	Probably Rock Band 3 will be coming out probably next year.
7646495	7649116	So they'll probably keep Rock Band 2 around until 3 comes out.
7650137	7652698	I wonder what 3 will do that really ups the ante.
7653519	7653879	I'm curious.
7653899	7658921	Probably offer the same stuff that they did in Beatles Rock Band like the 3 part harmonies.
7660162	7661943	Maybe some sort of
7663553	7664133	I don't really know.
7665675	7675201	I'm hoping though it at least does the whole thing where your Rock Band 1 and maybe your Rock Band 2 library can be exported and you're just going to have this gigantic jukebox of songs available.
7675261	7675922	That would be awesome.
7675962	7676862	I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.
7677503	7684348	The only thing that they may have is obviously the older songs won't support the three-part harmonies, but who cares?
7684788	7685889	You don't need to have that.
7686704	7686964	Roadie Battle
7709293	7717538	Yeah, so what's kind of neat though with the Wii version, they're actually doing something called Roadie Battle, which surprisingly enough is actually something innovative.
7718078	7722000	What it's going to be is it's a mode that you use with your DS.
7722761	7729364	And basically you need two DSs to do this, I guess if you're playing with two humans using the DS.
7729925	7735848	And then the other two people will play a versus battle on Guitar Hero and on the Wii.
7736448	7765628	and so during that time you know you have little mini games that you play on the DS like for example you know you're sabotaging the other players so you unscrew the amp so you actually you know make the little motions like you're you know screwing in something and basically that will screw up the other person or they'll have one where you have to reset the soundboard and so they have little marks where the sliders need to be and you have to slide your stylus to move the sliders I think that's kind of cool and I think that would be kind of cool as a standalone you know
7766758	7770342	Multiplayer game or something like that on the Wii for Guitar Hero 5.
7770402	7772744	Just say you want to play a little mini game or something like that.
7773045	7773365	Different.
7773405	7774006	That would be kind of neat.
7776848	7778850	I guess I like any new features.
7778911	7780492	Kind of cool, I guess, if nothing else.
7780853	7785177	But if you don't have two people, you don't have two DSs or something like that, you can actually play against a computer.
7785778	7787059	But it's neat.
7788089	7788990	All right, very cool.
7789811	7799399	Hey, a lot of things that, or I should say, a lot of complaints have been made about the Xbox 360's friends list and the fact that it's limited to basically 100 friends.
7799999	7803702	Well, and people are wondering, why doesn't Xbox just up the friends list?
7803762	7807565	And, you know, honestly, guys, it's not as easy as just flipping a switch, you know.
7807966	7812430	Probably this is, you know, takes a lot of work on the server ends and so forth.
7812450	7816313	You know, if the things were built a certain way, then they're kind of stuck that way.
7816713	7819434	But apparently a lot of this dates back to Halo 2.
7820474	7828096	Apparently original Xbox games were coded to be limited to 100 friends and that limit was brought into the current generation.
7828617	7833938	And this has to do with a report from G4, I guess, talked to a high level Microsoft source.
7835399	7839400	The real reason why they cannot up the friends list is because more people are still playing Halo 2.
7840919	7841379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7868120	7870702	I just remove people after they've been offline for like 30 days.
7870963	7872664	Yeah, then you kind of figure they're not coming back.
7873745	7875006	And if they do, it's no big deal.
7875066	7880612	Or, you know, obviously if it's my friends or something like that that I know in real life, you know, I won't take them off there.
7880672	7885216	But, you know, for the most part, I will take people that are not on there for 30 days.
7887139	7892504	And the thought is maybe some folks will get off of Halo 2 once Halo 3 ODST comes out in September.
7892544	7893144	But you know what?
7893685	7894065	I don't know.
7894186	7897028	I think there's always going to be some people playing Halo 2.
7897649	7901893	When they pull the plug on Halo 2 someday, there are going to be some pissed off gamers.
7902394	7906938	But the question is, you know, how many are they willing to risk pissing off to do it?
7908360	7909581	Or why can't they just, like...
7911041	7918888	I don't know, limit your friends list to show just the first 100 in Halo 2 and then just have it later, you know, more later or something like that.
7919308	7920409	Just limit it to the first 100.
7923472	7923772	Alright.
7924152	7926114	Well, let's get into the mailbag.
7926154	7935342	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and the lovely DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and picks a few of her favorite emails to read here on the program.
7936983	7938844	So, who's emailed us this week?
7939024	7941125	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, DarkSakura.
7941345	7949528	We have one from Mark who says, I'm a new fan of your show and I added your video game talk show to my podcast to my Yahoo RSS feed so I can hear you all the time.
7950028	7952729	Now, what are all your PlayStation 3 PSN names?
7953149	7954670	I don't have one because I don't play on it.
7956651	7958751	Run that by me game with your favorite PS3 games?
7958771	7960552	No, your PSN name.
7961132	7962313	Oh, PSN name?
7963393	7965414	Green Sky, but IE instead of Y.
7966704	7968325	Loki, OLR, all caps.
7968925	7972508	I can't remember if there's a space zone between Loki and OLR.
7972548	7974089	Mine's all one word, all lowercase.
7975129	7980633	I think on the PlayStation Network you can have spaces.
7981073	7981654	Maybe you can.
7982254	7983495	I don't remember.
7984816	7985636	It's in the forums.
7985896	7986577	Go look in the forums.
7988213	7991239	Next email, oh, it's by the same person.
7992181	7994386	Well, I'm not going to read one by the same person twice.
7994907	7996670	Read it at the end.
7999974	8011161	Redertainment Hi, I'm a resident of Utah and frequent the Best Buy store where the pilot program that was discussed last week is taking place.
8011621	8015984	I didn't ask the manager about it under the guise of doing a story for a gaming site.
8016484	8021648	What I learned is that they are taking the trade in values from the GameStop website.
8022308	8026691	Also, not all the games are subject to this program, just ones that are out of print and are hard to sell.
8027372	8030074	I couldn't get any other details as I am not an employee.
8030214	8031775	Also, Super Mormon Brothers, really?
8032235	8033356	Come on, you could come up with better.
8033656	8044404	For instance, Grand Theft Auto, LDS in City, Sim Missionary, DDR Mormon Cabernacle Choir Mix, and Are You Smarter Than a Member of the Quorum of the Seventy.
8045543	8048267	That's all I have Staycare?
8048908	8060764	Redertainment This message brought to you by the Utah State Legislature where racism, classism, and homophobia are not just encouraged, it's rewarded That is so funny that we actually did have a listener in that town that we were talking about last week's show, that's great
8061328	8065550	This is from Robert M. Interesting you mentioned Johnny Cash and Guitar Hero 5.
8065710	8070332	I love the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, at least one or two, especially the soundtracks of those games.
8070772	8078235	It seems to lose focus creatively and musically with Underground and Underground 2, the later of which containing such random artists as Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and yes, Cash.
8079019	8085844	I can accept such an eclectic variety of artists in a music slash rhythm game more readily than in a skating game, though.
8086165	8093791	I'm not sure how I feel about the character model in 5 yet, nor have I made up my mind about Hendrix being in World Tour.
8094651	8097313	We just had commentary from Shermie.
8097673	8108900	To play freaking moron's advocate, I get the feeling that Mr. Kotick meant to say that he felt retail costs may need to increase as project budgets and marketing increase.
8108980	8112282	Of course, if that's what you mean, say that.
8112362	8121367	In an ideal world, which this isn't, Bobby wouldn't trip over a scorpion and fall into an alligator pit and be replaced with Gary Kitchens and or David Crane after a merger with their company Skyworks Technologies.
8123652	8124172	Moving forward!
8153666	8154867	Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2
8170916	8196255	OLRPSP.com you can get the last 20 it's the one site where it goes back a little further but unfortunately we don't really offer any further back than that I do know some OLR listeners have scrounged up old episodes just because of server load and space every show is like 90 megabytes it's a huge amount of bandwidth so we can't offer every show but
8197316	8198397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8217057	8218297	Did you find all the old stuff?
8218317	8219178	I think that's the old ones.
8219218	8219958	I haven't looked.
8219978	8220898	Did you put it?
8220918	8221898	I haven't burned them yet.
8222198	8222719	I saw.
8222759	8223839	We need to just do a DVD compilation.
8223859	8227680	Somebody said season one is on the OL Archive now.
8228200	8235022	But you have to remember, just remember, if you're going to go back and download episode one, episode two, it was a totally different show seven years ago.
8235122	8235642	We grew.
8236002	8237123	It got less mature.
8237203	8238283	Totally different.
8238543	8241004	And I had migrated the whole first episode, just warning everyone.
8241424	8244985	And then I think that was, wasn't that when I went to go sleep in the Harry Potter room?
8245768	8246489	That was later, I think.
8246509	8248070	That was later, yeah.
8248170	8251352	I slept on a little bed under the stairs.
8251993	8254074	Jason and Raichan found the old episodes.
8254114	8254975	They had them somehow.
8255675	8258958	I must have burned them off for Raichan when I sent her the ferret years ago.
8259158	8259658	I bet I did.
8260019	8260239	Hmm.
8261380	8261800	How funny.
8262865	8269006	So moving forward now, and actually this is one of those weeks where I've actually had to pick different emails because we've got so many.
8269486	8271687	So if your emails aren't getting read, I'm sorry.
8271887	8273467	It's just we really do have to move through here.
8274768	8276848	Shook here, or is it Shookay?
8277028	8277368	I don't know.
8277768	8283249	Lately I've been thinking about getting Final Fantasy X on PS2 for my 13th birthday on October 17th.
8283289	8289671	Thing is, my old man, who's just about as heartless as a grizzled non-vet, won't let me get what he calls, quote, pussy jab stuff, end quote.
8290351	8290391	Ew.
8290987	8292067	That's not racist at all.
8292127	8292868	No, not at all.
8293388	8296569	Could you give me some advice as to coercing him into letting me get it?
8296689	8297790	It'd be much appreciated.
8298230	8300491	Tell him it's localized for American audiences.
8303932	8304672	That's about it.
8304912	8307013	Or do what I used to do and sneak.
8307694	8308494	Buy it yourself.
8309514	8311955	It's Final Fantasy X for the PS2?
8312155	8312375	Yeah.
8312575	8314236	Dude, that's like 20 bucks now.
8314736	8315317	You can do it.
8315417	8318138	Sell back some old games to GameStop and just buy the game yourself.
8318738	8318918	Yeah.
8320169	8322992	And, dude, Final Fantasy X had Blitzball.
8323012	8323633	That's pretty hardcore.
8323693	8327117	And thank you for being a lot more open-minded than your father.
8327177	8329860	No insult intended towards your father, but he sounds bigoted.
8331641	8334744	He sounds like an asshole and complete ill willment towards your father.
8334784	8335084	Sorry.
8335144	8335684	Ill willment.
8336305	8337106	I mean, I don't like to.
8337126	8337766	But you're cool.
8337826	8338226	You're cool.
8338246	8339608	I don't like to insult people's parents.
8339848	8340428	Yeah, I know.
8340969	8348995	Because even though our parents may be, you know, my dad is fairly racist and thick headed, but I still.
8349015	8351557	Well, when my mom and dad say stupid shit, I call him on it.
8351617	8353439	Like, but that's just the way we are in our family.
8353499	8354740	You know, they call me on stuff.
8354800	8355681	I call them on stuff.
8355961	8356662	So what can you do?
8357702	8357903	So.
8359444	8360745	Is Shermie smelling the microphone?
8362372	8362872	No.
8362932	8364474	Oh, you're almost strangled.
8364514	8365134	Poor Shermie.
8366435	8367136	Poor Shermie.
8367156	8368197	Go sit on Dan's desk.
8369458	8371739	She likes people, she just is nervous.
8372300	8372580	Okay.
8373721	8377584	Yeah, tell your dad, you know, to get with the times.
8379205	8381287	Ooh, this one's for me from Cheeseburger.
8382515	8384577	Jamie, what's a good starter pinball machine for under $1,000?
8384657	8387459	Oh, and post more videos on YouTube, they're great.
8388119	8395144	Just for the record, T-H-E-R-E is for location, T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E is what you intended.
8396565	8400228	Good pinball tables under $1,000, good luck on eBay and Craigslist, seriously.
8400628	8405452	You're going to pick up a beater, just to let you know, typically for that low price.
8405672	8418574	but you can it's a good way to get started you know if you pick up a you know a beater machine needs a little bit of work and start putting the work into it yourself you can trade it later on for other tables for things that you want better um
8420350	8434098	Yeah, those are really... Also, there's a... Dan's not here for me to get the name of it from him, but there's a... The Sacramento Pinball Group actually puts up purchased stuff every so often.
8434699	8436420	And that's a group that my husband's a part of.
8437220	8449688	But just... eBay and Craigslist, really, you just need to make sure that you look for, you know, everything works or, you know, if there's a problem with it, don't make sure there's no, like...
8450268	8450488	Last email?
8450508	8450608	Okay.
8473598	8474719	from Geekboy2424.
8474820	8483410	Hey guys, with the summer of arcade coming to an end and Rob's obsession with Super Metroid, I wanted to know if any of you are interested in Shadow Complex.
8483851	8485793	What makes it look good to you or makes it look bad?
8485873	8487836	Thanks for the opinions and I love the show.
8488056	8489197	Logan aka Geekboy2424.
8489738	8496263	I have to be honest, I don't know much about the game, and especially because my Xbox 360 fried this week, I don't think I'll be getting this anytime soon.
8496764	8500967	But I love the idea of a game influenced by Super Metroid, and I'm all about that.
8501808	8504410	I'll check it out, at least the demo, just based on that alone.
8504750	8507813	Just the fact that it's that whole exploration and power-ups.
8508353	8509414	I just love that kind of design.
8509454	8512537	You know I love my Super Metroid, and I just love the design of that game.
8512597	8514538	I loved Castlevania, too.
8515479	8516420	Symphony of the Night, of course.
8516840	8519643	So I'm all about at least checking it out, if nothing else.
8521505	8521745	All right.
8522025	8522566	Sounds good to me.
8522926	8527370	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us more emails to read in the future.
8527911	8530193	In the meantime, it's time to get into our FUs of the week.
8530293	8534256	Thankfully, there wasn't a lot of stupidity out there on the internet last week.
8534297	8535237	At least we didn't find any.
8535558	8537980	So we don't really have anything to dedicate this week's FUs to.
8538260	8541043	Oh, except for the fact that my Xbox 360 fried itself.
8558348	8558848	My F.U.
8558888	8562609	goes to how much my hand hurts and the freaking suture that was left in it.
8562950	8563350	The end.
8564630	8564950	Loki.
8565490	8565731	F.U.
8565751	8569172	goes to all the drinks that I just had because I feel really full.
8569732	8576474	And also to the guys that's on the Neo Geo forums that's selling all the candy cabinets that won't get back to me.
8576934	8583036	I know a lot of people are antsy because they're waiting to hear back from them and I want to put down my deposit to guarantee my cabinets.
8584477	8584797	That's it.
8586267	8587128	Um, I don't know.
8587148	8588429	I don't really have a lot of FUs.
8588649	8591270	FUs to the fact that I nap too much.
8591971	8592932	That's my FU this week.
8594012	8594613	FU to napping.
8594773	8596034	Although, actually, napping's awesome.
8596054	8598595	I shouldn't say FU to it, because it's really cool, actually.
8599496	8600476	I just do it too much.
8600617	8601217	That's the problem.
8601707	8602428	I like naps.
8602728	8603649	Naps are cool.
8604409	8605610	Unless you nap all the time like me.
8606551	8613637	Alright, just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8613917	8615858	But we have a few more stories before we get to that.
8615978	8616819	So, Loki.
8617179	8621703	Are you a girl and a gamer who wishes that there were more girl gamer perspectives for you?
8621723	8622744	Yes, yes I am.
8623104	8632170	Well, you're in luck, because now there's the Gamer's Girl, which is a brand new blog that you can find at thegamersgirl.blogspot.com.
8632950	8638234	And it's a website geared towards women who are dating gamers.
8639314	8643297	And they have interesting little articles.
8643457	8647980	One of them that they're highlighting, of course, is the Gamer Widow.
8648740	8649381	Basically...
8651563	8654505	A woman that has lost their boyfriend to gaming.
8656147	8663853	They offer tips for gamers to keep their significant other from resenting or interrupting their game time needlessly.
8663933	8670998	Like, for example, setting aside a half an hour right when you get home from work to lavish affection on your partner before you switch on the 360.
8671819	8675101	And I gotta tell you, from my own experience, that does work.
8675461	8678824	So, you may want to follow that advice.
8679244	8680045	But yes, um...
8682031	8683231	It's neat, I guess.
8706240	8708904	Hey, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to the Skype line.
8708924	8713591	And this story has to do with something that women and men and everybody can bond over.
8714012	8714893	Pokemons!
8715434	8716255	Yay!
8716556	8717437	Let me show you them.
8718783	8722284	There are some new Pokemon games coming out this spring.
8722964	8725925	The HeartGold version and the SoulSilver version.
8726465	8732666	And what these are, these are remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver and they'll now be on the DS.
8734486	8736867	So yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know, right?
8736887	8737627	They're coming out Spring 2010.
8739208	8740708	Let's see, what is the little quote here?
8741548	8750514	Announcing these much-anticipated game launches at the Pokemon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokemon.
8750874	8755377	We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first, but of course, now we all know.
8755697	8756978	That quote, by the way, from J.C.
8757038	8760781	Smith, the Pokemon Company International's Director of Marketing.
8761261	8763523	So, there you go, remakes coming for the DS.
8763563	8768066	As far as what features and so forth on them, don't know yet, but there's a trailer out there.
8768826	8771969	And it looks like it does have Wi-Fi battling going on on it.
8772009	8773210	So that's kind of cool, I guess.
8774110	8777833	I actually had... Was it Gold and Silver I had?
8777893	8779595	No, the last one I think I had was Ruby.
8779615	8780856	I think it was the last one I had.
8780876	8782237	It was an advanced game.
8784339	8786980	I'm kind of not into Pokemon anymore.
8787680	8789261	You don't want to show people your Pokemans?
8789341	8789901	Not anymore.
8790081	8790961	I'm not as into them as I used to be.
8790981	8795483	I think I remember you playing that, or maybe it was Shane playing that on the... Probably both were.
8795723	8798824	The Game Boy Advance thing for the GameCube.
8799877	8804398	I was playing Ruby on that one for a while.
8804758	8808639	I think I had Ruby and he had Sapphire and we were doing the trading thing for a little bit.
8809499	8814161	I was playing Pearl for a while when I would go to the gym and play Pokemans.
8815121	8815381	I don't know.
8815421	8817041	Pokemon is just so repetitive to me.
8817081	8818001	That's my problem with it.
8818101	8819182	It just got too repetitive.
8819762	8820142	You know what?
8820542	8823363	Nothing will ever top Pokemon Snap in terms of coolness.
8823783	8824143	Awesome.
8824603	8825463	I love Pokemon Snap.
8825523	8828344	I still play that on Virtual Console once in a great while, but it happens.
8829926	8833068	Hey, how about that Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR?
8833148	8834769	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8834789	8836509	We're going to go ahead and open it up and take your calls.
8836850	8840211	But while we wait for your calls, how about some last minute stories?
8840812	8842372	Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8843193	8848916	Yes, Redbox is test marketing video game rentals in their kiosk for $2 a night.
8849136	8852678	And they're testing this right now in their Reno, Nevada market.
8854113	8855154	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8855174	8855534	Who's this?
8856275	8856975	Hey, it's Ranma.
8856995	8857996	What's going on, everyone?
8858016	8860057	You always seem to get through, Ranma.
8860078	8860818	What's on your mind, buddy?
8862259	8862979	Not too much.
8863660	8866182	Once again, I take another one for the team.
8866622	8869684	I went out, I dropped five bucks on Rock Revolution.
8870645	8875288	I heard about this insane price drop for Rock Revolution, that it was coming way down in price.
8875348	8877509	So you actually picked this up, huh?
8878150	8878350	Yes.
8878810	8881132	Actually, it was retailing for $16.99 at most places, and it
8883066	8886607	The place right across the street from my job price matched GameStop for me, which was pretty cool.
8887387	8887688	Nice.
8887888	8895630	So, well... If I paid more than $4.99, I would have thrown it across the room.
8897431	8901572	Well, since you only paid $5, doesn't that make it eligible to be thrown across the room?
8902553	8905294	The fact that it has Twisted Sisters, we're not going to take it.
8906094	8907094	It slides because of that.
8907294	8910555	Any song, any game that has that song works for me.
8910896	8911916	But isn't that a cover?
8912145	8913745	but aren't they all bad covers?
8913865	8915586	I don't care!
8915646	8916586	It's so awesome!
8918346	8920127	So, I mean, but how's the game itself?
8920287	8921547	I mean, how's the interface?
8921627	8922487	How does it run?
8922607	8930129	I mean, are we just picking on Rock Revolution because it's, you know, the bastard child of music games or what's the reason to really hate this game?
8931469	8937330	Because it's nothing more than like Guitar Freak's drum mania hyped up on some really bad coke and steroids.
8938350	8938971	How so?
8939791	8941051	Okay, first off,
8941812	8948577	When playing with the drums, I keep forgetting that there is an actual symbol for the foot pedal instead of the lines.
8948597	8949877	I keep forgetting about that.
8951098	8956462	Overall, the game plays where three songs, the album goes gold.
8956702	8959564	If you complete five songs, the album goes platinum.
8960514	8968657	One of the objectives is where you play one of the songs, it goes up in three levels of difficulty as you're playing, but it tells you on the screen what level you're at.
8969077	8976300	And another one is where you practice a certain part of the song and you have to play it back fully memorized.
8978301	8979701	That is kind of weird.
8981082	8985203	Well, after two albums, you get to pick an arena.
8985924	8989385	To give you an arena, you pick three songs and you play it right through, which is not so bad.
8990515	8992936	Wow, but having to play them from memory, that's kind of dumb.
8994076	8998738	I know it is, but it's only for like, not the whole song, it's like maybe like 30 seconds of a song.
8999758	9004279	It goes through with you twice, and then it goes over again from memory.
9004659	9005760	I guess that's not terrible.
9006640	9007500	That's not so bad.
9008100	9011301	I don't know, I actually am thinking of trying to find this game and pick it up.
9011361	9011902	I mean, it's only $5.
9012822	9014002	I mean, whatever.
9014142	9017303	I've spent more than that on crappy Xbox Live Arcade games.
9018384	9019624	I think that describes most of us.
9022606	9028093	AJ Mix in chat says, if you're going to buy Rock Revolution for five bucks just for the Bomani pack, stop.
9028494	9029015	Do not.
9030993	9031133	I... I...
9059116	9063558	I do know Actdeft had me worried saying that, oh, the Rock Band drums don't work with the game.
9063998	9064398	You know what?
9064458	9065578	Look on Harmonix.
9065798	9066799	We talked about this last week.
9066839	9072521	Harmonix's website has a compatibility chart that includes Rock Band, and it will tell you right there.
9072561	9073101	So take a look.
9074141	9074742	Works for me.
9075282	9077362	So anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9079883	9080644	No, not offhand.
9081044	9081324	All right.
9081584	9082264	Have a good one, Ranma.
9082284	9082824	Thanks for calling.
9083345	9083785	No problem.
9083905	9084125	Later.
9085120	9087805	GameGuru says, Rock Revolution is like a train wreck.
9087845	9088687	You can't look away.
9089168	9092835	That comment, of course, with all our other chat comments at chat.orangerollingeradio.com.
9093015	9095219	Rock Revolution, the Yaris of music games.
9096287	9096968	Aw, that was sad.
9097008	9098369	I almost feel kind of bad for it.
9098449	9099230	No, I don't.
9099510	9101852	I don't feel bad, because they had their opportunity.
9102252	9111920	For, like, years, they had their opportunity, but they decided, you know what, we're just going to license the, you know, rights to our guitar, you know, peripherals or whatever.
9112240	9118325	We're going to license those for the Guitar Hero arcade game, because... And they really embarrassed themselves at E3 a few years ago, didn't they?
9118665	9118885	Yes.
9119105	9119946	Alright, let's go to the phones.
9120887	9121867	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9121887	9122208	Who's this?
9123237	9124258	This is DSMaster25.
9124358	9126480	Hi, DSMaster25.
9126500	9127000	What's on your mind?
9128402	9128942	Not much.
9129022	9131244	Just you guys talking Rock Revolution.
9132465	9136729	I've actually had the ROM for probably about two days now.
9137170	9141534	You're not supposed to tell people we have ROMs.
9143675	9144596	This is translated.
9147059	9148480	It's really crappy on DS.
9150370	9154654	It has one part of the game that is missing from the console versions.
9155835	9156215	What's that?
9157276	9157836	The singing.
9158777	9159377	That's right.
9159417	9162360	The console versions don't even have the singing because they're covers, huh?
9162420	9163520	So they can't really match up.
9166042	9168264	Now, I can't think of a lot of DS games where you do that.
9168304	9169925	You actually sing in the microphone, right?
9170806	9172367	Yeah, it has the pitch bars.
9172407	9174389	You know how Karaoke Revolution works, right?
9174429	9174669	Yeah.
9176070	9177771	Basically, it's that interface.
9178172	9178532	So it's
9179834	9180454	But is it fun?
9201547	9204770	This thing, part and drumming, was about as fun as it got.
9204790	9216660	The bass, I thought at first, because I had the Guitar Hero peripheral for the DS, so I figured, oh, they might have something along the lines of a Guitar Freak's minigame-ish sort of spiel.
9217000	9224727	So I plugged it in expecting the upward note chart going in, but that wasn't the case.
9224767	9227269	It was just like strum up, strum down, strum up, strum down.
9227662	9229544	Same thing for the bass, but with the four strings.
9229744	9230825	It's stupid.
9231946	9238492	So, basically, to sum it up, it's about as fun as dark gray notes on a black background.
9239312	9241134	Have you heard, though, Konami's not giving up?
9241434	9246579	Guitar Freaks has a new version coming out in Japan, and apparently they finally caught on to the five fret thing.
9246599	9247820	They're going to go up to five frets.
9249376	9251679	I do not like that idea.
9251899	9256625	What the... You know what's funny?
9257186	9258387	Do you remember this years ago?
9258768	9268420	Years and years ago, do you remember when Red Octane, before Guitar Hero came out, their business was making money off of peripherals for Konami games.
9268880	9270881	They actually released a controller.
9271261	9279903	Like, eight, seven, six, five, I don't remember, five, six years ago, before Guitar Hero was out, they released a controller for Guitar Freaks with five buttons on it.
9280403	9283664	And everybody always asked, why the hell are there five buttons on this controller?
9284064	9286905	Oh, there must be a new Guitar Freaks game coming out with five buttons.
9286965	9291286	And then it turns out, well, it was a precursor to them putting out Guitar Hero.
9291626	9293407	Probably the fact, probably Konami's...
9295348	9301051	Revitalizing their series kind of probably drove Red Octane to do it themselves and ended up being very successful with it.
9302652	9308675	Yeah, but I could not... See, but I was a guitar freak before I played Guitar Hero.
9309335	9313077	And my uncle kept telling me, like, start going up on medium.
9313137	9314698	Use that fourth and fifth button.
9314718	9316459	I'm like, I can't.
9316639	9321602	I'm too used to the three-button pressing system that was on Guitar Freaks.
9321622	9323503	I'm so used to the Japanese guitar games.
9324966	9325546	It takes time.
9325727	9326927	You just practice and it takes time.
9327028	9330750	Four isn't as hard to do because you can do four without really moving your hand.
9331190	9334473	It's five that gets tricky because you have to learn how to move your hand back and forth.
9334593	9335494	That's when it gets really hard.
9335534	9339436	But four, most guitar freaks players can do four pretty easy because it's still one hand.
9339556	9340477	You just have to get your pinky.
9340637	9343859	You have to do pinky exercises every day and you'll get better.
9343879	9347702	See, and actually get this.
9347802	9352966	My school, for like fundraisers for the music program, they've been having guitar hill tournaments all these
9353650	9355931	and actually they finally had a rock band last year.
9356491	9370677	Now it's just a matter of time before they just, because with DJ Hero coming out, do you think, I think you guys might have heard this before, but some of me thinking, because, you know, I've been working on this whole mod with like Disney rock songs on Guitar Freaks.
9370857	9376440	I've been, kind of like how the people have been modding Guitar Hero tracks for a while.
9376660	9381922	I've been doing it with Guitar Freaks, but now it's all Disney stuff because they haven't done a Disney Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania.
9382728	9391053	So, basically, why haven't they done Disney with anything else other than DDR and Poppin'?
9391193	9392433	Don't give them ideas.
9392794	9408522	Because Disney has their own studio, Disney has their own gaming studio, and for whatever reason, well, because DDR is Konami's thing, Disney can't really rip it off for themselves, but Konami, as you can see, does not have the locks on guitar games, so if Disney wants to do their own guitar game, they will.
9408742	9409883	That's probably the reason behind it.
9411722	9414985	See, I'm... But here's one thing I kind of figure.
9415125	9419849	Around the lines, no one helped out where the Jonas Brothers are, just speaking Disney.
9420730	9432841	I was actually at a Demi concert, and there was like this supposed preview coming up with the Jonas Brothers talking guitar hero, and possibly an expansion pack for them.
9432921	9435223	I'm like, I could see that happening, and...
9436328	9443112	Well, you look at the light at GameStop, instead of teenage boys, you're going to be seeing tween girls.
9443552	9445513	It would be a band here, probably.
9446254	9449896	As Kevin Smith says, in six years, those girls will be 18.
9449936	9456740	Alright, DS Master, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, alright?
9458081	9459542	Alright, just one last question.
9459602	9459902	Yes, yes.
9461091	9468277	Do you think there's, especially with DJ Hero and Scratch coming out, do you ever think there's ever going to be a revitalization for Beatmania?
9468818	9469278	Period.
9470099	9474342	Sadly, the closest you're going to get is these knockoff games coming out.
9474882	9477044	Not the DJ Hero, but the other one, the Scratch Ultimate DJ.
9477064	9480467	Scratch is as close to Beatmania as you're going to get.
9480647	9482389	It is pretty damn close to Beatmania.
9482529	9487873	Konami just doesn't care about Bomani anymore, and a lot of that has to do with the closure of their Northern California office.
9488493	9488974	Sorry to say.
9489554	9490215	Which sucks.
9490932	9493393	It does suck, but there's not a lot we can do.
9493874	9495354	Alright, DS Master, thanks so much for the call.
9495674	9496115	Take care, buddy.
9496735	9498236	Peace out and keep the shows rockin'.
9498316	9498716	We'll try.
9498736	9504098	1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9505019	9506199	Try to get through here on the line.
9507280	9509721	We'll probably take maybe one more call and then we'll probably be done here.
9511874	9515036	DarkTetsuya wants to remind us that 2DX17 is coming out.
9515877	9517318	Jesus Christ, I didn't even say hello.
9517338	9518639	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9519480	9520801	Let me guess, this is Legend of Zaku.
9521762	9523623	Of course, how would you have guessed?
9523923	9528787	Did you, because you cut me off, did you know that they are releasing an Atari Lynx game named after you?
9530108	9530428	Really?
9530989	9531249	Yes.
9532570	9533070	Oh, wow.
9533310	9536633	I'm not kidding, there's an Atari Lynx game coming out called Zaku, check it out.
9537874	9537974	Ugh.
9539147	9542932	Better not rip off a Gundam or anything like that.
9543213	9545516	Well, the only thing I'm going to warn you is that Zaku's a chick.
9545676	9547879	So somehow something got misinterpreted.
9547959	9549481	So, I don't know.
9549702	9550883	You'll have to go take it up with them.
9551945	9552526	Whatever.
9552626	9553006	Anyways...
9554272	9556994	Something just came up to my attention recently.
9557715	9563479	I don't know if you noticed, but apparently Sega is pulling the plug on the Chromohound 360 servers.
9564560	9577209	In other words, the $50 that we pay for Xbox Live every year isn't really helping us, isn't really keeping the servers on for an unlimited amount of time.
9578387	9585519	In other words, we're paying 50 bucks, and yet our servers are more likely not going to, they don't look like they're going to be safe.
9585840	9590488	Because if Sega could pull the plug on that, what's going to stop other companies from doing the same thing?
9591545	9593006	Is this really news though?
9593046	9598169	Because I thought at least on the original Xbox that servers were being shut down for the old sports games.
9598509	9599790	Am I correct or am I wrong on that?
9599950	9600590	No, they were.
9601390	9602731	So this has happened before.
9603111	9606573	It's just I think this is the first time we've heard of this happening on the Xbox 360.
9607134	9614878	And the fact that it's a non-sports title that, you know, ages, you know, the ages gets old and replaced with a new sports title.
9615218	9616919	You know, that both kind of plays into it too.
9617419	9620481	I mean, it sucks, but it's also kind of not the first time.
9621601	9622962	But, I mean, I understand your point.
9623062	9626444	You know, what are we paying $50 for if it's not for the maintenance of these servers?
9626725	9642455	I mean, I don't get it that we're paying that much money and we're getting, you know, and the fact of the matter is this, just getting shafted for, I don't know, I guess it's because it has the, you know, the potential to set precedent.
9643177	9650979	If Sega could do it, then anyone else has the potential to just say, oh, we'll pull the plug on the server, even though you're paying $50 a year.
9651380	9655481	I can understand them pulling the plug on the server if literally no one is using it.
9655781	9658782	I mean, even if it's just a handful of people.
9658802	9660122	I mean, are there listeners?
9660362	9663023	I mean, honestly, I want an honest poll of the listeners.
9663123	9665864	Is anyone still playing Chromehounds online at least once a week?
9668700	9669860	I mean, I don't know.
9670240	9686444	And again, I understand what you're saying about precedent and all that stuff, but I can also understand that if they need to close down this server to make room for a new game, that there is a finite amount of space out there and an amount of bandwidth that maybe they just need to get rid of.
9686905	9689145	Does it suck, especially considering we're paying for it?
9689185	9691906	Yeah, but... I mean, the fact of the matter is that...
9692546	9718949	We're pretty much paying $50 for dedicated servers and then all of a sudden we find out that aside from the sports games, which are seasonal, I bet, you know, which are obviously seasonal and it's expected that they close out a few servers for an outdated Madden game, for example, but for something like Chromehounds, which is completely non-sports, just to have the servers closed and we're still paying for it, it's just, I don't know, it's just mind-boggling.
9720161	9723262	DeathWishing in chat says he plays I Find Matches every night.
9723402	9726323	Yeah, I think he's called in about Chromehounds before, so that kind of doesn't surprise me.
9726423	9727603	I don't think I see anyone else, though.
9728803	9729024	Hmm.
9730504	9733405	Well, you know, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this.
9733505	9740807	I mean, unfortunately, I think it's one of those things where they'll just take a chance on pissing off a few people to make room for some new game they've got coming out.
9740967	9743948	It's Sega, Sky.
9744348	9749029	I doubt they would even have the ability to follow up on Chromehounds unless, of course, they were
9750410	9758373	It's a recurring theme, though, tonight, though, is that we keep getting screwed on all these things, yet we just kind of seem to take it.
9758974	9762395	The Xbox Red ringings, the servers getting shut down.
9763236	9771660	At least for PSN, I kind of expect the servers will go down because they're free, so they're only up for a limited amount of time, except for popular games.
9771820	9777623	But, I mean, we expected that in the older PS2 days, you know, when a service is free.
9778820	9780441	but not for something that we pay for.
9782801	9784302	I don't know if there's an easy answer, Zaku.
9784922	9786643	We have to speak with our wallets.
9787023	9789044	The StarCraft thing, that was the other thing I was going to mention.
9789404	9792005	All right, Zaku, do you have anything else for listeners today before we go and wrap it up?
9792725	9793085	All right.
9794506	9794866	I don't know.
9794946	9797427	Is it just me that I've noticed that...
9799541	9812384	Quake Live, apparently John Carmack actually said over the weekend in QuakeCon is that that free online version of Quake, Quake Live can't really sustain itself on ads.
9812504	9813324	I'm not surprised.
9813945	9826708	Which brings me to the point is there even chance or any room for a viable business model for a game that just relies heavily on ad revenues?
9827208	9827928	Because I think if
9828482	9834605	If Quake Live proves one thing, is that even in a tight economy, this one was hemorrhaging money.
9835786	9839587	Hence the need for them to actually start releasing premium content.
9840488	9843809	Or actually not even, no, I take that back.
9844070	9848492	It's like a premium subscription where you actually create your own servers.
9849352	9852894	I think in order to answer that question, you have to ask yourself, how often do you click on ads?
9853925	9861007	Well, it's not that you click on the ads, it's that the ads are actually strewn all over the actual maps in the game.
9861227	9861508	I see.
9862628	9883195	So it's not necessarily clicking the ads, it's just the fact that I guess if it's something nostalgic like Quake, and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't even enough even on ads to break even, then I don't know if it might be viable for future business models with that same type.
9888709	9893533	I don't think there is enough money to be made there because I don't think people really kind of...
9894995	9895936	Act on that stuff.
9896376	9896777	I don't know.
9896837	9903922	I think the business model is going to have to be incorporating some paid content into it for the hardcore section of it.
9904283	9914371	EA managed to get some sort of assurance in the fact that with Battlefield Heroes, at least that paid content is for the most part optional.
9914851	9923238	I remember reading before tonight's show about this and that Quake Live, they're actually going to do a paid thing where you will be able to set up your own private rooms and so forth.
9923439	9923619	Right.
9924611	9933696	I mean with Battlefield Heroes it's kind of like the other side of the coin where EA is not forcing you to buy certain content in order to play the game.
9934296	9938878	It's just mostly aesthetics and just to level up your character a lot quicker.
9939459	9946022	So you can pretty much sustain without having to resort to buying DLC.
9946802	9951985	So I don't know if that's a viable model that could supplement ad revenues as well.
9953445	9954545	And is it a footy monster?
9976371	9977131	and ShadowFly.
10004977	10005257	Please.
10006898	10007478	So I went there.
10008699	10013881	They wanted to get some anime and manga programming in, so I figured I'd submit a panel.
10013921	10022344	I actually wanted to do a panel about localizing American comics in Japan, which you can talk about a lot there, like the Spider-Man manga, the Spider-Man live action show, and stuff like that.
10024625	10029367	It turns out they didn't actually advertise any of the anime and manga panels anywhere at the convention.
10030668	10033409	So I ended up getting one person to come in on Sunday.
10034352	10034712	Wow.
10034832	10036834	Oh, I think I read about this in your journal.
10036854	10037975	This is that same convention.
10038275	10040216	Like horrible signage and stuff, right?
10040376	10041257	Yeah.
10041777	10042337	Well, you've been there.
10042357	10043598	It's the same place that ASEN was at.
10043658	10050023	So imagine if everything was at the convention center where you registered and they didn't have any signs pointing toward the hotel at all.
10050363	10050523	Wow.
10050543	10051123	Who would go there?
10051944	10052364	Wow.
10053385	10053685	Okay.
10054125	10055566	Did the convention actually have a lot of people?
10056327	10056927	Yeah.
10057367	10058748	I don't know exactly how many.
10058828	10060790	In 2006, they got, I think, 60,000 people.
10060830	10062071	I have no idea how many they got this year.
10062091	10063852	I'm sure it's been down a lot since then.
10064554	10065054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10073007	10076849	Spreading the program with no schedule and no panels in there.
10077170	10077410	Wow.
10077430	10078530	No names or descriptions in there.
10078810	10081852	Someone really made you the bastard child of the convention.
10082132	10082853	Pretty much.
10083753	10084554	I'm sorry to hear that.
10084594	10084814	Yeah.
10085174	10090878	I mean, for those that haven't been to that little area in Chicago, you have to... I mean, that walkway is no short trip either.
10090898	10091178	No, it's not.
10091198	10092719	To get from one to the other.
10092779	10098342	So if you don't know where to go... I mean, during ASAN, you can figure it out because there's tons of people traveling through there all the time.
10098742	10101344	But yeah, if it's not being trafficked...
10102184	10103105	People don't know where to go.
10103625	10107007	And just to make this gaming related, they had a ton of gaming bootlegs there too.
10107027	10108848	People were selling full sets of ROMs on the floor.
10109189	10111610	They had a main cabinet going with a couple tournaments throughout the day.
10111910	10112631	That's pretty bold.
10113931	10114952	There was a gaming section.
10115132	10116113	Actually, it was kind of funny.
10116153	10118274	They had a Street Fighter 4 tournament, or they were supposed to.
10120255	10124438	They wanted people to pay $20 to enter, and of course no one did, so they didn't end up having it.
10126539	10127940	It was an interesting convention.
10127960	10131222	I can't say I'd want to go back, and if I didn't get a free badge, I don't think I would have gone.
10131704	10136326	But at least, you know, now you know, and at least it wasn't, like, that wasn't the focus.
10136566	10142188	I mean, you know, for, I guess, maybe a comic book convention, they probably did alright, but that's unfortunate, though.
10143308	10144188	Kind of a waste of time.
10145269	10149010	Can I complain about King of Fighters 12 a little bit, or do you want to end the Skype?
10149330	10150190	Of course you can.
10150230	10153131	I wanted to give the other guys a chance to say something, too, if they wanted to say anything.
10155052	10155432	It's fine.
10155452	10156032	You can go on.
10156052	10158613	We're busy playing World of Warcraft, actually.
10159333	10160814	Actually, I'm installing Windows 7.
10161604	10162124	DarkSakura.com
10189236	10190397	What's the ending?
10190417	10194161	Well, did you notice what they did, though, with the characters themselves is that they're sprite-wrapped 3D?
10194281	10194441	Mm-hmm.
10210825	10218408	It was very interesting, but it also causes some really weird just things that don't look right graphically with the characters themselves.
10218929	10220809	And on top of that, there's, like, no story.
10221870	10223330	Yeah, I love the animation in the game, though.
10223350	10227272	I mean, it's got the best animation of any game I've seen since Street Fighter 3, really.
10228172	10236916	The advantage, though, for them doing it in that manner is that if they want to change anything visually about the character, they can map it over the 3D model without changing movesets.
10237677	10237837	Yeah.
10239482	10242544	I'm just hoping we actually get those movesets back for the most part.
10242584	10245446	I mean, I'm a Clark Steele player, and he's got two moves.
10245906	10246446	Literally.
10246887	10248428	Is it just me, or is he over-roided?
10249548	10249848	Oh, yes.
10250189	10257813	It's going to be impossible for me to cosplay as Clark from now on, certainly in that style, unless I decide to go shopping with Hulk Hogan or Barry Bonds sometime soon.
10258194	10260995	I also didn't like that they did Athena in the cutesy anime style.
10262236	10263377	I don't mind that so much, actually.
10263657	10264477	That one's warmed up to me.
10264517	10268500	The change I... I'm a little bit iffy on Kenzo so far.
10268806	10269226	Yeah.
10269787	10273869	Well, I like, though, that it seems that... I like his outfit in that, though.
10273949	10276991	It seems like they're doing more towards the Psycho Soldier outfit.
10279192	10280193	What's up with No My?
10280573	10281173	That's a thing.
10281534	10281894	Yeah.
10282214	10282854	Isn't that weird?
10283155	10283375	I don't...
10284656	10287318	Well, the other thing that gets me is that there's no interaction between the characters.
10287378	10294903	Like, for example, you know, Leona, if you had Leona versus Heidern in the old game, she'd come out and salute him because he raised her in the storyline.
10295344	10298766	And, you know, you'd have the Mai and Andy thing about her taunting him over wanting a baby or something.
10300547	10302789	Uh-oh.
10303289	10304050	Are we losing you guys?
10304070	10304370	Hello?
10304950	10305331	Oh, hello?
10305431	10305671	Sorry.
10305771	10305971	Hi.
10307252	10309233	Uh, sorry, I think my Skype hiccuped a little bit there.
10309353	10309694	That's alright.
10309734	10310014	But, uh,
10310728	10313370	I don't know, people didn't really play as Mai that much to begin with.
10313410	10315411	I mean, they watched her bounce for the most part.
10315712	10316472	I liked Mai.
10316572	10319494	Mai is actually a staple of my team because I'm really good with her.
10320435	10321075	Fair enough.
10321956	10329881	Alright, well guys, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for the call and have fun with all your respective games, Windows 7 and WoW and whatever you're playing these days, Rob.
10330862	10332463	Right now I'm playing a lot of BlazBlue, actually.
10332583	10334345	That's what I've been playing all night and training.
10334665	10335145	Have fun with that.
10335165	10336506	Hope your Xbox 360 doesn't fry.
10336546	10340069	You'll be getting your TurboGrafx as soon as we get a paycheck in.
10340799	10341159	Yay!
10341299	10341979	I look forward to it.
10342379	10342619	All right.
10342859	10343540	Take care, guys.
10343600	10344380	Have a good one, everybody.
10345100	10345300	Later.
10345840	10346500	Later.
10348281	10348741	That's funny.
10348761	10352062	We don't get conference calls very often, but that was fun.
10352822	10358723	One of these days, I just want every single person listening to all make a mass Skype conference call and then call us.
10358783	10359803	It'll be complete chaos.
10359823	10361284	We can do SkypeCon all on Skype.
10361344	10362324	I'm on the radio!
10364380	10370044	Alright, let's start to wrap up guys tonight because it's already after 9 o'clock and we want to get out of here before it's too late.
10370824	10372065	But more last minute stories.
10372125	10373126	Loki, I don't know if you have anything else.
10373973	10374593	I have nothing else.
10375093	10375373	Really?
10375493	10375653	Wow.
10375713	10377054	It was kind of a slow news week this week.
10377074	10379694	Compared to other weeks, it was a little slow this week.
10379734	10381115	I have nothing else I want to talk about.
10381375	10382015	Let's put it that way.
10382095	10384735	There are other things to talk about, but there's nothing I want to talk about.
10384755	10385476	But nothing that big.
10385736	10386016	All right.
10386456	10386656	Fine.
10386696	10387076	Be that way.
10387416	10389776	I'm fighting spyware, and it's just pissing me off.
10389816	10390437	Oh, how annoying.
10390537	10391837	Well, it's stuff I have to do.
10391937	10394297	It's safe mode, and I don't feel like doing it right now.
10395498	10395838	It's just...
10397138	10402624	Searching for crap and then they get a wrong page and then it locks your system up because it wants to download spyware.
10402644	10403745	It's a pain in the ass.
10404485	10405086	You know what's funny?
10405106	10413354	Since everybody's talking about this Skype thing, I remember for a while, I don't know what ever happened with it, but they were talking about doing another show on all games after us, like a late night show or what have you.
10414415	10421581	And I think what would be cool is somebody should just host a Skype thing, like an OLR post show that's just a massive...
10422222	10423803	My dinner was really good, but I still want meat.
10423823	10424283	Tasty, tasty death.
10448220	10450001	My final thought is, I want yogurt.
10450021	10451042	It'd be yummy.
10451102	10451803	Ooh, Rob.
10451823	10454144	But all the yogurt places close Sunday.
10454164	10455485	But Baskin-Robbins is open.
10456266	10457767	We'd have to, like, not do afterbirth.
10459128	10459588	No, they close at 10.
10460349	10461490	We'd have to hurry through afterbirth.
10461830	10462791	Let's do afterbirth anyway.
10462811	10463211	I don't care.
10463311	10463571	All right.
10464032	10464912	We can go to the grocery store.
10465733	10475380	It's totally selfish of me, but I'm thinking of, because the arcade cabinet is technically my birthday gift because the wife is letting me have it, and that's a gift alone.
10476271	10483839	But I am going to open up the unofficial Loki's a Greedy Bastard birthday gift fund for Arcade Cabinet use.
10485399	10487661	So links will be in the form.
10488121	10493245	I will donate, and then I can feel guilt-free when I don't get you anything else.
10493926	10494466	That's fine.
10494547	10496508	You don't have to get me anything at all anyway.
10496949	10497769	That's what everyone says.
10498149	10498450	All right.
10499210	10503053	Let's go ahead and close up, guys, and call it a night.
10503094	10505776	Thank you guys, as always, for downloading and listening to our program.
10505796	10506757	We really appreciate it.
10507217	10510099	If you want to help us out, just help us spread the word.
10510179	10511480	Tell somebody you know about the show.
10512321	10514422	We'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
10514482	10515723	We'll be back to do it all again in seven days.
