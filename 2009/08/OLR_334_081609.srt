1
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:18,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, August 16, 2009, is there a Wii cushion on the horizon?

2
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Will the PlayStation 3 soon see you laughing?

3
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:24,877
[SPEAKER_13]: And could you soon be able to take a trip to Silent Hill for real?

4
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:35,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:42,951
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:54,478
[SPEAKER_04]: With you for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, as I used to call her every day on this week, DarkSakra, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:56,836
[SPEAKER_11]: How did that get started anyway?

8
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:57,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember.

9
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, because I had my Happy Bunny stuff for a while.

10
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,137
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to be obsessed with Happy Bunny, if I remember right.

11
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:04,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I think Happy Bunny's kind of stupid.

12
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:05,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

13
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Happy Bunny kind of junked the shark a little bit.

14
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you see Happy Bunny everywhere on everything.

15
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Bunny was cool and no one knew about it.

16
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:12,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

17
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:16,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,500
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Loki?

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:17,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the happiest bunny on the farm, Loki.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not a bunny on a farm.

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very quiet tonight, Loki.

24
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on?

25
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:26,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to remember a password.

26
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:28,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I got it.

27
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:28,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got it.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see what you're trying to log into.

29
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:35,885
[SPEAKER_05]: RomaniSows is what I'm logging into.

30
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to download torrents, but to read their forms.

31
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:38,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

32
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,009
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so important on their forms?

33
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

34
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see if some guy returned my PM.

35
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:45,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And he didn't.

36
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:45,633
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a bastard.

37
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,354
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought he said read their porn.

38
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are corresponding with Loki, you should write him back.

39
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass.

40
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:52,879
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's alright.

41
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

42
00:01:53,863 --> 00:02:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I was second in line for a System 573 board, but I probably don't need it now, so it's alright.

43
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:03,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You are very quiet tonight, and I can't figure out why.

44
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try turning up your mic a little bit.

45
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The beauty of live radio, boys and girls.

46
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you meant like I wasn't saying a lot, not that I was quiet.

47
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like you were actually quiet on the mic.

48
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:12,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you were too loud.

49
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're good now.

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So there we go.

52
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:38,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The joy of live radio as we tape live here on Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com live after the Bobby Blackwolf show I have an announcement You have an announcement, yes Rob had chicken for dinner I did, it was delicious You didn't get me any Grilled chicken I had chicken and a biscuit It still smells like chicken in this room and it's driving me nuts I was hungry, I literally had nothing to eat today I'm gonna make my husband bring me some food You should do that, that's why you got married, right?

53
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it'd be my manservant I too had chicken for dinner Did you?

54
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes What kind of chicken did you have?

55
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I had chicken covered with Ritz cracker bits

56
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:05,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I refuse to eat there.

57
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's attached to Pizza Hut.

58
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Wing Street.

59
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:10,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

60
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably that food at Wings Stop.

61
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooters' wings are worse for you.

62
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:23,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they?

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But Hooters' wings are good.

64
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:25,952
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not.

65
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:26,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're not.

66
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:27,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Hooters' wings are good.

67
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything at Hooters sucks.

68
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the women suck.

69
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything at Hooters is awful.

70
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:34,319
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with this picture?

71
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to keep the dirty comment down.

72
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with this picture?

73
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Hooters more than anyone else in this room.

74
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Their food, I have given their food like three different chances, and...

75
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, not only is their food bad, but their service is worse.

76
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's absolute crap.

77
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:51,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Their hot sauce tastes like too much vinegar.

78
00:03:51,826 --> 00:04:00,168
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, I went in one time and I decided, okay, I'm gonna get a burger and what the hell, let's get, order the wings because everyone's raving about the wings and stuff.

79
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Ordered the burger, the burger took an hour for me to get at my table.

80
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:11,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The wings, mind you, which is their staple food that they serve there, took two hours to get to me.

81
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're neon orange.

82
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Loki's too loud.

83
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:13,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

84
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,916
[SPEAKER_05]: and they tasted like shit.

85
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:16,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

86
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Get him angry then he'll be like.

87
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only that.

88
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried the normal like their normal hot wings or whatever.

90
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,707
[SPEAKER_05]: They tasted like shit.

91
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried them like a different flavor.

92
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different flavor of shit.

93
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:27,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just.

94
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:28,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's.

95
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's.

96
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:30,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Awful.

97
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,458
[SPEAKER_05]: There is nothing good at that place.

98
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:36,161
[SPEAKER_05]: All their food sucks, and if you go for the ambience, you're stupid.

99
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get better food at a strip club.

100
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:38,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding?

101
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,625
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I went to Hooters was Victoria and I. We were like, where should we go eat?

102
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:42,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Hooters!

103
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:43,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went.

104
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:43,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fun.

105
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,008
[SPEAKER_04]: We were laughing the whole time.

106
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Our waitress had big boobies, and we were making fun of her, but in a positive way.

107
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, okay?

108
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Strip club food is not very good.

109
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It was better than Hooters.

110
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:55,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

111
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,444
[SPEAKER_05]: At a strip club, I'm not going to just have to imagine naked boobies.

112
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see them firsthand.

113
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

114
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's just not worth my time.

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question about Hooters.

116
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember that E3?

117
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:19,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably 2004, 2005, when we were staying at the ghetto motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard.

118
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what inspired us to say there.

119
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I ought to be young and in our 20s again.

120
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:29,808
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be staying at that ghetto motel 6, and we had to walk up Hollywood Boulevard,

121
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Through a concert that Jimmy Kimmel Live was doing or something to get to Hooters.

122
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were like, hadn't you never been there at that point?

123
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been there.

124
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:38,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

125
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:42,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Loki, you're like a manly man and you've never been to Hooters.

126
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:45,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, don't tell me you're going to make a gay man take you to Hooters.

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So eventually a gay man did have to take him to Hooters.

128
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So he went to Hooters.

129
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was our first experience.

130
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:53,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, his first experience at a Hooters.

131
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess it wasn't favorable.

132
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:56,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

133
00:05:56,808 --> 00:06:01,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just also getting there took us like 30 minutes when it was just like a block up the street.

134
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: We could see it, but it took a half an hour to get there.

135
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:06,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow.

136
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,101
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:37,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I really like it for its classic RPG-osity.

138
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,984
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been pretty fun for me.

139
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:51,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I also played through Raiden Fighters Aces and nearly beat the game, except that I was in a lot of pain when I was playing it.

140
00:06:52,509 --> 00:07:03,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was really more that I was just going to play for a little bit of it and then put it aside, but I actually played all the way through.

141
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:13,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I kept getting to the last stage, and because my hand hurt so bad, I couldn't hit the fire button fast enough, so I kept also not counteracting the fire that was coming at me and kept dying.

142
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:19,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And it turns out that when you have to continue, it starts you off from the beginning of the stage.

143
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:34,760
[SPEAKER_11]: and I just said you know what fuck a bunch of this and you know I'm not gonna do it so I uh I put it down and then promptly went to go put my hand in a big thing of ice water cause it really really hurt and um

144
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:41,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I also played a lot of the Namco Museum package that we picked up.

145
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:48,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just some Galaga and some Pac-Man.

146
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this the 360 compilation?

147
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:56,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is like the Galaga Resurrection and some of the arcade titles they've put out over the past couple years.

148
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:58,050
[SPEAKER_11]: They kind of butchered the Galaga...

149
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:23,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I had more fun going back and playing Galaga 88 Dan and I were actually talking about this is more fun on TurboGrafx It's not a bad collection, it's a really good collection I love Namco, yay Namco, kiss kiss We were going to play some Symphony of the Night and as it turned out, Dan hasn't authorized our Xbox yet

150
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't play it.

151
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though we have it on his account, I can't play it.

152
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like... So then I started playing a lot of Blue Dragon.

153
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love, love, love, love, love Blue Dragon.

154
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just got back to their village.

155
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,382
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone who's played the game knows where that is.

156
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:41,702
[SPEAKER_11]: What part of the game I'm at.

157
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that game took a lot of shit for being kind of generic, for being kind of not that impressive, some people have said, for considering who all's behind it.

158
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:52,964
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

159
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:54,084
[SPEAKER_11]: They can bite me.

160
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,072
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

161
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:25,751
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, it has the charm of... I've noticed this typically about games that Toriyama designs, that they tend to have that charm that comes with his art style.

162
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love that.

163
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:29,672
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fantastic for me.

164
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:33,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And Uematsu's music, I mean, oh my god, Uematsu.

165
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:34,693
[SPEAKER_11]: It made me happy.

166
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:39,214
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I get that, but I'm way more about Lost Odyssey than I was Blue Dragon.

167
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:45,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think Blue Dragon was as terrible as a lot of folks made it out to be, but I just thought it was, eh, it's aight.

168
00:09:52,135 --> 00:10:02,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new story, something to play through, but something that you can pick up that will automatically be familiar to you.

169
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:09,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So for me, it's been filling my must-play Super Nintendo with a more comfortable controller.

170
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,237
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course I've been playing Sims 3.

171
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:17,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I started another family because the game decided to fart on one of mine.

172
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:27,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, technically what happened is that someone turned off my computer while I was in the middle of a game and didn't save said game.

173
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,692
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was either the spouse or Windows updates, which I thought I had turned those off too.

174
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:36,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whatever.

175
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:39,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I've also been playing on Gaia.

176
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:41,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the booty grab.

177
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:46,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com for questions and comments.

178
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:53,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Ayanami asked DarkSakura, hold it, which game on RFA, which is Raiden Fighters, and was it on one credit?

179
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:59,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, actually, no, because like I said, my hand hurt a lot, so I played the first one.

180
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:11,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, you know, I was really just gonna sit down and see what it was like, because I hadn't played the Aces ones, so I played through and...

181
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:29,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I really don't have the fine control that I used to because, like I said, my hand has been sticking with a suture in it, and my tendons are healing themselves, so I haven't really been able to play like I might have a few years ago.

182
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,245
[SPEAKER_11]: So, no, I didn't do it on one credit.

183
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully in a couple months that'll be all better, right?

184
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:37,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, when it's all better, I'm going to be going back to R-Type.

185
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:39,889
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

186
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how about you and your gaming week?

187
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:43,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I played DDR, that was it.

188
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:45,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I played is DDR.

189
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Not DDR, what the hell am I talking about?

190
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:48,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play any DDR.

191
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a DDR freak, so, you know.

192
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:51,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

193
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,517
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually kind of noteworthy.

194
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:56,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you actually started exercising.

195
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

196
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:01,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually I will, but no, I'm a green DDR freak, so.

197
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:08,109
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto all week long, and we have been recording our multiplayer games.

198
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Grand Theft Auto and DDR have so much in common.

199
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's a three-letter acronym I was looking to say, and I was staring at DDR Freak, that's why I made the slip, okay?

200
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

201
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:25,795
[SPEAKER_04]: With all due respect to the many friends I made on there, including you guys, since when was DDR Freak relevant again?

202
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:27,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

203
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at... I'm trying to... Okay.

204
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:31,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have my pads that I've built.

205
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:33,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember when I built them?

206
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:34,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, it was that long ago.

207
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used them since... No, I haven't used them since then.

208
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I have them sitting in my garage.

209
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:52,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just seeing if it's going to be more advantageous to actually purchase some already pre-done arcade-style pads for DDR.

210
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:53,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

211
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,118
[SPEAKER_05]: or should I just fix it?

212
00:12:56,138 --> 00:13:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now I have to ground the pads because the static electricity being built up by the Lexin arrows, it causes the thing I have it attached to to interpret the keys to short out because it just builds up static electricity and shocks it.

213
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not good because it'll stop working after about two minutes.

214
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:18,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have to reboot the whole computer.

215
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:20,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

216
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto

217
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

218
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:18,645
[SPEAKER_05]: something funny and set the music as good because the Orange Launch Radio channel needs more content it's in HD so it'll be awesome yeah because that new capture thing I have is awesome it works so well so it'll make things a lot easier for capturing video to put on the site

219
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting an arcade cabinet.

220
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

221
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it an actual game or what is it?

222
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:49,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an arcade cabinet.

223
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the cabinet?

224
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

225
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:52,164
[SPEAKER_04]: For what?

226
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,026
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you plan to put on it?

227
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:54,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Mame.

228
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:55,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Mame.

229
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:55,987
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR.

230
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

231
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a candy cabinet.

232
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what a candy cabinet is?

233
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't the slightest idea what that is.

234
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:06,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You know those cabinets that line Arcade Infinity?

235
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:08,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, like the ones you sit down and play?

236
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:08,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

237
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:09,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

238
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:10,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a candy cabinet.

239
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:10,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

240
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,658
[SPEAKER_04]: The Japanese style ones.

241
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:11,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

242
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those are pretty cool.

243
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's a deal going on.

244
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,060
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Neo Geo forums or whatever.

245
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it looking for something else, actually.

246
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at one time I wanted to buy a DDR machine.

247
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:29,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I had to scale down my wishes because a DDR machine would cost me at least $2,500.

248
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:31,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably more than that.

249
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:33,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just not affordable.

250
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So a candy cab, actually, I'm looking at was a new Astro City machine.

251
00:15:40,347 --> 00:16:05,733
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a Sega made one and it's supposed to run somewhere around $450 I think and they're basically doing a big bulk shipment and they have some extras available they're being shipped to San Francisco so hopefully I'm trying to get the guy to send me a personal message again so I can actually put down a deposit for it because they're supposed to be coming between now and September so

252
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:14,541
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome, because then I'm going to hook it up to become like a little, short, stubby DDR machine.

253
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,803
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure it's actually DDR and not Grand Theft Auto?

254
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be both.

255
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we were thinking about getting one of those for all of our Neo Geo.

256
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you should act on this.

257
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, 400 bucks and they're shipping them already.

258
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they're already on a boat.

259
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on a boat?

260
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,434
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already on a boat on the way here.

261
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:36,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they're on a motherfucking boat.

262
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're already on their way over.

263
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:41,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, he's trying to sell 30 of them.

264
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, he's going to keep them and sell them for higher.

265
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:48,120
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

266
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see my gaming week.

267
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:09,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Wednesday, we all got a patch on Xbox Live, right?

268
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:16,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody had to update to this new patch that added all this new stuff in Netflix and blah, blah, blah.

269
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of changed some things with the achievements and so on.

270
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to download that and I'm messing with the achievements and stuff for a little bit.

271
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought I'd look at Netflix and I like the fact that you can add the movies from the Netflix channel now.

272
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of browse through what new movies are out and things.

273
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was pretty awesome.

274
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I turn it off and I'm off doing other things for a while.

275
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:38,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm bored, so I put a tweet up on Twitter that says, Hi, I'm bored.

276
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to play Rock Band?

277
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of the OLR listeners are like, Me, me, me.

278
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So they invite me into a game.

279
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: We're playing some Rock Band.

280
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Da-da-da-da-da.

281
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to step away for a little bit because I've got to do some other errands real quick.

282
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:49,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got other things I've got to do.

283
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:56,649
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I go back after about 20 minutes, turn on the Xbox 360 again, and then... It starts doing... That's actually the sound it makes.

284
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It just starts throwing up everywhere and making all these like...

285
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:00,892
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

286
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:32,696
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a handful of people on Twitter who claim that happened, but I made this whole YouTube and I posted it to the Orange Entree channel and most people are telling me, nah, you just have lucky timing and your system's about to red ring.

287
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can fucking tell that.

288
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:35,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously about to red ring.

289
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's broken already.

290
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not getting past a certain point, red ring or not.

291
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So, congratulations me, my Xbox is broke.

292
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:48,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And, wouldn't you know it, I'm just outside the three year warranty thing.

293
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That means they can open it up.

294
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like three years and six months after it.

295
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,196
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I get to open it up.

296
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:53,964
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to open it up?

297
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:54,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

298
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:55,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We can fix it.

299
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:57,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I fixed one out of two.

300
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a few.

301
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:00,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, goody.

302
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, 50% is better than 0%.

303
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like my trauma center record.

304
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:06,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I don't know.

305
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:15,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of all about fixing it, but at the same time, I'm like, you know, and there's a story later on about price cuts, and I'm like, maybe I'll just wait and just get the elite system because I kind of want the new stuff.

306
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:16,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But hold on a minute.

307
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I allowing myself to think this way?

308
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:22,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I even need to be worrying about repairs and so on in the first place?

309
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

310
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:40,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You're preaching to the choir, okay?

311
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I have five systems that have died, okay?

312
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: My Dreamcast is ten years old and still works.

313
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been celebrating the Genesis on Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight.

314
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:50,304
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking a lot about that.

315
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That just celebrated its 20th anniversary.

316
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, those still work.

317
00:19:54,026 --> 00:20:01,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a room full of consoles that are older than most of our listeners' ages combined in the back room of my house that, guess what?

318
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:03,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Still work!

319
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:06,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the Atari 7800, but it's the hour supply, so let's not talk about that.

320
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

321
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

322
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll see you in the next one.

323
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,708
[SPEAKER_11]: to bring in a more sociological aspect to it.

324
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, this is the way the world is.

325
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Because your initial systems were broken.

326
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:10,134
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the fact that people would rather be complacent than put any effort into changing a situation in general.

327
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:14,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And so enough people just let it go and they can get away with it.

328
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:17,837
[SPEAKER_11]: But enough people complain about something and something might eventually happen.

329
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:18,818
[SPEAKER_11]: You know...

330
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,269
[SPEAKER_11]: If they think that they can get away with it this long, they're just going to keep getting away with it.

331
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:26,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Until enough people hold them accountable.

332
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,582
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all there is to that.

333
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: All I have to say is that it just sucks.

334
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing just sucks, and Microsoft sucks, and you suck for not making more of a stink about it.

335
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Not you specifically, but you as gamers in general.

336
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:45,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suck for not realizing this before, and everything sucks.

337
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that I'm going to have to buy a new 360 sucks too.

338
00:21:53,883 --> 00:22:05,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft is apologizing to me in chat, but you don't need to apologize.

339
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not your fault.

340
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop apologizing.

341
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,153
[SPEAKER_04]: People who apologize for things that aren't their fault sucks.

342
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:12,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

343
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:17,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact that it broke during a Rock Band 2 OL Army session nonetheless sucks.

344
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:41,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's actually the big thing that I think is a problem with the industry as it is now, with almost anything actually, is that too many people are just more willing to, oh, I don't want a conflict, I don't want to put the effort into it, I don't want to do this about it, oh, well, that's just how it is, that's how things are going to be, you know?

345
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:41,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

346
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:43,658
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

348
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:33,259
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I want.

349
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,561
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I want every media outlet.

350
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,302
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I want every person.

351
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:42,727
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I want every gamer to ask Microsoft about their new system.

352
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it last more than three years?

353
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:48,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this system red ring?

354
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:54,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the questions I want Microsoft to be asked to their face and have to answer.

355
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I trust you that your system is not another pile of poop?

356
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:00,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it.

357
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this hasn't been done yet.

358
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:12,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that what we should do also is, and this is actually something as a community, have you ever heard of a site called starbucked.com?

359
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,426
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but is this stuff to do with Battlestar Galactica?

360
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:15,786
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

361
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:27,553
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about a person who had such a horrible customer service experience with Starbucks that he created a consumer advocacy site so that people could voice their concerns regarding problems they've had with Starbucks and other things.

362
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:33,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And his problem was actually something that could have been fixed if one person had gotten off their ass and helped him properly.

363
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:41,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that I should make a site, and don't nobody make it for me unless you want to make me an admin of it, is a red-ringed

364
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:44,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's gotta be a site like that already.

365
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at work on Friday and I mentioned we had some downtime because our systems were down and I mentioned, oh yeah, my Xbox.

366
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:26,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And people I never suspected even played video games like outside of like Madden and stuff were saying, oh, you got the Red Rings, huh?

367
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:27,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got that too.

368
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And like everybody in class was piping up, oh yeah, the Red Rings.

369
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know the Red Rings.

370
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

371
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:44,993
[SPEAKER_11]: If I pulled up everything on Twitter that had Red Ring of Death, printed it out in black and white, because I want to save my color cartridges, and mailed the stack of papers to Microsoft and go, look!

372
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they do anything, because people are still buying 360s.

373
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,553
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's it do?

374
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:57,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't boot up now, or does it just not play your games?

375
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It does a blblbl thing after it's been on like two minutes.

376
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes during the boot, sometimes while I'm in the middle of a game.

377
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:04,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter.

378
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:08,405
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I haven't really tried it since that one night.

379
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:11,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's where I'm at.

380
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:20,781
[SPEAKER_11]: To be perfectly honest though, I think we're on our third 360, but keep in mind we have an advantage.

381
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the history of gaming to put a black mark on, excuse me, a red mark on Xbox.

382
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,747
[SPEAKER_04]: A red ring around the Xbox.

383
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: A red ring on the Xbox 360 for this travesty.

384
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that they're covering it up very well.

385
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, has there been any console in history that has the hardware issues that the 360 has?

386
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:51,164
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why they, I think, are being able to keep their head afloat regarding everything is the fact that they've been so quick to replace systems, too.

387
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:55,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, Rob, I think you should still give a call, give a try.

388
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:58,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, hey, I bought this before...

389
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,912
[SPEAKER_11]: All this was going on, you guys owe me.

390
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:04,592
[SPEAKER_11]: See what happens.

391
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,775
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want to keep your business as a customer, they're going to bend over backwards.

392
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby says the PS2.

393
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby actually says a lot in chat.

394
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:13,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read some of the comments from chat.

395
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby says, Microsoft knows, they know, they won't admit it, but they know.

396
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he says his original Xbox still works.

397
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:25,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So does mine.

398
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:26,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine does too.

399
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:33,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes on to say the difference between the PS2 and the 360 is that there were no blogs when the PS2s were failing in mass.

400
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's certainly a legitimate viewpoint.

401
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:35,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

402
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:37,341
[SPEAKER_04]: See, here's the thing, though.

403
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anyone that had a PS2 that failed outside of people I've met on the internet.

404
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:45,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when I was gaming, I didn't know anybody that had a failed PS2.

405
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:46,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine didn't fail.

406
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:48,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, like, 50 people that have had 360s fail.

407
00:27:48,523 --> 00:27:50,664
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I have a first model Japanese PS2.

408
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:51,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

409
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:52,724
[SPEAKER_11]: It still works.

410
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my Japanese PS2 still works too.

411
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:20,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby says, I'm on my fifth PS2 and you met me in person.

412
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:21,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

413
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I mean.

414
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:30,839
[SPEAKER_11]: My Japanese PS2 still works perfectly and those are the ones that were definitely having problems back in the day.

415
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,142
[SPEAKER_11]: My PS2 that I have now works perfectly.

416
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a stack of PS1s, by the way.

417
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages and the free repair of any console rendered unusable by the update.

418
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:08,438
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be the second such lawsuit filed against Microsoft, the first having been filed in 2005, shortly after the da-da-da, etc.

419
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:14,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, not enough people had their consoles borked by this update, and people are telling me up and down it wasn't the update.

420
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:20,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is that it sure is convenient timing for this to happen.

421
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried running it without the hard drive?

422
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:23,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't.

423
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:23,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I try that?

424
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:24,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

425
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll try that and see what happens.

426
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see you next time.

427
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:58,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, other stuff I played my gaming week, because I have much more in my gaming week than just Abort360 that I still... By the way, my resolution right now is I'm not doing anything until this rumored price drop we'll get to later in the show.

428
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll get it repaired, I don't know.

429
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I'm leaning towards just getting a new 360.

430
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:09,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a new one and make sure it's a new Elite, not an older Elite that people have been sitting on forever that...

431
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,227
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'll try and do.

432
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:22,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, what I wanted to get into elsewhere in my gaming week, because this is something that deserves positive talk and not negative talk, is Ion Online I played a little more of.

433
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: They had their next closed beta, I guess the final one.

434
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the second closed beta I've participated in.

435
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:51,972
[SPEAKER_04]: and I got to play the game a lot more than two weeks ago the first time I played the beta for Ion Online I still feel like I've only really scratched the surface of the game and I was having a lot of problems with graphics stuff the game doesn't work too hot with Vista but I found if I ran in full screen windowed mode I was able to get a much better frame rate so you know just you have to really tinker with those settings and at least they've made it very customizable in the graphics and so on

436
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:52,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

437
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:53,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarok Online has that.

438
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:20,327
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

439
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:46,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play.

440
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:46,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

441
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm reading comments from chat here.

442
00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:30,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, to publicly acknowledge it because it keeps going back and forth in chat, I am aware that CC Gaming repairs 360s and would also take the 360 for scrap.

443
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't decided what I want to do yet.

444
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:37,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'd have to ship it, which is going to be money, but I don't know.

445
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:43,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some time to think and try these other solutions too before I just commit to one particular solution.

446
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:46,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So certainly that's something I'm heavily considering.

447
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:47,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

448
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:52,124
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it for our gaming weeks.

449
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:54,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into... Here, I have a present for you.

450
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:55,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this present?

451
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, present.

452
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of my more obscure Bimani stuff.

453
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You burned me a DVD mini.

454
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:00,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

455
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember you used to use CD minis all the time.

456
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:03,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's DVD minis.

457
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:10,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's because they were cheap by the spindle, and the pre-show fit on them perfectly.

458
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,281
[SPEAKER_11]: All my stuff was just fine.

459
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,103
[SPEAKER_11]: But the next one I'm going to burn you is an actual DVD.

460
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:14,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

461
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:23,307
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, of which we don't have a lot, but we will continue to plug our Twitter at OLR, and then, of course, we're on Facebook as the OL Army.

462
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:25,328
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a MySpace, supposedly, too.

463
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anyone on MySpace anymore?

464
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we had some friend requests there the other day, so I guess we do.

465
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:32,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, LiveJournal, Orange Launch.

466
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:34,033
[SPEAKER_12]: MySpace is so 2005.

467
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:34,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

468
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:39,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's get into some gaming news, then, and we'll start with Loki.

469
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:46,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is a couple rumors regarding some Wii software, one of which is, of course, Wii Fit.

470
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:51,465
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a rumored price point for it, which, of course, not too surprising.

471
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:54,447
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the bundle at the $89.99 price point, which is...

472
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,371
[SPEAKER_05]: or I should say $99.99 price point.

473
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little higher, that's kind of weird.

474
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:04,835
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, that's pretty close to what the normal Wii Fit bundle is.

475
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:10,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Then of course, the rumor is the standalone game is going to be $29.99 as well.

476
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:16,825
[SPEAKER_05]: No word exactly on when those are going to be officially announced, but I don't know, it sounds about right to me.

477
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:24,210
[SPEAKER_05]: $29.99 for a game that's not too different than the original, sounds fair, I guess.

478
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:25,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

479
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:34,110
[SPEAKER_05]: The other weird thing, though, that they have... And this is also coming from a marketing survey, apparently.

480
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:45,233
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a slide that shows what appears to be some sort of new peripheral that's going to be with a game that's like a bicycling game.

481
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:52,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And the peripheral itself actually looks like one of those... Oh, gosh, what's...

482
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,025
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

484
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:30,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do almost like a prop copter type thing.

485
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:36,085
[SPEAKER_05]: You can rotate one of the things to spin a rotisserie barbecue.

486
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:39,767
[SPEAKER_05]: They have downhill racing, you name it.

487
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:44,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the usual calorie tracking and that kind of stuff.

488
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:48,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, it looks kind of cool and definitely something I could see on the Wii.

489
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:50,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no word on what that is.

490
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:52,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing it's probably a third party putting that out.

491
00:35:52,873 --> 00:35:54,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably someone like Ubisoft or...

492
00:35:55,234 --> 00:36:23,364
[SPEAKER_04]: EA or something well it wouldn't surprise me too that if one of these like bicycling things got picked up because it seems like at E3 remember when there was like Kensha Hall and everything we would see something like this demoed down there like a bicycling exercise game so there's some companies exploring this have been for a long time I wouldn't be surprised if it even was Nintendo doing it or something just maybe that one screenshot's kind of misleading because the one character doesn't look like a me but I mean everything doesn't have to look like a me in the games but who knows yeah

493
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:33,228
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is, it sort of looks like an island setting, and I know that they've talked about, you know, putting the other games on that stupid island that they created for Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort.

494
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Fit's on an island?

495
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:38,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have, like, the Jogging is on an island.

496
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:40,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's right, okay.

497
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:43,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know if it's the same island, but it's very similar.

498
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Skinny Island, what would the name of that island be?

499
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Woohoo Island or something.

500
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo Island?

501
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:49,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what they called it.

502
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:51,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo, I'm not fat anymore, yay!

503
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: or Sex Island as Sims would call it.

504
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:58,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

505
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:00,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

506
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

507
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be more excited about the pedal thing than I would be the Wii Fit balance board because at least the pedal thing, you know, it seems like exercise whereas the balance board, you're just kind of standing there leaning back and forth.

508
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:14,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

509
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:27,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, our good friend Bobby just piping up with all sorts of trivia tonight saying Miyamoto wants that to become one of the new characters that is indeed Woohoo Island is the name of where all this takes place.

510
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:32,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't want to see any other like games with the island, you know, running around doing stuff, you know.

511
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:36,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario at Woohoo Island, you know, killing Koopas, or... Oh, wait for it.

512
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:37,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll happen.

513
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:38,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the new Smash Bros.

514
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:40,890
[SPEAKER_05]: game with Woohoo Island as a playable character.

515
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I betcha.

516
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be a stage.

517
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:42,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a stage.

518
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:43,990
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it'll be a character.

519
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,391
[SPEAKER_04]: The island is a character.

520
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:46,431
[SPEAKER_05]: The island will be a character.

521
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:48,491
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it himself, that the island's a character.

522
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:50,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoiler right there.

523
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:54,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how do you face off against a whole island?

524
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:55,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.

525
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:57,743
[SPEAKER_09]: X-Men did it.

526
00:37:58,183 --> 00:37:59,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Giant Size X-Men number one.

527
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:00,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

528
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:01,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

529
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:04,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Told you I'm a geek.

530
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

531
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,891
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think of this?

532
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this bicycle peripheral something that would interest you guys, or no?

533
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:17,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be interesting to see it, but once again, I'd probably use it about as much as I do Wii Fit.

534
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:21,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Fit, though, it fills the space underneath my TV stand.

535
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,021
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

536
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:24,962
[SPEAKER_11]: You should lend it to me.

537
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

538
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:49,627
[SPEAKER_04]: If the game was fun and the bike thing actually worked, because she's actually sitting on the couch or something, right?

539
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:50,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's sitting on the couch using the pedal.

540
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bike is kind of there.

541
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:55,550
[SPEAKER_04]: If that is actually sturdy, then that might be cool.

542
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

543
00:38:57,912 --> 00:38:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see.

544
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:00,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I like exercise bikes and stuff.

545
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:02,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a fun way to do it.

546
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

547
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:06,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I can go to my gym and play my Game Boy on the bike.

548
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:08,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's also how much a month?

549
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:10,599
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't pay a whole lot for my gym.

550
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:11,760
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm out of contract.

551
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:12,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

552
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:20,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to some other news, talking about something on the DS as opposed to the Nintendo Wii.

553
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:26,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest IX, of course, was a huge game over in Japan when it came out, as all Dragon Quest games are.

554
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:29,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, of course, the question is, when is it going to come out over here?

555
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:38,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, there was a Q&A session this week with investors, and the president of Squeenix, Yoishi Wada, said that they are considering...

556
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:44,765
[SPEAKER_04]: releasing Dragon Quest IX overseas and still deciding which regions are actually going to get it.

557
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:48,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't plan to release it until after April of 2010.

558
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,109
[SPEAKER_05]: They're assholes is basically what it is.

559
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:51,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm serious.

560
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:52,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like...

561
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:54,646
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

562
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:18,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII

563
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I'm going to say something that I know is going to piss some people off, but I kind of don't care because I'm just keeping it real.

564
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:46,764
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the case when I support piracy, honestly.

565
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:53,627
[SPEAKER_04]: When these foreign companies are too stubborn to release the games over here, I say, you know what?

566
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:57,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Then if you can understand Japanese, copy the Japanese one and get it.

567
00:40:57,328 --> 00:40:58,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you even have to worry about that?

568
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:04,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have people that will translate it, and then they'll add a patch to the ROM, and boom, it's in English.

569
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:11,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm going to take some flack for that comment, but I kind of don't care, because I was doing that with DDR years ago, when they refused to release that over here.

570
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:12,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

571
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:17,239
[SPEAKER_04]: When they finally released it over here, I bought every single one, even when they were crap, for quite a while.

572
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And Konami thanks you for that by releasing even crappier games.

573
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:21,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

574
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:22,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lesson we learned there?

575
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:24,003
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't matter.

576
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:27,745
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just... This kind of news that, like, they just...

577
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:37,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about, like, I understand resources and that there's other games they want to do and maybe they want to do some things that are outside the box and so forth, but I don't know.

578
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:44,628
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing kind of just reeks of, and we just don't feel like it right now, type thing.

579
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:53,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And some folks in chat, GameGuru says, Mother 3 in Actdeft speaks up with the Mother 3 fan translation.

580
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm all for that too.

581
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:09,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they just won't take... I can't imagine it takes that long to translate a game, especially when you have fans that translate it for you.

582
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:12,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's got to be the ultimate kick in the pants.

583
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:15,092
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have these fan companies beating you to it.

584
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:18,814
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are paid 40 hours a week to do this.

585
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

586
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:20,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

587
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:31,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, though, that when they do it themselves, not only do they have to pay translator, they have to pay writer.

588
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:42,095
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to take the time to change anything in-game graphically that they need to translate from one language to another.

589
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:45,976
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to pay someone to localize it.

590
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:51,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that other people might have gotten because the joke is... It was actually a pun, you know?

591
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:19,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So, really, there are things that are lost in translation that you do have to go through reorganizing for the cultural element to make it something that would be understood by your audience.

592
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:27,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there is actually a good deal of cost that comes in with the translation process when you are paying for it.

593
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,581
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

594
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:52,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Production cost in the actual physical copies of the game.

595
00:43:52,937 --> 00:43:55,379
[SPEAKER_11]: There's shipment.

596
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,760
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to deal with a lot of money.

597
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That they would make back on Dragon Quest IX?

598
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:09,007
[SPEAKER_11]: But when they also, and again I'm doing this straight from a business perspective, they have to look at previous sales and look at what their overhead was versus how much they actually made.

599
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:13,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because their last few games that they've localized over here, at least on the 360 and stuff, haven't done that great.

600
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:17,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Star Ocean, Last Hope wasn't all that great.

601
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,576
[SPEAKER_05]: The Last Remnant was not that great at all.

602
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The game itself wasn't that great.

603
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the one before that, which I don't remember the name off the top of my head, but that didn't do that well either.

604
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:27,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

605
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:29,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

606
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:30,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that Infinite Undiscovery?

607
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:31,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Infinite Undiscovery.

608
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's just a lot of weird stuff that they're doing.

609
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, Chrono Trigger did alright, but I mean, shit, dude.

610
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:41,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a ROM that they're basically running off an emulator.

611
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's basically all they did.

612
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't tell me that they programmed the engine from scratch and rebuilt the game.

613
00:44:47,923 --> 00:44:49,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't buy that at all.

614
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could totally see them going the route of like,

615
00:44:55,185 --> 00:44:57,087
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

616
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:22,330
[SPEAKER_05]: and their tactical... I don't remember the other Final Fantasy tactical game that they had.

617
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:32,018
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tower Defense one is kind of just... This is alright, but they haven't really been having that many good hits lately.

618
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:39,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than Final Fantasy 4 and 3 and stuff like that on DS, when they actually remade them, that was kind of cool.

619
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:42,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's effort put into it, and it's Final Fantasy...

620
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:44,662
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

621
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:09,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at some comments in chat.

622
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:17,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Gripper01, excuse me, I'm chewing ice here, says, plus with fan translations, they are not censored like the early Final Fantasy translations.

623
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:28,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, GameGuru is saying, Atlus even offered to publish Mother 3 for Nintendo, and Nintendo of Japan denied it.

624
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:32,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess this whole back and forth is that because of all the parody in the games...

625
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:39,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo of America is afraid of getting sued, so they want to make some changes, and Nintendo of Japan won't let them.

626
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:42,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just weird, that whole mess.

627
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:47,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they released it on a virtual console or something like that?

628
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother 3 is a DS game, so no.

629
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:52,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Game Boy Advance game, but they could still do it.

630
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:54,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

631
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:56,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's basically a Super Nintendo game.

632
00:46:58,203 --> 00:46:59,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Money, it all comes down to money.

633
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

634
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:29,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's move on with some more news while I steam over not having Dragon Quest IX.

635
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:34,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's not that bad because this is a DS game and I don't have the attention span for DS games, so whatever.

636
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:41,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about something else that you'd have to have a bit of an attention span if you plan on finishing it at all?

637
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:43,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Mega Man 9.

638
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,481
[SPEAKER_11]: There's new download content.

639
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:46,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And guess what it does?

640
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:47,743
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes the game harder!

641
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:48,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

642
00:47:49,525 --> 00:47:51,528
[SPEAKER_11]: You have superhero mode!

643
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:53,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Which costs a dollar.

644
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:55,813
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole dollar?

645
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,593
[SPEAKER_11]: A whole dollar.

646
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:57,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 80 Microsoft points.

647
00:48:00,362 --> 00:48:07,829
[SPEAKER_11]: and it basically just keeps it increases the number of enemies that you're going to see on screen at any given time in the game.

648
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,892
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's for all you people who want the next big challenge.

649
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:14,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically for people who like Asshole Mario.

650
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:18,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Or who have those leftover points that you just can't seem to get rid of.

651
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:21,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I have leftover points that I can't seem to get rid of.

652
00:48:21,138 --> 00:48:24,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is in multiples of 100, except rock band songs.

653
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool if they did that for Super Mario Bros.

654
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:29,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Like re-release Mario Bros.

655
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:33,146
[SPEAKER_05]: with a level editor or something like that, and then have it where you can share levels online.

656
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:36,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that would be innovative and used online, so Nintendo would never buy that.

657
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:39,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But a perfect example of something you can do...

658
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:40,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple.

659
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to actually program really a whole ton to it.

660
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:44,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Release it.

661
00:48:45,399 --> 00:48:46,399
[SPEAKER_05]: People would love it.

662
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd get a lot of money back.

663
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:50,561
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to put a lot of effort in.

664
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Nintendo certainly doesn't do that.

665
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:55,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but then they'd get sued for copying LittleBigPlanet.

666
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm in the camp that's like, isn't Mega Man 9 hard enough?

667
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's definitely the hardcore fans that have the whole pattern.

668
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:03,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet.

669
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it a long time ago, but I still haven't heard it.

670
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,660
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard.

671
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I only was able to beat three or four of the robots before I was like, okay, I'm spent.

672
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:12,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

673
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:13,821
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'd like to see?

674
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd actually like to see a new Rockman and Forte.

675
00:49:19,363 --> 00:49:20,243
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make me happy.

676
00:49:20,283 --> 00:49:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some Mega Man 9 easy mode content?

677
00:49:23,124 --> 00:49:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd pay a dollar for that.

678
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:27,297
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

679
00:49:41,249 --> 00:50:03,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's every Mega Man fan's like dream game is like just Mega Man orgy where it's like all what 81 master robots or however many they've had over the series not even counting X I'm not even going to throw the X series into it because that could be like the sequel when this game does well but the Mega Man orgy would just be a game where it's like all 81 robots going at it at once

680
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:23,772
[SPEAKER_04]: and then do it like Metroid style which is a very interesting orgy considering one of which considering one of those robots is a woman and there are other 80 year men just do it do it all Metroid style and make the legends like Mega Man Legends tie that in there oh that would be hot that would be a good game but it has to remain 2D it has to remain 2D

681
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:35,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking of a game that just kind of had all 81 stages in it and playable at once, but I like your idea of a Metroidvania-style Mega Man game with all the robots.

682
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

683
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:49,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you totally used the escape velocity thing, then you would be able to go back to your last save point location, do weird warps like that, and then Samus would come out and kick Mega Man's ass.

684
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:52,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So you totally took my game.

685
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:56,228
[SPEAKER_11]: But that actually is... Okay, we're putting that under Dream Games.

686
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:58,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And four-player co-op because that would be awesome.

687
00:50:58,649 --> 00:50:59,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for fun.

688
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for fun.

689
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,851
[SPEAKER_11]: That's under Dream Games now for Orange Lounge Radio.

690
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:04,071
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an official Dream Game.

691
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:05,052
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Mega Man Orgy?

692
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:06,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Mega Man Orgy.

693
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:11,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Or as I like what Actdeft calls it in chat, Mega 10 RGY.

694
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:14,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So the zero is an O in orgy.

695
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:14,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

696
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:15,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

697
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:16,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.

698
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:18,739
[SPEAKER_11]: You are now marketing director of this game.

699
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:19,239
Okay.

700
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on your promotion.

701
00:51:22,771 --> 00:51:24,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You now get a non-existent job.

702
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So add that to the wiki that's going on the list.

703
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:31,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and at the end, there's a big butt.

704
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:33,676
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

705
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you high?

706
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:37,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an easter egg.

707
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,100
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like when you can hold the buttons down and the stars turn into chickens.

708
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:43,299
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

709
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:07,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

710
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:12,035
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why it doesn't need to be on the list, because that list is just ridiculous stuff.

711
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:13,175
[SPEAKER_05]: This is ridiculous.

712
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,216
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never going to happen.

713
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:15,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just because it's never going to happen.

714
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I don't have, I don't know.

715
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:21,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's people out there that have done custom Mega Man games, and it wouldn't be that difficult.

716
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:25,818
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room would like to point out that what you're describing could be Guts Man's ass.

717
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:27,079
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be.

718
00:52:27,899 --> 00:52:32,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Easter egg in the game, you know, beat Guts Man with a certain number of life left, and you get a butt.

719
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with you?

720
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:40,384
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with me for finding this funny?

721
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:41,424
[SPEAKER_04]: How old am I?

722
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Like five?

723
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

724
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:44,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

725
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:45,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all for fun.

726
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun does not require an age.

727
00:52:48,086 --> 00:52:53,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but fun requires a new story real quick here before this show literally goes down the crapper.

728
00:52:53,667 --> 00:53:02,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of your butt, Nintendo has patented a brand new inflatable cushion that you would use for a horseback riding game.

729
00:53:03,757 --> 00:53:04,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

730
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:07,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.

731
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:09,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks absolutely awful.

732
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:15,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, their picture that they have, first off, looks like this grown man dressed up like a little kid.

733
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is creepy enough, if you ask me.

734
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:26,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, the actual cushion itself is literally just like an inner tube that they have strapped the Wii Remote to and you rock back and forth.

735
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's supposed to be a kid.

736
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:31,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it's supposed to be a kid, but it looks like a man-child.

737
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:36,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is this for?

738
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:40,364
[SPEAKER_04]: For a finely arcade perfect port of Final Furlong, or what is this?

739
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:43,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for, I don't know, sitting on your butt.

740
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:49,850
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for those racing games that they have where you sit on the Wii balance board, but if you have hemorrhoids, you can't do it, so then you can sit on the cushion.

741
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this where your butt gets a little tickle if you do well on the game?

742
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:54,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what this is for?

743
00:53:54,132 --> 00:53:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

744
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:57,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks stupid, I mean seriously.

745
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:20,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this Wii inflatable cushion reminds me of.

746
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have that in my living room.

747
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me describe how this works first off.

748
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

749
00:54:27,148 --> 00:54:28,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Wild, wacky action bike.

750
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:29,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

751
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:32,630
[SPEAKER_05]: As if it wasn't completely obvious.

752
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:37,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an inflatable air cushion or other type of seat with pockets for the Wii remote.

753
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:45,335
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for simulating horseback riding or riding of other animals, real or imagined, or even vehicles.

754
00:54:46,115 --> 00:55:05,331
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you can indicate the gait of a horse by gently moving forward and backward on the cushion to go slow or fast forward and backward rocking motions to gallop.

755
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:11,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically this game will adjust your speed based on how fast you hump the cushion.

756
00:55:12,757 --> 00:55:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

757
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:14,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

758
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Outro

759
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:50,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just see the whole rocking back and forth.

760
00:55:51,709 --> 00:55:53,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing deflates while you're playing it.

761
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how sad.

762
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this for real?

763
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:58,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for real.

764
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this Nintendo making the patent?

765
00:56:02,752 --> 00:56:03,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever this is.

766
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:06,393
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what this thing kind of looks like to me?

767
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:07,113
[SPEAKER_11]: You know those...

768
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:15,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you know at the gym they have the inflatable balls and they have the ones that are half size?

769
00:56:15,466 --> 00:56:19,388
[SPEAKER_11]: This sort of makes me think of those just with another rocking thing put on it.

770
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:24,990
[SPEAKER_11]: This one also looks really... It looks like a wacky action bike, okay?

771
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessary!

772
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:30,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, how many games are you going to play where you're riding a horse?

773
00:56:31,313 --> 00:56:34,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely not necessary and why the hell would they patent this?

774
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:43,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, keep in mind, though, it's a good idea to... They could patent something and not actually bring it out, but it keeps someone else from doing it.

775
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in chat says, we find out why it's called WooHoo Island.

776
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:51,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

777
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:54,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get WooHoo biking and WooHoo horse riding with this thing.

778
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just strange.

779
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why can't you... Although, although...

780
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:12,169
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is legit, if this is a real thing that Nintendo is planning, you know you can't wait for that press conference when Reggie Fils-Aimé comes out on one of these.

781
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:17,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year's E3 press conference is when you're just like, oh my god, Nintendo has seriously just fucking lost it this time.

782
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:27,074
[SPEAKER_04]: The last two years of press conferences were bad, but now when Reggie Fils-Aimé comes rolling out on one of these things, you're just going to be like, oh my god, this is just difficult to watch.

783
00:57:27,094 --> 00:57:29,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to go there and just walk out.

784
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:30,996
[SPEAKER_05]: and walk out right at that.

785
00:57:31,236 --> 00:57:31,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's it.

786
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:32,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

787
00:57:32,978 --> 00:57:33,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

788
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I give up.

789
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,402
[SPEAKER_05]: This is absolutely stupid.

790
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:39,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I seriously want.

791
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Can somebody please do that at E3?

792
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody who's special enough to get invited to Nintendo's conference.

793
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody who doesn't mind getting blacklisted a little bit.

794
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,091
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

795
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:50,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

796
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:52,873
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so stupid.

797
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:53,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of here.

798
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:55,055
[SPEAKER_04]: See ya.

799
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:55,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

800
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:56,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I am done.

801
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:58,557
[SPEAKER_04]: D-U-N done.

802
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:04,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And get up and walk out.

803
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,095
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no practical use for this whatsoever.

804
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:10,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big device that holds a remote that shakes it back and forth.

805
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:20,319
[SPEAKER_05]: How difficult would it be to take this same horse riding game and just shake the remote slow to go slow, shake it faster to go faster.

806
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, look at that.

807
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:22,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have to buy any more peripherals.

808
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine the size of the box this game is going to come in if it's just this giant device?

809
00:58:30,002 --> 00:58:31,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you probably have to inflate it yourself.

810
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:33,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably comes in a small box and...

811
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to inflate it yourself.

812
00:58:38,837 --> 00:58:39,338
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

813
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:44,522
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole talk about the cushion thing just sort of made my brain shut off, so I decided to look at Teriyaki Doritos instead.

814
00:58:46,363 --> 00:58:47,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you stop being so random?

815
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,547
[SPEAKER_04]: First you want our Mega Man game to have a butt.

816
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:53,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you say, I don't care about inflatable Nintendo cushion.

817
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,071
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be the biggest joke of the year.

818
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:57,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Teriyaki Doritos.

819
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:58,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

820
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:00,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want Teriyaki Doritos right now.

821
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:29,473
[SPEAKER_11]: this is gonna be one of those shows where it's like this is gonna be one of those shows because I'm sorry the whole concept of this cushion thing literally made my brain shut off for like a minute and then by the time I came back to consciousness I was looking at teriyaki doritos you know the best part about this is is that the I bet you the Wii remote's not sensitive enough to sense these little rocking motions that are in that would be the punchline to the whole thing

822
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:32,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, some comments in chat.

823
00:59:32,742 --> 00:59:34,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, my name is Reggie.

824
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:37,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about kicking ass, taking names, and fucking a pillow.

825
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:43,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy oh boy.

826
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:47,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Gripper01 in chat says... Seriously, is this something we need to be teaching our kids?

827
00:59:47,505 --> 00:59:48,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Hold on, shush.

828
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:52,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Gripper01 says, I'm still waiting for Excitebots to be released in the UK.

829
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo hates Europe.

830
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:56,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, at least you'll have this peripheral, possibly.

831
00:59:56,789 --> 01:00:00,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this going to break certain girls' hymens, just like, you know, flashback writing?

832
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:03,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are they going to become women just from playing this game?

833
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,033
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to know, because...

834
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:08,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

835
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:11,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chalk that up to the list of Wii injuries.

836
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Broken lamp, shattered television screen, broken hymen.

837
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Just add that to the list.

838
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Loki.

839
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you go there?

840
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:23,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's horseback riding.

841
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

842
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:27,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on topic.

843
01:00:28,103 --> 01:00:30,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Hymen Breaker Wii 2009.

844
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:34,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think we can pretty much just sum it up.

845
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:35,505
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a horrible idea.

846
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:37,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

847
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:38,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Nintendo horrible?

848
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:39,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

849
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:40,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

850
01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:43,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting.

851
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:59,664
[SPEAKER_04]: In all honesty, all jokes aside, to see somebody putting a respectable, reputable game company behind an inflatable pillow that will move, you really have to wonder, where are they going with this?

852
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:01,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be interesting.

853
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:04,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I see potential modifications involving the Rez vibrator.

854
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:08,381
[SPEAKER_11]: It is hard for me to be serious about this, Rob.

855
01:01:08,761 --> 01:01:17,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, if anything, this is a sign of hope because it gives me hope that at any conference that they hold from now on, I'm hoping that I see this.

856
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:20,328
[SPEAKER_04]: What's her name?

857
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:21,008
[SPEAKER_04]: That new one?

858
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: What's her name?

859
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:22,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Piper?

860
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,150
[SPEAKER_04]: What the heck's her name?

861
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:24,791
[SPEAKER_04]: That Perrin?

862
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:25,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that her name?

863
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:29,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I want her to come out on one of these.

864
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:29,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Palin?

865
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:30,134
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

866
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:32,155
[SPEAKER_04]: She autographed an Xbox, supposedly.

867
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:34,737
[SPEAKER_11]: That's doing horrible things for my imagination right now.

868
01:01:35,214 --> 01:01:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

869
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on, please, to another story.

870
01:01:40,277 --> 01:01:45,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to talk about, hey, other Nintendo Wii news, but this one is actually a lot more serious, I'm sorry to say.

871
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:50,263
[SPEAKER_04]: 32 gigabyte SD cards will soon be usable in Wiis.

872
01:01:50,343 --> 01:01:55,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think they already take the 32 gigabyte, or sorry, gigabyte, yeah, gigabyte cards, right?

873
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:55,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

874
01:01:55,806 --> 01:01:56,426
[SPEAKER_04]: They take them now.

875
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:57,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing is that

876
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:10,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, right now, if you want to use download content, you can store it on the card, but you have to copy it over to the actual Wii console every time you want to use it.

877
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:12,158
[SPEAKER_04]: But not for much longer.

878
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:24,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, pretty soon, you will be able to play your download content directly off of the SD cards, which will finally justify Nintendo's choice to not put a hard drive in these things.

879
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as you can change out the cards and so on, that's kind of cool.

880
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:38,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, there's a new IGN report saying that all the tricks used for both Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the past, leaving internal memory open, is gone.

881
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:48,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, straight up booting off the SD card is available, and that means easier downloads, larger expansions, and quicker loads when bringing in song data from the SD card into Guitar Hero 5.

882
01:02:48,443 --> 01:02:50,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently that's the first game that's going to be able to use this.

883
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:51,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And no support from Nintendo.

884
01:02:52,387 --> 01:02:53,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just figured this out on their own.

885
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:57,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

886
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:05,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see if any other developers are going to use this other than companies that are just trying to mirror what they're doing on the 360 and the PS3.

887
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:11,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It does piss me off, though, that they haven't done any download content other than, I guess, Animal Crossing.

888
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But Animal Crossing, you don't really actually buy the download content, I don't think.

889
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:18,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of something that comes in the mail, just like you get used to.

890
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably already in the game anyways.

891
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:21,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

892
01:03:22,608 --> 01:03:28,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of pissed off that they aren't actually doing any expansions and stuff for these new games that they're putting out.

893
01:03:28,453 --> 01:03:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And even still, let's support the MP3 stuff before on the SD cards, and then now with the newer games, oh, sorry, we're not going to do that anymore.

894
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you're taking a step backwards, come on!

895
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:49,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least I'm glad to hear that they're putting in that functionality that really should have been there from the get-go, but hey, better late than never, right?

896
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:49,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

897
01:03:50,563 --> 01:03:56,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, but ironically enough, though, I haven't bought really a lot of virtual console games in a long, long time.

898
01:03:57,628 --> 01:04:08,275
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some stuff coming up later in the show that I find interesting, but as far as, you know, virtual console stuff, there really hasn't been a lot lately I've been interested in, except the Final Fantasy IV WiiWare game.

899
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:12,038
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the WiiWare game that's that Nick's Quest...

900
01:04:12,694 --> 01:04:13,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of this.

901
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:13,575
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

902
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:14,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick's Quest.

903
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:17,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be called Icarian something or whatever.

904
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Kid Icarus, basically.

905
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, neat.

906
01:04:20,383 --> 01:04:21,144
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hadn't heard of this.

907
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:28,293
[SPEAKER_05]: They changed it because apparently Icarian Quest or whatever it was called is too close to Kid Icarus and Nintendo got pissed.

908
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the classic game of the week before we end Part A tonight.

909
01:04:50,148 --> 01:04:50,668
[SPEAKER_11]: EMI Warner Universal

910
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:30,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Delilah, there's also Viva La Vida, some stuff from that album.

911
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:38,708
[SPEAKER_11]: But the big thing, Rob, that should make you happy is if there's ABBA, you get four-part harmony.

912
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:39,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

913
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm kind of done on the karaoke games.

914
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:47,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is there really room in the marketplace right now for yet another karaoke game?

915
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:51,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would play this one, though, because it wouldn't be me singing by myself.

916
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:57,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's cool that, you know, because the Wii doesn't really have a lot of karaoke games that I know of.

917
01:05:57,326 --> 01:05:58,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some overseas.

918
01:05:58,026 --> 01:05:58,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is.

919
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:00,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have a karaoke channel, right?

920
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Konami's Karaoke Revolution game is out on Wii or is coming out.

921
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:05,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Their new one's out on Wii.

922
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:06,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They have American Idol.

923
01:06:06,868 --> 01:06:07,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on Wii.

924
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do they?

925
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, American Idol Encore.

926
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band, Guitar Hero

927
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:54,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Lips is... Which is too bad because it's by the guys who did Elite Beat Agents.

928
01:06:54,624 --> 01:06:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet they're still doing another one, though.

929
01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:56,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they really?

930
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, remember?

931
01:06:57,606 --> 01:06:59,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Lips number one hits coming out this September.

932
01:06:59,388 --> 01:07:00,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, I remember that.

933
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:05,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I was under the impression that Singing Star was actually doing better than Lips.

934
01:07:06,132 --> 01:07:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's just because Europe... Singing Star is the karaoke game in Europe.

935
01:07:10,915 --> 01:07:13,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very... I like Singing Star.

936
01:07:13,357 --> 01:07:14,538
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a lot of versions coming out.

937
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:16,684
[SPEAKER_11]: You actually got me to play that.

938
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar's fun.

939
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:18,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I like SingStar.

940
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,764
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't like singing.

941
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:20,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is weird.

942
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:27,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't consider myself a rabid SingStar fan, but yet I have SingStar Volume 1, Volume 2, and ABBA all on PS3, and I want SingStar Queen.

943
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:29,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I would get that.

944
01:07:30,608 --> 01:07:32,628
[SPEAKER_11]: We should do another SingStar party at your house.

945
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be fun.

946
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:34,029
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar party.

947
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

948
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:35,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring people.

949
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to make that happen.

950
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:37,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe later today weekend.

951
01:07:37,434 --> 01:07:38,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring someone who's listening right now.

952
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I'm not going to PAX, I'm thinking SingStar Party.

953
01:07:41,901 --> 01:07:42,682
[SPEAKER_04]: This might have to happen.

954
01:07:42,983 --> 01:07:44,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have our own PAX.

955
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,790
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll call it OLR.

956
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:48,411
[SPEAKER_04]: TAMPAX.

957
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:49,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll call it TAMPAX.

958
01:07:50,476 --> 01:07:54,019
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you need to... We'll call it Tampax.

959
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:57,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what time is... Or when's BlizzCon this year?

960
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:58,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right before PAX, right?

961
01:07:58,403 --> 01:07:59,985
[SPEAKER_04]: This next weekend is BlizzCon.

962
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:00,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

963
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:01,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

964
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you could just become part of the second annual QQCon.

965
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, QQCon.

966
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:08,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this idea.

967
01:08:08,892 --> 01:08:09,333
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

968
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember QQCon last year.

969
01:08:11,074 --> 01:08:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year I'm not sad that I'm not going to BlizzCon because I'm over WoW now.

970
01:08:14,718 --> 01:08:17,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And WoW got spoiled anyway, so we're going to get to it a little bit later.

971
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,060
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

972
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:19,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It just occurred to me.

973
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:30,211
[SPEAKER_11]: We could actually rent like an office room or something and have just systems set up and just do OLRCon.

974
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:31,472
[SPEAKER_11]: First year OLRCon.

975
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some little office.

976
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,269
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how they start.

977
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:36,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

978
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:37,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Airport Hilton.

979
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Airport Hojo.

980
01:08:40,092 --> 01:08:49,636
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we used to do, actually, we used to have Ground Zero Con in Mobile and they held it at college in the student center.

981
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:51,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Frisbee's idea.

982
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:52,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Packs in the back's yard.

983
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

984
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:56,678
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't had it.

985
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:59,219
[SPEAKER_11]: We remember we used to do the old Baymani parties way back when.

986
01:08:59,239 --> 01:08:59,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

987
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:00,880
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd sort of be the same thing.

988
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Just be gamer nerd syndrome party.

989
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:04,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd con or something.

990
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:05,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Nerd con at my house.

991
01:09:05,362 --> 01:09:06,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I've got pinball.

992
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:06,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to think.

993
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder how much it would cost her in a small space just for the day.

994
01:09:10,024 --> 01:09:10,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I will look into this.

995
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

996
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:13,805
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got time off because of your hand right now.

997
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to find us a place to have a con.

998
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick poll of chat.

999
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would come to OLR con?

1000
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:20,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Wire N.

1001
01:09:21,341 --> 01:09:23,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Y or N, you would check out for OLRCon.

1002
01:09:23,963 --> 01:09:29,728
[SPEAKER_11]: And your response must be either a Y or an N. Spelled out W-H-Y or E-N.

1003
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:32,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, like I said, I'm random today.

1004
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:34,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1005
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:36,713
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to make that happen.

1006
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:41,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's get to some release dates while we ponder the idea of an OLRCon.

1007
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:42,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We can host it at an Olive Garden.

1008
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:44,739
[SPEAKER_04]: They can cater.

1009
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:46,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Catered by Olive Garden.

1010
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,182
[SPEAKER_11]: OLRCon catered by Olive Garden.

1011
01:09:49,443 --> 01:09:49,743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1012
01:09:49,823 --> 01:09:50,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck that.

1013
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:51,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I cook better than Olive Garden.

1014
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:52,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I will cook.

1015
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:52,946
[SPEAKER_05]: At the mall.

1016
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:18,623
[SPEAKER_05]: with the one room you know the one room that they have that's you know just they had like movies playing in a closed down McDonald's they had this yeah I'm just

1017
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:19,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1018
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the strangest anime con I'd ever seen in my life, was the one that was at the mall, where the closed stores served as screening rooms and stuff, and then you'd just see random people in costumes throughout the mall.

1019
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:33,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, there's people trying to go to Macy's.

1020
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so strange.

1021
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most awkward thing I've ever seen in my life.

1022
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:42,806
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

1023
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, this week, not a whole lot coming out.

1024
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:50,350
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some pretty good games, but it's still kind of that slow part of the summer.

1025
01:10:51,491 --> 01:10:55,273
[SPEAKER_05]: This week on DS, Core, a game from Graffiti.

1026
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a first-person shooter.

1027
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:59,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been delayed forever, but finally making its way out.

1028
01:11:00,216 --> 01:11:03,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Still Life 2 on PC is coming out this week as well.

1029
01:11:04,998 --> 01:11:07,520
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends on DS...

[SPEAKER_05]: Spectrobes Origins, a pretty good role-playing game from Disney Interactive making its way out to the Wii this week.

1034

[SPEAKER_05]: My Dress Up also goes with the My Makeup thing and also for girls.

1035
01:12:08,349 --> 01:12:14,773
[SPEAKER_05]: ATV Quad Kings from Zoo Games and that's the most generic ATV off-road racing game I've ever seen.

1036
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Joint Operations Combined Arms coming out on PC this week.

1037
01:12:22,578 --> 01:12:23,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is it.

1038
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move on to Japan and Japanese release dates.

1039
01:12:30,602 --> 01:12:34,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually going to make a comment about the mind makeup thing.

1040
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:36,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It could also be for the occasional cross-dresser.

1041
01:12:38,365 --> 01:12:38,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1042
01:12:40,006 --> 01:12:43,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say something is just for girls because some boys might be into that.

1043
01:12:44,335 --> 01:12:46,056
[SPEAKER_04]: My character in Ion looks like a drag queen.

1044
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Your character in Ion has a fan.

1045
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:48,777
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a fan.

1046
01:12:49,018 --> 01:12:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: How amazing is that?

1047
01:12:50,138 --> 01:12:54,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to mention this, though, because I think it is on Steam, but it's an awesome name for a game.

1048
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:55,201
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1049
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:59,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza Morgana, the monsters and manipulations in the magical forest.

1050
01:12:59,703 --> 01:13:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza Morgana.

1051
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:03,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adventure game.

1052
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:04,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a gothic...

1053
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot Topic looking type thing

1054
01:13:22,145 --> 01:13:22,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1055
01:13:41,576 --> 01:13:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, L2, Love Cross Loop is also a game coming out of Japan on the PlayStation 2 this week.

1056
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:52,464
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Nintendo DS, Live Battle Card is the only new release this week.

1057
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:54,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very slow release week over in Japan.

1058
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:55,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what gives.

1059
01:13:56,287 --> 01:14:04,833
[SPEAKER_04]: There is on the Sony PSP, Heart no Kune no Alice comes out, as well as Ukame Kakushi comes out from Konami this week.

1060
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see what kind of game this is, but it doesn't look like any of their series...

1061
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:13,838
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1062
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:58,876
[SPEAKER_11]: for our buddies in the UK actually we've got a number of releases if you've been able to ignore Madden that game has touched my life because Dan had to go for me in that opening anyway let's move on on the 19th we have Shadow Complex on Xbox 360 did you make a yay?

1063
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:02,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the cat's hanging around.

1064
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:05,350
[SPEAKER_11]: She's about to be dinner in a moment.

1065
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,232
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 20th, Tales of Monkey Island, The Siege of Spinner City.

1066
01:15:10,032 --> 01:15:16,155
[SPEAKER_11]: And the 21st, DJ Star and Raven Squad, Supercar Challenge, and then Wolfenstein.

1067
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's Wolfenstein.

1068
01:15:18,737 --> 01:15:21,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that's it.

1069
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:26,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well there's a new patent submitted by Sony.

1070
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:29,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's a device or...

1071
01:15:30,774 --> 01:15:38,000
[SPEAKER_05]: A program to interpret whether you... Or different emotions that you are feeling while playing, I guess, the PS3.

1072
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: One example that they show is laughter, which apparently they have this really weird-looking guy laughing at a video of somebody kicking themselves in the ass with a machine that they're powering with their own hands.

1073
01:15:53,294 --> 01:15:54,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it sense boredom?

1074
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:55,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1075
01:15:56,397 --> 01:15:56,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently...

1076
01:15:58,693 --> 01:15:59,654
[SPEAKER_05]: They make that joke too.

1077
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:08,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they're saying that not necessarily sure what it would do, but it would be able to sense laughter as well as other emotions.

1078
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:12,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadness, excitement, anger, joy, interest, and boredom.

1079
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: They say perhaps if the game detects boredom, it could increase the number of enemies on screen.

1080
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: If it detects anger, the difficulty can go down.

1081
01:16:19,383 --> 01:16:26,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, if it detects sadness and their punchline to the joke, it will tell you just to stop playing Lair.

1082
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1083
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:39,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering though if it's going to detect me laughing when they make an announcement about some new PS3 system or something like that that's going to be more expensive than the previous one, just like the PSP Go, because that would be hilarious.

1084
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:41,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, ah, you think I'm going to buy that?

1085
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1086
01:16:43,922 --> 01:16:48,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this peripheral should go with the Nintendo one.

1087
01:16:48,244 --> 01:16:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed to combine their forces so that it can sense me giggling when I'm riding the inflatable Wii Sack, or whatever it's called.

1088
01:16:56,388 --> 01:16:57,189
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii Sack.

1089
01:16:58,129 --> 01:16:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1090
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:01,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the name.

1091
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:04,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then it's called the Wii Sack until we get a real name for it.

1092
01:17:06,696 --> 01:17:15,583
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems kind of a dumb technology because all I had to do was act angry or something like, Grrr, I'm angry!

1093
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:17,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game gets easier.

1094
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:19,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1095
01:17:21,252 --> 01:17:23,996
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it doesn't tell you that this is in the game?

1096
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:27,762
[SPEAKER_04]: People will find out.

1097
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:29,444
[SPEAKER_04]: They have ways of finding out.

1098
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:34,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably something that they're not really going to use, but they want to...

1099
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:40,720
[SPEAKER_05]: A case PS3 wants to do a Milo, you know, or something like that.

1100
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,462
[SPEAKER_05]: They can detect laughter and all whatnot.

1101
01:17:44,782 --> 01:17:47,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Something so they have the technology before Microsoft does, maybe?

1102
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:51,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something so they can say, hey, we patented that, we sue you now.

1103
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1104
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:55,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, I...

1105
01:17:57,428 --> 01:18:01,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be interesting, but I really would have to see the application of how this is used.

1106
01:18:02,313 --> 01:18:07,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm into this a lot more than I am the Wii Sack, but this is...

1107
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be hokey, it could be kind of neat.

1108
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:21,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the idea of a game because you all know those people that get so angry when they're playing the games, not that there's anyone in this room like that, Loki, that they're throwing controllers on the ground and trying to break things.

1109
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:26,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I never throw controllers because controllers are expensive and there's no reason to get pissed off at the controllers.

1110
01:18:26,063 --> 01:18:26,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get angry.

1111
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:28,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You do get very angry when playing games.

1112
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:29,185
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1113
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:30,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on!

1114
01:18:30,826 --> 01:18:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard you do that.

1115
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:32,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, okay.

1116
01:18:32,548 --> 01:18:41,275
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm playing Grand Theft Auto or something like that, and the game glitches out on me or something like that, like, you know, I fire six sniper rounds.

1117
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: The game's retarded!

1118
01:18:42,616 --> 01:18:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: If I fire six sniper rounds into the back of someone's head, and then they're like, oh, hey, someone's shooting at me, and they turn around and fire a pistol and kill me.

1119
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, come on!

1120
01:18:52,544 --> 01:18:56,207
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite is when Loki will go, and then the game's like, I don't know what I'm doing!

1121
01:18:57,889 --> 01:18:59,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, because it's retarded.

1122
01:19:02,694 --> 01:19:11,579
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite is when Loki impersonates the game I do that to people too It's fun all around

1123
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:16,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, something that is going to be impersonated all over again.

1124
01:19:16,704 --> 01:19:22,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard, for WoW's 5th anniversary, Onyxia is making a return, y'all.

1125
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Onyxia was a level 60 raid, of course, in old school Warcraft, where 40 of you would fight the dragon Onyxia once.

1126
01:19:30,129 --> 01:19:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's kind of a bit of a joke, like people will go run the Onyxia thing, because you can totally solo Onyxia now, or at least duo it.

1127
01:19:38,772 --> 01:19:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

1128
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:09,662
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

1129
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:30,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's going to be a 310% speed flying mount modeled after Onyxia that's going to be a rare drop.

1130
01:20:31,281 --> 01:20:33,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be something a lot of folks are after.

1131
01:20:33,322 --> 01:20:39,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's not glitched out like the dragon was at one time during Final Fantasy XI where you couldn't kill the dragon.

1132
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:42,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I heard about that.

1133
01:20:43,027 --> 01:20:45,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I was after we were playing, but yeah, I remember hearing about that.

1134
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,669
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it was while we were playing.

1135
01:20:47,728 --> 01:20:50,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Cataclysm is supposedly the name of the new WoW expansion.

1136
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:52,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if the name's been confirmed yet.

1137
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:53,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a registered trademark from them, though.

1138
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, so despite the name possibly getting out, apparently some of the information about the game has leaked out too.

1139
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:22,161
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be able to go to 85 in this new game, I'm sorry, new expansion, which is different because usually WoW has been doing the 10 level increments.

1140
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:26,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning Crusade lets you go to 10, I'm sorry, lets you go to 70, which was 10 up from 60.

1141
01:21:27,224 --> 01:21:29,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrath of the Lich King lets you go up to...

1142
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:30,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1143
01:21:45,217 --> 01:21:46,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they're going to do that.

1144
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:06,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Also some new races are rumored for the game.

1145
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Worgen will be the new alliance class and Goblins will be the new horde class.

1146
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:16,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other interesting thing is that some new job race combinations are opening up.

1147
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:20,104
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, now you can be a Tauren Paladin or Troll Druid.

1148
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:23,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one because Druids you had to be Tauren or Night Elf to be.

1149
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently now trolls can be druids too, and assumably worgens, since nothing else on the Alliance side opened up for druids.

1150
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:31,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

1151
01:22:32,412 --> 01:22:36,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to fly in some parts of Old World now too, which was a thing that was being requested.

1152
01:22:37,414 --> 01:22:44,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know though, for me, honestly, as somebody who recently left WoW, this isn't really cool enough sounding for me to want to go back.

1153
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:44,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be honest.

1154
01:22:45,478 --> 01:22:50,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm like, the improvements sound neat and sound needed, but I'm not seeing anything where I'm like, oh damn.

1155
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:52,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's, I don't know

1156
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be interesting.

1157
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It could all be speculation too.

1158
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:13,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be like one of those culmination of all the rumors that are on there and then just put it out all at once.

1159
01:23:13,914 --> 01:23:18,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've seen the rumor about the new name of the expansion because of the registered trademark.

1160
01:23:19,256 --> 01:23:24,678
[SPEAKER_05]: The rumor of the new classes based on the Halloween masks that appeared or whatever.

1161
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:28,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And some other crap.

1162
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:29,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1163
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:32,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out next week I guess.

1164
01:23:33,081 --> 01:23:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean seriously.

1165
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:35,365
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1166
01:24:03,228 --> 01:24:06,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week?

1167
01:24:06,753 --> 01:24:08,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going for another series this time, Rob.

1168
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:09,997
[SPEAKER_11]: How dare you?

1169
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:11,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1170
01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:13,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I can't get the music volume down.

1171
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1172
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Raiden, you say?

1173
01:24:16,445 --> 01:24:16,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1174
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's cue up some music from Raiden here.

1175
01:24:19,113 --> 01:24:24,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, basically, yeah, this one goes through the whole PlayStation screen launch-up thing, sorry.

1176
01:24:25,115 --> 01:24:30,937
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, for anyone who doesn't know, Raiden is a scrolling shooter.

1177
01:24:31,157 --> 01:24:40,880
[SPEAKER_11]: It's put out by Seibu Kaihatsu, and it was in the arcades, and I think we got it by Fabtech over here in the States.

1178
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:48,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, it's supposed to be kind of hard to emulate because of the way that they changed the game boards for them.

1179
01:24:49,342 --> 01:24:55,668
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, it came out on PlayStation as the Raiden Project.

1180
01:24:56,148 --> 01:24:57,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, at least Raiden 1 and 2 did.

1181
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:02,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we got, it came out on Amiga, Atari Jaguar, TurboGrafx.

1182
01:25:05,211 --> 01:25:07,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out on the Duo as a Super Raiden.

1183
01:25:08,272 --> 01:25:13,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Atari Link, Super Nintendo came out for PC, Genesis, and there's actually a mobile phone version too.

1184
01:25:16,555 --> 01:25:25,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Seibu Kaihatsu did all of the ones that came out until 98, and then Moss Limited did the games that came out since 2005.

1185
01:25:26,017 --> 01:25:33,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And the games since 2005 also came out on the Taito Type-X boards, which were supposed to be... They were pretty hard to duplicate the emulation for.

1186
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:41,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so anyway, the world was taken over by aliens, and the world says, screw you aliens, and fights back.

1187
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:41,973
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the story.

1188
01:25:43,214 --> 01:25:50,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so you also had, um, uh, you could play one player or have two players and play together.

1189
01:25:50,101 --> 01:25:55,547
[SPEAKER_11]: You also had a variety of different weapons, um, you know, that you would get through different power-ups.

1190
01:25:55,607 --> 01:25:58,670
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite being the little electric thingy weapon.

1191
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:12,781
[SPEAKER_11]: which, in fact, is on the screen right now in the example we're showing, where you would fire this continuous stream of energy that would lock on to certain enemies and then wrap around them and, you know, pull towards them.

1192
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:19,306
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like how, um, you know those electric globe things where you put your hand on and all the energy goes to where your hand is?

1193
01:26:19,326 --> 01:26:20,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing.

1194
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:21,628
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my favorite weapon in the game.

1195
01:26:22,288 --> 01:26:29,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, the games that came out in the series were Raiden, Raiden 2, Raiden DX, Raiden 3, and Raiden 4.

1196
01:26:29,273 --> 01:26:32,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Raiden DX, of those, is probably my favorite.

1197
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:37,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there were also spin-off games that were, um...

1198
01:26:38,478 --> 01:26:45,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure, actually we talked about them recently when I was going over my gaming week.

1199
01:26:46,266 --> 01:26:51,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Viper Phase 1, Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet.

1200
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:55,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big series of games.

1201
01:26:56,135 --> 01:26:56,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1202
01:26:58,457 --> 01:27:02,420
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually probably one of my favorite shooters to this date.

1203
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:12,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also, it can get pretty hard because you get a lot of bullets and a lot of enemies on the screen and they're big and it's just a lot of fun.

1204
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:14,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely a lot of fun.

1205
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:15,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus the music's great.

1206
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn it up here a little bit.

1207
01:27:30,471 --> 01:27:33,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the clip that I gave you is actually from Riding Project.

1208
01:27:35,295 --> 01:27:36,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a story about Riding Project.

1209
01:27:36,956 --> 01:27:37,316
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1210
01:27:37,937 --> 01:27:42,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember being completely intoxicated on Everclear and beating this game.

1211
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:43,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1212
01:27:45,944 --> 01:27:48,826
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the same night that I ended up having so much Everclear I hallucinated.

1213
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:51,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I was 19.

1214
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:52,929
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I take that back.

1215
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:53,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I was 20.

1216
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,551
[SPEAKER_04]: You say that proudly.

1217
01:27:55,211 --> 01:27:55,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was 20.

1218
01:27:56,912 --> 01:27:58,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well there you have it, folks.

1219
01:27:58,033 --> 01:27:59,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week.

1220
01:28:00,175 --> 01:28:00,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Raiden.

1221
01:28:00,856 --> 01:28:01,817
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole dang series.

1222
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:03,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DarkSakura said the series.

1223
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:04,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you get.

1224
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you very much, DarkSakura.

1225
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:09,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll look forward to see what you pick for us next week.

1226
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the meantime, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, a chance for us to stretch, get water, and so forth.

1227
01:28:14,705 --> 01:28:16,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have plenty more show to come.

1228
01:28:17,227 --> 01:28:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back from a break, Twitter topics, something new we're trying tonight.

1229
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:25,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been trying to incorporate Twitter into the show for a long time now, so we're going to do some Twitter topics when we come back.

1230
01:28:26,196 --> 01:28:28,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid-fire news and some more discussions, including...

1231
01:28:29,779 --> 01:28:34,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill, a chance for you to go visit like real Silent Hill.

1232
01:28:34,322 --> 01:28:37,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, but as close as it's going to get.

1233
01:28:37,303 --> 01:28:39,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about that and it sounds kind of cool.

1234
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1235
01:28:42,647 --> 01:28:43,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1236
01:28:49,264 --> 01:28:59,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 16th of 2009, where we are taping live our, what, 334th episode of Orange Lounge Radio?

1237
01:29:02,173 --> 01:29:04,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Slightly more than half evil.

1238
01:29:04,254 --> 01:29:07,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it just keeps on going and no signs of quitting anytime soon.

1239
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:12,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming back this segment and going to get into some Twitter topics here shortly.

1240
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you wanted to submit a topic, you could do that earlier by joining our Twitter.

1241
01:29:17,741 --> 01:29:18,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't send it now.

1242
01:29:18,502 --> 01:29:20,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too late because we already have picked what we want to talk about tonight.

1243
01:29:21,183 --> 01:29:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to do that for future weeks, you can send those to us at OLR on Twitter.

1244
01:29:25,886 --> 01:29:28,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not following us on Twitter yet, why not?

1245
01:29:30,558 --> 01:29:58,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mention one game I didn't mention during my gaming week because it wasn't really my gaming week and not a game I've been playing but a game that my roommate has been playing non-stop like just been obsessed with and playing it like I think he's racked up like 15-16 hours just this week alone it's an iPhone game believe it or not and the iPhone game is called Zenonia is the name of the game Z-E-N-O-N-I-A and it's a game I probably need to look at and check out I guess there's a free demo available out there but if you want to play more than

1246
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,851
[SPEAKER_04]: A certain amount of time, you have to pay money for it.

1247
01:30:01,192 --> 01:30:07,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess it's like a... The best way I could describe it from what I saw, it's like a Secret of Mana-style game, is what it looked like.

1248
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:12,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like the role-playing game, but more of the action style, like Secret of Mana is.

1249
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And with kind of the multiple quests going on at once, like WoW has.

1250
01:30:17,683 --> 01:30:19,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess you can be good or evil in the game.

1251
01:30:19,885 --> 01:30:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: John was trying to tell me a little bit about the game.

1252
01:30:22,026 --> 01:30:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was interesting enough to give a mention here on the show, because, you know, iPhones...

1253
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:27,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Peggle.

1254
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:52,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play Peggle?

1255
01:30:52,633 --> 01:30:52,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1256
01:30:52,975 --> 01:30:53,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times on the iPhone.

1257
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:55,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bad on the iPhone.

1258
01:30:55,805 --> 01:30:56,768
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the only version of it I have.

1259
01:30:57,149 --> 01:30:57,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.

1260
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics.

1261
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:04,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier on Twitter we asked you guys to tell us some things you wanted us to talk about tonight.

1262
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:09,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing says, StarCraft 2 petition has over 100k signatures for LAN support.

1263
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Discuss that.

1264
01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:15,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember we were kind of talking about that, was this the one where we said people need to kind of get over it?

1265
01:31:15,244 --> 01:31:16,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was this actually though, was it?

1266
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:17,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was something else.

1267
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:20,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think, you know, because LAN's a big part of StarCraft.

1268
01:31:20,967 --> 01:31:25,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, hell, they have like tournaments and it's really huge over in, you know,

1269
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:44,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they would... I mean, I think the reason why they want to take out LAN because, one, piracy, because they want all their online play or all the multiplayer to go through their... I want to say it was Battle.net or whatever.

1270
01:31:44,562 --> 01:31:45,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Battle.net.

1271
01:31:45,163 --> 01:31:45,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle.net.

1272
01:31:48,343 --> 01:31:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I always kind of thought it was for statistical purposes.

1273
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:56,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they want to log every game that's played by folks and, you know, kind of keep track of statistics and so forth.

1274
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, piracy is kind of a nice little bonus to that.

1275
01:31:59,553 --> 01:32:11,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it makes sense because you're making these people buy three different versions of the same damn game because you're just saying, oh, well, you know, the campaigns are separate.

1276
01:32:12,043 --> 01:32:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when any other, you know, RTS game out there, you know, Command & Conquer...

1277
01:32:16,747 --> 01:32:17,388
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1278
01:32:36,923 --> 01:32:37,724
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1279
01:33:02,322 --> 01:33:05,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat says, online petitions never work for a few exceptions.

1280
01:33:06,443 --> 01:33:08,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of true too.

1281
01:33:08,464 --> 01:33:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to make a statement, guys, put your money where your mouth is.

1282
01:33:12,565 --> 01:33:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy the game when it comes out.

1283
01:33:14,206 --> 01:33:19,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if there's 100,000 people that dent in their first week sales of the game, that'll be heard loud and clear.

1284
01:33:20,948 --> 01:33:23,769
[SPEAKER_04]: But this online petition, that can be swept under the rug.

1285
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:25,989
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, do you still buy the game?

1286
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: If yes, then...

1287
01:33:28,554 --> 01:33:30,295
[SPEAKER_05]: They had no reason to put it back in, did they?

1288
01:33:30,315 --> 01:33:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to send physical mail instead of just a petition signing.

1289
01:33:34,796 --> 01:33:43,018
[SPEAKER_05]: You send a letter because 100,000 letters look a lot better than 100,000 emails and definitely a lot better than 100,000 signatures.

1290
01:33:44,179 --> 01:33:44,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do both.

1291
01:33:44,959 --> 01:33:45,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Do all three.

1292
01:33:47,781 --> 01:33:54,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Surtur on Twitter says, Please discuss the PS3 Slim.

1293
01:33:55,065 --> 01:33:56,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to get a PS3, but they're too expensive.

1294
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume the Slim will be cheaper or there'll be a price cut.

1295
01:33:59,728 --> 01:34:01,329
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this Slim that you're talking about?

1296
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,209
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no Slim.

1297
01:34:02,249 --> 01:34:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: They've denied it.

1298
01:34:03,737 --> 01:34:04,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Deny, deny, deny.

1299
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:08,302
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting though, Sir Truer, if I'm saying your name right?

1300
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:15,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because, we've made that assumption before, that just because they are remaking the system means it's going to be cheaper.

1301
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:16,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Not true.

1302
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:17,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the PSP.

1303
01:34:17,593 --> 01:34:18,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be cheaper.

1304
01:34:18,655 --> 01:34:20,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee it's not going to be cheaper.

1305
01:34:20,036 --> 01:34:20,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think it's going to be cheaper?

1306
01:34:20,897 --> 01:34:21,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be cheaper.

1307
01:34:21,858 --> 01:34:22,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1308
01:34:22,259 --> 01:34:23,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is their M.O.

1309
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:24,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1310
01:34:37,682 --> 01:34:46,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope that they would drop the price of the system because I think it's something that would be in their best interest because their sales are hurting and they're definitely not getting better anytime soon.

1311
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:57,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the slim PS3 might be appealing to some people because, hey, it's new, it looks different, it's nicer looking, we're assuming, and whatnot.

1312
01:34:57,399 --> 01:34:59,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some backwards compatibilities added in?

1313
01:35:00,302 --> 01:35:03,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's kind of wishful thinking there, but we'll have to see.

1314
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:08,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they're going to announce it next week, I'm sure, at Gamescom.

1315
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:09,108
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to happen.

1316
01:35:09,368 --> 01:35:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the rumors right now, and they're definitely prepping for it.

1317
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:21,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And between the birds and you guys, I guess, it's definitely happening.

1318
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:25,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just a matter of time whenever they decide to announce it.

1319
01:35:26,379 --> 01:35:27,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Gripper01 in chat says, Was it?

1320
01:35:32,242 --> 01:35:33,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember a comment earlier, though.

1321
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:36,264
[SPEAKER_04]: He's overseas, so maybe it could be different from region to region.

1322
01:35:36,284 --> 01:35:37,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was more expensive.

1323
01:35:37,985 --> 01:35:40,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was probably the same price, if not cheaper.

1324
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:46,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But, hey, that seems to be the trend nowadays.

1325
01:35:46,489 --> 01:35:48,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's release a new system with less features for more money.

1326
01:35:49,151 --> 01:35:51,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And Frisbee says, this tiny enemy crab...

1327
01:35:54,369 --> 01:35:54,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1328
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:55,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

1329
01:36:21,752 --> 01:36:25,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Noir says free tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour and then gives us a link to an article that talks about new Guitar Hero World Tour tracks that are coming out.

1330
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's an Activision track pack that came out.

1331
01:36:27,795 --> 01:36:28,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it is...

1332
01:36:47,406 --> 01:37:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: folks that work for Activision they're bands so you get these bands Awaken, H is Orange and 100 Reasons and these songs that hey they're free it's very hard to complain about free things but

1333
01:37:01,559 --> 01:37:03,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably... I don't own Guitar Hero World Tour.

1334
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably get to Guitar Hero 5, though.

1335
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Free tracks are good, I mean... It's hard to complain about free tracks, but honestly, very rarely would I probably play them.

1336
01:37:13,503 --> 01:37:16,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I look at the rock band tracks, very few of those do I play.

1337
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:24,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, there's one or two that I do enjoy, and considering they were free, you know, and I had to sift through 20 to find one or two that I like...

1338
01:37:24,927 --> 01:37:26,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still free.

1339
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:28,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to complain about free things.

1340
01:37:28,712 --> 01:37:29,673
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download it, and guess what?

1341
01:37:29,773 --> 01:37:31,455
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like it, you can always delete it later.

1342
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

1343
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free.

1344
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:34,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So when do those come out?

1345
01:37:34,691 --> 01:37:36,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are coming out this week?

1346
01:37:36,411 --> 01:37:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, today.

1347
01:37:37,072 --> 01:37:38,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they just came out this past week.

1348
01:37:38,992 --> 01:37:42,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out in the Guitar Hero World Tour store right now.

1349
01:37:44,395 --> 01:37:49,497
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us a topic to talk about on Twitter, we'll open up Twitter topics next week just a little bit before the show.

1350
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:55,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably if we already are covering your topic somewhere else in the show, sadly you probably didn't make it tonight.

1351
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:56,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But always try again next week.

1352
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero Van Halen Free

1353
01:38:14,963 --> 01:38:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1354
01:38:32,899 --> 01:38:41,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, using those codes, you enter them in online to prove that you've purchased the game, and then you can get your free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen.

1355
01:38:42,202 --> 01:38:49,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only will you get it free, you will get it weeks early, because it takes six weeks to ship to you, and the game doesn't come out until December 22nd.

1356
01:38:51,085 --> 01:38:56,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, I gotta imagine their sales on that game are gonna be crap, unless they're gonna count the free copies of the sale.

1357
01:38:57,087 --> 01:38:59,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I am totally surprised and shocked by this news.

1358
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:00,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I am shocked.

1359
01:39:01,349 --> 01:39:01,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

1360
01:39:03,191 --> 01:39:05,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a hypothetical situation come true.

1361
01:39:05,212 --> 01:39:06,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so weird.

1362
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:08,172
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1363
01:39:10,073 --> 01:39:11,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other interesting stuff.

1364
01:39:11,533 --> 01:39:17,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Also rumors, of course, that the Elite is going to be getting a price cut at the end of this month.

1365
01:39:17,815 --> 01:39:22,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently this is coming from a leak of a Myers catalog.

1366
01:39:23,676 --> 01:39:25,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, because I know someone who needs a new 360.

1367
01:39:25,097 --> 01:39:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a catalog that's going to be hitting stands.

1368
01:39:31,338 --> 01:39:35,642
[SPEAKER_05]: On August 30th, it shows that the Elite model has a new price of $2.99.

1369
01:39:37,084 --> 01:39:48,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, that kind of goes along with the whole rumor that the Pro system is going away because on the new arcades, the box art only shows the arcade and Elite systems.

1370
01:39:48,514 --> 01:39:50,716
[SPEAKER_05]: No Pro system to be found at all.

1371
01:39:50,856 --> 01:39:56,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rumor is that that SKU is going away and is being replaced by the Elite system for...

1372
01:39:57,882 --> 01:40:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: 299, makes sense to me, probably will happen, might even get announced next week, so wouldn't be a big surprise.

1373
01:40:05,085 --> 01:40:19,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, last but not least, there is another rumor that white and pink DSIs are coming to America, and apparently these were found in a Toys R Us database, listing both color schemes.

1374
01:40:22,023 --> 01:40:24,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that sounds totally false to me.

1375
01:40:24,384 --> 01:40:25,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that that's ever going to happen.

1376
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:27,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially not in September.

1377
01:40:30,968 --> 01:40:31,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1378
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:32,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1379
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Some rapid fire news I've got for you guys.

1380
01:40:36,412 --> 01:40:41,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey DDR fans, there's finally a point to those USB slots in the DDRX machines.

1381
01:40:41,735 --> 01:40:45,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Konami this week opened up the new DDR Edit website.

1382
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ddredit.konamionline.com

1383
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the days of edit mode and doing hell edits.

1384
01:41:12,902 --> 01:41:13,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss that too.

1385
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:18,384
[SPEAKER_04]: We would actually get the Japanese games that you could edit the songs and take them into the arcade because it all matched up.

1386
01:41:18,564 --> 01:41:18,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1387
01:41:18,844 --> 01:41:19,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun times.

1388
01:41:19,664 --> 01:41:24,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we'd hack them to add freeze arrows to songs that didn't have freeze arrows.

1389
01:41:24,486 --> 01:41:25,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1390
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:25,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1391
01:41:25,806 --> 01:41:26,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fun times.

1392
01:41:26,546 --> 01:41:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun times.

1393
01:41:27,646 --> 01:41:29,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember you giving away the boxes of movies.

1394
01:41:30,487 --> 01:41:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1395
01:41:30,807 --> 01:41:31,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It was make, edit, get porn.

1396
01:41:31,928 --> 01:41:32,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1397
01:41:32,388 --> 01:41:32,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1398
01:41:33,428 --> 01:41:33,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic times.

1399
01:41:33,908 --> 01:41:35,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to that kid that won, Dave?

1400
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:35,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him?

1401
01:41:36,493 --> 01:41:37,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to him?

1402
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:38,035
[SPEAKER_05]: He became a man that day.

1403
01:41:38,135 --> 01:41:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he?

1404
01:41:40,517 --> 01:41:46,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I got the box full of anime and stuff that one time, which eventually went to Dimple.

1405
01:41:46,763 --> 01:41:46,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

1406
01:41:47,864 --> 01:41:53,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, live at QuakeCon 2009 has been spotted some new games on Xbox Live Arcade.

1407
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom 2 has been spotted out there on the show floor, apparently.

1408
01:41:56,893 --> 01:41:57,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1409
01:41:57,634 --> 01:42:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake Live, both for Xbox 360's Arcade were both apparently out there on a floor on the floor I guess, let me actually clarify I guess only Doom 2 was out there actually playable on the floor but somebody actually had like a shirt that said Quake Arena Arcade or what have you and they've got some pictures and so forth Lies!

1410
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:18,196
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all lies!

1411
01:42:19,017 --> 01:42:20,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe it one second

1412
01:42:22,426 --> 01:42:25,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I just had to be the counterpoint to that.

1413
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:29,993
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somebody, there's like a picture of somebody playing Doom 2 on Xbox with an Xbox controller.

1414
01:42:30,033 --> 01:42:31,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's photoshopped, it's live.

1415
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:32,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1416
01:42:33,733 --> 01:42:38,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly from me tonight, there's a brand new game coming out for an old system.

1417
01:42:38,337 --> 01:42:39,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And the old system?

1418
01:42:39,478 --> 01:42:40,659
[SPEAKER_04]: The Atari Lynx.

1419
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1420
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:41,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1421
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one of those.

1422
01:42:42,561 --> 01:42:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new game called Zaku coming out for the Atari Lynx.

1423
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:52,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is named after one of OLR's infamous callers is getting his own game on the Atari Lynx.

1424
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:53,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting this.

1425
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same people that brought you, do you remember Beggar Prince that came out on the Genesis in 2006?

1426
01:42:57,834 --> 01:42:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1427
01:42:59,468 --> 01:43:26,534
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of Wukong also now those are actually like localized games from Taiwan that I guess just came out or whatever but this is something I guess that was built on the development kit for the Atari Lynx on an Amiga of all things and is actually coming out and supposedly has pretty kick butt graphics for a Lynx that is it's too bad they're not bringing it out in other systems because I don't know I don't have a Lynx simulator I have a Lynx but I just don't are they actually doing a cartridge for it?

1428
01:43:26,994 --> 01:43:28,655
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what the plan is it looks like

1429
01:43:29,606 --> 01:43:31,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I might have to pick this up.

1430
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:35,131
[SPEAKER_04]: They did one for Baker Prince, I know, and they charged a lot of money for it.

1431
01:43:35,231 --> 01:43:36,732
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks like a lot of fun.

1432
01:43:36,912 --> 01:43:38,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Those carts were expensive.

1433
01:43:38,573 --> 01:43:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's an idea of what it's all about.

1434
01:43:39,954 --> 01:43:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a horizontal shooter, and it is a hero who dons her rocket shoes and power gloves and sets off on a journey to retrieve stolen development tools being used to flood the market with bad games.

1435
01:43:52,633 --> 01:43:54,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually signing up for the mailing list right now.

1436
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:21,163
[SPEAKER_11]: 11.99 euro, 14.99 pound.

1437
01:44:21,183 --> 01:44:22,825
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a free trial.

1438
01:44:23,986 --> 01:44:30,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And also are getting Call of Juarez Bound in Blood demo and more content for Red Faction Guerrilla.

1439
01:44:31,634 --> 01:44:41,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Rock Band Unplugged is getting some Iron Maiden songs, The Trooper and Number of the Beast for 99 pounds a pop.

1440
01:44:42,284 --> 01:45:09,670
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's pretty good and also there's stuff for NHL 10 and LittleBigPlanet blah blah blah oh and one last thing for that one, Fat Princess is getting a connectivity patch moving forward Tecmo is getting a few games on the virtual console Ninja Gaiden and Rygar are to be coming out also

1441
01:45:12,003 --> 01:45:17,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they were talking about... Tecmo Bowl already did come out.

1442
01:45:17,788 --> 01:45:24,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I really like Ninja Gaiden, but also Solomon's Key is being added to that too.

1443
01:45:25,394 --> 01:45:27,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the old school arcade Rygar.

1444
01:45:27,315 --> 01:45:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an awesome game.

1445
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:37,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, this makes me a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very infinity happy girl is Loom.

1446
01:45:37,411 --> 01:45:39,612
[SPEAKER_11]: There's news about Loom.

1447
01:45:39,672 --> 01:45:51,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Telltale is talking about considering doing another Loom game, which I will be all over happy, happy, happy if that actually happens.

1448
01:45:52,755 --> 01:45:55,016
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually said that...

1449
01:45:58,498 --> 01:46:07,322
[SPEAKER_11]: That the game itself was about two and a half hours long and that they're trying to do two and a half hour long games and Loom fits quite well with that little strategy.

1450
01:46:08,523 --> 01:46:09,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Loom.

1451
01:46:10,744 --> 01:46:11,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Loom.

1452
01:46:11,484 --> 01:46:12,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I should actually start playing it.

1453
01:46:12,584 --> 01:46:13,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Loom is cool.

1454
01:46:13,865 --> 01:46:15,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be down with a Loom remake.

1455
01:46:16,186 --> 01:46:18,187
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a lot of nostalgia behind that.

1456
01:46:19,397 --> 01:46:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: If, and this is the big ifs,

1457
01:46:49,182 --> 01:46:55,564
[SPEAKER_05]: If they beat out Madden 10 in this month in MPD sales.

1458
01:46:55,864 --> 01:46:56,224
Ha!

1459
01:46:56,724 --> 01:46:59,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So the offer only applies to sales in August.

1460
01:46:59,805 --> 01:47:02,266
[SPEAKER_05]: The MPD figures will be used to calculate the totals.

1461
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:05,827
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to follow the guy on Twitter.

1462
01:47:06,627 --> 01:47:08,628
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you really wanted to do that.

1463
01:47:08,728 --> 01:47:14,389
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is M-A-N-V-E-E-R-H-E-I-R is his Twitter name.

1464
01:47:15,169 --> 01:47:16,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And limit one copy per person.

1465
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:20,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.

1466
01:47:24,102 --> 01:47:24,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Madden 10

1467
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:50,440
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1468
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1469
01:48:17,437 --> 01:48:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You just extended the Tingle bet?

1470
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:20,218
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

1471
01:48:20,458 --> 01:48:22,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different bet.

1472
01:48:22,379 --> 01:48:23,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1473
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit record, everybody.

1474
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:24,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit record.

1475
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:25,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1476
01:48:25,961 --> 01:48:26,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different bet altogether.

1477
01:48:27,221 --> 01:48:31,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only will he give you free copies of Wolfenstein, I'll dress up like Tingle playing Madden.

1478
01:48:32,283 --> 01:48:33,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Wolfenstein, I guess.

1479
01:48:33,484 --> 01:48:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be appropriate.

1480
01:48:34,985 --> 01:48:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's never gonna happen.

1481
01:48:37,846 --> 01:48:38,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

1482
01:48:38,326 --> 01:48:40,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Tingle with a gun speaking German.

1483
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:45,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify the terms of the bet, just in case, because you never know what might happen.

1484
01:48:46,517 --> 01:48:53,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Wolfenstein, the new Wolfenstein, should outsell Madden in the first month of release, you will dress up as Tingle here on the show.

1485
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:58,161
[SPEAKER_04]: If this gentleman has to reimburse all his customers, you too will dress up like Tingle here on the show.

1486
01:48:59,022 --> 01:49:01,803
[SPEAKER_04]: But you will not set fire and Bobby Black will fire Tingle.

1487
01:49:01,923 --> 01:49:02,883
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's just... No, that's gone.

1488
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my judgment, because... Okay.

1489
01:49:05,324 --> 01:49:06,945
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead, you will play...

1490
01:49:08,545 --> 01:49:12,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and this isn't like we're adding the numbers of Wolfenstein to the million.

1491
01:49:13,028 --> 01:49:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that is not going to happen.

1492
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:18,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely different bet, and you all wanted something to come back.

1493
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: You all wanted something where Loki would be willing to dress up as Tingle again, so here it is.

1494
01:49:23,013 --> 01:49:23,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen.

1495
01:49:24,033 --> 01:49:26,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I only make bets that I'm confident in that I'm going to win.

1496
01:49:27,515 --> 01:49:28,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

1497
01:49:28,836 --> 01:49:29,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1498
01:49:29,356 --> 01:49:30,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's going to outsell Madden?

1499
01:49:31,597 --> 01:49:34,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I know from selling Madden that that's not going to fucking happen, so...

1500
01:49:35,695 --> 01:49:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, let's hope for the wishful thinking there.

1501
01:49:39,796 --> 01:49:45,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, and the guys behind Wolfenstein, thank you, because you just upped their sales by, you know, how many people listen to the show?

1502
01:49:45,617 --> 01:49:46,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, two.

1503
01:49:49,718 --> 01:49:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anyone who's seen mine knows that there's no way.

1504
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:52,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like him.

1505
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:55,860
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows there's no way that's going to happen, but hey, it makes him look nice.

1506
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1507
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:58,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just nice.

1508
01:49:59,421 --> 01:50:00,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You're offering the tingle thing again.

1509
01:50:01,835 --> 01:50:05,257
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days, man, you know, someday this show is going to have to end.

1510
01:50:05,337 --> 01:50:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday.

1511
01:50:06,518 --> 01:50:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope before it's over we get you in a Tingle costume one way or another.

1512
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:10,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1513
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Never going to happen.

1514
01:50:11,841 --> 01:50:12,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Had to lose a bet.

1515
01:50:12,942 --> 01:50:16,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, I have judgments not selling.

1516
01:50:17,745 --> 01:50:18,045
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1517
01:50:18,165 --> 01:50:18,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1518
01:50:18,805 --> 01:50:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Or being made anymore.

1519
01:50:21,061 --> 01:50:22,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to something else.

1520
01:50:22,262 --> 01:50:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, maybe Loki could dress up as this.

1521
01:50:24,545 --> 01:50:25,766
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little more manly.

1522
01:50:25,826 --> 01:50:28,228
[SPEAKER_04]: He could dress up as Pyramid Head or something out of Silent Hill.

1523
01:50:29,069 --> 01:50:32,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Silent Hill, actually we'll have a lot of people dressing up in the name of Silent Hill.

1524
01:50:33,334 --> 01:50:40,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's going to be an actual Silent Hill haunted house, or as they're calling it, a haunted attraction coming to South...

1525
01:50:41,462 --> 01:50:42,243
[SPEAKER_04]: SILENTHILL HAUNTED HOUSE

1526
01:51:11,024 --> 01:51:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:51:40,396 --> 01:51:41,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We would make Silent Hill music.

1528
01:51:42,618 --> 01:51:43,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's two mazes.

1529
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:46,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one's called Fear.

1530
01:51:47,003 --> 01:51:48,065
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks scary, Jamie.

1531
01:51:48,145 --> 01:51:48,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you want to go?

1532
01:51:49,486 --> 01:51:50,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do Silent Hill.

1533
01:51:51,689 --> 01:51:52,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Single admission, $13.

1534
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:53,170
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing this.

1535
01:51:57,332 --> 01:52:00,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the Silent Hill music, but it gives you a little ambiance there.

1536
01:52:01,314 --> 01:52:05,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun, actually, to go down there and go to the haunted house and go to Disneyland.

1537
01:52:05,596 --> 01:52:06,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we might have to make that happen.

1538
01:52:06,497 --> 01:52:07,897
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a Saw attraction one time.

1539
01:52:08,318 --> 01:52:09,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a year ago, right?

1540
01:52:09,658 --> 01:52:09,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1541
01:52:10,038 --> 01:52:11,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm not into Saw.

1542
01:52:11,519 --> 01:52:12,860
[SPEAKER_04]: You already know how I feel about Saw.

1543
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Torture porn.

1544
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill, cool.

1545
01:52:14,821 --> 01:52:15,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Saw, torture porn.

1546
01:52:15,461 --> 01:52:17,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Saw is too hard to figure out what's going on nowadays.

1547
01:52:17,842 --> 01:52:20,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like trying to figure out what was going on in Crank.

1548
01:52:20,143 --> 01:52:20,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a twist!

1549
01:52:22,506 --> 01:52:25,428
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says if you guys go, you'll need to record it on video.

1550
01:52:25,488 --> 01:52:26,008
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't let you.

1551
01:52:26,028 --> 01:52:27,709
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably won't let us in there with a video camera.

1552
01:52:27,729 --> 01:52:29,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I don't need me... Hat cam!

1553
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:35,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need me screaming like a girl out there on YouTube because Jamie will be able to testify to this after.

1554
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:36,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she already can.

1555
01:52:36,213 --> 01:52:36,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1556
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:41,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will scream like a girl in this attraction the minute I see something that is scary.

1557
01:52:41,055 --> 01:52:42,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to know how I won't be scared?

1558
01:52:42,996 --> 01:52:44,177
[SPEAKER_11]: How you can tell if I won't be scared?

1559
01:52:44,277 --> 01:52:44,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1560
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:45,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I won't be saying anything.

1561
01:52:46,358 --> 01:52:49,460
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been in scary situations with me and you know what I do.

1562
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:49,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1563
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I shut up and I'm really quiet.

1564
01:52:52,122 --> 01:52:54,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I will scream obscenities even if there are children around.

1565
01:52:55,606 --> 01:52:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: My voice will get even higher than it's ever gotten on the radio.

1566
01:52:58,289 --> 01:52:58,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it will.

1567
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:01,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen me on rides.

1568
01:53:01,352 --> 01:53:07,439
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just put a mic or turn on your phone to record just the audio because that would be hilarious.

1569
01:53:08,018 --> 01:53:13,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting requests from chatters wanting us to pick them up on the way to the haunted house.

1570
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We should just tell people when we're going, and then we'll all go in together.

1571
01:53:17,381 --> 01:53:23,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a big – because I know Jimmy, who used to do the show – what the hell was the show he did with John?

1572
01:53:24,323 --> 01:53:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: STFU.

1573
01:53:25,083 --> 01:53:25,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1574
01:53:43,726 --> 01:53:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Osfer in chat says, Rob, reciprocate that high voice, please.

1575
01:53:47,287 --> 01:53:48,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do that here on the radio.

1576
01:53:48,767 --> 01:53:49,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

1577
01:53:49,867 --> 01:53:52,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I legitimately cannot do the screaming like a little girl.

1578
01:53:52,968 --> 01:53:55,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to do my imitation of scared Rob.

1579
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:55,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1580
01:53:55,909 --> 01:53:56,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let me take a breath.

1581
01:53:57,389 --> 01:53:58,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me get in character.

1582
01:53:59,229 --> 01:53:59,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1583
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:04,610
[SPEAKER_04]: When have I ever said, oh, my God, y'all?

1584
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,931
[SPEAKER_11]: You do that when you're teasing.

1585
01:54:05,951 --> 01:54:06,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1586
01:54:06,851 --> 01:54:07,931
[SPEAKER_11]: You do that when you tease people.

1587
01:54:07,991 --> 01:54:08,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1588
01:54:08,411 --> 01:54:10,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1589
01:54:10,792 --> 01:54:12,212
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Rob, by the way.

1590
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Needs more swearing

1591
01:54:18,942 --> 01:54:20,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I, you know, wasn't gonna.

1592
01:54:20,803 --> 01:54:21,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's Rob.

1593
01:54:22,623 --> 01:54:25,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it is high enough to break glass.

1594
01:54:25,684 --> 01:54:30,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who else lives in LA that we should challenge to come to this with us?

1595
01:54:31,066 --> 01:54:32,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Is our friends from All Games Interactive.

1596
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:34,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

1597
01:54:35,067 --> 01:54:37,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yeah, that's what we need to do.

1598
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get Lawrence, we need to get Scott, we need to get Jessica, and all of them to come with us.

1599
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:46,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And we should have like a scare-off or something.

1600
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:47,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Becky says she'll come with us.

1601
01:54:49,229 --> 01:54:50,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this needs to happen now.

1602
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:53,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anybody from All Games Interactive listening?

1603
01:54:53,952 --> 01:54:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's throw down.

1604
01:54:54,752 --> 01:54:55,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a scare-off.

1605
01:54:57,934 --> 01:54:59,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how a scare-off works.

1606
01:55:01,155 --> 01:55:03,296
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have to hold a glass of water.

1607
01:55:04,877 --> 01:55:07,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you spill the glass of water...

1608
01:55:09,269 --> 01:55:10,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know why Osfer's thanking me.

1609
01:55:10,929 --> 01:55:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this idea.

1610
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like this idea.

1611
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:18,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Have to hold something that shows or like hook something up to our body.

1612
01:55:19,451 --> 01:55:21,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii Vitality Sensor.

1613
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad it won't be out in time.

1614
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:25,912
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

1615
01:55:26,332 --> 01:55:31,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Just when I found a use for the Wii Vitality Sensor to see who gets more scared here, me or Jessica, right?

1616
01:55:32,373 --> 01:55:34,674
[SPEAKER_04]: The damn thing isn't going to be out in time.

1617
01:55:35,959 --> 01:55:38,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to do it very drunk, Rob.

1618
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:40,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have like a portable heart rate monitors or something like that?

1619
01:55:40,903 --> 01:55:42,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they make those.

1620
01:55:42,244 --> 01:55:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they?

1621
01:55:42,924 --> 01:55:47,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Or actually, iPhone has an app that's a heart rate monitor where you just tap in time with your heartbeat.

1622
01:55:47,388 --> 01:55:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that wouldn't work.

1623
01:55:49,009 --> 01:55:49,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid.

1624
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:51,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Actual heart rate monitors are like 69 bucks a piece.

1625
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid that I will be trying to contain my scare, like, I'll be trying to fight it because I'm very competitive.

1626
01:55:58,913 --> 01:56:00,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I am a very competitive person, I'll admit it.

1627
01:56:01,054 --> 01:56:16,379
[SPEAKER_04]: That I, like, if I'm going against somebody from All Games Interactive in a scare-off or whatever, that I will somehow, like, between being actually scared and trying to, like, hold it in, like, I'm not going to scream, I'm not going to scream, that I will shit my pants in the middle of the haunted house.

1628
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:17,820
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what you should do?

1629
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:18,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want that to happen.

1630
01:56:18,741 --> 01:56:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an automatic loss.

1631
01:56:19,661 --> 01:56:21,703
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have judges go with you.

1632
01:56:22,503 --> 01:56:28,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Have three judges go one time with you and one time with her and then rate the scare detection factor.

1633
01:56:28,907 --> 01:56:30,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I'm picking on Jessica.

1634
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel for some reason she's the easiest target of who's most likely to get scared from the All Games Interactive crew.

1635
01:56:36,493 --> 01:56:38,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But for all I know, Mary Young is the target.

1636
01:56:38,554 --> 01:56:39,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Scott.

1637
01:56:39,475 --> 01:56:39,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1638
01:56:40,135 --> 01:56:43,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so who would you pick then to do in a least likely to be?

1639
01:56:43,277 --> 01:56:50,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I need an all-games interactive expert to tell me who is most likely to get scared at Silent Hill, the experience that I can challenge to a scare-off.

1640
01:56:51,702 --> 01:56:53,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Jessica is no longer a part of all-games.

1641
01:56:53,182 --> 01:56:54,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she was, though, right?

1642
01:56:54,843 --> 01:56:59,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, who do you think would be best off for a least likely to be scared?

1643
01:57:01,307 --> 01:57:01,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it what?

1644
01:57:01,787 --> 01:57:02,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a scare-off with you?

1645
01:57:04,168 --> 01:57:06,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it would be me that would be least likely to be scared.

1646
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:07,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1647
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the Tower of Terror scared the shit out of me.

1648
01:57:11,902 --> 01:57:13,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're going to lose.

1649
01:57:13,663 --> 01:57:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I've also been in an elevator when it's fallen.

1650
01:57:18,285 --> 01:57:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat is suggesting Derek H. Does he even live in LA?

1651
01:57:21,206 --> 01:57:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he does.

1652
01:57:22,087 --> 01:57:23,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't he like in the Midwest or something?

1653
01:57:24,228 --> 01:57:24,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.

1654
01:57:25,628 --> 01:57:26,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1655
01:57:27,349 --> 01:57:27,629
[SPEAKER_04]: SILENT HILL

1656
01:57:48,635 --> 01:57:57,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is a definite bit of... Not really a surprise, but it's sort of happy and not happy at the same time.

1657
01:57:58,659 --> 01:58:05,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Sega doesn't have any plans to do anything to commemorate the Dreamcast launch.

1658
01:58:05,242 --> 01:58:09,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Dreamcast launch happened 9-9-99, so they're not doing anything 9-9-09.

1659
01:58:10,144 --> 01:58:14,046
[SPEAKER_11]: But they said unofficially that there should be some celebrations and some...

1660
01:58:14,486 --> 01:58:18,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Parties, things to mark, you know, such a momentous day in gaming.

1661
01:58:21,828 --> 01:58:27,129
[SPEAKER_11]: But that they don't really have any plans to celebrate the US launch.

1662
01:58:29,649 --> 01:58:39,311
[SPEAKER_11]: However, they were talking, there is some talk about putting up some of, doing potential digital downloads, I think, of Dreamcast games.

1663
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:43,012
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the limiting factor being is just how large they are right now.

1664
01:58:44,545 --> 01:58:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But... You know what?

1665
01:58:46,285 --> 01:58:47,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do something on Wednesday.

1666
01:59:13,672 --> 01:59:18,954
[SPEAKER_11]: we need to come over here and play Dreamcast because of the anniversary that day and record it

1667
01:59:19,718 --> 01:59:25,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember sitting in that line outside the damn mall and getting so bored that we went over and bought books at Barnes & Noble and came back and got in line.

1668
01:59:44,915 --> 01:59:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: The launch of the Dreamcast was during the period where, believe it or not, I wasn't playing a lot of video games.

1669
01:59:50,338 --> 01:59:57,342
[SPEAKER_04]: The years I was living in Chico, kind of away at college, I kind of fell out of video gaming, my love of gaming for a while, so I kind of missed the launch of the Dreamcast.

1670
01:59:57,382 --> 02:00:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: But in retrospect, I was able to kind of catch up on it and see just how awesome of a system it was.

1671
02:00:04,045 --> 02:00:05,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic Adventure Rental Dreamcast Special Release Sonic Adventure

1672
02:00:20,522 --> 02:00:29,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised though that Sega's not even at the bare minimum releasing Crazy Taxi on Xbox Live Arcade or something.

1673
02:00:29,226 --> 02:00:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how Sega loves to re-release their old nostalgia stuff.

1674
02:00:33,288 --> 02:00:36,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a little something, some Dreamcast love.

1675
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess, though, okay, now, granted, before somebody in chat mentions it, which I'm sure they will, they do have the poll going on right now for the Genesis game that's going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade.

1676
02:00:45,793 --> 02:00:46,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys hear about this?

1677
02:00:46,853 --> 02:00:55,776
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, like, doing a poll at, what is it, GenesisPoll.com or something like that to see what game should be the next one they release on Xbox Live Arcade.

1678
02:00:55,816 --> 02:01:03,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think right now Earthworm Jim is winning by a landslide, which is too bad, because, like, Wonder Boy and ToeJam & Earl...

1679
02:01:04,559 --> 02:01:06,761
[SPEAKER_04]: and Revenge of Shinobi are all on that poll as well.

1680
02:01:07,121 --> 02:01:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be nice if it actually load.

1681
02:01:08,582 --> 02:01:09,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the whole thing not load?

1682
02:01:10,624 --> 02:01:10,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

1683
02:01:10,824 --> 02:01:11,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.

1684
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:15,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You should see a poll in the middle there with the options of the game that would come out next.

1685
02:01:15,387 --> 02:01:16,608
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird that it's not showing up for you.

1686
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:17,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It showed up for me at home.

1687
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:19,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the poll's over?

1688
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:20,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1689
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:20,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1690
02:01:21,251 --> 02:01:21,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.

1691
02:01:23,393 --> 02:01:25,714
[SPEAKER_04]: But Earthworm Jim was kicking all the other games' ass.

1692
02:01:25,734 --> 02:01:26,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that's gonna win.

1693
02:01:27,616 --> 02:01:29,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1694
02:01:30,057 --> 02:01:31,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Earthworm Jim was actually a really good game.

1695
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:32,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1696
02:01:33,942 --> 02:01:36,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that they're probably all slated to come out.

1697
02:01:36,284 --> 02:01:38,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just which one do we want to release first?

1698
02:01:38,185 --> 02:01:38,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1699
02:01:38,765 --> 02:01:55,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're all being worked on right now, which is kind of cool because, you know, it's nice to know we'll get all those games eventually, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Genesis remakes on Xbox Live Arcade, although, oddly enough, I do love the Mega Collection because I think the Mega Collection is a really, really good value.

1700
02:01:55,977 --> 02:02:01,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the ones by themselves don't bring that much to the table outside of achievements and, you know...

1701
02:02:02,386 --> 02:02:04,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Just being a rehashed version of the old game.

1702
02:02:04,947 --> 02:02:07,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But, heck, same thing as Virtual Console, I guess.

1703
02:02:08,528 --> 02:02:09,388
[SPEAKER_04]: If we want to put it that way.

1704
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so, too bad that we won't see more Dreamcast 11 on September 9th of 2009, but I guess it was just ahead of its time.

1705
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:19,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else to chalk it up to.

1706
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more news.

1707
02:02:23,132 --> 02:02:23,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1708
02:02:25,484 --> 02:02:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero World Tour

1709
02:02:48,849 --> 02:02:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero Smash Hits

1710
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:08,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your, I guess, authorization to download them.

1711
02:03:09,344 --> 02:03:11,725
[SPEAKER_05]: For cost, of course, just like Rock Band was $5.

1712
02:03:12,786 --> 02:03:15,248
[SPEAKER_05]: No pricing, though, has been announced yet for it.

1713
02:03:15,649 --> 02:03:23,255
[SPEAKER_05]: But the options, though, for PS3 and Xbox 360, you can download the whole lump of songs, or you can pick and choose which ones you want.

1714
02:03:23,995 --> 02:03:29,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, most of the tracks will be available, including, I guess...

1715
02:03:30,487 --> 02:03:47,263
[SPEAKER_05]: 152 of the 158 tracks that are available right now for download content for Guitar Hero World Tour will be compatible with Guitar Hero 5 the other cool thing though is apparently Band Hero also will be backwards compatible with these other games as well

1716
02:03:48,586 --> 02:03:52,930
[SPEAKER_05]: No word though on if you can import the Band Hero songs into Guitar Hero 5 or vice versa.

1717
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:57,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't literally Band Hero just a different skinned version of Guitar Hero 5 though?

1718
02:03:57,593 --> 02:03:57,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1719
02:03:57,813 --> 02:03:59,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Like literally?

1720
02:03:59,254 --> 02:03:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally it is.

1721
02:04:00,335 --> 02:04:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Just different skinned version with different songs?

1722
02:04:02,256 --> 02:04:03,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's different track lists.

1723
02:04:03,697 --> 02:04:06,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more geared towards kids, supposedly.

1724
02:04:06,359 --> 02:04:09,301
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just basically... In other words, I'll like it more.

1725
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:12,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another excuse to put out another version of the game.

1726
02:04:13,124 --> 02:04:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another thing that they can go, Hey, look, Guitar Hero's out selling Rock Band like ten times over.

1727
02:04:20,011 --> 02:04:22,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you're releasing ten times more games, stupid.

1728
02:04:23,474 --> 02:04:23,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1729
02:04:24,274 --> 02:04:25,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just getting ridiculous now.

1730
02:04:26,336 --> 02:04:30,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, I think a lot of people are seeing that, and they've figured out, Hey, you know what?

1731
02:04:31,701 --> 02:04:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to buy all these games.

1732
02:04:33,783 --> 02:04:37,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, before I used to pick up some of the Guitar Hero games, even though...

1733
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:39,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really play them.

1734
02:04:40,030 --> 02:04:40,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Not anymore.

1735
02:04:40,991 --> 02:04:47,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really touching them because I do realize that they're just all... So they could be available for... They're download content.

1736
02:04:47,572 --> 02:04:49,493
[SPEAKER_05]: They only have a few tracks that come out each month.

1737
02:04:49,753 --> 02:04:51,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band has a few tracks that come out each week.

1738
02:04:52,193 --> 02:04:53,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a real bummer.

1739
02:04:53,374 --> 02:05:05,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real bummer that my Xbox died when it did because I had just downloaded Janis Joplin, Peace of My Heart, which I was so looking forward to playing, and the Gorillaz pack too, and never got to play them because of my Xbox dying.

1740
02:05:06,681 --> 02:05:08,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5

1741
02:05:29,197 --> 02:05:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro tip here, just go rent World Tour and get the code from the back and hopefully no one else has thought of that.

1742
02:05:35,860 --> 02:05:36,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.

1743
02:05:37,221 --> 02:05:37,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you go.

1744
02:05:39,042 --> 02:05:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, it's no big deal.

1745
02:05:39,962 --> 02:05:43,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure the game will come down in price big time used at some point.

1746
02:05:43,764 --> 02:05:46,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, then I won't be able to get the code, huh?

1747
02:05:47,106 --> 02:05:47,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

1748
02:05:47,606 --> 02:05:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's used, you may still be able to because the codes really don't mean anything right now.

1749
02:05:52,508 --> 02:05:53,909
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't used for anything.

1750
02:05:53,949 --> 02:05:55,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you do happen to find it used...

1751
02:05:56,403 --> 02:05:57,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still use it.

1752
02:05:58,204 --> 02:05:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still probably kind of pricey used.

1753
02:05:59,946 --> 02:06:03,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there were any songs in World Tour I wanted that badly.

1754
02:06:04,829 --> 02:06:13,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing too, Rock Band 2 right now is $99 for the bundle, which is not bad if you haven't picked up.

1755
02:06:14,336 --> 02:06:15,377
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the funny thing right here.

1756
02:06:16,738 --> 02:06:20,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Beatles Rock Band bundle that they have right now.

1757
02:06:22,338 --> 02:06:32,281
[SPEAKER_05]: We found out that the title is going to be heavily allocated, which means they're only going to release limited quantities to distributors and retail stores are probably going to get them because they're going to be really hard to find, basically.

1758
02:06:33,801 --> 02:06:39,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually cheaper to buy Rock Band 2, the bundle, and then buy Beatles Rock Band, the game only.

1759
02:06:39,803 --> 02:06:43,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You will literally save almost $100 and you'll get two games instead of one.

1760
02:06:44,813 --> 02:06:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it's that important that your instruments look like the Beatles instruments, I mean, we're talking a plastic guitar here, if it's really, is it $100 important?

1761
02:06:55,296 --> 02:07:04,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, if you really want to spend the extra $100, you can buy another guitar that looks, you know, one of the two separate guitars that they have available as well.

1762
02:07:05,998 --> 02:07:12,320
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, seriously, if you're just holding out for that bundle, just buy Rock Band 2 and then get the other game.

1763
02:07:12,588 --> 02:07:16,090
[SPEAKER_04]: But aren't they going to phase out the Rock Band 2 bundles eventually?

1764
02:07:17,851 --> 02:07:20,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not because not everyone's going to want Beatles Rock Band.

1765
02:07:20,932 --> 02:07:23,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Rock Band 2 will be around for a while until Rock Band 3.

1766
02:07:23,874 --> 02:07:25,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably Rock Band 3 will be coming out probably next year.

1767
02:07:26,495 --> 02:07:29,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll probably keep Rock Band 2 around until 3 comes out.

1768
02:07:30,137 --> 02:07:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what 3 will do that really ups the ante.

1769
02:07:33,519 --> 02:07:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious.

1770
02:07:33,899 --> 02:07:38,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably offer the same stuff that they did in Beatles Rock Band like the 3 part harmonies.

1771
02:07:40,162 --> 02:07:41,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some sort of

1772
02:07:43,553 --> 02:07:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know.

1773
02:07:45,675 --> 02:07:55,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping though it at least does the whole thing where your Rock Band 1 and maybe your Rock Band 2 library can be exported and you're just going to have this gigantic jukebox of songs available.

1774
02:07:55,261 --> 02:07:55,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

1775
02:07:55,962 --> 02:07:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.

1776
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that they may have is obviously the older songs won't support the three-part harmonies, but who cares?

1777
02:08:04,788 --> 02:08:05,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to have that.

1778
02:08:06,704 --> 02:08:06,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Roadie Battle

1779
02:08:29,293 --> 02:08:37,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what's kind of neat though with the Wii version, they're actually doing something called Roadie Battle, which surprisingly enough is actually something innovative.

1780
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: What it's going to be is it's a mode that you use with your DS.

1781
02:08:42,761 --> 02:08:49,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically you need two DSs to do this, I guess if you're playing with two humans using the DS.

1782
02:08:49,925 --> 02:08:55,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other two people will play a versus battle on Guitar Hero and on the Wii.

1783
02:08:56,448 --> 02:09:25,628
[SPEAKER_05]: and so during that time you know you have little mini games that you play on the DS like for example you know you're sabotaging the other players so you unscrew the amp so you actually you know make the little motions like you're you know screwing in something and basically that will screw up the other person or they'll have one where you have to reset the soundboard and so they have little marks where the sliders need to be and you have to slide your stylus to move the sliders I think that's kind of cool and I think that would be kind of cool as a standalone you know

1784
02:09:26,758 --> 02:09:30,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer game or something like that on the Wii for Guitar Hero 5.

1785
02:09:30,402 --> 02:09:32,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say you want to play a little mini game or something like that.

1786
02:09:33,045 --> 02:09:33,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Different.

1787
02:09:33,405 --> 02:09:34,006
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of neat.

1788
02:09:36,848 --> 02:09:38,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I like any new features.

1789
02:09:38,911 --> 02:09:40,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of cool, I guess, if nothing else.

1790
02:09:40,853 --> 02:09:45,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you don't have two people, you don't have two DSs or something like that, you can actually play against a computer.

1791
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:47,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's neat.

1792
02:09:48,089 --> 02:09:48,990
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very cool.

1793
02:09:49,811 --> 02:09:59,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, a lot of things that, or I should say, a lot of complaints have been made about the Xbox 360's friends list and the fact that it's limited to basically 100 friends.

1794
02:09:59,999 --> 02:10:03,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and people are wondering, why doesn't Xbox just up the friends list?

1795
02:10:03,762 --> 02:10:07,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, honestly, guys, it's not as easy as just flipping a switch, you know.

1796
02:10:07,966 --> 02:10:12,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably this is, you know, takes a lot of work on the server ends and so forth.

1797
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:16,313
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if the things were built a certain way, then they're kind of stuck that way.

1798
02:10:16,713 --> 02:10:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently a lot of this dates back to Halo 2.

1799
02:10:20,474 --> 02:10:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently original Xbox games were coded to be limited to 100 friends and that limit was brought into the current generation.

1800
02:10:28,617 --> 02:10:33,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has to do with a report from G4, I guess, talked to a high level Microsoft source.

1801
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:39,400
[SPEAKER_04]: The real reason why they cannot up the friends list is because more people are still playing Halo 2.

1802
02:10:40,919 --> 02:10:41,379
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1803
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remove people after they've been offline for like 30 days.

1804
02:11:10,963 --> 02:11:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, then you kind of figure they're not coming back.

1805
02:11:13,745 --> 02:11:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they do, it's no big deal.

1806
02:11:15,066 --> 02:11:20,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, obviously if it's my friends or something like that that I know in real life, you know, I won't take them off there.

1807
02:11:20,672 --> 02:11:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, for the most part, I will take people that are not on there for 30 days.

1808
02:11:27,139 --> 02:11:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thought is maybe some folks will get off of Halo 2 once Halo 3 ODST comes out in September.

1809
02:11:32,544 --> 02:11:33,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

1810
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:34,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1811
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:37,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's always going to be some people playing Halo 2.

1812
02:11:37,649 --> 02:11:41,893
[SPEAKER_04]: When they pull the plug on Halo 2 someday, there are going to be some pissed off gamers.

1813
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:46,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question is, you know, how many are they willing to risk pissing off to do it?

1814
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:49,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Or why can't they just, like...

1815
02:11:51,041 --> 02:11:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, limit your friends list to show just the first 100 in Halo 2 and then just have it later, you know, more later or something like that.

1816
02:11:59,308 --> 02:12:00,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Just limit it to the first 100.

1817
02:12:03,472 --> 02:12:03,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1818
02:12:04,152 --> 02:12:06,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get into the mailbag.

1819
02:12:06,154 --> 02:12:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and the lovely DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and picks a few of her favorite emails to read here on the program.

1820
02:12:16,983 --> 02:12:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So, who's emailed us this week?

1821
02:12:19,024 --> 02:12:21,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, DarkSakura.

1822
02:12:21,345 --> 02:12:29,528
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one from Mark who says, I'm a new fan of your show and I added your video game talk show to my podcast to my Yahoo RSS feed so I can hear you all the time.

1823
02:12:30,028 --> 02:12:32,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what are all your PlayStation 3 PSN names?

1824
02:12:33,149 --> 02:12:34,670
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have one because I don't play on it.

1825
02:12:36,651 --> 02:12:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Run that by me game with your favorite PS3 games?

1826
02:12:38,771 --> 02:12:40,552
[SPEAKER_11]: No, your PSN name.

1827
02:12:41,132 --> 02:12:42,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, PSN name?

1828
02:12:43,393 --> 02:12:45,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Sky, but IE instead of Y.

1829
02:12:46,704 --> 02:12:48,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, OLR, all caps.

1830
02:12:48,925 --> 02:12:52,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if there's a space zone between Loki and OLR.

1831
02:12:52,548 --> 02:12:54,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's all one word, all lowercase.

1832
02:12:55,129 --> 02:13:00,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I think on the PlayStation Network you can have spaces.

1833
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:01,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can.

1834
02:13:02,254 --> 02:13:03,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1835
02:13:04,816 --> 02:13:05,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the forums.

1836
02:13:05,896 --> 02:13:06,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look in the forums.

1837
02:13:08,213 --> 02:13:11,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email, oh, it's by the same person.

1838
02:13:12,181 --> 02:13:14,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm not going to read one by the same person twice.

1839
02:13:14,907 --> 02:13:16,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Read it at the end.

1840
02:13:19,974 --> 02:13:31,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Redertainment Hi, I'm a resident of Utah and frequent the Best Buy store where the pilot program that was discussed last week is taking place.

1841
02:13:31,621 --> 02:13:35,984
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't ask the manager about it under the guise of doing a story for a gaming site.

1842
02:13:36,484 --> 02:13:41,648
[SPEAKER_11]: What I learned is that they are taking the trade in values from the GameStop website.

1843
02:13:42,308 --> 02:13:46,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, not all the games are subject to this program, just ones that are out of print and are hard to sell.

1844
02:13:47,372 --> 02:13:50,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't get any other details as I am not an employee.

1845
02:13:50,214 --> 02:13:51,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Super Mormon Brothers, really?

1846
02:13:52,235 --> 02:13:53,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, you could come up with better.

1847
02:13:53,656 --> 02:14:04,404
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, Grand Theft Auto, LDS in City, Sim Missionary, DDR Mormon Cabernacle Choir Mix, and Are You Smarter Than a Member of the Quorum of the Seventy.

1848
02:14:05,543 --> 02:14:08,267
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have Staycare?

1849
02:14:08,908 --> 02:14:20,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Redertainment This message brought to you by the Utah State Legislature where racism, classism, and homophobia are not just encouraged, it's rewarded That is so funny that we actually did have a listener in that town that we were talking about last week's show, that's great

1850
02:14:21,328 --> 02:14:25,550
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Robert M. Interesting you mentioned Johnny Cash and Guitar Hero 5.

1851
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:30,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, at least one or two, especially the soundtracks of those games.

1852
02:14:30,772 --> 02:14:38,235
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to lose focus creatively and musically with Underground and Underground 2, the later of which containing such random artists as Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and yes, Cash.

1853
02:14:39,019 --> 02:14:45,844
[SPEAKER_11]: I can accept such an eclectic variety of artists in a music slash rhythm game more readily than in a skating game, though.

1854
02:14:46,165 --> 02:14:53,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how I feel about the character model in 5 yet, nor have I made up my mind about Hendrix being in World Tour.

1855
02:14:54,651 --> 02:14:57,313
[SPEAKER_11]: We just had commentary from Shermie.

1856
02:14:57,673 --> 02:15:08,900
[SPEAKER_11]: To play freaking moron's advocate, I get the feeling that Mr. Kotick meant to say that he felt retail costs may need to increase as project budgets and marketing increase.

1857
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:12,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, if that's what you mean, say that.

1858
02:15:12,362 --> 02:15:21,367
[SPEAKER_11]: In an ideal world, which this isn't, Bobby wouldn't trip over a scorpion and fall into an alligator pit and be replaced with Gary Kitchens and or David Crane after a merger with their company Skyworks Technologies.

1859
02:15:23,652 --> 02:15:24,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving forward!

1860
02:15:53,666 --> 02:15:54,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2 Uncharted 2

1861
02:16:10,916 --> 02:16:36,255
[SPEAKER_04]: OLRPSP.com you can get the last 20 it's the one site where it goes back a little further but unfortunately we don't really offer any further back than that I do know some OLR listeners have scrounged up old episodes just because of server load and space every show is like 90 megabytes it's a huge amount of bandwidth so we can't offer every show but

1862
02:16:37,316 --> 02:16:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1863
02:16:57,057 --> 02:16:58,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find all the old stuff?

1864
02:16:58,317 --> 02:16:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the old ones.

1865
02:16:59,218 --> 02:16:59,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't looked.

1866
02:16:59,978 --> 02:17:00,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you put it?

1867
02:17:00,918 --> 02:17:01,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't burned them yet.

1868
02:17:02,198 --> 02:17:02,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw.

1869
02:17:02,759 --> 02:17:03,839
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to just do a DVD compilation.

1870
02:17:03,859 --> 02:17:07,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said season one is on the OL Archive now.

1871
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:15,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to remember, just remember, if you're going to go back and download episode one, episode two, it was a totally different show seven years ago.

1872
02:17:15,122 --> 02:17:15,642
[SPEAKER_11]: We grew.

1873
02:17:16,002 --> 02:17:17,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It got less mature.

1874
02:17:17,203 --> 02:17:18,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally different.

1875
02:17:18,543 --> 02:17:21,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had migrated the whole first episode, just warning everyone.

1876
02:17:21,424 --> 02:17:24,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think that was, wasn't that when I went to go sleep in the Harry Potter room?

1877
02:17:25,768 --> 02:17:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: That was later, I think.

1878
02:17:26,509 --> 02:17:28,070
[SPEAKER_11]: That was later, yeah.

1879
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:31,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I slept on a little bed under the stairs.

1880
02:17:31,993 --> 02:17:34,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason and Raichan found the old episodes.

1881
02:17:34,114 --> 02:17:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: They had them somehow.

1882
02:17:35,675 --> 02:17:38,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I must have burned them off for Raichan when I sent her the ferret years ago.

1883
02:17:39,158 --> 02:17:39,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet I did.

1884
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:40,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

1885
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:41,800
[SPEAKER_04]: How funny.

1886
02:17:42,865 --> 02:17:49,006
[SPEAKER_11]: So moving forward now, and actually this is one of those weeks where I've actually had to pick different emails because we've got so many.

1887
02:17:49,486 --> 02:17:51,687
[SPEAKER_11]: So if your emails aren't getting read, I'm sorry.

1888
02:17:51,887 --> 02:17:53,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just we really do have to move through here.

1889
02:17:54,768 --> 02:17:56,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Shook here, or is it Shookay?

1890
02:17:57,028 --> 02:17:57,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1891
02:17:57,768 --> 02:18:03,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Lately I've been thinking about getting Final Fantasy X on PS2 for my 13th birthday on October 17th.

1892
02:18:03,289 --> 02:18:09,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Thing is, my old man, who's just about as heartless as a grizzled non-vet, won't let me get what he calls, quote, pussy jab stuff, end quote.

1893
02:18:10,351 --> 02:18:10,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Ew.

1894
02:18:10,987 --> 02:18:12,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not racist at all.

1895
02:18:12,127 --> 02:18:12,868
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not at all.

1896
02:18:13,388 --> 02:18:16,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you give me some advice as to coercing him into letting me get it?

1897
02:18:16,689 --> 02:18:17,790
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be much appreciated.

1898
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:20,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell him it's localized for American audiences.

1899
02:18:23,932 --> 02:18:24,672
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

1900
02:18:24,912 --> 02:18:27,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do what I used to do and sneak.

1901
02:18:27,694 --> 02:18:28,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy it yourself.

1902
02:18:29,514 --> 02:18:31,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Final Fantasy X for the PS2?

1903
02:18:32,155 --> 02:18:32,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1904
02:18:32,575 --> 02:18:34,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that's like 20 bucks now.

1905
02:18:34,736 --> 02:18:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it.

1906
02:18:35,417 --> 02:18:38,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell back some old games to GameStop and just buy the game yourself.

1907
02:18:38,738 --> 02:18:38,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1908
02:18:40,169 --> 02:18:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And, dude, Final Fantasy X had Blitzball.

1909
02:18:43,012 --> 02:18:43,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty hardcore.

1910
02:18:43,693 --> 02:18:47,117
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for being a lot more open-minded than your father.

1911
02:18:47,177 --> 02:18:49,860
[SPEAKER_11]: No insult intended towards your father, but he sounds bigoted.

1912
02:18:51,641 --> 02:18:54,744
[SPEAKER_04]: He sounds like an asshole and complete ill willment towards your father.

1913
02:18:54,784 --> 02:18:55,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1914
02:18:55,144 --> 02:18:55,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Ill willment.

1915
02:18:56,305 --> 02:18:57,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't like to.

1916
02:18:57,126 --> 02:18:57,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're cool.

1917
02:18:57,826 --> 02:18:58,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool.

1918
02:18:58,246 --> 02:18:59,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to insult people's parents.

1919
02:18:59,848 --> 02:19:00,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1920
02:19:00,969 --> 02:19:08,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Because even though our parents may be, you know, my dad is fairly racist and thick headed, but I still.

1921
02:19:09,015 --> 02:19:11,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when my mom and dad say stupid shit, I call him on it.

1922
02:19:11,617 --> 02:19:13,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but that's just the way we are in our family.

1923
02:19:13,499 --> 02:19:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they call me on stuff.

1924
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:15,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I call them on stuff.

1925
02:19:15,961 --> 02:19:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So what can you do?

1926
02:19:17,702 --> 02:19:17,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1927
02:19:19,444 --> 02:19:20,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Shermie smelling the microphone?

1928
02:19:22,372 --> 02:19:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1929
02:19:22,932 --> 02:19:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're almost strangled.

1930
02:19:24,514 --> 02:19:25,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Shermie.

1931
02:19:26,435 --> 02:19:27,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor Shermie.

1932
02:19:27,156 --> 02:19:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Go sit on Dan's desk.

1933
02:19:29,458 --> 02:19:31,739
[SPEAKER_11]: She likes people, she just is nervous.

1934
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:32,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1935
02:19:33,721 --> 02:19:37,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, tell your dad, you know, to get with the times.

1936
02:19:39,205 --> 02:19:41,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, this one's for me from Cheeseburger.

1937
02:19:42,515 --> 02:19:44,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, what's a good starter pinball machine for under $1,000?

1938
02:19:44,657 --> 02:19:47,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and post more videos on YouTube, they're great.

1939
02:19:48,119 --> 02:19:55,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for the record, T-H-E-R-E is for location, T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E is what you intended.

1940
02:19:56,565 --> 02:20:00,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Good pinball tables under $1,000, good luck on eBay and Craigslist, seriously.

1941
02:20:00,628 --> 02:20:05,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to pick up a beater, just to let you know, typically for that low price.

1942
02:20:05,672 --> 02:20:18,574
[SPEAKER_11]: but you can it's a good way to get started you know if you pick up a you know a beater machine needs a little bit of work and start putting the work into it yourself you can trade it later on for other tables for things that you want better um

1943
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:34,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, those are really... Also, there's a... Dan's not here for me to get the name of it from him, but there's a... The Sacramento Pinball Group actually puts up purchased stuff every so often.

1944
02:20:34,699 --> 02:20:36,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a group that my husband's a part of.

1945
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:49,688
[SPEAKER_11]: But just... eBay and Craigslist, really, you just need to make sure that you look for, you know, everything works or, you know, if there's a problem with it, don't make sure there's no, like...

1946
02:20:50,268 --> 02:20:50,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Last email?

1947
02:20:50,508 --> 02:20:50,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1948
02:21:13,598 --> 02:21:14,719
[SPEAKER_11]: from Geekboy2424.

1949
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:23,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, with the summer of arcade coming to an end and Rob's obsession with Super Metroid, I wanted to know if any of you are interested in Shadow Complex.

1950
02:21:23,851 --> 02:21:25,793
[SPEAKER_11]: What makes it look good to you or makes it look bad?

1951
02:21:25,873 --> 02:21:27,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the opinions and I love the show.

1952
02:21:28,056 --> 02:21:29,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Logan aka Geekboy2424.

1953
02:21:29,738 --> 02:21:36,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be honest, I don't know much about the game, and especially because my Xbox 360 fried this week, I don't think I'll be getting this anytime soon.

1954
02:21:36,764 --> 02:21:40,967
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love the idea of a game influenced by Super Metroid, and I'm all about that.

1955
02:21:41,808 --> 02:21:44,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out, at least the demo, just based on that alone.

1956
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:47,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the fact that it's that whole exploration and power-ups.

1957
02:21:48,353 --> 02:21:49,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love that kind of design.

1958
02:21:49,454 --> 02:21:52,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I love my Super Metroid, and I just love the design of that game.

1959
02:21:52,597 --> 02:21:54,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved Castlevania, too.

1960
02:21:55,479 --> 02:21:56,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Symphony of the Night, of course.

1961
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm all about at least checking it out, if nothing else.

1962
02:22:01,505 --> 02:22:01,745
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1963
02:22:02,025 --> 02:22:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good to me.

1964
02:22:02,926 --> 02:22:07,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us more emails to read in the future.

1965
02:22:07,911 --> 02:22:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, it's time to get into our FUs of the week.

1966
02:22:10,293 --> 02:22:14,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully, there wasn't a lot of stupidity out there on the internet last week.

1967
02:22:14,297 --> 02:22:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: At least we didn't find any.

1968
02:22:15,558 --> 02:22:17,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't really have anything to dedicate this week's FUs to.

1969
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:21,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, except for the fact that my Xbox 360 fried itself.

1970
02:22:38,348 --> 02:22:38,848
[SPEAKER_10]: My F.U.

1971
02:22:38,888 --> 02:22:42,609
[SPEAKER_10]: goes to how much my hand hurts and the freaking suture that was left in it.

1972
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:43,350
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1973
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:44,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1974
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:45,731
[SPEAKER_05]: F.U.

1975
02:22:45,751 --> 02:22:49,172
[SPEAKER_05]: goes to all the drinks that I just had because I feel really full.

1976
02:22:49,732 --> 02:22:56,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to the guys that's on the Neo Geo forums that's selling all the candy cabinets that won't get back to me.

1977
02:22:56,934 --> 02:23:03,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people are antsy because they're waiting to hear back from them and I want to put down my deposit to guarantee my cabinets.

1978
02:23:04,477 --> 02:23:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1979
02:23:06,267 --> 02:23:07,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

1980
02:23:07,148 --> 02:23:08,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have a lot of FUs.

1981
02:23:08,649 --> 02:23:11,270
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs to the fact that I nap too much.

1982
02:23:11,971 --> 02:23:12,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my FU this week.

1983
02:23:14,012 --> 02:23:14,613
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to napping.

1984
02:23:14,773 --> 02:23:16,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, actually, napping's awesome.

1985
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:18,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say FU to it, because it's really cool, actually.

1986
02:23:19,496 --> 02:23:20,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I just do it too much.

1987
02:23:20,617 --> 02:23:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.

1988
02:23:21,707 --> 02:23:22,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I like naps.

1989
02:23:22,728 --> 02:23:23,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Naps are cool.

1990
02:23:24,409 --> 02:23:25,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you nap all the time like me.

1991
02:23:26,551 --> 02:23:33,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:23:33,917 --> 02:23:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a few more stories before we get to that.

1993
02:23:35,978 --> 02:23:36,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki.

1994
02:23:37,179 --> 02:23:41,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a girl and a gamer who wishes that there were more girl gamer perspectives for you?

1995
02:23:41,723 --> 02:23:42,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes I am.

1996
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:52,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're in luck, because now there's the Gamer's Girl, which is a brand new blog that you can find at thegamersgirl.blogspot.com.

1997
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:58,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a website geared towards women who are dating gamers.

1998
02:23:59,314 --> 02:24:03,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have interesting little articles.

1999
02:24:03,457 --> 02:24:07,980
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them that they're highlighting, of course, is the Gamer Widow.

2000
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:09,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically...

2001
02:24:11,563 --> 02:24:14,505
[SPEAKER_05]: A woman that has lost their boyfriend to gaming.

2002
02:24:16,147 --> 02:24:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: They offer tips for gamers to keep their significant other from resenting or interrupting their game time needlessly.

2003
02:24:23,933 --> 02:24:30,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, setting aside a half an hour right when you get home from work to lavish affection on your partner before you switch on the 360.

2004
02:24:31,819 --> 02:24:35,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta tell you, from my own experience, that does work.

2005
02:24:35,461 --> 02:24:38,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you may want to follow that advice.

2006
02:24:39,244 --> 02:24:40,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, um...

2007
02:24:42,031 --> 02:24:43,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat, I guess.

2008
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:08,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to the Skype line.

2009
02:25:08,924 --> 02:25:13,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And this story has to do with something that women and men and everybody can bond over.

2010
02:25:14,012 --> 02:25:14,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemons!

2011
02:25:15,434 --> 02:25:16,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2012
02:25:16,556 --> 02:25:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me show you them.

2013
02:25:18,783 --> 02:25:22,284
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some new Pokemon games coming out this spring.

2014
02:25:22,964 --> 02:25:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: The HeartGold version and the SoulSilver version.

2015
02:25:26,465 --> 02:25:32,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And what these are, these are remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver and they'll now be on the DS.

2016
02:25:34,486 --> 02:25:36,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know, right?

2017
02:25:36,887 --> 02:25:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming out Spring 2010.

2018
02:25:39,208 --> 02:25:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what is the little quote here?

2019
02:25:41,548 --> 02:25:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Announcing these much-anticipated game launches at the Pokemon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokemon.

2020
02:25:50,874 --> 02:25:55,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first, but of course, now we all know.

2021
02:25:55,697 --> 02:25:56,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That quote, by the way, from J.C.

2022
02:25:57,038 --> 02:26:00,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Smith, the Pokemon Company International's Director of Marketing.

2023
02:26:01,261 --> 02:26:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go, remakes coming for the DS.

2024
02:26:03,563 --> 02:26:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as what features and so forth on them, don't know yet, but there's a trailer out there.

2025
02:26:08,826 --> 02:26:11,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it does have Wi-Fi battling going on on it.

2026
02:26:12,009 --> 02:26:13,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool, I guess.

2027
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:17,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had... Was it Gold and Silver I had?

2028
02:26:17,893 --> 02:26:19,595
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the last one I think I had was Ruby.

2029
02:26:19,615 --> 02:26:20,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the last one I had.

2030
02:26:20,876 --> 02:26:22,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an advanced game.

2031
02:26:24,339 --> 02:26:26,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of not into Pokemon anymore.

2032
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to show people your Pokemans?

2033
02:26:29,341 --> 02:26:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore.

2034
02:26:30,081 --> 02:26:30,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not as into them as I used to be.

2035
02:26:30,981 --> 02:26:35,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I remember you playing that, or maybe it was Shane playing that on the... Probably both were.

2036
02:26:35,723 --> 02:26:38,824
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boy Advance thing for the GameCube.

2037
02:26:39,877 --> 02:26:44,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing Ruby on that one for a while.

2038
02:26:44,758 --> 02:26:48,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had Ruby and he had Sapphire and we were doing the trading thing for a little bit.

2039
02:26:49,499 --> 02:26:54,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing Pearl for a while when I would go to the gym and play Pokemans.

2040
02:26:55,121 --> 02:26:55,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2041
02:26:55,421 --> 02:26:57,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon is just so repetitive to me.

2042
02:26:57,081 --> 02:26:58,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my problem with it.

2043
02:26:58,101 --> 02:26:59,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It just got too repetitive.

2044
02:26:59,762 --> 02:27:00,142
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2045
02:27:00,542 --> 02:27:03,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing will ever top Pokemon Snap in terms of coolness.

2046
02:27:03,783 --> 02:27:04,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2047
02:27:04,603 --> 02:27:05,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Pokemon Snap.

2048
02:27:05,523 --> 02:27:08,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I still play that on Virtual Console once in a great while, but it happens.

2049
02:27:09,926 --> 02:27:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how about that Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR?

2050
02:27:13,148 --> 02:27:14,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2051
02:27:14,789 --> 02:27:16,509
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and open it up and take your calls.

2052
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:20,211
[SPEAKER_04]: But while we wait for your calls, how about some last minute stories?

2053
02:27:20,812 --> 02:27:22,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

2054
02:27:23,193 --> 02:27:28,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Redbox is test marketing video game rentals in their kiosk for $2 a night.

2055
02:27:29,136 --> 02:27:32,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're testing this right now in their Reno, Nevada market.

2056
02:27:34,113 --> 02:27:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2057
02:27:35,174 --> 02:27:35,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2058
02:27:36,275 --> 02:27:36,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2059
02:27:36,995 --> 02:27:37,996
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, everyone?

2060
02:27:38,016 --> 02:27:40,057
[SPEAKER_04]: You always seem to get through, Ranma.

2061
02:27:40,078 --> 02:27:40,818
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2062
02:27:42,259 --> 02:27:42,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Not too much.

2063
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:46,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, I take another one for the team.

2064
02:27:46,622 --> 02:27:49,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out, I dropped five bucks on Rock Revolution.

2065
02:27:50,645 --> 02:27:55,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about this insane price drop for Rock Revolution, that it was coming way down in price.

2066
02:27:55,348 --> 02:27:57,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So you actually picked this up, huh?

2067
02:27:58,150 --> 02:27:58,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2068
02:27:58,810 --> 02:28:01,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it was retailing for $16.99 at most places, and it

2069
02:28:03,066 --> 02:28:06,607
[SPEAKER_14]: The place right across the street from my job price matched GameStop for me, which was pretty cool.

2070
02:28:07,387 --> 02:28:07,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

2071
02:28:07,888 --> 02:28:15,630
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well... If I paid more than $4.99, I would have thrown it across the room.

2072
02:28:17,431 --> 02:28:21,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since you only paid $5, doesn't that make it eligible to be thrown across the room?

2073
02:28:22,553 --> 02:28:25,294
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that it has Twisted Sisters, we're not going to take it.

2074
02:28:26,094 --> 02:28:27,094
[SPEAKER_14]: It slides because of that.

2075
02:28:27,294 --> 02:28:30,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Any song, any game that has that song works for me.

2076
02:28:30,896 --> 02:28:31,916
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't that a cover?

2077
02:28:32,145 --> 02:28:33,745
[SPEAKER_14]: but aren't they all bad covers?

2078
02:28:33,865 --> 02:28:35,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care!

2079
02:28:35,646 --> 02:28:36,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so awesome!

2080
02:28:38,346 --> 02:28:40,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, but how's the game itself?

2081
02:28:40,287 --> 02:28:41,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how's the interface?

2082
02:28:41,627 --> 02:28:42,487
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it run?

2083
02:28:42,607 --> 02:28:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are we just picking on Rock Revolution because it's, you know, the bastard child of music games or what's the reason to really hate this game?

2084
02:28:51,469 --> 02:28:57,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's nothing more than like Guitar Freak's drum mania hyped up on some really bad coke and steroids.

2085
02:28:58,350 --> 02:28:58,971
[SPEAKER_14]: How so?

2086
02:28:59,791 --> 02:29:01,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, first off,

2087
02:29:01,812 --> 02:29:08,577
[SPEAKER_14]: When playing with the drums, I keep forgetting that there is an actual symbol for the foot pedal instead of the lines.

2088
02:29:08,597 --> 02:29:09,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep forgetting about that.

2089
02:29:11,098 --> 02:29:16,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Overall, the game plays where three songs, the album goes gold.

2090
02:29:16,702 --> 02:29:19,564
[SPEAKER_14]: If you complete five songs, the album goes platinum.

2091
02:29:20,514 --> 02:29:28,657
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the objectives is where you play one of the songs, it goes up in three levels of difficulty as you're playing, but it tells you on the screen what level you're at.

2092
02:29:29,077 --> 02:29:36,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And another one is where you practice a certain part of the song and you have to play it back fully memorized.

2093
02:29:38,301 --> 02:29:39,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of weird.

2094
02:29:41,082 --> 02:29:45,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, after two albums, you get to pick an arena.

2095
02:29:45,924 --> 02:29:49,385
[SPEAKER_14]: To give you an arena, you pick three songs and you play it right through, which is not so bad.

2096
02:29:50,515 --> 02:29:52,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, but having to play them from memory, that's kind of dumb.

2097
02:29:54,076 --> 02:29:58,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it is, but it's only for like, not the whole song, it's like maybe like 30 seconds of a song.

2098
02:29:59,758 --> 02:30:04,279
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes through with you twice, and then it goes over again from memory.

2099
02:30:04,659 --> 02:30:05,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's not terrible.

2100
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,500
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not so bad.

2101
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:11,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I actually am thinking of trying to find this game and pick it up.

2102
02:30:11,361 --> 02:30:11,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's only $5.

2103
02:30:12,822 --> 02:30:14,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whatever.

2104
02:30:14,142 --> 02:30:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent more than that on crappy Xbox Live Arcade games.

2105
02:30:18,384 --> 02:30:19,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that describes most of us.

2106
02:30:22,606 --> 02:30:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: AJ Mix in chat says, if you're going to buy Rock Revolution for five bucks just for the Bomani pack, stop.

2107
02:30:28,494 --> 02:30:29,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not.

2108
02:30:30,993 --> 02:30:31,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I... I...

2109
02:30:59,116 --> 02:31:03,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know Actdeft had me worried saying that, oh, the Rock Band drums don't work with the game.

2110
02:31:03,998 --> 02:31:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2111
02:31:04,458 --> 02:31:05,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Look on Harmonix.

2112
02:31:05,798 --> 02:31:06,799
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this last week.

2113
02:31:06,839 --> 02:31:12,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix's website has a compatibility chart that includes Rock Band, and it will tell you right there.

2114
02:31:12,561 --> 02:31:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So take a look.

2115
02:31:14,141 --> 02:31:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Works for me.

2116
02:31:15,282 --> 02:31:17,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2117
02:31:19,883 --> 02:31:20,644
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not offhand.

2118
02:31:21,044 --> 02:31:21,324
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2119
02:31:21,584 --> 02:31:22,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, Ranma.

2120
02:31:22,284 --> 02:31:22,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

2121
02:31:23,345 --> 02:31:23,785
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

2122
02:31:23,905 --> 02:31:24,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2123
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:27,805
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says, Rock Revolution is like a train wreck.

2124
02:31:27,845 --> 02:31:28,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't look away.

2125
02:31:29,168 --> 02:31:32,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That comment, of course, with all our other chat comments at chat.orangerollingeradio.com.

2126
02:31:33,015 --> 02:31:35,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Revolution, the Yaris of music games.

2127
02:31:36,287 --> 02:31:36,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, that was sad.

2128
02:31:37,008 --> 02:31:38,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost feel kind of bad for it.

2129
02:31:38,449 --> 02:31:39,230
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

2130
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:41,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel bad, because they had their opportunity.

2131
02:31:42,252 --> 02:31:51,920
[SPEAKER_05]: For, like, years, they had their opportunity, but they decided, you know what, we're just going to license the, you know, rights to our guitar, you know, peripherals or whatever.

2132
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:58,325
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to license those for the Guitar Hero arcade game, because... And they really embarrassed themselves at E3 a few years ago, didn't they?

2133
02:31:58,665 --> 02:31:58,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2134
02:31:59,105 --> 02:31:59,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2135
02:32:00,887 --> 02:32:01,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2136
02:32:01,887 --> 02:32:02,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2137
02:32:03,237 --> 02:32:04,258
[SPEAKER_03]: This is DSMaster25.

2138
02:32:04,358 --> 02:32:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, DSMaster25.

2139
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:07,000
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2140
02:32:08,402 --> 02:32:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

2141
02:32:09,022 --> 02:32:11,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you guys talking Rock Revolution.

2142
02:32:12,465 --> 02:32:16,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had the ROM for probably about two days now.

2143
02:32:17,170 --> 02:32:21,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to tell people we have ROMs.

2144
02:32:23,675 --> 02:32:24,596
[SPEAKER_03]: This is translated.

2145
02:32:27,059 --> 02:32:28,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really crappy on DS.

2146
02:32:30,370 --> 02:32:34,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It has one part of the game that is missing from the console versions.

2147
02:32:35,835 --> 02:32:36,215
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2148
02:32:37,276 --> 02:32:37,836
[SPEAKER_03]: The singing.

2149
02:32:38,777 --> 02:32:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

2150
02:32:39,417 --> 02:32:42,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The console versions don't even have the singing because they're covers, huh?

2151
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:43,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't really match up.

2152
02:32:46,042 --> 02:32:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I can't think of a lot of DS games where you do that.

2153
02:32:48,304 --> 02:32:49,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually sing in the microphone, right?

2154
02:32:50,806 --> 02:32:52,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has the pitch bars.

2155
02:32:52,407 --> 02:32:54,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how Karaoke Revolution works, right?

2156
02:32:54,429 --> 02:32:54,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2157
02:32:56,070 --> 02:32:57,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's that interface.

2158
02:32:58,172 --> 02:32:58,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's

2159
02:32:59,834 --> 02:33:00,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it fun?

2160
02:33:21,547 --> 02:33:24,770
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing, part and drumming, was about as fun as it got.

2161
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:36,660
[SPEAKER_03]: The bass, I thought at first, because I had the Guitar Hero peripheral for the DS, so I figured, oh, they might have something along the lines of a Guitar Freak's minigame-ish sort of spiel.

2162
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:44,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So I plugged it in expecting the upward note chart going in, but that wasn't the case.

2163
02:33:44,767 --> 02:33:47,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like strum up, strum down, strum up, strum down.

2164
02:33:47,662 --> 02:33:49,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing for the bass, but with the four strings.

2165
02:33:49,744 --> 02:33:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

2166
02:33:51,946 --> 02:33:58,492
[SPEAKER_05]: So, basically, to sum it up, it's about as fun as dark gray notes on a black background.

2167
02:33:59,312 --> 02:34:01,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard, though, Konami's not giving up?

2168
02:34:01,434 --> 02:34:06,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Freaks has a new version coming out in Japan, and apparently they finally caught on to the five fret thing.

2169
02:34:06,599 --> 02:34:07,820
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go up to five frets.

2170
02:34:09,376 --> 02:34:11,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like that idea.

2171
02:34:11,899 --> 02:34:16,625
[SPEAKER_03]: What the... You know what's funny?

2172
02:34:17,186 --> 02:34:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember this years ago?

2173
02:34:18,768 --> 02:34:28,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Years and years ago, do you remember when Red Octane, before Guitar Hero came out, their business was making money off of peripherals for Konami games.

2174
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:30,881
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually released a controller.

2175
02:34:31,261 --> 02:34:39,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, eight, seven, six, five, I don't remember, five, six years ago, before Guitar Hero was out, they released a controller for Guitar Freaks with five buttons on it.

2176
02:34:40,403 --> 02:34:43,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody always asked, why the hell are there five buttons on this controller?

2177
02:34:44,064 --> 02:34:46,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there must be a new Guitar Freaks game coming out with five buttons.

2178
02:34:46,965 --> 02:34:51,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turns out, well, it was a precursor to them putting out Guitar Hero.

2179
02:34:51,626 --> 02:34:53,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the fact, probably Konami's...

2180
02:34:55,348 --> 02:35:01,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Revitalizing their series kind of probably drove Red Octane to do it themselves and ended up being very successful with it.

2181
02:35:02,652 --> 02:35:08,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I could not... See, but I was a guitar freak before I played Guitar Hero.

2182
02:35:09,335 --> 02:35:13,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And my uncle kept telling me, like, start going up on medium.

2183
02:35:13,137 --> 02:35:14,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Use that fourth and fifth button.

2184
02:35:14,718 --> 02:35:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I can't.

2185
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:21,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too used to the three-button pressing system that was on Guitar Freaks.

2186
02:35:21,622 --> 02:35:23,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so used to the Japanese guitar games.

2187
02:35:24,966 --> 02:35:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes time.

2188
02:35:25,727 --> 02:35:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You just practice and it takes time.

2189
02:35:27,028 --> 02:35:30,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Four isn't as hard to do because you can do four without really moving your hand.

2190
02:35:31,190 --> 02:35:34,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's five that gets tricky because you have to learn how to move your hand back and forth.

2191
02:35:34,593 --> 02:35:35,494
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it gets really hard.

2192
02:35:35,534 --> 02:35:39,436
[SPEAKER_04]: But four, most guitar freaks players can do four pretty easy because it's still one hand.

2193
02:35:39,556 --> 02:35:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to get your pinky.

2194
02:35:40,637 --> 02:35:43,859
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do pinky exercises every day and you'll get better.

2195
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:47,702
[SPEAKER_03]: See, and actually get this.

2196
02:35:47,802 --> 02:35:52,966
[SPEAKER_03]: My school, for like fundraisers for the music program, they've been having guitar hill tournaments all these

2197
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually they finally had a rock band last year.

2198
02:35:56,491 --> 02:36:10,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's just a matter of time before they just, because with DJ Hero coming out, do you think, I think you guys might have heard this before, but some of me thinking, because, you know, I've been working on this whole mod with like Disney rock songs on Guitar Freaks.

2199
02:36:10,857 --> 02:36:16,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, kind of like how the people have been modding Guitar Hero tracks for a while.

2200
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing it with Guitar Freaks, but now it's all Disney stuff because they haven't done a Disney Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania.

2201
02:36:22,728 --> 02:36:31,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, why haven't they done Disney with anything else other than DDR and Poppin'?

2202
02:36:31,193 --> 02:36:32,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give them ideas.

2203
02:36:32,794 --> 02:36:48,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Disney has their own studio, Disney has their own gaming studio, and for whatever reason, well, because DDR is Konami's thing, Disney can't really rip it off for themselves, but Konami, as you can see, does not have the locks on guitar games, so if Disney wants to do their own guitar game, they will.

2204
02:36:48,742 --> 02:36:49,883
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the reason behind it.

2205
02:36:51,722 --> 02:36:54,985
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm... But here's one thing I kind of figure.

2206
02:36:55,125 --> 02:36:59,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Around the lines, no one helped out where the Jonas Brothers are, just speaking Disney.

2207
02:37:00,730 --> 02:37:12,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually at a Demi concert, and there was like this supposed preview coming up with the Jonas Brothers talking guitar hero, and possibly an expansion pack for them.

2208
02:37:12,921 --> 02:37:15,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I could see that happening, and...

2209
02:37:16,328 --> 02:37:23,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you look at the light at GameStop, instead of teenage boys, you're going to be seeing tween girls.

2210
02:37:23,552 --> 02:37:25,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a band here, probably.

2211
02:37:26,254 --> 02:37:29,896
[SPEAKER_04]: As Kevin Smith says, in six years, those girls will be 18.

2212
02:37:29,936 --> 02:37:36,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DS Master, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, alright?

2213
02:37:38,081 --> 02:37:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, just one last question.

2214
02:37:39,602 --> 02:37:39,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

2215
02:37:41,091 --> 02:37:48,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there's, especially with DJ Hero and Scratch coming out, do you ever think there's ever going to be a revitalization for Beatmania?

2216
02:37:48,818 --> 02:37:49,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

2217
02:37:50,099 --> 02:37:54,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, the closest you're going to get is these knockoff games coming out.

2218
02:37:54,882 --> 02:37:57,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the DJ Hero, but the other one, the Scratch Ultimate DJ.

2219
02:37:57,064 --> 02:38:00,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Scratch is as close to Beatmania as you're going to get.

2220
02:38:00,647 --> 02:38:02,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty damn close to Beatmania.

2221
02:38:02,529 --> 02:38:07,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami just doesn't care about Bomani anymore, and a lot of that has to do with the closure of their Northern California office.

2222
02:38:08,493 --> 02:38:08,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to say.

2223
02:38:09,554 --> 02:38:10,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Which sucks.

2224
02:38:10,932 --> 02:38:13,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It does suck, but there's not a lot we can do.

2225
02:38:13,874 --> 02:38:15,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DS Master, thanks so much for the call.

2226
02:38:15,674 --> 02:38:16,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2227
02:38:16,735 --> 02:38:18,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out and keep the shows rockin'.

2228
02:38:18,316 --> 02:38:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try.

2229
02:38:18,736 --> 02:38:24,098
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2230
02:38:25,019 --> 02:38:26,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get through here on the line.

2231
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,721
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably take maybe one more call and then we'll probably be done here.

2232
02:38:31,874 --> 02:38:35,036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya wants to remind us that 2DX17 is coming out.

2233
02:38:35,877 --> 02:38:37,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ, I didn't even say hello.

2234
02:38:37,338 --> 02:38:38,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2235
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:40,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, this is Legend of Zaku.

2236
02:38:41,762 --> 02:38:43,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, how would you have guessed?

2237
02:38:43,923 --> 02:38:48,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, because you cut me off, did you know that they are releasing an Atari Lynx game named after you?

2238
02:38:50,108 --> 02:38:50,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2239
02:38:50,989 --> 02:38:51,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2240
02:38:52,570 --> 02:38:53,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

2241
02:38:53,310 --> 02:38:56,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not kidding, there's an Atari Lynx game coming out called Zaku, check it out.

2242
02:38:57,874 --> 02:38:57,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh.

2243
02:38:59,147 --> 02:39:02,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Better not rip off a Gundam or anything like that.

2244
02:39:03,213 --> 02:39:05,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the only thing I'm going to warn you is that Zaku's a chick.

2245
02:39:05,676 --> 02:39:07,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So somehow something got misinterpreted.

2246
02:39:07,959 --> 02:39:09,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

2247
02:39:09,702 --> 02:39:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to go take it up with them.

2248
02:39:11,945 --> 02:39:12,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

2249
02:39:12,626 --> 02:39:13,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways...

2250
02:39:14,272 --> 02:39:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Something just came up to my attention recently.

2251
02:39:17,715 --> 02:39:23,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you noticed, but apparently Sega is pulling the plug on the Chromohound 360 servers.

2252
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:37,209
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the $50 that we pay for Xbox Live every year isn't really helping us, isn't really keeping the servers on for an unlimited amount of time.

2253
02:39:38,387 --> 02:39:45,519
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, we're paying 50 bucks, and yet our servers are more likely not going to, they don't look like they're going to be safe.

2254
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:50,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if Sega could pull the plug on that, what's going to stop other companies from doing the same thing?

2255
02:39:51,545 --> 02:39:53,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this really news though?

2256
02:39:53,046 --> 02:39:58,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I thought at least on the original Xbox that servers were being shut down for the old sports games.

2257
02:39:58,509 --> 02:39:59,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct or am I wrong on that?

2258
02:39:59,950 --> 02:40:00,590
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they were.

2259
02:40:01,390 --> 02:40:02,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has happened before.

2260
02:40:03,111 --> 02:40:06,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I think this is the first time we've heard of this happening on the Xbox 360.

2261
02:40:07,134 --> 02:40:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that it's a non-sports title that, you know, ages, you know, the ages gets old and replaced with a new sports title.

2262
02:40:15,218 --> 02:40:16,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that both kind of plays into it too.

2263
02:40:17,419 --> 02:40:20,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it sucks, but it's also kind of not the first time.

2264
02:40:21,601 --> 02:40:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I understand your point.

2265
02:40:23,062 --> 02:40:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what are we paying $50 for if it's not for the maintenance of these servers?

2266
02:40:26,725 --> 02:40:42,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't get it that we're paying that much money and we're getting, you know, and the fact of the matter is this, just getting shafted for, I don't know, I guess it's because it has the, you know, the potential to set precedent.

2267
02:40:43,177 --> 02:40:50,979
[SPEAKER_01]: If Sega could do it, then anyone else has the potential to just say, oh, we'll pull the plug on the server, even though you're paying $50 a year.

2268
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:55,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand them pulling the plug on the server if literally no one is using it.

2269
02:40:55,781 --> 02:40:58,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even if it's just a handful of people.

2270
02:40:58,802 --> 02:41:00,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are there listeners?

2271
02:41:00,362 --> 02:41:03,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I want an honest poll of the listeners.

2272
02:41:03,123 --> 02:41:05,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anyone still playing Chromehounds online at least once a week?

2273
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:09,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

2274
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I understand what you're saying about precedent and all that stuff, but I can also understand that if they need to close down this server to make room for a new game, that there is a finite amount of space out there and an amount of bandwidth that maybe they just need to get rid of.

2275
02:41:26,905 --> 02:41:29,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it suck, especially considering we're paying for it?

2276
02:41:29,185 --> 02:41:31,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but... I mean, the fact of the matter is that...

2277
02:41:32,546 --> 02:41:58,949
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty much paying $50 for dedicated servers and then all of a sudden we find out that aside from the sports games, which are seasonal, I bet, you know, which are obviously seasonal and it's expected that they close out a few servers for an outdated Madden game, for example, but for something like Chromehounds, which is completely non-sports, just to have the servers closed and we're still paying for it, it's just, I don't know, it's just mind-boggling.

2278
02:42:00,161 --> 02:42:03,262
[SPEAKER_04]: DeathWishing in chat says he plays I Find Matches every night.

2279
02:42:03,402 --> 02:42:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think he's called in about Chromehounds before, so that kind of doesn't surprise me.

2280
02:42:06,423 --> 02:42:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I see anyone else, though.

2281
02:42:08,803 --> 02:42:09,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2282
02:42:10,504 --> 02:42:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this.

2283
02:42:13,505 --> 02:42:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unfortunately, I think it's one of those things where they'll just take a chance on pissing off a few people to make room for some new game they've got coming out.

2284
02:42:20,967 --> 02:42:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Sega, Sky.

2285
02:42:24,348 --> 02:42:29,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt they would even have the ability to follow up on Chromehounds unless, of course, they were

2286
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:38,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a recurring theme, though, tonight, though, is that we keep getting screwed on all these things, yet we just kind of seem to take it.

2287
02:42:38,974 --> 02:42:42,395
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Red ringings, the servers getting shut down.

2288
02:42:43,236 --> 02:42:51,660
[SPEAKER_01]: At least for PSN, I kind of expect the servers will go down because they're free, so they're only up for a limited amount of time, except for popular games.

2289
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:57,623
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, we expected that in the older PS2 days, you know, when a service is free.

2290
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:00,441
[SPEAKER_01]: but not for something that we pay for.

2291
02:43:02,801 --> 02:43:04,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's an easy answer, Zaku.

2292
02:43:04,922 --> 02:43:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to speak with our wallets.

2293
02:43:07,023 --> 02:43:09,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The StarCraft thing, that was the other thing I was going to mention.

2294
02:43:09,404 --> 02:43:12,005
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Zaku, do you have anything else for listeners today before we go and wrap it up?

2295
02:43:12,725 --> 02:43:13,085
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2296
02:43:14,506 --> 02:43:14,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2297
02:43:14,946 --> 02:43:17,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just me that I've noticed that...

2298
02:43:19,541 --> 02:43:32,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake Live, apparently John Carmack actually said over the weekend in QuakeCon is that that free online version of Quake, Quake Live can't really sustain itself on ads.

2299
02:43:32,504 --> 02:43:33,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised.

2300
02:43:33,945 --> 02:43:46,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Which brings me to the point is there even chance or any room for a viable business model for a game that just relies heavily on ad revenues?

2301
02:43:47,208 --> 02:43:47,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think if

2302
02:43:48,482 --> 02:43:54,605
[SPEAKER_01]: If Quake Live proves one thing, is that even in a tight economy, this one was hemorrhaging money.

2303
02:43:55,786 --> 02:43:59,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence the need for them to actually start releasing premium content.

2304
02:44:00,488 --> 02:44:03,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually not even, no, I take that back.

2305
02:44:04,070 --> 02:44:08,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a premium subscription where you actually create your own servers.

2306
02:44:09,352 --> 02:44:12,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in order to answer that question, you have to ask yourself, how often do you click on ads?

2307
02:44:13,925 --> 02:44:21,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not that you click on the ads, it's that the ads are actually strewn all over the actual maps in the game.

2308
02:44:21,227 --> 02:44:21,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

2309
02:44:22,628 --> 02:44:43,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily clicking the ads, it's just the fact that I guess if it's something nostalgic like Quake, and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't even enough even on ads to break even, then I don't know if it might be viable for future business models with that same type.

2310
02:44:48,709 --> 02:44:53,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there is enough money to be made there because I don't think people really kind of...

2311
02:44:54,995 --> 02:44:55,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Act on that stuff.

2312
02:44:56,376 --> 02:44:56,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2313
02:44:56,837 --> 02:45:03,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the business model is going to have to be incorporating some paid content into it for the hardcore section of it.

2314
02:45:04,283 --> 02:45:14,371
[SPEAKER_01]: EA managed to get some sort of assurance in the fact that with Battlefield Heroes, at least that paid content is for the most part optional.

2315
02:45:14,851 --> 02:45:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember reading before tonight's show about this and that Quake Live, they're actually going to do a paid thing where you will be able to set up your own private rooms and so forth.

2316
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2317
02:45:24,611 --> 02:45:33,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean with Battlefield Heroes it's kind of like the other side of the coin where EA is not forcing you to buy certain content in order to play the game.

2318
02:45:34,296 --> 02:45:38,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just mostly aesthetics and just to level up your character a lot quicker.

2319
02:45:39,459 --> 02:45:46,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can pretty much sustain without having to resort to buying DLC.

2320
02:45:46,802 --> 02:45:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that's a viable model that could supplement ad revenues as well.

2321
02:45:53,445 --> 02:45:54,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it a footy monster?

2322
02:46:16,371 --> 02:46:17,131
[SPEAKER_07]: and ShadowFly.

2323
02:46:44,977 --> 02:46:45,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

2324
02:46:46,898 --> 02:46:47,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went there.

2325
02:46:48,699 --> 02:46:53,881
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted to get some anime and manga programming in, so I figured I'd submit a panel.

2326
02:46:53,921 --> 02:47:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually wanted to do a panel about localizing American comics in Japan, which you can talk about a lot there, like the Spider-Man manga, the Spider-Man live action show, and stuff like that.

2327
02:47:04,625 --> 02:47:09,367
[SPEAKER_07]: It turns out they didn't actually advertise any of the anime and manga panels anywhere at the convention.

2328
02:47:10,668 --> 02:47:13,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ended up getting one person to come in on Sunday.

2329
02:47:14,352 --> 02:47:14,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2330
02:47:14,832 --> 02:47:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I read about this in your journal.

2331
02:47:16,854 --> 02:47:17,975
[SPEAKER_04]: This is that same convention.

2332
02:47:18,275 --> 02:47:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Like horrible signage and stuff, right?

2333
02:47:20,376 --> 02:47:21,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2334
02:47:21,777 --> 02:47:22,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've been there.

2335
02:47:22,357 --> 02:47:23,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same place that ASEN was at.

2336
02:47:23,658 --> 02:47:30,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So imagine if everything was at the convention center where you registered and they didn't have any signs pointing toward the hotel at all.

2337
02:47:30,363 --> 02:47:30,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2338
02:47:30,543 --> 02:47:31,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would go there?

2339
02:47:31,944 --> 02:47:32,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2340
02:47:33,385 --> 02:47:33,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2341
02:47:34,125 --> 02:47:35,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the convention actually have a lot of people?

2342
02:47:36,327 --> 02:47:36,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2343
02:47:37,367 --> 02:47:38,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know exactly how many.

2344
02:47:38,828 --> 02:47:40,790
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2006, they got, I think, 60,000 people.

2345
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:42,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea how many they got this year.

2346
02:47:42,091 --> 02:47:43,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's been down a lot since then.

2347
02:47:44,554 --> 02:47:45,054
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2348
02:47:53,007 --> 02:47:56,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Spreading the program with no schedule and no panels in there.

2349
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:57,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2350
02:47:57,430 --> 02:47:58,530
[SPEAKER_07]: No names or descriptions in there.

2351
02:47:58,810 --> 02:48:01,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone really made you the bastard child of the convention.

2352
02:48:02,132 --> 02:48:02,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

2353
02:48:03,753 --> 02:48:04,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2354
02:48:04,594 --> 02:48:04,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2355
02:48:05,174 --> 02:48:10,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for those that haven't been to that little area in Chicago, you have to... I mean, that walkway is no short trip either.

2356
02:48:10,898 --> 02:48:11,178
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

2357
02:48:11,198 --> 02:48:12,719
[SPEAKER_04]: To get from one to the other.

2358
02:48:12,779 --> 02:48:18,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't know where to go... I mean, during ASAN, you can figure it out because there's tons of people traveling through there all the time.

2359
02:48:18,742 --> 02:48:21,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if it's not being trafficked...

2360
02:48:22,184 --> 02:48:23,105
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't know where to go.

2361
02:48:23,625 --> 02:48:27,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to make this gaming related, they had a ton of gaming bootlegs there too.

2362
02:48:27,027 --> 02:48:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: People were selling full sets of ROMs on the floor.

2363
02:48:29,189 --> 02:48:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a main cabinet going with a couple tournaments throughout the day.

2364
02:48:31,910 --> 02:48:32,631
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty bold.

2365
02:48:33,931 --> 02:48:34,952
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a gaming section.

2366
02:48:35,132 --> 02:48:36,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was kind of funny.

2367
02:48:36,153 --> 02:48:38,274
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a Street Fighter 4 tournament, or they were supposed to.

2368
02:48:40,255 --> 02:48:44,438
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted people to pay $20 to enter, and of course no one did, so they didn't end up having it.

2369
02:48:46,539 --> 02:48:47,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an interesting convention.

2370
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:51,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say I'd want to go back, and if I didn't get a free badge, I don't think I would have gone.

2371
02:48:51,704 --> 02:48:56,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least, you know, now you know, and at least it wasn't, like, that wasn't the focus.

2372
02:48:56,566 --> 02:49:02,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, for, I guess, maybe a comic book convention, they probably did alright, but that's unfortunate, though.

2373
02:49:03,308 --> 02:49:04,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a waste of time.

2374
02:49:05,269 --> 02:49:09,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I complain about King of Fighters 12 a little bit, or do you want to end the Skype?

2375
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:10,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you can.

2376
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:13,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to give the other guys a chance to say something, too, if they wanted to say anything.

2377
02:49:15,052 --> 02:49:15,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

2378
02:49:15,452 --> 02:49:16,032
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go on.

2379
02:49:16,052 --> 02:49:18,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We're busy playing World of Warcraft, actually.

2380
02:49:19,333 --> 02:49:20,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm installing Windows 7.

2381
02:49:21,604 --> 02:49:22,124
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2382
02:49:49,236 --> 02:49:50,397
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the ending?

2383
02:49:50,417 --> 02:49:54,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you notice what they did, though, with the characters themselves is that they're sprite-wrapped 3D?

2384
02:49:54,281 --> 02:49:54,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2385
02:50:10,825 --> 02:50:18,408
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very interesting, but it also causes some really weird just things that don't look right graphically with the characters themselves.

2386
02:50:18,929 --> 02:50:20,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And on top of that, there's, like, no story.

2387
02:50:21,870 --> 02:50:23,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love the animation in the game, though.

2388
02:50:23,350 --> 02:50:27,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's got the best animation of any game I've seen since Street Fighter 3, really.

2389
02:50:28,172 --> 02:50:36,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The advantage, though, for them doing it in that manner is that if they want to change anything visually about the character, they can map it over the 3D model without changing movesets.

2390
02:50:37,677 --> 02:50:37,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2391
02:50:39,482 --> 02:50:42,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just hoping we actually get those movesets back for the most part.

2392
02:50:42,584 --> 02:50:45,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm a Clark Steele player, and he's got two moves.

2393
02:50:45,906 --> 02:50:46,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally.

2394
02:50:46,887 --> 02:50:48,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it just me, or is he over-roided?

2395
02:50:49,548 --> 02:50:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

2396
02:50:50,189 --> 02:50:57,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be impossible for me to cosplay as Clark from now on, certainly in that style, unless I decide to go shopping with Hulk Hogan or Barry Bonds sometime soon.

2397
02:50:58,194 --> 02:51:00,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I also didn't like that they did Athena in the cutesy anime style.

2398
02:51:02,236 --> 02:51:03,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind that so much, actually.

2399
02:51:03,657 --> 02:51:04,477
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's warmed up to me.

2400
02:51:04,517 --> 02:51:08,500
[SPEAKER_07]: The change I... I'm a little bit iffy on Kenzo so far.

2401
02:51:08,806 --> 02:51:09,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2402
02:51:09,787 --> 02:51:13,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I like, though, that it seems that... I like his outfit in that, though.

2403
02:51:13,949 --> 02:51:16,991
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like they're doing more towards the Psycho Soldier outfit.

2404
02:51:19,192 --> 02:51:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with No My?

2405
02:51:20,573 --> 02:51:21,173
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thing.

2406
02:51:21,534 --> 02:51:21,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2407
02:51:22,214 --> 02:51:22,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that weird?

2408
02:51:23,155 --> 02:51:23,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't...

2409
02:51:24,656 --> 02:51:27,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the other thing that gets me is that there's no interaction between the characters.

2410
02:51:27,378 --> 02:51:34,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for example, you know, Leona, if you had Leona versus Heidern in the old game, she'd come out and salute him because he raised her in the storyline.

2411
02:51:35,344 --> 02:51:38,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, you'd have the Mai and Andy thing about her taunting him over wanting a baby or something.

2412
02:51:40,547 --> 02:51:42,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

2413
02:51:43,289 --> 02:51:44,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we losing you guys?

2414
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:44,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

2415
02:51:44,950 --> 02:51:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hello?

2416
02:51:45,431 --> 02:51:45,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2417
02:51:45,771 --> 02:51:45,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

2418
02:51:47,252 --> 02:51:49,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, sorry, I think my Skype hiccuped a little bit there.

2419
02:51:49,353 --> 02:51:49,694
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

2420
02:51:49,734 --> 02:51:50,014
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh,

2421
02:51:50,728 --> 02:51:53,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, people didn't really play as Mai that much to begin with.

2422
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:55,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they watched her bounce for the most part.

2423
02:51:55,712 --> 02:51:56,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Mai.

2424
02:51:56,572 --> 02:51:59,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Mai is actually a staple of my team because I'm really good with her.

2425
02:52:00,435 --> 02:52:01,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

2426
02:52:01,956 --> 02:52:09,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well guys, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for the call and have fun with all your respective games, Windows 7 and WoW and whatever you're playing these days, Rob.

2427
02:52:10,862 --> 02:52:12,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm playing a lot of BlazBlue, actually.

2428
02:52:12,583 --> 02:52:14,345
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've been playing all night and training.

2429
02:52:14,665 --> 02:52:15,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with that.

2430
02:52:15,165 --> 02:52:16,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope your Xbox 360 doesn't fry.

2431
02:52:16,546 --> 02:52:20,069
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be getting your TurboGrafx as soon as we get a paycheck in.

2432
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:21,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2433
02:52:21,299 --> 02:52:21,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to it.

2434
02:52:22,379 --> 02:52:22,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2435
02:52:22,859 --> 02:52:23,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, guys.

2436
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:24,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, everybody.

2437
02:52:25,100 --> 02:52:25,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

2438
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:26,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2439
02:52:28,281 --> 02:52:28,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

2440
02:52:28,761 --> 02:52:32,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get conference calls very often, but that was fun.

2441
02:52:32,822 --> 02:52:38,723
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days, I just want every single person listening to all make a mass Skype conference call and then call us.

2442
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:39,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be complete chaos.

2443
02:52:39,823 --> 02:52:41,284
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do SkypeCon all on Skype.

2444
02:52:41,344 --> 02:52:42,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on the radio!

2445
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:50,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's start to wrap up guys tonight because it's already after 9 o'clock and we want to get out of here before it's too late.

2446
02:52:50,824 --> 02:52:52,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But more last minute stories.

2447
02:52:52,125 --> 02:52:53,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't know if you have anything else.

2448
02:52:53,973 --> 02:52:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nothing else.

2449
02:52:55,093 --> 02:52:55,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2450
02:52:55,493 --> 02:52:55,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2451
02:52:55,713 --> 02:52:57,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a slow news week this week.

2452
02:52:57,074 --> 02:52:59,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to other weeks, it was a little slow this week.

2453
02:52:59,734 --> 02:53:01,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing else I want to talk about.

2454
02:53:01,375 --> 02:53:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it that way.

2455
02:53:02,095 --> 02:53:04,735
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other things to talk about, but there's nothing I want to talk about.

2456
02:53:04,755 --> 02:53:05,476
[SPEAKER_04]: But nothing that big.

2457
02:53:05,736 --> 02:53:06,016
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2458
02:53:06,456 --> 02:53:06,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2459
02:53:06,696 --> 02:53:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Be that way.

2460
02:53:07,416 --> 02:53:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fighting spyware, and it's just pissing me off.

2461
02:53:09,816 --> 02:53:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how annoying.

2462
02:53:10,537 --> 02:53:11,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's stuff I have to do.

2463
02:53:11,937 --> 02:53:14,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It's safe mode, and I don't feel like doing it right now.

2464
02:53:15,498 --> 02:53:15,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

2465
02:53:17,138 --> 02:53:22,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Searching for crap and then they get a wrong page and then it locks your system up because it wants to download spyware.

2466
02:53:22,644 --> 02:53:23,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pain in the ass.

2467
02:53:24,485 --> 02:53:25,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

2468
02:53:25,106 --> 02:53:33,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Since everybody's talking about this Skype thing, I remember for a while, I don't know what ever happened with it, but they were talking about doing another show on all games after us, like a late night show or what have you.

2469
02:53:34,415 --> 02:53:41,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what would be cool is somebody should just host a Skype thing, like an OLR post show that's just a massive...

2470
02:53:42,222 --> 02:53:43,803
[SPEAKER_04]: My dinner was really good, but I still want meat.

2471
02:53:43,823 --> 02:53:44,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasty, tasty death.

2472
02:54:08,220 --> 02:54:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, I want yogurt.

2473
02:54:10,021 --> 02:54:11,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be yummy.

2474
02:54:11,102 --> 02:54:11,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, Rob.

2475
02:54:11,823 --> 02:54:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the yogurt places close Sunday.

2476
02:54:14,164 --> 02:54:15,485
[SPEAKER_12]: But Baskin-Robbins is open.

2477
02:54:16,266 --> 02:54:17,767
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd have to, like, not do afterbirth.

2478
02:54:19,128 --> 02:54:19,588
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they close at 10.

2479
02:54:20,349 --> 02:54:21,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd have to hurry through afterbirth.

2480
02:54:21,830 --> 02:54:22,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do afterbirth anyway.

2481
02:54:22,811 --> 02:54:23,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

2482
02:54:23,311 --> 02:54:23,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2483
02:54:24,032 --> 02:54:24,912
[SPEAKER_12]: We can go to the grocery store.

2484
02:54:25,733 --> 02:54:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally selfish of me, but I'm thinking of, because the arcade cabinet is technically my birthday gift because the wife is letting me have it, and that's a gift alone.

2485
02:54:36,271 --> 02:54:43,839
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am going to open up the unofficial Loki's a Greedy Bastard birthday gift fund for Arcade Cabinet use.

2486
02:54:45,399 --> 02:54:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So links will be in the form.

2487
02:54:48,121 --> 02:54:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I will donate, and then I can feel guilt-free when I don't get you anything else.

2488
02:54:53,926 --> 02:54:54,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

2489
02:54:54,547 --> 02:54:56,508
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to get me anything at all anyway.

2490
02:54:56,949 --> 02:54:57,769
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what everyone says.

2491
02:54:58,149 --> 02:54:58,450
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2492
02:54:59,210 --> 02:55:03,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and close up, guys, and call it a night.

2493
02:55:03,094 --> 02:55:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys, as always, for downloading and listening to our program.

2494
02:55:05,796 --> 02:55:06,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.

2495
02:55:07,217 --> 02:55:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to help us out, just help us spread the word.

2496
02:55:10,179 --> 02:55:11,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell somebody you know about the show.

2497
02:55:12,321 --> 02:55:14,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2498
02:55:14,482 --> 02:55:15,723
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back to do it all again in seven days.

2499
02:55:15,743 --> 02:55:15,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, guys.

2500
02:55:16,003 --> 02:55:16,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good week.

2501
02:55:32,805 --> 02:55:35,567
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2502
02:55:36,087 --> 02:55:39,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2503
02:55:39,770 --> 02:55:48,416
[SPEAKER_13]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2504
02:55:48,916 --> 02:56:00,505
[SPEAKER_13]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2505
02:56:01,105 --> 02:56:01,926
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next week!

2506
02:56:03,710 --> 02:56:04,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!
