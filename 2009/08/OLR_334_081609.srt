00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, August 16th, 2009

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is there a wee cushion on the horizon?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Will the Playstation 3 soon see you laughing?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And could you soon be able to take a trip to Silent Hill for real?

Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
With you for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Happiest bunny on the farm, as I used to call her every day on this week

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait, how did that get started anyway?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't even remember

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, because I had my happy bunny stuff for a while

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You used to be obsessed with happy bunny if I remember right

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And now I think happy bunny is kind of stupid

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh really? Well, happy bunny kind of jumped the shark a little bit

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now you see happy bunny everywhere on everything

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Happy bunny was cool when no one knew about it

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Exactly

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How are you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Fine

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Not the happiest bunny on the farm, Loki

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I'm not a bunny on a farm

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're very quiet tonight, Loki, what is going on?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nothing, I'm trying to remember a password

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I think I got it

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I got it

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, I'm trying to see what you're trying to log into

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alright

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Imani Sowz is what I'm logging into

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Not the download torrents, but to read their forms

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I see

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's so important on their forms?

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Nothing, I want to see if some guy returned my PM

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And he didn't

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He's a bastard

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought they said read their porn, so

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you are corresponding with Loki, you should write him back, ass

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, it's alright

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was second in line for a system 573 board, but I didn't

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I probably don't need it now, so it's alright

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You are very quiet tonight, and I can't figure out why

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's try turning up your mic a little bit

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The beauty of live radio, boys and girls

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, I thought you meant like I wasn't saying a lot, not that I was quiet

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, like you were actually quiet on the mic, now you were too loud

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think we're good now

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So there we go

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The joy of live radio as we tape live here on Sunday nights at All Games Radio

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
www.allgames.com, live after The Bobby Black Wolf Show

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have an announcement

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You have an announcement, yes

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Rob had chicken for dinner

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I did, it was delicious

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He didn't get me any

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Grilled chicken

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I had chicken and a biscuit

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It still smells like chicken in this room, and it's driving me nuts

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Look, I was hungry, I literally had nothing to eat today

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm gonna make my husband bring me some food

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You should do that, that's why you got married, right?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, so that it'd be my man servant

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I too had chicken for dinner

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Did you?

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What kind of chicken did you have?

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I had chicken covered with Ritz cracker bits

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Have you been, since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We'll get into our gaming week in just a moment

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But since we're turning into Orange Launch Foodio

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Have you been to that new restaurant?

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I think, you know, we're an international show

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I'm sure this place exists, other places

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But it's new to Sacramento

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Have you been to Wingstop?

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's pretty interesting

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I refuse to eat there

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why is that?

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because it's attached to Pizza Hut

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, that's Wing...

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, Wing Street

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's a different one

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, Wingstop is a new one that they have here

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where they just, you know, they serve wings, obviously

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In all these different flavors

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I don't think I've ever had, like, food worse for you

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Probably that food at Wingstop

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hooters wings are worse for you

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are they?

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But Hooters wings are good

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No they're not

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No they're not

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think Hooters wings are good

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Everything at Hooters sucks

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Even the women suck

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everything at Hooters is awful

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What is wrong with this picture?

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm gonna keep the dirty comment down

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is wrong with this picture?

108
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I love Hooters more than anyone else in this room

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Their food, I have given their food, like, three different chances

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And, like, not only is their food bad, but their service is worse

111
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just, it's absolutely crap

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Their hostels taste like too much vinegar

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
For example, I went in one time and I decided

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, I'm gonna get a burger and what the hell

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's get, order the wings because everyone's raving about the wings and stuff

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Order the burger, the burger took an hour for me to get at my table

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The wings, mind you, which is their staple food that they serve there

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Took two hours to get to me

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now Loki's too loud

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And they tasted like shit, okay

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Get him angry, then he'll be louder

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And not only that, okay, so I tried normal, like, their normal hot wings or whatever

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They tasted like shit

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I tried them, like, a different flavor

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a different flavor of shit

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just, it's, it's awful

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There is nothing good at that place

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All their food sucks and if you go for the ambiance, you're stupid

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can get better food at a strip club

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you kidding?

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just, the last time I went to Hooters was Victoria and I

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We were like, where should we go eat?

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go to Hooters!

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we went, we had fun, we were laughing the whole time

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Our waitress had big boobies and we were, you know, making fun of her

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But in a positive way, like, you know

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Seriously, okay, strip club food is not very good

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It was better than Hooters

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And you know what?

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At a strip club, I'm not gonna just have to imagine naked boobies

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can see them firsthand

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, you know, I'm sorry, it's just not worth my time

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Here's my, here's my question about Hooters

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you remember that E3?

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was probably 2004, 2005

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When we were staying at the ghetto, ghetto ghetto ghetto

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like, I don't know what inspired us to stay there

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I ought to be young and in our 20s again

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But to be staying at that ghetto Motel 6

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And we had to walk up Hollywood Boulevard

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Through a concert that Jimmy Kimmel Live was doing or something

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To get to Hooters, because we were like

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hadn't you never been there at that point?

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've never been there

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right, and I was like, Loki!

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're like a manly man and you've never been to Hooters

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm like, don't tell me you're gonna make a gay man take you to Hooters

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So eventually a gay man did have to take him to Hooters

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So we went to Hooters

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And, you know, it was, it was our first experience

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, his first experience at Hooters

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I guess it wasn't favorable

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, just also getting there took us like 30 minutes

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When it was just like a block up the street

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We could see it, but it took a half an hour to get there

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, anyhow

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But it wasn't crowded, because everybody was out in the street watching the concert

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And then once the concert was over, oh damn, did that place fill up fast

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's crazy

171
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Alright, anyhow, sorry, we'll stop talking about Hooters

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And talk about our gaming week!

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What types of games have you been playing this week?

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was actually busy, believe it or not

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've really been getting into Blue Dragon

177
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Which, yeah, it took me long enough, but shut up

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I really like it for its classic RPG-ocity

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know, it's been pretty fun for me

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I also played through Raiden Fighters Aces

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And nearly beat the game, except that I was in a lot of pain when I was playing it

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I was, it was really more that I was just gonna play for a little bit of it

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then, you know, put it aside

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I actually played all the way through

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then I kept getting to the last stage

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And because my hand hurt so bad, I couldn't hit the fire button fast enough

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I kept also not counteracting the fire that was coming at me

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And kept dying

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And it turns out that when you have to continue, it starts you off from the beginning of the stage

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I just said, you know what, fuck a bunch of this

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And, you know, I'm not gonna do it

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So I put it down and then promptly went to go put my hand in a big thing of ice water

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because it really, really hurt

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then I also played a lot of the Namco Museum package that we picked up

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And, you know, just some Galaga and some Pac-Man

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait, is this the 360 compilation?

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, so this is like the Galaga Resurrection and some of the arcade titles they've put out over the past couple years

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They kind of butchered the Galaga one

199
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I like, I had more fun going back and playing Galaga 98, uh, Galaga 88

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, you know, Dan and I were actually talking about, you know, this is more fun on TurboGrafx

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, um, it's not a bad collection, it's a really good collection

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I love Namco, yay Namco, kiss kiss

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But, eh

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then, um, we were gonna play some Symphony of the Night and as it turned out that Dan hasn't authorized our Xbox yet

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I can't play it

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even though we have it on his account, I can't play it

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I was like, ugh, ugh, ugh

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, um, so then I started playing a lot of Blue Dragon

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And I love, love, love, love, love Blue Dragon

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I just got back to their village

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If anyone who's played the game knows where that is

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What part of the game I'm at

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now that game took a lot of shit for being kind of generic, for being kind of, like, not that impressive

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Some people have said for considering who all's behind it

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know what? They can bite me

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay then

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Because the thing that I like about it is that it has the classic RPG feel

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It has a good solid story

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And yeah, maybe it's not, ooh, innovative

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Maybe it doesn't have the stigma of being Final Fantasy

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But I bet if you slapped a Final Fantasy name on it and changed the characters, I bet you'd love it

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Seriously

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I mean, it has the charm of, uh

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've noticed this typically about games that Toriyama designs

225
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That they tend to have that charm that comes with his art style

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I loved that

227
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That was fantastic for me

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Uematsu's music, I mean, oh my god, Uematsu

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It made me happy

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
See, I get that, but I'm way more about Lost Odyssey than I was Blue Dragon

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't think Blue Dragon was as terrible as a lot of folks made it out to be

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But I just thought it was, eh, it's aight

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's aight

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Did you just say it's aight?

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Stop

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's classic, it's new and classic at the same time

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know what I mean?

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a new story, it's something to play through, but something that you can pick up that will automatically be familiar to you

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So for me, it's been filling my must-play Super Nintendo with a more comfortable controller

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Alright

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And of course I've been playing Sims 3

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I started another family because the game decided to fart on one of mine

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, technically what happened is that, um

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Someone turned off my computer while I was in the middle of a game

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And didn't save said game

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So it was either the Spouse or Windows Updates

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which I thought I had turned those off too

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, whatever

250
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And um, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, I've also been playing on Gaia

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I like the booty grab

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Uh, going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com for questions and comments

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ray Iyanami asked Dark Sakura, hold it

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Which game on RFA, which Raiden fighters, and was it on one credit?

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Um, actually no because like I said, my hand hurt a lot

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I played the first one

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Um

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, I was really just gonna sit down and see what it was like

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Cause I hadn't played the Aces ones

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I played through and

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, I was

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I really don't have the fine control that I used to

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because I've, you know, like I said

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My hand has been, um, sticking with a suture in it

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And my tendons are healing themselves

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I haven't really been able to play

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like I might have, you know

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A few years ago

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So, uh, no I didn't do it on one credit

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But hopefully in a couple months that'll be all better, right?

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, well when it's all better I'm gonna be going back to R-Type

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Loki, how about you and your gaming week?

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I played DDR, that was it

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's all I played is DDR

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Or, not DDR, what the hell am I talking about? I didn't play any DDR

279
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm a DDR freak, so you know

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Really? This is actually kind of noteworthy

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm like, you actually started exercising

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What is this?

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Eventually I will, but no

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm a green DDR freak, so

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto all the week

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
All week long, and we have

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Been recording our, like, multiplayer game

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Because Grand Theft Auto and DDR have so much in common

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay, it's a three letter acronym

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I was looking to say, and I was staring at DDR freak

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's why I made the slip, okay?

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, whatever

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
With all due respect to the many friends I made on there

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Including you guys

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Since when was DDR freak relevant again?

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not, I'm looking at

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm trying to, okay

298
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because I have my pads that I've built

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You remember when I built them? Hell, it was that long ago

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I've used them since

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, I haven't used them since then

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, I have them sitting in my garage

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I'm just seeing if it's going to be more

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Agentageous to actually

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Purchase some

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Already pre-done arcade style pads

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
For DDR

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or should I just fix it?

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because right now I have to ground

310
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The pads because the static electricity being built up

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
By the Lexan

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Arrows

313
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It causes the

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thing I have it attached to

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
To interpret the keys

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To short out

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because it just builds up static electricity

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then, like, shocks it

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Which is not good

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Because it'll stop working after about two minutes

321
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And then have to reboot the whole computer

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I need to figure out how to ground them

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And one time I read how to do that

325
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I can't remember now, so

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm just going to buy new ones

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because it's easier that way

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Frisbee in our chat room says

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Grand Theft Arrow

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, but Grand Theft Auto

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We've been playing quite a bit, of course

332
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have like

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Five hours of footage now

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Of us playing Grand Theft Auto

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Even a little bit of me playing

336
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Earth Defense Force

337
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because we decided to switch off to Earth Defense Force

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Because our other co-worker decided

339
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He wanted to go play Magic the Gathering with somebody

340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So we were like, ah, fuck that

341
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But yeah, Grand Theft Auto

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It'll be awesome, I just have to

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Edit it down now to

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Something funny

345
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And set the music

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Good, because the Orange Launch Radio channel needs more content

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's in HD, so it'll be awesome

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, because that new capture thing I have

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is awesome, it works so well

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So it'll make things a lot easier

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
For capturing video to put on the site

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Good, we need to do some mystery science

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Theatering to video games

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's what we need to do

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's actually some old school talk going on in the chat room right now

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What's it called?

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Block Box

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So we brought up Tetranet

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You remember Tetranet?

362
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I remember Tetranet, I used to play that stuff all the time

363
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Sorry to interrupt

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I'm getting an arcade cabinet

365
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Really?

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is it an actual game, or what is it?

367
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's an arcade cabinet

368
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Just the cabinet?

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For what?

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What do you plan to put on it?

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maim, DDR

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a candy cabinet

373
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you know what a candy cabinet is?

374
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I haven't the slightest idea what that is

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know those cabinets that line Arcade Infinity?

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The really small ones?

377
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, yeah, like the ones you sit down and play?

378
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, that's a candy cabinet

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, those are pretty cool

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's a deal going on

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's the Neo Geo forums

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I found it looking for something else

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because at one time

384
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I wanted to buy a DDR machine

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But then I had to scale down

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
my wishes

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because a DDR machine would cost me at least $2500

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Probably more than that

389
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And that's just not affordable

390
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So a candy cab

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm looking at a

392
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
new Astro City machine

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Which is a Sega made one

394
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And um

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's supposed to run somewhere around $450

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And they're basically doing a big bulk shipment

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And they have some extras available

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They're being shipped to San Francisco

400
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So um

401
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hopefully, I'm trying to get the guy to

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
send me a personal message again

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I can actually put down the deposit for it

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because they're supposed to be coming

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Between now and September, so

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That'd be awesome

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because then I'm gonna put a

408
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
To become like a

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Little, short, stubby

410
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
DDR machine

411
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you sure it's actually DDR and not Grand Theft Auto?

412
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It can be both

413
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Actually, we were thinking about

414
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Getting one of those for all of our Neo Geo

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, you should act on this

416
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, 400 bucks

417
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And they're shipping them already

418
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Actually, they're already on a boat

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They're already on a boat on the way here

420
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, they're on a motherfucking boat

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So they're already on their way over

422
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's just, um

423
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, he's trying to sell 30 of them

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Otherwise, he's gonna keep them

425
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And sell them for higher

426
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I should ask the spouse, just

427
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
He could pay for it out of pinball money

428
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We're having a hard time hearing you, DarkSakura

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Make sure that mic's really good

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Thank you, much better

431
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And then I'm having a milkshake

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And my stomach feels like it's gonna explode

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because I have lots of milkshake in me

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, there you go

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's see my gaming week

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Wednesday

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We all got a patch on Xbox Live, right?

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And everybody, you know, had to update

439
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
To this new patch that

440
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know, added all this new stuff in Netflix

441
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And blah, blah, blah

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Kind of changed some things with the achievements and so on

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I'm gonna download that and I'm messing with the achievements and stuff for a little bit

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Thought I'd look at Netflix

445
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I like the fact that you can add the movies

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
From the Netflix channel now

447
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can kind of browse through what new movies are out and things

448
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I thought that was pretty awesome

449
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then I turn it off and I'm off doing other things for a while

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then I'm bored

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So I put a tweet up on Twitter that says

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hi, I'm bored, who wants to play Rock Band?

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So a couple of the OLR listeners are like, me, me, me

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So they invite me into a game

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We're playing some Rock Band, da, da, da, da, da

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I have to step away for a little bit because I gotta do some other errands real quick

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I got other things I gotta do

458
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But then I go back after about 20 minutes

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Turn on the Xbox 360 again and then

460
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It starts doing all

461
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's actually the sound it makes

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It just starts throwing up everywhere

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Making all these, like, jaggeds on the screen

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And looks very ugly

465
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And it'll happen in the middle of a game

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It'll happen when I'm trying to boot up and so forth

467
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, of course, what do I instantly blame?

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The patch that went out on Wednesday

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm like, oh my god, my system got borked by the patch

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm becoming a statistic

471
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm like, this happened before, right?

472
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And we have a ton of people that got their Xboxes screwed up because of the patch

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, turns out

474
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There's a handful of people on Twitter

475
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Who claim that happened, but

476
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I made this whole YouTube and I posted it to the

477
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Orange Ons Radio channel and most people are telling me

478
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Just have lucky timing

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And your system's about to red ring

480
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, I can fucking tell that

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's obviously about to red ring

482
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's broken already

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I mean, it's not getting past a certain point, red ring or not

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So, congratulations me, my Xbox is broke

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And, once you know it

486
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm just outside the three year warranty thing

487
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That means I get to open it up

488
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm like three years and six months after it

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That means I get to open it up

490
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You wanna open it up?

491
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We'll see, we can fix it

492
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've had a few

493
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, goodie

494
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hey, 50% is better than zero percent

495
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Sounds like my trauma center record, look

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know, I'm kind of all about fixing it

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But at the same time, I'm like

498
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And there's a story later on about price cuts

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And I'm like, maybe I'll just wait and get the elite system

500
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Because I kinda want the new stuff

501
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But, hold on a minute

502
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why am I allowing myself to think this way?

503
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why do I even need to be worrying about repairs and so on in the first place?

504
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What the hell kind of system

505
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Fries itself after three years?

506
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Really?

507
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Video game systems

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Most of them have been pretty stable

509
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Most people have old school Nintendos that still work

510
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Granted, you have to blow on the cartridge and so on

511
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But, not bad for like 25 years old

512
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Eh?

513
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're preaching to the choir, okay?

514
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I have five systems that have died, okay?

515
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
My Dreamcast is 10 years old and still works

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We've been celebrating the Genesis

517
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
On Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight

518
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He was talking a lot about that

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That just celebrated his 20th anniversary

520
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Those still work

521
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That are older than most of our listeners ages combined

522
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the back room of my house

523
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That, guess what?

524
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Still work!

525
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Except for the Atari 7800, but it still has an hour supply

526
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, let's not talk about that

527
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's just stupid

528
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Like, and I just

529
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, it's just kind of funny

530
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The response I was getting was a lot of people was like, yep

531
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're Red Ringing 2

532
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I've been there

533
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And, you know, I couldn't help but think

534
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm so grateful that everybody's letting me know

535
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm not alone

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
On the other hand, I'm thinking

537
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What the hell kind of gaming society have we become

538
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That this is even borderline acceptable

539
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That we've just chalked this up to

540
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Eh, it happens

541
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah

542
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Those Xbox 360s

543
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Totally unreliable

544
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I guess I'll have to get another one

545
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm just thinking to myself

546
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Where did we go wrong?

547
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Where did we allow this to be acceptable?

548
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why is Microsoft doing as well as they are?

549
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
To bring in a more sociological aspect to it

550
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sorry, this is the way the world is

551
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Because your initial systems were broken

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I was sort of doing something

553
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Um

554
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's the fact that people would rather be complacent

555
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Than put any effort into changing a situation

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In general

557
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And so, enough people just let it go

558
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And they can get away with it

559
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But, you know, enough people complain about something

560
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And something might eventually happen

561
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You know

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If they think that they can get away with it this long

563
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They're just gonna keep getting away with it

564
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Until enough people hold them accountable

565
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's all there is to that

566
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, all I have to say is that

567
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It just sucks

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Like, the whole thing just sucks

569
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And Microsoft sucks

570
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And, you know, you suck for not making more of a stink about it

571
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Not you specifically

572
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But you as gamers in general

573
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And I suck for not realizing this before

574
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And everything sucks

575
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And the fact that I'm gonna have to buy a new 360

576
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Sucks too

577
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Or I guess I could get this one fixed

578
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm having offers for fixing

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And apparently Loki has an awesome 50% fixed record

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the other one was just unfixable

581
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I tried everything, okay

582
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It was just too far gone

583
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, who knows

584
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And actdeft is apologizing to me in chat

585
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But you don't need to apologize, it's not your fault

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Stop apologizing

587
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
People who apologize for things that aren't their fault

588
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Sucks

589
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well, that's actually the big thing

590
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That I think

591
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Is the problem with the industry

592
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
As it is now

593
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
With almost anything actually

594
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Is that

595
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Too many people are just

596
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
More willing to

597
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, I don't wanna conflict

598
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't wanna put the effort into it

599
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't wanna do this about it

600
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, well that's just how it is

601
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's how things are gonna be

602
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You know

603
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Everyone get off your asses

604
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And complain if you've got something wrong

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This is the thing

606
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Here's what I want, I'm gonna put a challenge

607
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Out there

608
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This would make me happy

609
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I will spend the $300 on a new elite

610
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or whatever I have to do when the price drop comes down

611
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I will do all this stuff

612
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And continue to just let Microsoft

613
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Rate me in the butt as they're doing right now

614
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I will continue to allow this

615
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If my challenge goes responded to

616
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
By the media and the gaming industry

617
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I know there's some of you insider folk that listen

618
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And don't wanna admit it

619
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I know there's some of you that work for gaming companies and so forth

620
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That listen and probably don't wanna admit it to your employer

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But look, this is the one thing I want

622
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That will make me happy

623
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Because in 3 or 4 years Microsoft is gonna come out

624
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And tout their new console

625
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Their Xbox 720

626
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Or whatever you wanna call it

627
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Or hell, there's talk that there might be a slim down

628
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
360

629
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is what I want

630
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is what I want every media outlet

631
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is what I want every gamer

632
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
To ask Microsoft

633
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
About their new system

634
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Will it last more than 3 years?

635
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah

636
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Does this system red ring

637
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Those are the questions I want Microsoft

638
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
To be asked to their face

639
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And have to answer

640
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Why should I trust you

641
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That your system is not another pile of poop

642
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I do it

643
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay, so this hasn't been done yet

644
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think that what we should do also

645
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is, and this is actually something

646
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
As a community

647
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Have you ever heard of a site called

648
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Starbucked.com?

649
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
No, but does this have to do with Battlestar Galactica?

650
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
No, it's about a person who had

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Such a horrible customer service experience

652
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
With Starbucks

653
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That he created a consumer advocacy site

654
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So that people could voice their concerns regarding

655
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Problems they've had with Starbucks

656
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And his problem is actually something

657
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That could have been fixed

658
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If one person had gotten off their ass and helped him properly

659
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So, um

660
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I think that I should make a site

661
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And don't nobody make it for me

662
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Unless you want to make me an admin of it

663
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is a red ringed, you know

664
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh, there's got to be a site like that already

665
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I looked, there wasn't

666
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Really?

667
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You know, to make a big, you know

668
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Hi, this is a picture of our red ringed system

669
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is what was done about it

670
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And keep a running tally

671
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of all of these

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And start, you know, sending

673
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Up and go, hey look

674
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Here's where you guys have screwed up

675
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Here's our tally this week, here's our tally this week

676
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Here, just search Twitter, seriously

677
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Search Twitter, R-R-O-D, watch

678
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I even, I was at work

679
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
On Friday and I mentioned, we had some

680
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Down time because our systems were down

681
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And I mentioned, oh yeah, my Xbox

682
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And people I never suspected even played

683
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Video games, like outside of like

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Madden and stuff were saying, oh you got the

685
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Red rings, huh? Yeah, I got that too

686
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And like everybody in class was piping up

687
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, the red rings, oh I know the red rings

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Well you know what, then why not, let's

689
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Let's, um, if I pulled up

690
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Everything on Twitter that had

691
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Red ring of death, printed it out

692
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
In black and white because I don't want to save my color cartridges

693
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And emailed the stack

694
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Not emailed, but mailed the stack

695
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Of papers to

696
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Microsoft and go, look

697
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't think they do anything

698
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Because people are still buying 360's

699
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But what's it do? So it doesn't boot up now?

700
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or is it just not play your games?

701
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It does a blalalala thing after

702
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's been on like two minutes

703
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Sometimes during the boot, sometimes while I'm in the middle of the game

704
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Doesn't matter

705
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
To be honest, I haven't really tried it since that one night

706
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So

707
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's where I'm at

708
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
To be perfectly honest though

709
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, I think we're on

710
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What, our third

711
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
360, but keep in mind

712
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We have an advantage

713
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just want the history of gaming to put

714
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
A black mark on, excuse me

715
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
A red mark on Xbox

716
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
A red ring around the Xbox

717
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
A red ring on the Xbox 360

718
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
For this travesty

719
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And the fact that they're covering it up very well

720
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, has there been any console

721
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In history

722
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That has the hardware issues that the 360 has?

723
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The reason why

724
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They, I think are being able

725
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
To keep their head afloat regarding everything

726
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Is the fact that they've been so quick to replace

727
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Systems too

728
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like, I know, honestly Rob

729
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think you should still give a call, give a try

730
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know, say hey

731
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I bought this, you know, before

732
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
All this was going on

733
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You guys owe me

734
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know, see what happens

735
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You know, if they want to keep your business as a customer

736
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
They're gonna bend over backwards

737
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Bobby says the PS2, Bobby actually says a lot in chat

738
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let me read some of the comments from chat

739
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Bobby says they know

740
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Sorry, Microsoft knows

741
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They know, they won't admit it, but they know

742
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And

743
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, he says his original

744
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Xbox still works, so does mine

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Mine does too

746
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And he goes on to say the difference between the PS2 and the 360

747
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Is that there were no blogs when the PS2s

748
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Were failing in mass, and you know, that's

749
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Certainly a legitimate viewpoint

750
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't know, see here's the thing though

751
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know anyone that had a PS2 that failed

752
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Outside of people I've met on the internet

753
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Like, when I was gaming

754
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I didn't know anybody that had a failed PS2

755
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Mine didn't fail, I know like 50 people that have

756
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
360s fail

757
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
My Japanese PS2, guess what?

758
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It still works!

759
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, my Japanese PS2 still works too

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I mean, first release model

761
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We got ours way back when

762
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We had this like

763
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Cause I wanted Tekken that bad

764
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So we got our

765
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We have a Japanese PS3

766
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There was I think a PS2, sorry

767
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If I'm right, it was a demo system

768
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Back from when Game Masters

769
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Was still open

770
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And that was years ago

771
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I'm on my fifth PS2 and you met me in person

772
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I guess that's true

773
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But you know what I mean, like, you know

774
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
My Japanese PS2 still works perfectly

775
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And those are the ones that were

776
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Definitely having problems back in the day

777
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
My PS2 that I have now

778
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Works perfectly

779
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm just annoyed

780
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What else did we get in chat?

781
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I do have a stack of PS1s by the way

782
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to get onto other stuff in my gaming week

783
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Cause I did more than just bitch about my

784
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Bork to Xbox 360, but let's see, what else was there

785
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I think I posted a chat from Wiki

786
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
In response to the November 2006 update

787
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Error that bricked his console

788
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
A California man filed a class action lawsuit against

789
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Microsoft in Washington federal court in early December

790
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
2006, the lawsuit seeks

791
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
5 million in damages and the free repair of any

792
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Console rendered unusable by the update

793
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This will be the second such lawsuit filed against

794
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Microsoft, the first having been filed in 2005

795
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Shortly after the... etc

796
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Unfortunately not enough

797
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
People had their consoles borked by this update

798
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And people are, you know, telling me up and down

799
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That it wasn't the update

800
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
All I know is that, you know

801
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It sure is convenient timing for this to happen

802
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Have you tried bringing it without the hard drive?

803
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I haven't, should I try that?

804
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yes

805
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Ok, I'll try that, see what happens

806
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Because it could be something corrupted on the hard drive

807
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Do you have Rock Band 2 installed to your hard drive?

808
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I do, but the thing will crap out before

809
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Even playing Rock Band 2

810
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But you have it installed to your hard drive

811
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Cause it just reads your disc for a second

812
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And then it runs it off the hard drive

813
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Ok, I'll try that

814
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That would certainly be better, but we'll see

815
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Alright, anyhow

816
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Other stuff I played my gaming week

817
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Cause I have much more in my gaming week than just

818
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Abort 360 that I still, by the way

819
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
My resolution right now is I'm not doing anything

820
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Till this rumored price drop will get to later in the show

821
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Maybe I'll get it repaired

822
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know, right now I'm leaning

823
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Right now I'm leaning towards just getting a new

824
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
360

825
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Get a new one and make sure it's a new elite, not an older elite

826
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That people have been sitting on forever

827
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or, yeah, that's what I'll try and do

828
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But anyhow

829
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What I wanted to get into elsewhere in my gaming week

830
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because this is something that deserves

831
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Positive talk and not negative talk

832
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Is Ion Online I played a little more of

833
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They had their next closed beta

834
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I guess the final one, it's the second closed beta

835
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I've participated in

836
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I got to play the game a lot more than

837
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Two weeks ago, the first time I played the beta for Ion Online

838
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I still feel like I've only really

839
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Scratched the surface of the game

840
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I was having a lot of problems with

841
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Graphics stuff

842
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The game doesn't work too hot with

843
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Vista, but I found if I ran in full screen windowed mode

844
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I was able to get a much better frame rate

845
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So, you know, just you have to really

846
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Tinker with those settings and at least they've made it very

847
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Customizable in the graphics and so on

848
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The game is a very good looking game

849
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a very smooth game

850
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's kind of fun, it's wow-ish

851
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It definitely, you can feel the

852
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Wow inspiration there, but one thing I liked

853
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That WoW doesn't have is the

854
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Whole chained combat

855
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Meaning that there are moves that you can do

856
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That only open up after you do

857
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
A first move, like maybe you do a

858
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Special little thing with your mace, then you can make

859
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
A lightning bolt fall down or whatever

860
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's branching combos

861
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Ragnarok Online has that

862
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, Monk class, you have your combos

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Well that's every class in this game has something like that

864
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But I mean, I'm saying that Ragnarok Online certainly

865
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Thought of, you know, implementing stuff like that

866
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well sure, I'm sure a lot of what

867
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Can be thought of has been thought of in MMOs

868
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Who knows, there could be more though

869
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I only got my character to level 8

870
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Which is like scratching the surface of the game

871
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I didn't even get into any PVP or instances or what have you

872
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So can I fairly review this game?

873
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No, but off the closed beta

874
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Can I say I'm interested?

875
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The game was fun enough

876
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Where I would feel like I could buy the game

877
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I won't be getting ripped off

878
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes, I think it's worth checking out

879
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So that's what I plan to do in September

880
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And then hopefully I'll be able to spend some more time with it

881
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And tell you my final thoughts on it

882
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So there you go

883
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I've been playing a priest

884
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So, there it is

885
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I wanna play

886
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Anyhow

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Hold on, I'm reading comments from chat here

888
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
About, yes

889
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
To publicly acknowledge it

890
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because it keeps going back and forth in chat

891
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I am aware that CC Gaming

892
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Repairs 360s

893
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And would also take the 360 for scrap

894
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I just haven't decided what I want to do yet

895
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You know, because I'd have to ship it

896
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Which is gonna be money, but

897
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You know, I don't know

898
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I want some time to think and try these

899
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Other solutions too before I just

900
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Commit to one particular solution

901
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Certainly that's something I'm heavily considering

902
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But we'll see

903
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Alright

904
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's it for our gaming weeks

905
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Let's get into

906
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What's this present? Ooh, present

907
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Some of my more obscure Bimani stuff

908
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You burned me a DVD mini

909
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah, I remember you used to use CD

910
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Minis all the time, now it's DVD Minis

911
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well that's because it was, they were

912
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Cheap by the spindle and

913
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You know, the pre-shift fit on them

914
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Perfectly, all my stuff was just fine

915
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But the next one I'm gonna burn you is an actual DVD

916
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Alright, uh

917
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight

918
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Of which we don't have a lot, but we will continue to plug our

919
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Twitter at OLR and then of course we're on

920
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Facebook as the OLR me

921
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We have a MySpace supposedly too

922
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Is anyone on MySpace anymore? No, we had some friend requests

923
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
There the other day, so I guess we do

924
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And yeah, LiveJournal

925
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Orange launch MySpace is so 2005

926
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It really is, okay

927
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's get into some gaming news then and we'll

928
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Start with Loki

929
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yes, there is a couple of rumors

930
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Regarding some Wii software

931
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
One of which is of course

932
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Wii Fit, there is a rumored price point

933
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
For it, which of course

934
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Not too surprising, they have the

935
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Bundle at the

936
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
$99.99 price point

937
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Which is, you know

938
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Or I should say $99.99 price point

939
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I think that's a little higher, that's kinda weird

940
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But anyways, it's pretty close to what the

941
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Normal Wii Fit bundle is

942
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Then of course the rumor is the standalone

943
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Game is gonna be $29.99 as well

944
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
No word exactly on

945
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
When those are gonna be officially announced

946
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But I don't know

947
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That sounds about right to me

948
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You know, $29.99 for a game that's

949
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Not too different than the original

950
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Sounds fair, I guess

951
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Maybe

952
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The other weird thing though

953
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That they have

954
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And this is also coming from

955
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
A marketing survey, apparently

956
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
They have a slide

957
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That shows

958
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What appears to be some

959
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Sort of new peripheral that's gonna be

960
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
With a game that's

961
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Like a bicycling game and the peripheral

962
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Itself actually looks like one of those

963
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh

964
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Gosh

965
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I forget the kind of bike

966
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The exercise bike?

967
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Stationary?

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Recumbent bike

969
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think, something like that

970
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's really interesting because

971
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It almost looks like a Wii Fit type of

972
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Game

973
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can definitely see Miis in the pictures

974
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And stuff like that, but I don't think it's

975
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Necessarily something from

976
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Nintendo themselves

977
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because

978
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Some of the other characters don't necessarily look like

979
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Miis, but they have different things like

980
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Road races, you can walk

981
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Your dog in the game, you can do

982
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Almost like a prop copter type thing

983
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You can

984
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Rotate one of the things

985
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Spin a rotisserie barbecue

986
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Downhill

987
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Racing, you name it

988
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And of course the usual

989
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Calorie tracking and that kind of

990
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Stuff, but I mean it looks kind of cool

991
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And definitely something I could see on

992
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The Wii, so

993
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No word on what that is, I'm guessing it's probably a third

994
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Party putting that out, probably someone like Ubisoft

995
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Or EA or something

996
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Well it wouldn't surprise me too if one of these

997
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Bicycling things got picked up because it seems

998
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Like at E3, remember when there was a

999
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Kenshi Hall and everything? We would see something

1000
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Like this demoed, like a

1001
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Bicycling exercise game

1002
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
There's some companies exploring this, have been

1003
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
For a long time

1004
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it even was Nintendo doing it or something

1005
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Just maybe that one screenshot

1006
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Is kind of misleading because the one character

1007
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Doesn't look like a Mii, but

1008
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Everything doesn't have to look like a Mii in the games

1009
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But who knows

1010
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The other thing is, it sort of looks like an island

1011
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Setting, and I know that they've talked about

1012
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Putting the other games on that stupid island

1013
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That they created for Wii Fit

1014
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
In Wii Sports Resort

1015
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Wii Fit's on an island?

1016
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Well they have like, the jogging

1017
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Is on an island

1018
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So I don't know if it's the same island

1019
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But it's very similar

1020
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Skinny Island, what would the name of that island be?

1021
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's WooHoo Island or something

1022
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WooHoo Island? I think that's what they called it

1023
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WooHoo, I'm not fat anymore, yay

1024
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Or Sex Island, as Sims would call it

1025
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
WooHoo Island

1026
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
WooHoo! Whoopee

1027
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't know

1028
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's neat

1029
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I would be more excited about the pedal thing than I would be

1030
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The Wii Fit balance board, because at least the pedal thing

1031
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You know, it seems like exercise

1032
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Whereas the balance board, you're just kind of

1033
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Standing there, leaning back and forth

1034
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You know, back and forth

1035
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't know

1036
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Again, our good friend Bobby is just piping up with all sorts of trivia tonight

1037
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Saying Miyamoto wants that to become

1038
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
One of the new characters that is indeed

1039
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WooHoo Island

1040
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Is the name of where all this takes place

1041
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well I don't want to see any other games with the island

1042
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You know, running around doing stuff

1043
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You know, Mario at WooHoo Island

1044
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You know, killing Koopas

1045
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh wait for it, it'll happen

1046
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There's a new Smash Brothers game with WooHoo Island

1047
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
As a playable character

1048
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That'll be a stage, it'll be a stage

1049
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
No, it'll be a character

1050
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The island will be a character

1051
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He said it himself, the island's a character

1052
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Spoiler right there

1053
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean, how do you face off against a whole island?

1054
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You can't

1055
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
X-Men did it

1056
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Giants has X-Men number one

1057
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Uh huh

1058
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh my gosh

1059
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Told you I'm a geek

1060
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Um, so uh

1061
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't know, what do you guys think of this?

1062
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Is this bicycle peripheral something that would interest you guys?

1063
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Or no?

1064
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It'd be interesting to see it, but

1065
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Once again, I'd probably use it about as much as I do Wii Fit

1066
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Wii Fit though, it fills the space

1067
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Underneath my TV stand

1068
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's it

1069
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You should lend it to me

1070
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's all about price to me

1071
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I actually use Wii Fit once in a while

1072
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I haven't lately, I've been slacking off

1073
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And I need to stop doing that

1074
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's summer, it's too hot in the summer

1075
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The price would be $89.99

1076
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Including the peripheral, it's about the price of a Wii Fit

1077
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
For the bike and the game?

1078
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's not terrible

1079
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If the game was fun and the bike thing actually worked

1080
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Cause she's actually sitting on the couch

1081
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Or something, right?

1082
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And the bike is kinda there

1083
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
If that is actually sturdy

1084
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Then that might be cool

1085
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't know though

1086
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We'll have to see

1087
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I like exercise bikes and stuff

1088
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You know what, I can go to my gym

1089
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And play my Gameboy on a bike

1090
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But that's also how much a month?

1091
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I don't pay a whole lot for my gym

1092
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm out of contract

1093
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I see

1094
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Alright, moving on to some other news

1095
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Talking about something on the DS

1096
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
As opposed to the Nintendo Wii

1097
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Dragon Quest IX of course

1098
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Was a huge game over in Japan when it came out

1099
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
As all Dragon Quest games are

1100
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And so of course the question is

1101
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
When is it going to come out over here?

1102
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well apparently there was a Q&A session

1103
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This week with investors

1104
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And the president of Squeenix

1105
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yoishi Wada said that they are

1106
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Considering releasing Dragon Quest IX

1107
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Overseas

1108
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And still deciding which regions are actually

1109
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Going to get it

1110
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And they don't plan to release it until after April

1111
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Of 2010

1112
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They're assholes is basically what it is

1113
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm serious, it's just like

1114
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Eh, why do we feel like it?

1115
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You'll be lucky and be pleased when you get it

1116
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's just like

1117
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You know, they see the fans of the series

1118
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Over here just as like

1119
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Beggars on the street that they

1120
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
May casually throw down their

1121
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Money so that they can bask in the glory

1122
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Of Dragon Quest

1123
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They can go fuck themselves because I don't give a shit

1124
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
About their fucking game

1125
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Dragon Quest is a horrible series in my opinion

1126
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, now come on, now you're just being petty

1127
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Because Dragon Quest VIII was awesome

1128
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No it wasn't

1129
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And Dragon Quest VIII

1130
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Sold about half a million copies here in North America

1131
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That isn't any

1132
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Small number, I mean is it a blockbuster?

1133
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No

1134
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Is it pretty decent? Yeah

1135
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So why not?

1136
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And look, I'm going to say something that I know is going to piss

1137
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Some people off but I kind of don't care because I'm just

1138
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Keeping it real, okay

1139
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is the case when I support piracy

1140
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Honestly

1141
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
When these foreign companies are too stubborn

1142
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
To release the games over here

1143
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I say you know what

1144
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Then if you can understand Japanese

1145
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Copy the Japanese one and get it

1146
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Why do you have to worry about that? Because they have people that will

1147
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Translate it and then they'll add a patch

1148
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
To the ROM and boom it's in English

1149
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I know I'm going to take some flack for that comment

1150
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But I kind of don't care because I was doing that with

1151
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DDR years ago when they

1152
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Refused to release that over here and you know

1153
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
When they finally released it over here I bought

1154
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Every single one even when they were crap

1155
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
For quite a while

1156
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And Konami thanks you for that by releasing even

1157
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Crappier games

1158
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The lesson we learned there that doesn't matter

1159
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But I just

1160
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This kind of news that like they just

1161
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm all about like

1162
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I understand resources and that there's

1163
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Other games they want to do

1164
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And maybe they want to do some things that are outside the box

1165
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And so forth but I don't know

1166
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This thing kind of just reeks of

1167
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And we just don't feel

1168
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Like it right now

1169
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Type thing

1170
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And some folks in chat GameGuru says

1171
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Mother 3 in Act F speaks up

1172
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
With the Mother 3 fan translation

1173
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah

1174
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm all for that too

1175
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You know

1176
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm just

1177
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I don't understand why they just won't

1178
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I can't imagine it takes that

1179
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Long to translate a game especially when

1180
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You have fans that translate it

1181
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For you

1182
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I mean that's got to be the ultimate kick in the pants

1183
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
When you have these fan companies

1184
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Beating you to it

1185
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
People that are paid 40 hours

1186
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
A week to do this

1187
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't know

1188
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Keep in mind though that when

1189
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
They do it themselves

1190
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Not only do they have to pay

1191
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Translator, they have to

1192
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Pay writer

1193
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
They have to take the time to change

1194
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Anything in game

1195
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Graphically that has

1196
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They need to

1197
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Translate from one language to another

1198
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
They have to pay

1199
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Someone to localize it

1200
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
To make the jokes come across

1201
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I played through a

1202
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Fan done copy of Final Fantasy 5

1203
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And there were just a few things in there

1204
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That I got because I had

1205
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Studied some Japanese for a while

1206
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That I don't know that other people

1207
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Might have gotten because the joke

1208
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Is

1209
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It was actually a pun

1210
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So

1211
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There are things that are lost in translation

1212
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That you do have to

1213
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Go through

1214
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Reorganizing for the cultural element

1215
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
To make it something that would be

1216
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Understood by your audience

1217
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So there is actually a good deal of cost

1218
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That comes in with

1219
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The translation process

1220
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
When you are paying for it

1221
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
For the fans

1222
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
For them, it's a labor of love

1223
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's something that they enjoy doing

1224
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But when the company brings it out, they have to pay

1225
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Somebody to do this

1226
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And even if someone says, oh I'll do it for free

1227
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm sorry that doesn't work, you still have to pay them

1228
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Because there are labor laws

1229
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And then there is marketing

1230
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
There is

1231
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Production cost

1232
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
In the actual physical copies of the game

1233
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
There's

1234
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You know, shipment

1235
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You have to deal with a lot of the money

1236
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That they would make back on Dragon Quest 9?

1237
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But when they also

1238
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And again, I'm doing this straight from a business

1239
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Perspective, they have to look at previous sales

1240
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And look at what their overhead was

1241
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Versus how much they actually made

1242
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The last few games that they have localized over here

1243
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
At least on the 360 and stuff, haven't done that great

1244
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I mean, Star Ocean, Last Hope wasn't all that great

1245
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The Last Remnant

1246
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Was not that great at all

1247
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The game itself wasn't that great

1248
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And then the one before that, which I don't remember

1249
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The name off the top of my head

1250
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But that didn't do that well either

1251
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's just, I don't know

1252
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Was that Infinite on Discovery?

1253
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes, Infinite on Discovery

1254
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But there's just a lot of weird stuff that they're doing

1255
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Like, Chrono Trigger did alright

1256
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Shit, dude, it's just a ROM

1257
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That they're basically running off an emulator

1258
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I mean, that's basically all they did

1259
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You can't tell me that they programmed the engine

1260
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
From scratch and rebuilt the game

1261
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm sorry, I don't buy that at all

1262
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And I could totally see them going the route of like

1263
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You know, the Final Fantasy 4 after years stuff

1264
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Where they just take the ROM and kind of edit it

1265
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And add some new stuff to it

1266
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And boom, new game, let's resell it

1267
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And even the stuff that they've done online

1268
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Like Final Fantasy 4 and whatnot

1269
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I mean, My Life as a King is kind of eh

1270
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
When they had download content

1271
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That probably should have been included in the game to begin with

1272
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And My Life as a Dark Lord was kind of eh

1273
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It was alright, I guess

1274
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And their tactical

1275
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't remember the other Final Fantasy tactical game

1276
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That they had

1277
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The Tower Defense one

1278
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Is kind of just

1279
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This is alright, but they haven't really been having

1280
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That many good hits lately

1281
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And other than Final Fantasy 4 and 3 and stuff like that

1282
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
On DS

1283
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
When they actually remade them

1284
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And that was kind of cool

1285
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because there's effort put into it

1286
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And it's Final Fantasy

1287
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But I don't know, maybe they're just worried

1288
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That it's not going to do as well

1289
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And why pay the money to have it, you know, translated

1290
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But it's a major release for them

1291
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't see why they wouldn't do it

1292
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
They're probably going to do it

1293
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And it'll just take some time

1294
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because, you know, as history has shown

1295
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Square is really slow

1296
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
When it comes to finishing their games

1297
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm looking at some comments in chat

1298
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Gripper01

1299
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Says

1300
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Plus with fan translations they are not censored

1301
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Like the early Final Fantasy translations

1302
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Hmm

1303
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Apparently

1304
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
GameGuru is saying

1305
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Atlas even offered to publish Mother 3 for Nintendo

1306
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And Nintendo of Japan denied it

1307
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And I guess this whole back and forth

1308
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Is that because of all the parity

1309
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
In the games

1310
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Nintendo of America is afraid of getting sued

1311
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So they want to make some changes

1312
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And Nintendo of Japan won't let them

1313
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's just weird, that whole mess

1314
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So why don't they release it in, well

1315
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Do they, have they released it like on

1316
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Virtual console or something like that?

1317
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Mother 3 is a DS game, so no

1318
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's a Game Boy Advance game

1319
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But they could still do it

1320
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't know, I mean it's basically Super Nintendo

1321
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I don't, they

1322
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
In theory I think it could be done

1323
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Actually I need to find the translated ROM

1324
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Because I am going to play the translated ROM

1325
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
People

1326
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm saying this now

1327
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Because I don't care

1328
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But yeah, actually something that brings the other thing

1329
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Going back to what I was saying

1330
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is you also have to deal with distribution

1331
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And with dealing with the companies

1332
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
That you're going to be releasing the game through

1333
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Money, it all comes down to money

1334
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I guess

1335
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Alright, well let's move on

1336
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
With some more news while I steam over

1337
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Not having Dragon Quest 9, I guess

1338
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's not that bad, because this is a DS game

1339
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And I don't have the attention span for DS games

1340
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So whatever

1341
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Well, how about something else that you'd have

1342
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
To have a bit of an attention span if you plan on

1343
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Finishing it at all

1344
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Mega Man 9

1345
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
There's new download content, and guess what it does

1346
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It makes the game harder

1347
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Why?

1348
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You have Super Hero Mode

1349
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Which costs a dollar

1350
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
A whole dollar

1351
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
A whole dollar, it's 80 Microsoft points

1352
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And

1353
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It basically

1354
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Just keeps, it increases the number of

1355
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Enemies that you're going to see on screen

1356
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
At any given time in the game

1357
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So yeah, it's for all you

1358
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
People who want the next big challenge

1359
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's basically for people who like asshole Mario

1360
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Or who have like those

1361
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Leftover points that you just can't seem

1362
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
To get rid of, because everything is

1363
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Everything is in multiples

1364
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of 100, except rock band songs

1365
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
See, that would be kind of cool

1366
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
If they did that for like Super Mario Brothers

1367
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Like re-release Mario Brothers

1368
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
With a level editor or something like that

1369
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then have it where you could share levels online

1370
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Of course that would be innovative and use online

1371
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So Nintendo would never buy that

1372
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
A perfect example of something you could do

1373
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Simple, you don't have to actually program

1374
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Really a whole ton to it

1375
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Release it

1376
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
People would love it

1377
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And you'd get a lot of money back

1378
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You'd put a lot of effort in

1379
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because Nintendo certainly doesn't do that

1380
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, but then they'd get sued for copying

1381
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Little Big Planet

1382
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, I'm in the camp that's like

1383
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Isn't Mega Man 9 hard enough?

1384
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I guess there's definitely the hardcore fans

1385
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I haven't played it yet, I bought it a long time ago

1386
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But I still haven't played it

1387
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I only was able to beat like 3 or 4 of the robots

1388
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Before I was like, okay I'm spent

1389
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm done

1390
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You know what I'd like to see?

1391
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'd actually like to see a new

1392
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
That would make me happy

1393
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
How about some Mega Man 9 easy mode content?

1394
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'd pay a dollar for that

1395
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Actually I had an idea of something that I would like to see

1396
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And that's called like

1397
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Like Uber Man

1398
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Where it's Mega Man and you have to fight through

1399
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
All of the 1 through 9 robots

1400
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And then do the Uber Wily stage

1401
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I think that's every Mega Man fan's dream game

1402
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Just Mega Man orgy

1403
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Where it's like all 81 master robots

1404
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Or however many they've had over the series

1405
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Not even counting X

1406
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'm not even going to throw the X series into it

1407
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because that could be like the sequel when this game does well

1408
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But Mega Man orgy would just be a game

1409
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Where it's like all 81 robots

1410
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Going at it at once

1411
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And then do it Metroid style

1412
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Which is a very interesting orgy

1413
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Considering one of those robots is a woman

1414
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And the other 80 are men

1415
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Just do it all Metroid style

1416
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And make the dungeons like Mega Man Legends

1417
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Tie that in there

1418
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Oh that would be hot

1419
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But it has to remain 2D

1420
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It has to remain 2D

1421
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I was thinking of a game that just had all 81 stages in it

1422
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And playable at once

1423
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But I like your idea of a

1424
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Metroidvania style Mega Man game

1425
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
With all the robots

1426
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That's pretty cool

1427
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And if you totally used the escape velocity thing

1428
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Then you would be able to

1429
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Go back to your last save point

1430
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You know, location

1431
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Do weird warps like that

1432
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And then Samus would come out and kick Mega Man's ass

1433
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So you totally took my game

1434
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But that actually is

1435
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Ok we're putting that under Dream Games

1436
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And 4 player co-op because that would be awesome

1437
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Just for fun

1438
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's under Dream Games now for Orange Knowledge Radio

1439
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's an official Dream Game

1440
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
What Mega Man orgy?

1441
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah Mega Man orgy

1442
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I like what ActDeft calls it in chat

1443
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Mega 10 RGY

1444
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So the 0 is an o in orgy

1445
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I like that

1446
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Ok

1447
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You are now marketing director of this game

1448
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Congratulations on your promotion

1449
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You now get a non-existent job

1450
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So add that to the wiki

1451
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That's going on the list

1452
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And at the end

1453
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
There's a big butt

1454
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What?

1455
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Are you high?

1456
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's an easter egg

1457
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
You know like when you can hold the buttons down

1458
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And the stars turn into chickens

1459
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Why would you just put a big butt

1460
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
At the end of the game?

1461
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Are you like high?

1462
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Because it's on our list

1463
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Are you 5 years old?

1464
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Way to take a perfectly awesome game

1465
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And just literally shit on it

1466
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because it's on our list

1467
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It would have a caption

1468
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Kiss our ass Capcom

1469
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
No you don't do that

1470
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's wrong

1471
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Oh come on you should look at our other games on our list

1472
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Exactly

1473
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
This is why it doesn't need to be on the list

1474
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Because that list is just ridiculous stuff

1475
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This is ridiculous it's never gonna happen

1476
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Well it's just because it's never gonna happen

1477
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's just I don't have

1478
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm sure there's people out there that have done custom Mega Man games

1479
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And it wouldn't be that difficult

1480
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
The chat room would like to point out that what you're describing

1481
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Could be Guts Man's ass

1482
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It could be

1483
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Easter egg in the game you know

1484
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Guts Man with a certain number of life left

1485
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And you get a butt

1486
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
What is wrong with you?

1487
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
What is wrong with me for finding this funny?

1488
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
How old am I? Like five?

1489
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Seriously?

1490
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It doesn't matter it's all for fun

1491
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Fun does not require an age

1492
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Alright but fun requires a new story real quick

1493
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Here before this story or before this show

1494
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Literally goes down the crapper

1495
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Speaking of your butt

1496
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Nintendo has patented a brand new

1497
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Inflatable cushion that you would use

1498
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
For a horseback riding game

1499
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Why?

1500
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Just that's the most retarded thing

1501
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I have ever heard

1502
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It looks absolutely awful

1503
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It basically their picture that they have

1504
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
First off looks like this like grown man

1505
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Dressed up like a little kid

1506
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Which is creepy enough if you ask me

1507
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And then the actual cushion itself

1508
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Is literally just like an inner tube

1509
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That they have strapped the Wii remote to

1510
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And you rock back and forth

1511
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I think that's supposed to be a kid

1512
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I understand it's supposed to be a kid

1513
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
But it looks like a man child

1514
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So what is this for?

1515
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
For a finally arcade perfect port

1516
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Of Final Furlong or what is this?

1517
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's for I don't know

1518
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Sitting on your butt

1519
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's for those racing games that they have

1520
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Where you sit on the Wii balance board

1521
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But if you have hemorrhoids you can't do it

1522
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So then you can sit on the cushion

1523
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Is this where your butt gets a little tickle

1524
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If you do well on the game?

1525
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
This is stupid I mean seriously

1526
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You know what this reminds me of?

1527
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Do you remember that episode of South Park

1528
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
With the bicycle that was powered

1529
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like it was something like when everything

1530
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Was going green or whatever

1531
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And they would sit down on the thing

1532
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That was just basically a giant dildo

1533
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And then they had to blow on this thing

1534
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
To make it go that looked like they were

1535
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Sucking cock

1536
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That's what this Wii inflatable cushion

1537
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Reminds me of like I'm gonna have that

1538
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In my living room

1539
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Let me describe how this works first off

1540
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Thank you wild wacky action bike

1541
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Thank you

1542
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
As if it wasn't completely obvious

1543
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's an inflatable air cushion

1544
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Or other type of seat

1545
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
With pockets for the Wii remote

1546
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It's for simulating horseback riding

1547
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Or riding of other animals real or imagined

1548
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Or even vehicles

1549
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
For example

1550
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
You can indicate the gait of a horse

1551
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
By gently

1552
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
By gently moving forward and backward

1553
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
On the cushion

1554
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
To go slow

1555
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Or fast forward and backward

1556
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Rocking motions to gallop

1557
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So basically this game

1558
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Will adjust your speed based on

1559
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
How fast you hump the cushion

1560
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Awesome

1561
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That seems completely useless

1562
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And not only that

1563
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But I mean really is this practical

1564
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I mean seriously

1565
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
We had a problem with the Wii balance board

1566
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Only holding 300 pounds

1567
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
People got pissed off

1568
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Because I'm a fatty

1569
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And I want to do Wii Fit

1570
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But I can't play it

1571
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
What about riding the horse

1572
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I pop the cushion

1573
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You don't even have to be fat

1574
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
To pop the cushion

1575
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Or let's say you're getting too into this game

1576
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And you're rocking back and forth

1577
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Or even you have special piercings

1578
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I can just see

1579
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This is the whole rocking back and forth

1580
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The whole thing deflates

1581
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
While you're playing it

1582
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Like how sad

1583
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Is this for real

1584
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's for real

1585
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Is this Nintendo making the patent

1586
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Or whatever this is

1587
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You know what this thing kind of looks like to me

1588
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You know those

1589
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Okay

1590
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You know at the gym they have the inflatable

1591
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Balls and they have the ones that are half

1592
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Size

1593
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Which makes me think of those with another rocking

1594
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You know thing put on it

1595
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This one also looks really um

1596
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It looks like a wacky action bike

1597
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's not necessary

1598
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I mean seriously how many games

1599
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Are you going to play where you're riding

1600
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
A horse

1601
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's absolutely not necessary

1602
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And why the hell would they patent this

1603
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Well keep in mind though

1604
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's a good idea to

1605
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
They could patent something and not actually bring it out

1606
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But it keeps someone else from doing it

1607
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
GameGuru in chat says we find out

1608
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Why it's called WooHoo Island

1609
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Great

1610
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So we're going to get WooHoo biking and WooHoo horse riding

1611
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
With this thing

1612
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's just strange

1613
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I mean why can't you

1614
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Although if this is legit

1615
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
If this is a real thing that Nintendo is planning

1616
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You know you can't wait for that

1617
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Press conference when Reggie Fils-Aime

1618
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Comes out of one of these

1619
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Like

1620
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's next year's E3 press conference

1621
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
When you're just like oh my god Nintendo is seriously

1622
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Just fucking lost it this time

1623
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Like just the last two years of press conferences

1624
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Were bad but now when Reggie Fils-Aime

1625
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Comes rolling out on one of these things

1626
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You're just going to be like oh my god

1627
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
This is just difficult to watch

1628
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I would love to go there and just walk out

1629
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Walk out right at that

1630
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Well that's it I'm done

1631
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm done

1632
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I give up

1633
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
This is absolutely stupid

1634
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Can somebody please do that at E3

1635
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Somebody who's special enough to get

1636
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Invited in Nintendo's conference

1637
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Somebody who doesn't mind

1638
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Getting blacklisted a little bit

1639
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's it I'm done

1640
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This is so stupid I'm out of here

1641
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
See ya

1642
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I am done D-U-N

1643
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Done

1644
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And get up and walk out

1645
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
There is no practical use for this whatsoever

1646
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's a giant device that holds a remote

1647
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That shakes it back and forth

1648
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
How difficult would it be to take this

1649
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Same horse riding game and just

1650
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Shake the remote slow to go slow

1651
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Shake it faster to go faster

1652
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Oh my god look at that I didn't have to buy

1653
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Any more peripherals

1654
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Can you imagine the size of the box

1655
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
This game is going to come in if it's just this

1656
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Giant device

1657
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Well you probably have to inflate it yourself

1658
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It probably comes in a small box and

1659
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You

1660
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You have to inflate it yourself

1661
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You know what the whole talk about

1662
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The cushion thing just sort of made my brain

1663
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Shut off so I decided to look at Teriyaki Doritos

1664
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Instead

1665
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Will you stop being so random

1666
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
First you want our Mega Man game to have

1667
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
A butt then you say I don't

1668
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Care about inflatable Nintendo cushion

1669
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This could be the biggest joke of the year

1670
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I want Teriyaki Doritos

1671
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Really

1672
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I really want Teriyaki Doritos right now

1673
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This is going to be one of those

1674
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Shows where it's like

1675
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm sorry the whole concept of this

1676
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Cushion thing literally made

1677
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
My brain shut off

1678
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
For like a minute

1679
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And then by the time

1680
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I came back to consciousness I was looking

1681
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
At Teriyaki Doritos

1682
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know the best part about this is

1683
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I bet you the Wii remote is not sensitive enough

1684
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
To sense these little rocking motions

1685
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That would be the

1686
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Punchline to the whole thing

1687
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Let's see some comments

1688
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Frisbee says

1689
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
My name is Reggie I'm about kicking ass

1690
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Taking names and fucking a pillow

1691
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Boy oh boy

1692
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Gripper01 in chat says

1693
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Is this something we need to be teaching our kids

1694
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Hold on shush

1695
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Gripper01 says I'm still waiting for Excitebots to be released

1696
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
In the UK Nintendo hates Europe

1697
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Well hey at least you'll have this peripheral

1698
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Possibly

1699
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So is this going to break certain girls' hymens

1700
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I mean are they going to become women

1701
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Just from playing this game

1702
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's what I want to know

1703
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Because this game sounds

1704
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh my god

1705
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Just chalk that up to the list of Wii injuries

1706
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Broken lamp

1707
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Shattered television screen

1708
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Broken hymen

1709
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Just add that to the list

1710
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Oh my god Loki why did you go there

1711
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Because that's horseback riding

1712
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Hello

1713
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It was on topic

1714
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Hymen Breaker Wii 2009

1715
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Ok I think we can

1716
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Pretty much just you know

1717
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Sum it up this is a horrible idea

1718
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You know what

1719
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Is it Nintendo horrible

1720
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You know what here's the thing

1721
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It's kind of interesting

1722
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
In all honesty all jokes

1723
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Aside like

1724
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
To see somebody putting you know

1725
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
A respectable reputable game company

1726
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Behind an inflatable pillow

1727
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That will move

1728
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You really have to wonder

1729
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Like where are they going with this

1730
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It could be interesting

1731
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I see potential modifications involving the res vibrator

1732
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I just you know

1733
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It is hard for me to be serious about this Rob

1734
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I think if anything this is a sign of hope

1735
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Because it gives me hope

1736
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That at any conference that

1737
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You know they hold from now on

1738
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm hoping that I see this

1739
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
What's her name

1740
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That new one

1741
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
What's her name Piper

1742
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Is that her name

1743
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I want her to come out on one of these

1744
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
No

1745
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
She autographed an Xbox supposedly

1746
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That's doing horrible things for my imagination right now

1747
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Alright

1748
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Let's move on please

1749
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
To another story

1750
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And we're going to talk about

1751
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey other Nintendo Wii news but this one

1752
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Is actually a lot more serious I'm sorry to say

1753
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
32 gigabyte SD cards

1754
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Will soon be usable in Wiis

1755
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Actually I think they already take the 32 gigabyte

1756
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Or sorry gigabyte

1757
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah gigabyte cards right

1758
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
They take them now but here's the thing is that

1759
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Apparently

1760
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Right now if you want

1761
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
To use download content

1762
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You basically you can store it on the card but you have to

1763
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Copy it over basically to the actual

1764
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Wii console every time you want to use it

1765
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
But not for much longer

1766
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Apparently pretty soon

1767
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
You will be able to play your download content

1768
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Directly off of the SD cards

1769
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Which will finally justify

1770
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Nintendo's

1771
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Choice to not put a hard drive in these things

1772
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Because as you can change out the cards and so on

1773
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's kind of cool

1774
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But apparently

1775
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
There's a new IGN report

1776
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Saying that all the tricks used for both

1777
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band in the past

1778
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Leaving internal memory open is gone

1779
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Instead straight up booting off the SD card

1780
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Is available and that means easier downloads

1781
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Larger expansions and quicker

1782
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Loads when bringing in song data from the

1783
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
SD card into Guitar Hero

1784
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Nintendo 5 and apparently that's the first game

1785
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And no support from Nintendo

1786
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So they just figured this out on themselves

1787
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
On their own

1788
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Interesting

1789
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So

1790
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I'm curious to see if any other developers are going to use this

1791
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Other than companies that are just trying to mirror

1792
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
What they're doing on the 360 and the PS3

1793
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It does piss me off though that they haven't

1794
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You know done any download content

1795
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Other than I guess Animal Crossing

1796
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But Animal Crossing you don't really actually

1797
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Buy the download content I don't think

1798
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It's kind of something that comes in the mail

1799
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Just like you get used to

1800
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It's probably already in the game anyways

1801
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm kind of pissed off that they aren't

1802
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Actually doing any expansions

1803
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And stuff for these new games that they're putting out

1804
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And even still like

1805
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let's support the MP3 stuff

1806
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Before on the SD cards and then

1807
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Now with the newer games

1808
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Sorry we're not going to do that anymore

1809
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
You're taking a step backwards come on

1810
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well

1811
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'm glad to hear that they're putting in that functionality

1812
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That really should have been there from the get go

1813
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But hey better late than never right?

1814
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So

1815
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You know ironically enough though I haven't bought really

1816
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A lot of virtual console games in a long

1817
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Long time

1818
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
There's some stuff coming up later in the show

1819
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That I find interesting but

1820
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
As far as you know virtual console stuff

1821
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
There really hasn't been a lot lately I've been interested in

1822
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Except the Final Fantasy IV

1823
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
WiiWare games

1824
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
What about the WiiWare game that's

1825
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I haven't heard of this what's that?

1826
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Next quest that used to be called

1827
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Ikiran something or whatever

1828
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It's like Kid Icarus basically

1829
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Oh neat no I hadn't heard of this

1830
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They changed it because apparently

1831
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Ikiran quest or whatever it was called

1832
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Is too close to Kid Icarus and Nintendo got pissed

1833
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Interesting

1834
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
When's this coming out is it already out?

1835
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
No I hadn't heard of this game

1836
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I don't know that last WiiWare game I downloaded

1837
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Was so terrible that BitBoy or whatever it was called

1838
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I think I'm turned off to WiiWare games for a little while

1839
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I mean that's how awful this game was

1840
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
So awful

1841
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Anyhow more gaming stories

1842
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And then release dates coming up soon

1843
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And of course the classic game of the week before we end part 8 at night

1844
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Well how about some more Wii stuff

1845
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Wii?

1846
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Wii sing actually

1847
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
That is going to have a four

1848
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Player karaoke mode

1849
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
As in four mics

1850
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Four people singing at one time

1851
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It says

1852
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That there's actually not

1853
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
A full track list out yet

1854
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But they are working with EMI

1855
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Warner Universal and a few independent

1856
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But there are thirty

1857
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Songs available already

1858
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Pokerface, Locomotion

1859
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Delilah

1860
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
There's also

1861
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Viva La Vida

1862
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
You know some stuff from

1863
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That album

1864
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And then

1865
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But the big thing Rob that should make you happy

1866
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Is if there's Abba

1867
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Yes

1868
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You get four part harmony

1869
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Awesome

1870
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yeah but I'm kind of done on the karaoke games

1871
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I mean is there really room in the marketplace right now

1872
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
For yet another karaoke game

1873
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Well I would play this one though because

1874
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It wouldn't be me singing by myself

1875
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I guess it's cool that

1876
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You know cause the Wii doesn't really have

1877
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
A lot of karaoke games that I know of

1878
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I think there's some overseas

1879
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Like they have a karaoke channel right

1880
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And then the Konami's karaoke revolution

1881
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Is coming out, there are new ones out on Wii

1882
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
They have American Idol's on Wii

1883
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Oh do they? Well that's the same thing

1884
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Konami just lost their American Idol license

1885
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Or whatever, their new series of karaoke

1886
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Games don't have that branding on it

1887
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So I consider that the same series

1888
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Is that the only series available on Wii right now?

1889
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
There's Disney Sing It

1890
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
That's the other series that's available

1891
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's got a narrow

1892
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Audience, that's not something I can

1893
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Break out at a party

1894
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah

1895
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Um

1896
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Rock band

1897
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Yeah I guess you saw that

1898
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I don't know it just seems to me that the karaoke marketplace

1899
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Is kind of oversaturated right now

1900
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I mean is there really room for all these games to be doing well

1901
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
From what I understand, and I could be completely wrong

1902
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But my understanding was that Lips

1903
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The Xbox 360 one was not doing that well

1904
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Lips is ugh

1905
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Which is too bad cause it's by the guys who did

1906
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Elite Beat Agents

1907
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Yet they're still doing another one though

1908
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Are they really?

1909
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I remember that

1910
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I was under the impression that Sing Star

1911
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Was actually doing better than Lips

1912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But maybe that's just because Europe

1913
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Sing Star is the karaoke game in Europe

1914
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You know

1915
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I like Sing Star

1916
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't know, they have a lot of versions coming out

1917
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You actually got me to play that

1918
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Sing Star's fun, I like Sing Star

1919
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Which is weird, I wouldn't consider myself

1920
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Like oh I'm a rabid Sing Star fan

1921
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But yet I have Sing Star volume 1, volume 2

1922
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And ABBA all on PS3 and I want Sing Star Queen

1923
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I would get that

1924
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We should do another Sing Star Party

1925
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I think it'd be fun, Sing Star Party

1926
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Ok, I'll bring people

1927
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
We'll have to make that happen, maybe later

1928
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I'll bring someone who's listening right now

1929
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Since I'm not going to PAX, I'm thinking Sing Star Party

1930
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
This might have to happen

1931
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Let's have our own PAX

1932
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Call it O-O-O-O-O-O-O

1933
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Tampax

1934
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
No, you need to

1935
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Call it Tampax

1936
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well what time is, or when's

1937
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
We got BlizzCon this year

1938
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
It's right before PAX, right?

1939
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
This next weekend is BlizzCon

1940
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Well, you could just become part of

1941
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The second annual QQCon

1942
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Ah, QQCon, I like this idea

1943
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's right, I remember QQCon last year

1944
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
But this year I'm not sad

1945
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
That I'm not going to BlizzCon

1946
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Because I'm over WoW now

1947
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And WoW got spoiled anyways, we're going to get to it a little bit later

1948
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You know what, it just occurred to me

1949
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
We could actually rent

1950
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Like

1951
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Like an office room or something

1952
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And have just

1953
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Systems set up and just do O-L-R-Con

1954
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
First year O-L-R-Con

1955
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Just some little office

1956
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's how they start

1957
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I guess that's true

1958
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Airport Hilton

1959
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
No, we used to do

1960
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Actually, we used to have

1961
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Ground Zero Con in Mobile

1962
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And they held it at college

1963
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
In the student center

1964
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I like Frisbee's idea, PAX in the back yard

1965
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
PAX yard

1966
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Nice

1967
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
We haven't had it, remember we used to do

1968
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The old Baymani parties way back when

1969
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
That should be the same thing, just be

1970
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Gamer nerd syndrome party

1971
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
NerdCon at my house, dude, I've got pinball

1972
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I wonder how much it would cost

1973
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Her in a small space just for the day

1974
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Oh, look into this

1975
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You should, you've got time off because of your hand right now

1976
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You need to find us a place to have a con

1977
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Quick poll of chat

1978
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Who would come to O-L-R-Con?

1979
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Y or N

1980
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You would check out for O-L-R-Con

1981
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And your response must be either a Y or an N

1982
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Spelled out W-H-Y

1983
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Or E-N

1984
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Like I said in random today

1985
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Alright

1986
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We might have to make that happen

1987
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Anyhow, let's get to some release dates

1988
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
While we ponder the idea of an O-L-R-Con

1989
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
We can host it at an Olive Garden

1990
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
They can cater

1991
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Catered by Olive Garden

1992
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You know what, fuck that

1993
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I cook better than Olive Garden

1994
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I will cook

1995
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
What about doing one of those really

1996
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
No offense to

1997
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
SacAnime, but remember how they used to have

1998
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
SacAnime at Sunrise Mall

1999
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You know, the really ghetto mall that we have around here

2000
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Wouldn't it be funny to do O-L-R-Con

2001
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
At Sunrise Mall

2002
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
At the mall?

2003
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
With the one room that they have that's

2004
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
They had movies playing at

2005
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
A closed down

2006
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
McDonald's

2007
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I remember that

2008
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That was the strangest

2009
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
AnimeCon I'd ever seen in my life

2010
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Was the one that was at the mall

2011
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Where the closed stores served as screening rooms

2012
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And then you'd just see random people in costumes

2013
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Throughout the mall

2014
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Meanwhile there's people trying to go to Macy's

2015
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You know, it's just so strange

2016
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It's the most awkward thing I've ever seen

2017
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
In my life

2018
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Alright, anyhow

2019
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Anyways, this week

2020
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Not a whole lot coming out

2021
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
There are some pretty good games, but it's still

2022
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Kind of that slow part of the summer

2023
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
This week on DS Core

2024
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Game from Graffiti

2025
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It's a first person shooter

2026
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It's been delayed forever

2027
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But finally making its way out

2028
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Still Life 2 on PC

2029
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Coming out this week as well

2030
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
My friends on

2031
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
DS

2032
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Because

2033
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Apparently if you play this game you have no friends

2034
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So you need

2035
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Your friends on the DS

2036
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
War Leaders, Clash of Nations

2037
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
On PC this week

2038

Sudoku Ball Detective

2039
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Yes, it's a

2040
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Game that you solve detective

2041
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Mysteries by playing games of

2042
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sudoku

2043
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Awesome

2044
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
My Makeup

2045
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
A game for girls

2046
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Delta Force Extreme 2

2047
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
They have that coming out

2048
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
As well as Plants vs. Zombies

2049
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The packaged version

2050
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Is making its way out this week as well

2051
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000

2053
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Coming out this week

2054
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Spectrobes Origins

2055
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Pretty good

2056
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Roleplaying game

2057
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
From Disney Interactive

2058
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Making its way out to the Wii this week

2059
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
My Dress Up also goes with

2060
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The My Makeup thing

2061
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Also for girls

2062
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
ATV Quad Kings from Zoo

2063
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Games

2064
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
That's the most generic ATV off-road racing

2065
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Game I've ever seen

2066
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Joint Operations

2067
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Combined Arms

2068
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Coming out on PC this week

2069
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And that is it

2070
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Let me move on to

2071
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Japan in Japanese

2072
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Release dates

2073
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
About the My Makeup thing

2074
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Could also be for the occasional

2075
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Cross-dresser

2076
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I guess

2077
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Don't say something is just for girls

2078
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Because some boys might be into that

2079
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
My character in Ion looks like a drag queen

2080
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Your character in Ion has a fan

2081
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
She has a fan, how amazing is that

2082
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I do have to mention this because I think it is

2083
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
On Steam, but it's an awesome name

2084
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
For a game

2085
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Pizza Morgana, Monsters and Manipulations

2086
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
In the Magical Forest

2087
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Pizza Morgana

2088
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's an adventure game

2089
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's kind of a gothic

2090
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Hot topic looking type thing

2091
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Interesting

2092
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Games coming out in Japan, not a lot

2093
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There is nothing new on the

2094
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Playstation 3 or the Xbox 360

2095
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
There is a new game coming out on the 20th

2096
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
On Playstation 2, it's called Melty Blood

2097
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Actress Again

2098
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Yes, that is really the name of it

2099
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Melty Blood Actress Again

2100
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's a fighting game

2101
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Bringing a whole new level to the 2D fighting world

2102
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Three different fighting styles

2103
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
A larger moveset and new characters

2104
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I guess this is continuing

2105
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
In the Melty Blood series

2106
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Is that an anime or something?

2107
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Or is this just a video game series I've never heard of

2108
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
L2 Love Cross Loop

2109
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Is also a game coming out of Japan on the

2110
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Playstation 2 this week

2111
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
On the Nintendo DS

2112
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Live Battle Card

2113
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Is the only new release this week

2114
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It's a very slow release week over in Japan

2115
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
There is on the Sony PSP

2116
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Heart no Kunen no Alice

2117
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Comes out, as well as

2118
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Ukame Kakushi comes out from

2119
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Konami this week

2120
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I'm trying to see what kind of game this is

2121
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But it doesn't look like any of their series

2122
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It just looks like

2123
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's O-O-K-A-M-I

2124
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Is what it is

2125
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So I'm not sure what series

2126
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I think that's a new one

2127
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Great God something says Dark Sakura

2128
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It's a big sight

2129
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Exactly

2130
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
For something like that actually that would be something

2131
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I'd have to see the kanji for because I should know

2132
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Both of those kanji, aha

2133
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Well there you go that's really all there is in

2134
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Japan this week

2135
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
For our

2136
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
For our buddies in the UK actually

2137
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
We've got a number of releases

2138
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
If you've been able to ignore Madden

2139
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
That game

2140
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Has touched my life because Dan

2141
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Had to go for a minute opening

2142
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
On the 19th we have Shadow Complex

2143
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
On Xbox 360

2144
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Did you make a yay?

2145
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No I said how do you share me?

2146
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The cat's hanging around

2147
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
She's about to be dinner in a moment

2148
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
On the 20th Tales of Monkey Island

2149
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
The Siege of Spinner City

2150
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And the 21st DJ Star

2151
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And Raven Squad

2152
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Supercar Challenge and then Wolfenstein

2153
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Oh it's a Dworkenstein

2154
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Anyway

2155
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's it

2156
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Alright well there's a new patent

2157
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Submitted by Sony

2158
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Apparently it's a device

2159
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Or

2160
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
A program to

2161
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Interpret whether you

2162
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Or different emotions that you are feeling

2163
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
While playing I guess the PS3

2164
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
One example

2165
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That they show is laughter

2166
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Which apparently they have this

2167
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Really weird looking guy laughing at a

2168
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Video of somebody

2169
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Kicking themselves in the ass with a machine

2170
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That they're powering with their own

2171
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Hands

2172
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Will it sense boredom?

2173
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Yes

2174
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Well apparently

2175
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
They make that joke too

2176
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Actually they're saying that

2177
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Not necessarily sure what it would do

2178
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But it would be able to sense laughter

2179
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
As well as other emotions

2180
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Sadness, excitement, anger, joy, interest

2181
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And boredom

2182
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
They say perhaps if the game detects boredom

2183
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They have enemies on screen, if it detects anger

2184
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
The difficulty can go down and finally

2185
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
If it detects sadness

2186
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And they're punchline to the joke

2187
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It will tell you just to stop playing

2188
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Lair

2189
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I'm wondering though if it's gonna

2190
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Detect me laughing when they make an announcement

2191
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
About like some new PS3 system or something

2192
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Like that that's gonna be more expensive than the

2193
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Previous one just like the PSP Go

2194
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Because that would be hilarious

2195
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So yeah you think I'm gonna buy that?

2196
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Nope

2197
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You know um this peripheral

2198
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Should go with the Nintendo one

2199
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Like they needed to combine their forces so that

2200
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It can sense me giggling when I'm riding

2201
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The inflatable

2202
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Wii sack or whatever it's called

2203
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
The Wii sack

2204
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I like that

2205
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
That'll be the name

2206
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Alright then it's called the Wii sack until we get a

2207
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Real name for it

2208
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
That seems kind of a

2209
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Dumb technology because like

2210
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
All I had to do was act angry

2211
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Or something like

2212
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Grrr I'm angry

2213
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You know and the game gets easier

2214
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I don't know

2215
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
What if it doesn't tell you

2216
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That this is in the game

2217
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Like it's just something that is kind of there

2218
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
People will find out

2219
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
They have ways of finding out

2220
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's probably something that they're not really gonna use

2221
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But they wanna you know

2222
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
In case PS3

2223
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Wants to do a Milo you know

2224
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Something like that

2225
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
They can detect laughter and all what not

2226
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Something so they have the technology

2227
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Before Microsoft does maybe?

2228
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah something so they can say hey we patented

2229
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
That we sue you now

2230
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Hmm

2231
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Well I don't know

2232
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It could be

2233
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Interesting but I really would have to see

2234
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
The application of how this is used

2235
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Like I'm into this a lot

2236
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
More than I am the Wii sack

2237
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But this is

2238
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You know it could be hokey

2239
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It could be kind of neat you know I like the idea

2240
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Of a game you know because you all know those

2241
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
People that get so angry when they're playing the games

2242
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Not that there's anyone in this room like that Loki

2243
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
That they're throwing controllers on the ground

2244
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I never throw controllers

2245
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I never throw controllers because controllers

2246
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Are expensive and there's no reason to get pissed off

2247
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But you get angry you do get very angry

2248
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
When playing games no come on

2249
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I've heard you do that

2250
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Well okay if I was playing Grand Theft Auto

2251
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Or something like that and the game

2252
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Glitches out on me or something like that

2253
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Like uh

2254
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You know I fire six sniper rounds

2255
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
The game retarded

2256
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I fire six sniper rounds into the back of someone's

2257
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Head and then they're like oh hey someone's

2258
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Shooting at me and they turn around and fire a pistol

2259
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And kill me and they're like come on

2260
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
My favorite is when Loki will go

2261
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And then the game's all like I don't know what I'm doing

2262
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
What the fuck

2263
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Exactly because it's retarded

2264
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
My favorite is when Loki impersonates

2265
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
The game

2266
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I do that to people too

2267
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's fun all around

2268
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Alright something that is

2269
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Gonna be impersonated all over again

2270
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Blizzard for

2271
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
WoW's fifth anniversary

2272
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Onyxia is making a return

2273
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Y'all Onyxia was a level

2274
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
60 raid of course in old school

2275
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Warcraft where 40 of you would

2276
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Fight the dragon Onyxia once

2277
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And now it's kind of a bit of a joke like people

2278
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Will go run the Onyxia thing because you can totally

2279
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Solo Onyxia now or at least

2280
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Duo it

2281
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Very easy and kind of take her

2282
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Down and do that whole quest where you get the

2283
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Onyxia's head in the middle of Orgrimmar

2284
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Or whatever it is that you're at

2285
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So they're gonna go back

2286
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
For the fifth anniversary and basically

2287
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Redo Onyxia's lair and the Onyxia

2288
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Boss as a 10 man

2289
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And heroic 25 man as all

2290
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The raids in WoW are now long gone

2291
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Are the days of the 40 man dungeons

2292
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Apparently there's gonna be loot

2293
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And the cool thing about the loot if you're a WoW player

2294
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Is that she's gonna drop

2295
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
The same stuff she did before

2296
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
But it's all been

2297
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Scaled to level 80 gear

2298
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So meaning that like the

2299
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Stats that was on the

2300
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Gear before was for 60 they're scaling it up to

2301
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
80 so it's like you can have tier 2

2302
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Gear that's just as cool as some of the gear they

2303
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Have now that's pretty cool

2304
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Also there's gonna be a

2305
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
310% speed flying mount

2306
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Modeled after Onyxia that's gonna be

2307
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
A rare drop so that'll be something

2308
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
A lot of folks are after

2309
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Hopefully it's not glitched out like the dragon was at one time

2310
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
During Final Fantasy 11

2311
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Where you couldn't kill the dragon

2312
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Remember that?

2313
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Oh yeah I heard about that

2314
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That was after we were playing but yeah I remember hearing about that

2315
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
No no it was while we were playing

2316
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But it was hilarious

2317
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Also some WoW news this week

2318
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Of course Blizzcon's coming up this next weekend

2319
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And some details have apparently

2320
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Been leaked about what they are gonna be talking about

2321
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
At Blizzcon. Cataclysm is supposedly

2322
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The name of the new WoW expansion

2323
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I don't even know if the name's been confirmed yet

2324
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
It's a registered trademark from them now

2325
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Alright well anyway

2326
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
So despite the name possibly getting out

2327
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Apparently some of the information about the game

2328
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Has leaked out too

2329
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You will be able to go to 85

2330
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
In this new expansion

2331
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Which is different because usually

2332
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
WoW has been doing the 10 level increments

2333
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Burning Crusade lets you go to 10

2334
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Or sorry lets you go to 70

2335
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Which was 10 up from 60

2336
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Wrath of the Lich King lets you go up to 80

2337
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And now you can go up to 85

2338
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
In Cataclysm

2339
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Also the other interesting thing about Cataclysm

2340
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It's not really a new world

2341
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
They're not launching a new world

2342
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
There's no Outlands or Northrend type thing

2343
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
No what this is gonna be is improvements

2344
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
To the old world

2345
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Which is kind of interesting because

2346
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I don't know how they're gonna be able to do that

2347
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah isn't that something everybody benefits from

2348
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Because that's a big thing that WoW does now

2349
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Is the whole phasing element

2350
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So maybe you can only get phased if you have the Cataclysm expansion

2351
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Otherwise you're stuck in the old WoW

2352
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I don't know

2353
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I don't know what they're doing with this

2354
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Also some new races are rumored for the game

2355
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Worgen will be the new Alliance class

2356
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And Goblins will be the new Horde class

2357
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And the other interesting thing

2358
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Is that some new job

2359
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Race combinations are opening up

2360
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
For instance now you can be a Tauren Paladin

2361
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Or Troll Druid

2362
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
That's a big one because Druids you had to be

2363
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Tauren or Night Elf to be

2364
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
But apparently now Trolls can be Druids too

2365
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And assumably Worgens

2366
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Since nothing else on the Alliance side opened up for Druids

2367
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So interesting

2368
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You'll be able to fly in some parts of old world now too

2369
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Which was a thing that was being requested

2370
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I don't know though

2371
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
For me honestly as somebody who recently left

2372
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
WoW this isn't really

2373
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Cool enough sounding for me to want to go back

2374
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I have to be honest

2375
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
The improvements sound neat and sound needed

2376
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But I'm not seeing anything where I'm like

2377
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Oh damn

2378
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Well I'm sure that's not all the details about it

2379
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
True

2380
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
They usually put a little more effort into their expansions

2381
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I would think a new heroic job class would be in there too

2382
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Like Death Knight

2383
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Like I was hoping for the next heroic class would be cool

2384
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I'm sure there's

2385
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I don't know

2386
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It'd be interesting

2387
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It could all be speculation too

2388
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It could be like one of those you know

2389
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Culmination of all the rumors that are on there

2390
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The new name of the expansion

2391
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Because of the registered trademark

2392
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
The rumor of the new classes

2393
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Based on the Halloween masks

2394
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That appeared or whatever

2395
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And some other crap

2396
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You know I'm

2397
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I don't know

2398
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
We'll find out next week I guess

2399
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I mean seriously

2400
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We'll find out in a week

2401
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But all of it sounds plausible

2402
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I mean nothing that's being announced sounds unplausible

2403
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But I think the new race job combinations

2404
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
That's going to be very interesting

2405
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Alright let's get into a segment here we like to do on

2406
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Orange Lawns Radio called the classic video game

2407
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Of the week

2408
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's a moment where we take a minute to reflect back on

2409
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Games history and

2410
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Dark Sakura likes to take a trip to the vault

2411
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And find a game that she thinks you know what you guys

2412
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Ought to be playing this game this week

2413
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So Dark Sakura

2414
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
What is the classic video game

2415
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Of the week?

2416
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I'm going for another series this time Rob

2417
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
How dare you?

2418
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Sorry we can't get the music volume down

2419
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
There we go

2420
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Raiden you say?

2421
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Alright let's cue up some music from Raiden here

2422
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Well

2423
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Basically yeah this one goes through the whole PlayStation screen

2424
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Launch up thing sorry

2425
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But basically for anyone who doesn't know

2426
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Raiden is

2427
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
A scrolling shooter

2428
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It's put out by Seibu Kairatsu

2429
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And it was

2430
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
In the arcades

2431
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And I think we got it by Fabtech

2432
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Over here in the states

2433
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Also supposed to be

2434
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Kind of hard to emulate because of

2435
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
The way that they changed the game boards

2436
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
For them

2437
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
But it came out

2438
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
On PlayStation as the

2439
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Raiden project

2440
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Well at least Raiden 1 and 2 did

2441
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And then we got

2442
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It came out on Amiga, Atari Jaguar

2443
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
The TurboGrafx

2444
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
It came out on the duo

2445
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
As Super Raiden

2446
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Atari Lynx, Super Nintendo

2447
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Came out for PC, Genesis

2448
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And there's actually a mobile phone version too

2449
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Seibu Kairatsu did

2450
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
All of the ones that came out

2451
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Until 98 and then

2452
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Moss Limited did the games

2453
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That came out since 2005

2454
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And the games since 2005 also came out

2455
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
On the Taito Type X boards

2456
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Which were supposed to be

2457
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
They were pretty hard to duplicate the emulation for

2458
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So anyway

2459
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
The world was taken over by aliens

2460
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And the world says screw you aliens

2461
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And fights back, that's the story

2462
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So you also had

2463
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You could play one player

2464
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Or have two players and play together

2465
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You also had a variety of different weapons

2466
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You know

2467
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That you would get through different power ups

2468
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
My favorite being the little electric

2469
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Thingy weapon which

2470
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
In fact it's on the screen right now in the example

2471
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Showing where you would fire this

2472
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Continuous stream of energy that would

2473
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Lock on to

2474
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Certain enemies and then wrap around them

2475
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And you know

2476
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Pull towards them, it's kind of like how

2477
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
You know those electric globe

2478
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Things where you put your hand on it

2479
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And all the energy goes to where your hand is

2480
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That's my favorite weapon in the game

2481
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And the games that came out in the series were

2482
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Raiden, Raiden 2, Raiden DX

2483
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Raiden 3, and Raiden 4. Raiden DX

2484
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Of those is probably my favorite

2485
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
There were also spin off games

2486
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That were

2487
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I'm sure

2488
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Actually we talked about them

2489
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Recently

2490
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
When I was going over my

2491
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Gaming week

2492
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
It was Viper Phase 1

2493
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, and Raiden Fighters Jet

2494
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So

2495
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Big, big, big, big, big

2496
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Big, big, big series of games

2497
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And

2498
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's actually probably one of

2499
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
My favorite shooters to this date

2500
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It's also

2501
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It can get pretty hard

2502
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Because you get a lot of

2503
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Bullets and a lot of enemies on the screen

2504
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And they're big and

2505
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's just a lot of fun

2506
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Definitely a lot of fun

2507
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Plus the music is great

2508
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I'll turn it up here a little bit

2509
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I think the clip that I gave you

2510
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Is actually from Raiden Project

2511
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I have a story about Raiden Project

2512
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
What's that?

2513
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I remember being completely

2514
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Intoxicated on Everclear

2515
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And beating this game

2516
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Nice

2517
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
That was the same night that I ended up having so much

2518
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Everclear how close I needed

2519
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I was 19

2520
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
No, I take that back, I was 20

2521
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
You say that proudly

2522
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yeah, I was 20

2523
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Alright, well there you have it folks

2524
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Your classic game of the week

2525
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Raiden, the whole dang series

2526
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Because Dark Soccer said the series

2527
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So that's what you get

2528
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Alright, well thank you very much Dark Soccer

2529
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
We'll look forward to see what you pick for us next week

2530
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But in the meantime we're going to take a quick break

2531
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
We're going to do some Twitter and so forth

2532
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But we have plenty more show to come

2533
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
When we come back from a break

2534
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Twitter topics

2535
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Something new we're trying tonight

2536
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
We've been trying to incorporate Twitter into the show for a long time now

2537
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So we're going to do some Twitter topics when we come back

2538
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Rapid fire news and some more discussions

2539
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Including Silent Hill

2540
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
A chance for you to go visit

2541
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Like real Silent Hill

2542
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Not really, but as close as it's going to get

2543
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We're going to talk about that

2544
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And it sounds kind of cool

2545
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So stay tuned

2546
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And welcome back everybody

2547
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
To more of Orange Lounge Radio

2548
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening

2549
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
August the 16th of 2009

2550
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Where we are taping live

2551
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Our what, 334th

2552
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2553
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Slightly more than half evil

2554
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yes, it just keeps on going

2555
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And no signs of quitting anytime soon

2556
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
We're coming back this segment

2557
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
We're going to get into some Twitter topics here shortly

2558
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And if you wanted to submit a topic

2559
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You could do that earlier

2560
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
By joining our Twitter

2561
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
You can't send it now, it's too late

2562
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Because we already have picked what we want to talk about tonight

2563
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But if you want to do that for future weeks

2564
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You can send those to us at OLR on Twitter

2565
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And if you're not following us on Twitter yet

2566
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Why not? You should be there

2567
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I wanted to mention one game

2568
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I didn't mention it during my gaming week

2569
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Because it wasn't really my gaming week

2570
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And not a game I've been playing

2571
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Non-stop

2572
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Just been obsessed with it

2573
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I think he's racked up like 15-16 hours

2574
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Just this week alone

2575
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It's an iPhone game, believe it or not

2576
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
And the iPhone game is called

2577
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Zenonia is the name of the game

2578
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Z-E-N-O-N-I-A

2579
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And it's a game I probably need to look at and check out

2580
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I guess there's a free demo available out there

2581
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
But if you want to play more than a certain amount of time

2582
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
You have to pay money for it

2583
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But I guess it's like a

2584
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
The best way I can describe it from what I saw

2585
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Is a style game

2586
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Kind of like the role playing game

2587
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But more of the action style

2588
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Like Secret of Mana is

2589
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
With the multiple quests going on at once

2590
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Like WoW has

2591
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And I guess you can be good or evil in the game

2592
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
John was trying to tell me a little bit about the game

2593
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I thought it was interesting enough to give a mention here on the show

2594
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Because iPhones have some pretty interesting games on it

2595
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Some of the games I didn't even mention

2596
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That I played this week were on the iPhone

2597
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
There's a new Space Invaders game on the iPhone

2598
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
That I checked out that's kind of interesting

2599
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Because you can use your own music collection in some of the stages

2600
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And there's also Civilization Revolution got a release on the iPhone this week

2601
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Which is a pretty neat port I got to say

2602
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I didn't play it a whole lot

2603
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So I don't want to give it a full review

2604
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
But I was fairly impressed with the port of the game I must say

2605
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I played Peggle

2606
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Did you play Peggle? Good times on the iPhone

2607
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It's not bad on the iPhone

2608
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
It's the only version of it I have

2609
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Good stuff

2610
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Alright let's get into some Twitter topics

2611
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Tell us some things you want us to talk about tonight

2612
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Deathwishing says

2613
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Starcraft 2 petition has over 100k signatures

2614
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
For LAN support

2615
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Discuss that

2616
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Remember we were talking about

2617
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Was this the one where we said people need to get over it?

2618
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I don't think it was this actually though

2619
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I think it was something else

2620
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I would think because LAN is a big part of Starcraft

2621
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I know how they have tournaments

2622
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It's really huge over in Asia

2623
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And the regions over there

2624
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
But it's just

2625
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I don't know why they would

2626
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I think the reason why they want to take out

2627
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
LAN because

2628
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
One, piracy

2629
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Because they want all their online play

2630
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Or all the multiplayer to go through

2631
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I want to say BattleNet

2632
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah BattleNet

2633
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
But

2634
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I always thought it was for statistical purposes

2635
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
They want to

2636
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Log every game that's played by folks

2637
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
And keep track of statistics and so forth

2638
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But yeah piracy is a nice little bonus

2639
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Basically piracy is what it is

2640
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I mean it makes sense because

2641
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You're making these people buy

2642
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Three different versions of the same damn game

2643
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Because you're just saying

2644
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh well

2645
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
The campaigns are separate

2646
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
When any other RTS

2647
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Game out there

2648
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Command and Conquer

2649
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
How even the original Starcraft had all the campaigns

2650
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Right there from the get go

2651
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It's kind of a little bit

2652
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I don't know milking it a bit

2653
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So yeah I can see how

2654
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Some people might be a little pissed off by that

2655
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And you know what

2656
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
And I'm just going to say this now because

2657
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We're going to be reporting on it later on I'm sure

2658
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
They're going to crack this

2659
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It's going to happen

2660
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
People want to play this in LAN

2661
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And you know what's going to happen

2662
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Is they're just going to tunnel it just like they do with the PSP

2663
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And the Wii or the Gamecube and all that stuff

2664
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
You know warp pipe was mentioned earlier

2665
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But they're just going to find a way to tunnel this

2666
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
With some third party software

2667
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Why don't we just give them

2668
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
The benefit of the doubt right now that

2669
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It'll be secure for about a week and then

2670
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It'll be broken again

2671
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Actdeftinchat says online petitions

2672
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Never work for a few exceptions

2673
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And you know that's kind of true too

2674
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
If you want to, if you really want to make a statement

2675
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Guys, put your money where your mouth is

2676
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Don't buy the game when it comes out

2677
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Because if there's 100,000 people

2678
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That dent in their first week sales

2679
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Of the game, that'll be heard loud and clear

2680
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
But this online petition

2681
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
That can be swept under the rug

2682
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
At the end of the day, do you still buy the game?

2683
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
If yes, then

2684
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
They had no reason to put it back in

2685
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
You need to send physical mail instead of like

2686
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
You know, just a petition

2687
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
You send a letter

2688
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Because 100,000 letters

2689
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Look a lot better than 100,000 emails

2690
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And definitely a lot better than 100,000 signatures

2691
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Or do both

2692
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Do all three

2693
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Surtur, I might be saying that wrong

2694
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Or Surtur, Surtur, S-U-R-T-U-R

2695
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
On Twitter says please discuss the PS3 slim

2696
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I'd like to get a PS3 but they're too expensive

2697
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I assume the slim will be cheaper or there'll be a price cut

2698
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
What is this slim that you're talking about

2699
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
There's no slim, they denied it

2700
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Denied, denied, denied

2701
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
You know what's interesting though

2702
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Surtur, if I'm saying your name right

2703
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Just because, you know, we've made that assumption before

2704
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That just because they are remaking the system

2705
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Means it's going to be cheaper

2706
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Not true, look at the PSP

2707
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
See they're going to be cheaper, I guarantee it's not gonna be cheaper

2708
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It's not gonna be cheaper

2709
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
This is their MO

2710
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
They basically take the console or whatever

2711
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
They drop the price of the old system

2712
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Which is something that we're starting to see a little bit

2713
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And then

2714
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
They basically release the new system at the same price the old system was

2715
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I would hope that they would drop the price of the system

2716
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Because I think it would be something that is in their best interest

2717
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Because their sales are hurting

2718
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And they're definitely not getting better anytime soon

2719
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And yeah, the slim PS3 might be appealing to some people, because hey, it's new, it looks different, it's nicer looking, we're assuming.

2720
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And whatnot, maybe some backwards compatibility is added in. I think that's kind of wishful thinking there, but we'll have to see.

2721
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:13,000
They're going to announce it next week, I'm sure, at Gamescom. It's going to happen. I mean, that's the rumors right now, and they're definitely prepping for it.

2722
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And between the birds and you guys, I guess, it's definitely happening. I mean, it's just a matter of time whenever they decide to announce it.

2723
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Gripper01 in chat says, the PS2 Slim was more expensive than the Fat. Was it? I think I remember a comment earlier, though, he's overseas, so maybe it could be different from region to region.

2724
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I don't think it was more expensive. I think it was probably the same price, if not cheaper. But hey, that seems to be the trend nowadays. Let's release a new system with less features for more money.

2725
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And Frisbee says, this tiny enemy crab... I like that. Funny.

2726
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's a matter of time. It's just a waiting game until they announce it, and no one's going to be surprised by it. If I were Sony right now, I'd be probably pissed off, because they can't fucking keep a secret for anything.

2727
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:21,000
They really... I mean, even though it kind of hurts our business a bit with the moles and everything, they really need to root out those moles if they want to keep some secrets.

2728
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:33,000
What you need to do, not that I endorse this in any manner, what you need to do is you tell one person something different, and you see what gets reported, and then you know who your mole is.

2729
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Dr. Noir says, free tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour, and then gives us a link to an article that talks about new Guitar Hero World Tour tracks that are coming out. Apparently there's an Activision track pack that came out.

2730
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Apparently it is... folks that work for Activision, they're bands, so you get these bands Awaken, H is Orange, and 100 Reasons, and these songs that... hey, they're free!

2731
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's very hard to complain about free things, but I would probably... I don't own Guitar Hero World Tour. I would probably get to Guitar Hero 5, though.

2732
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Free tracks are good, I mean...

2733
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It's hard to complain about free tracks, but honestly, very rarely would I probably play them. I mean, I look at the Rock Band tracks, very few of those do I play.

2734
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:28,000
But at the same time, there's one or two that I do enjoy, and considering they were free, you know, and I had to sift through 20 to find one or two that I like, it's still free, you know, so it's very hard to complain about free things.

2735
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
You can download it, and guess what, if you don't like it, you can always delete it later.

2736
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Yes you can.

2737
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And it's free.

2738
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So when do those come out? Those are coming out this week? Yeah, today, or they just came out this past week.

2739
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
So check that out in the Guitar Hero World Tour store right now.

2740
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:56,000
If you want to send us a topic to talk about on Twitter, we'll open up Twitter topics next week, just a little bit before the show, but probably if we already are covering your topic somewhere else in the show, sadly you probably didn't make it tonight, but always try again next week.

2741
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Let's do some rapid fire news quickly. We don't want to talk about this news a long time, but we want to get it across anyway. So Loki, how about some rapid fire news?

2742
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So this is a total shock, but apparently Activision is offering Guitar Hero 5, and then if you buy Guitar Hero 5, you get Guitar Hero Van Halen free.

2743
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Totally new news to me, but yeah, so that is the offer. It's all through the month of September, and basically you purchase your game. There's apparently codes in the back of the manual.

2744
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I think that's the way it was with World Tour as well, and there's some other stuff that goes along with that.

2745
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But using those codes, you enter them in online to prove that you've purchased the game, and then you can get your free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen. Not only will you get it free, you will get it weeks early, because it takes six weeks to ship to you, and the game doesn't come out until December 22nd.

2746
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Which I gotta imagine their sales on that game are going to be crap, unless they're going to count the free copies of the sale.

2747
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I am totally surprised and shocked by this news.

2748
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I am shocked. It's like a hypothetical situation come true. It's just so weird.

2749
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
There you go.

2750
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Some other interesting stuff. Also rumors, of course, that the Elite is going to be getting a price cut at the end of this month, and apparently this is coming from a leak of a Myers catalog.

2751
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Good, because I know someone who needs a new 360.

2752
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:36,000
It's a catalog that's going to be hitting stands on August 30th. It shows that the Elite model has a new price of $299.

2753
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:48,000
And of course, that kind of goes along with the whole rumor that the Pro system is going away, because on the new arcades, the box art only shows the arcade and Elite systems.

2754
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:58,000
No Pro system to be found at all, so the rumor is that that SKU is going away and is being replaced by the Elite system for $299.

2755
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Makes sense to me. Probably will happen. Might even get announced next week, so wouldn't be a big surprise.

2756
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And then, last but not least, there is another rumor that white and pink DSIs are coming to America.

2757
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And apparently these were found in a Toys R Us database, listing both color schemes.

2758
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I don't know, that sounds totally false to me. I don't believe that that's ever going to happen, especially not in September.

2759
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Okay, fine. Some rapid fire news I've got for you guys.

2760
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Hey DDR fans, there's finally a point to those USB slots in the DDRX machines.

2761
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That's right, Konami this week opened up the new DDR Edit website. It's DDREdit.KonamiOnline.com.

2762
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
You can actually go in there and open up a little editor and make your own steps to various songs in the game, except not all of them.

2763
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I actually went in there and played with it a little bit. It looks like there's only about seven or eight songs you can edit, at least right now.

2764
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Maybe they're doing it in waves or what have you, but you use this little, it's all a web tool.

2765
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's not something you download. It's all online in Flash or whatever, and it runs horribly, at least on my computer it did.

2766
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
It was all out of sync and everything.

2767
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I miss the days of edit mode and doing hell edits.

2768
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I miss that too. We would actually get the Japanese games that you could edit the songs and take them into the arcade because it all matched up.

2769
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Yeah.

2770
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Fun times.

2771
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Or we'd edit hack them to add freeze arrows to songs that didn't have freeze arrows.

2772
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That's right, I remember that.

2773
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah, fun times.

2774
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Fun times.

2775
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I remember you giving away the boxes of movies.

2776
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
That's right, it was make edit, get porn.

2777
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Yes.

2778
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Good times.

2779
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Epic times.

2780
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Whatever happened to that kid that won? Dave, remember him? Whatever happened to him?

2781
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
He became a man that day.

2782
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Did he?

2783
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Well, I got the box full of anime and stuff that one time, which eventually went back to, which went to Dimple.

2784
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Funny.

2785
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Hey, live at QuakeCon 2009 has been spotted some new games on Xbox Live Arcade.

2786
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Doom 2 has been spotted out there on the show floor apparently.

2787
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And Quake Live, both for Xbox 360's arcade, were both apparently out there on a floor, on the floor.

2788
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I guess, let me actually clarify, I guess only Doom 2 was out there actually playable on the floor,

2789
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,000
but somebody actually had like a shirt that said Quake Arena Arcade or what have you, and they've got some pictures and so forth.

2790
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Lies! They're all lies!

2791
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I don't believe it, one second.

2792
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I don't know, I just had to be the counterpoint to that.

2793
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
There's somebody, there's like a picture of somebody playing Doom 2 on Xbox with an Xbox controller.

2794
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
It's photoshopped, it's a lie.

2795
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Shut up.

2796
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Lastly from me tonight, there's a brand new game coming out for an old system, and the old system, the Atari Lynx.

2797
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
What? I have one of those.

2798
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
There's a new game called Zaku coming out for the Atari Lynx.

2799
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Yes, it is named after one of OLR's infamous callers is getting his own game on the Atari Lynx.

2800
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I'm getting this.

2801
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's the same people that brought you, do you remember Baker Prince that came out on the Genesis in 2006?

2802
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Kind of.

2803
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
The Legend of Wukong also.

2804
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Now those are actually like localized games from Taiwan that I guess just came out or whatever,

2805
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
but this is something I guess that was built on the development kit for the Atari Lynx on an Amiga, of all things,

2806
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,000
and is actually coming out and supposedly has pretty kick butt graphics for a Lynx, that is.

2807
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's too other than not bringing it out in other systems because, I don't know, I don't have a Lynx simulator.

2808
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I have a Lynx, but I just don't...

2809
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Are they actually doing a cartridge for it?

2810
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That's what the plan is, it looks like.

2811
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I think I might have to pick this up.

2812
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
They did one for Baker Prince, I know, and they charged a lot of money for it.

2813
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
This looks like a lot of fun.

2814
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Those carts were expensive.

2815
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Well here's an idea of what it's all about.

2816
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It's a horizontal shooter and it is a hero who dons her rocket shoes and power gloves

2817
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:51,000
and sets off on a journey to retrieve stolen development tools being used to flood the market with bad games.

2818
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
There you go.

2819
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I'm actually signing it for the mailing list right now.

2820
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Sounds like a cause that you can believe in.

2821
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Well DarkSakura, don't sign up for the mailing list just yet because you have to give us some rapid fire news.

2822
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Do I? Well crap, okay.

2823
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Well here's some news.

2824
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I really like corn chips. No, for real.

2825
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:13,000
The actual news, there is an addition to the PAL PSN updates.

2826
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:22,000
They're getting Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which will be 11.99 euro, 14.99 pound.

2827
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It has a free trial.

2828
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And also are getting Call of Juarez Bound in Blood demo and more content for Red Faction Guerrilla.

2829
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Also, Rock Band Unplugged is getting some Iron Maiden songs.

2830
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,000
The Trooper and Number of the Beast for 99 pounds of pop.

2831
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
So that's pretty good.

2832
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And also there's stuff for NHL 10 and Little Big Planet, blah blah blah.

2833
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Oh, and one last thing.

2834
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
For that one, Fat Princess is getting a connectivity patch.

2835
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Moving forward, Tecmo is getting a few games on the Virtual Console.

2836
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Ninja Gaiden and Rygar are to be coming out.

2837
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Also, I think they were talking about, Tecmo Bowl already did come out.

2838
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I really like Ninja Gaiden, but also Solomon's Key is being added to that too.

2839
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I like the old school arcade Rygar. That was an awesome game.

2840
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Also, this makes me a very very very infinity happy girl, is Loom.

2841
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
There's news about Loom.

2842
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Telltale is talking about considering doing another Loom game.

2843
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Which I will be all over happy happy happy if that actually happens.

2844
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:02,000
It was actually said that the game itself was about two and a half hours long.

2845
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And that they're trying to do two and a half hour long games and Loom fits quite well with that little strategy.

2846
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I like Loom. I have Loom. I should actually start playing it.

2847
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Loom is cool. I'd be down with a Loom remake.

2848
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
There's definitely a lot of nostalgia behind that.

2849
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Alright, let's get back into some discussion topics tonight.

2850
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Yes, apparently there's a new deal.

2851
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:42,000
This is coming from the Raven software designer Manveer Har, who has tweeted that apparently he's going to offer to reimburse you for your copy of Wolfenstein.

2852
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
If you purchase Wolfenstein, obviously. Keep your receipt.

2853
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:55,000
If, and this is the big ifs, if they beat out Madden 10 in this month in NPD sales.

2854
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Ha!

2855
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,000
So the offer only applies to sales in August. The NPD figures will be used to calculate the totals.

2856
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
You have to follow the guy on Twitter.

2857
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And in case you really wanted to do that, his name is Manveer Har is his Twitter name.

2858
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And limit one copy per person.

2859
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Let me go ahead and restate that again.

2860
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Ha!

2861
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I mean, no disrespect, but come on. Madden 10 is like, you know, it's not the type of game we usually talk about here on this show.

2862
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But I can clearly recognize the impact that that game has on, you know,

2863
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I have co-workers who came into work dead tired on Friday.

2864
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Like, I have students in my class who came in dead tired on Friday.

2865
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And I'm like, what's going on? What gives?

2866
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And they're like, oh, Madden came out yesterday.

2867
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
And I'm like, I should know that.

2868
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Like, I do a video game show on the internet.

2869
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I don't like to tell my students that because I don't want their teacher, you know, them to download and hear their teacher saying fuck on the internet.

2870
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
But, you know, I just, I'm thinking in the back of my mind like, oh, duh, you should kind of know that.

2871
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
But Madden 10 is a huge game.

2872
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
That's the point I'm trying to make. It's a landmark event game.

2873
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Well, your husband probably had to work like till 3 a.m. that day, huh?

2874
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I am so confident this will never happen that will this apply to the Tingle thing as well?

2875
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
What? You just extended the Tingle bet?

2876
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
No, no, no, no, no. It's a different bet.

2877
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It's a different bet altogether.

2878
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Hold on, hold on. Hit record, everybody. Hit record. Here we go.

2879
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
It's a different bet altogether.

2880
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Not only will he give you free copies of Wolfenstein, I will dress up like Tingle playing Madden. Or Wolfenstein, I guess, that would be appropriate.

2881
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
But it's never gonna happen. Never.

2882
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Tingle with the gun, speaking German.

2883
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So, if, I just want to clarify the terms of the bet, just in case, because you never know what might happen.

2884
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:54,000
So if Wolfenstein, the new Wolfenstein, should outsell Madden in the first month of release, you'll dress up as Tingle here on the show.

2885
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
If this gentleman has to reimburse all his customers, you too will dress up like Tingle here on the show.

2886
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Alright, but not, you will not set fire and Bobby Black will fire a judgement on it.

2887
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
No, that's just, that's a judgement, because...

2888
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
But instead, you will play Wolfenstein.

2889
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yes, and this isn't like we're adding the numbers of Wolfenstein to the millionth. No, that is not gonna happen.

2890
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Completely different bet, and you all wanted, you all wanted something to come back.

2891
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
You all wanted something where Loki would be willing to dress up as Tingle again, so here it is.

2892
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
It's not gonna happen. I only make bets that I'm confident in that I'm gonna win, so...

2893
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I mean, come on. Really? Something's gonna outsell Madden?

2894
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I know, from selling Madden, that that's not gonna fucking happen, so...

2895
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
But hey, let's hope for the wishful thinking there.

2896
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Hey, and the guys behind Wolfenstein thank you, because you just upped their sales by, you know, how many people listen to the show?

2897
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Two.

2898
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Oh yeah, two. There you go.

2899
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I mean, anyone with the same mind knows that there's no way, it's just like him, he knows there's no way that's gonna happen, but hey, it makes him look nice.

2900
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So there you go, you're just nice. You're offering the Tingle thing again.

2901
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
One of these days, man, you know, some day this show is gonna have to end. Some day.

2902
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And I hope before it's over we get you in a Tingle costume one way or another.

2903
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Nope, never gonna happen. Had to lose a bet, and unfortunately, uh...

2904
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
My judgement's not selling.

2905
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Alright, anyhow, we're being made anymore.

2906
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Let's move on to something else. Hey, maybe Loki could dress up as this. This is a little more manly. He could dress up as Pyramid Head or something out of Silent Hill.

2907
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Uh, hey, Silent Hill, actually we'll have a lot of people dressing up in the name of Silent Hill.

2908
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Apparently there's going to be an actual Silent Hill haunted house, or as they're calling it, a haunted attraction coming to South California, Southern California.

2909
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Orange County, to be specific. The OC is going to be getting this Silent Hill haunted house.

2910
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And, uh, yeah, I'm guessing that it's actually going to be like a haunted house that you walk through.

2911
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Apparently they did like a Saw one last year that was really scary based off the movie Saw, which, you know, you already know how we feel about that.

2912
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
But Silent Hill's cool. So, you know, they'll have probably people dressed up like the nurses, and they'll probably have a giant Pyramid Head.

2913
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Like, you could get raped by Pyramid Head IRL. That would be awesome. Sadly, this haunted house or whatever probably isn't going to be that awesome, but whatever.

2914
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
It might still be worth a look, especially if you're in the area. Hey, if you're in Southern California, you should probably go check this out.

2915
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Although it does sound like it's going to be a little bit pricey. I think I was looking at the website, and it was something like 20-something bucks. I don't remember. It was kind of expensive.

2916
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:36,000
That's about normal for, like, a haunted house. Like, the last haunted house we went to, which was... I'm going to bring up the site. It might make music, guys, because I think it makes music. Sorry, guys.

2917
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh, by the way, it's also the slowest loading site. Oh, that was weird. Ooh, it makes Silent Hill music. Ooh. Yeah, there's two mazes, and the other one's called Fear.

2918
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,000
This looks scary, Jamie. Are you sure you want to go? Not to Silent Hill. Single admission, $13.

2919
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:00,000
God, we are doing this. So, anyway, sorry. Sorry for the Silent Hill music, but it gives you a little ambience there.

2920
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:06,000
That would be fun, actually, to go down there and go to the haunted house and go to Disneyland. I think we might have to make that happen.

2921
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I had a Saw attraction one time. That was pretty cool. Yeah, that was a year ago, right? Yeah.

2922
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Yeah, but I'm not into Saw. You already know how I feel about Saw. Torture porn. Silent Hill, cool. Saw, torture porn.

2923
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Saw is too hard to figure out what's going on nowadays. It's like trying to figure out what's going on in Crank 2.

2924
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:26,000
It's a twist. And... Tigerclaw says if you guys go, you will need to record it on video. They won't let you.

2925
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
They probably won't let us in there with a video camera. Plus, I don't need... Hat cam!

2926
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I don't need me screaming like a girl out there on YouTube, because Jamie will be able to testify to this after.

2927
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Maybe she already can. I don't know. But I will scream like a girl in this attraction the minute I see something that is scary.

2928
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
You want to know how I won't be scared? How you can tell if I won't be scared? Huh. Because I won't be saying anything.

2929
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,000
You've been in scary situations with me, and you know what I do. I shut up. And I'm really quiet.

2930
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I will scream obscenities, even if there are children around. My voice will get even higher than it's ever gotten on the radio.

2931
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Yes, it will. Yeah, you've seen me on rides. Yes.

2932
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:08,000
You should just put a mic or turn on your phone to record just the audio, because that would be hilarious.

2933
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
We're getting requests from chatters wanting us to pick them up on the way to the haunted house.

2934
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
We should just tell people when we're going, and then we'll have like, we'll all go in together.

2935
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It'll be a big, because I know like, Jimmy, who used to do the show, what the hell was the show he did with John?

2936
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
STFU. That was the show they did. The one that's based off that sports show.

2937
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
He lives in OC. Like, they live in that area, so I know he would come.

2938
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:37,000
We should get a whole bunch of us to go, and I'll meet up, and then you can all hear me scream like a girl in person, laugh, ha ha ha.

2939
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And then we could at least film before and after. And then I'll be like, white as a ghost, and so forth.

2940
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Ospher in chat says, Rob, reciprocate that high voice, please.

2941
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I'm not going to do that here on the radio. I can't. Like, I legitimately cannot do the screaming like a little girl obscenities.

2942
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I'm going to do my imitation of scared Rob.

2943
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh, God.

2944
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Okay, let me take a breath. Get in character. Oh, my God.

2945
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
When have I ever said, oh, my God, y'all.

2946
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
You do that when you're teasing.

2947
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Oh, my God.

2948
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
You do that when you tease people.

2949
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Fine.

2950
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Oh, my God. That's Rob, by the way.

2951
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
He's pretty close, a little higher. Needs more swearing. Needs more swearing.

2952
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Well, I, you know, wasn't going to, but that's Rob. And, yeah, it is high enough to break glass.

2953
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,000
You know who else lives in L.A. that we should challenge to come to this with us?

2954
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Uh-oh.

2955
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Is our friends from All Games Interactive.

2956
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Oh.

2957
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Yeah, that's what we need to do. We need to get Lawrence. We need to get Scott.

2958
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
We need to get Jessica and all of them to come with us.

2959
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
And we should have, like, a scare off or something.

2960
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Becky says she'll come with us.

2961
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I'm, oh, this needs to happen now. This needs to happen.

2962
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Is anybody from All Games Interactive listening? Let's throw down. Let's have a scare off.

2963
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I don't know how a scare off works.

2964
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:09,000
You should have to hold a glass of water. And if you spill the glass of water.

2965
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I want to know why Oscar's thanking me.

2966
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I like this idea. I really like this idea.

2967
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Have to hold something that shows, or, like, hook something up to our body. The Wii Vitality Sensor.

2968
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Too bad it won't be out in time.

2969
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:32,000
God damn it. Just when I found a use for the Wii Vitality Sensor to see who gets more scared here, me or Jessica, right?

2970
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
The damn thing isn't going to be out in time.

2971
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Too bad they don't have...

2972
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I want to do it very drunk, Rob.

2973
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Do they have, like, a portable heart rate monitor or something like that?

2974
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yeah. They make those.

2975
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Do they?

2976
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Or, actually, the iPhone has an app that's a heart rate monitor where you just tap in time with your heartbeat.

2977
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
No, that wouldn't work.

2978
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Yeah.

2979
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I'm afraid...

2980
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Actual heart rate monitor is, like, 69 bucks a piece.

2981
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I'm afraid that I will be trying to contain my scary...

2982
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Like, I'll be trying to fight it because I'm very competitive.

2983
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Like, I am a very competitive person. I'll admit it.

2984
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
That, like, if I'm going against somebody from All Games Interactive in a scare-off or whatever,

2985
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:13,000
that I will somehow, like, between being actually scared and trying to, like, hold it in, like, I'm not going to scream, I'm not going to scream,

2986
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
that I will shit my pants in the middle of the haunted house.

2987
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You know, it should do.

2988
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
And I don't want that to happen.

2989
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
That's anonymous.

2990
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
You should have judges go with you.

2991
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Have three judges go one time with you and one time with her, and then rate the scare detection factor.

2992
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I don't know why I'm picking on Jessica.

2993
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I feel for some reason she's the easiest target of who's most likely to get scared from the All Games Interactive crew.

2994
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
But for all I know, Mary Young is the target, or Scott, for I don't know.

2995
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Okay, so who would you pick, then, to do in a least likely to be scared?

2996
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I need an All Games Interactive expert to tell me who is most likely to get scared at Silent Hill,

2997
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
because I have an experience that I can challenge to a scare-off.

2998
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Jessica's no longer a part of All Games.

2999
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Well, she was, though, right?

3000
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Well, who, then, would you think would be best off for a least likely to be scared?

3001
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
A what? And then a scare-off with you?

3002
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I don't know if it would be me that would be least likely to be scared.

3003
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Okay, the Tower of Terror scared the shit out of me.

3004
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But then again, I've also been in an elevator when it's fallen.

3005
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
The chat is suggesting Derek H. Does he even live in LA? I don't think he does.

3006
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Isn't he, like, in the Midwest or something? I don't know. I could be wrong.

3007
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
All right, anyhow.

3008
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Look, I'm going to stop picking on our friends at All Games Interactive and just, you know,

3009
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
we're just going to go to this and have fun.

3010
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
And if they want to come, hey, great.

3011
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But I'm down for going to this Silent Hill haunted house.

3012
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I love Silent Hill. It would be fun. Super fun.

3013
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And Silent Hill loves you for dinner.

3014
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Let's move on with some more stories.

3015
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
And then your phone call is coming up later this hour.

3016
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Well, this is a definite bit of not really a surprise, but it's sort of happy and not happy at the same time.

3017
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Sega doesn't have any plans to do anything to commemorate the Dreamcast launch,

3018
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
because Dreamcast launch happened 9-9-99, so they're not doing anything 9-9-09.

3019
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But they said unofficially that there should be some celebrations and some parties,

3020
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,000
things to mark, you know, such a momentous day in gaming.

3021
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:29,000
But that they don't really have any plans to celebrate the U.S. launch.

3022
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:39,000
However, there is some talk about putting up some of the potential digital downloads of Dreamcast games.

3023
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:45,000
It's just the limiting factor being how large they are right now.

3024
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Unfortunately, I think a lot of people aren't going to realize that they're going to have a 10th anniversary.

3025
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:57,000
To me, the Dreamcast right now is going to be like the Cabela's game during the Halo 3 launch.

3026
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Whereas the Dreamcast's anniversary is going to be the Cabela's game to the Beatles' catalog being re-released on the 9th.

3027
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
So a lot of people are going to think, Beatles? No Dreamcast.

3028
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
You know what? We need to do something on Wednesday.

3029
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
We need to come over here and play Dreamcast.

3030
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Because of the anniversary that day?

3031
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And record it.

3032
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
You know, it's a lot of Sega anniversaries this week. It's not just the Dreamcast, but the Genesis.

3033
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I mean, Bobby talked a lot about this on his show tonight, so go download that if you want to check it out.

3034
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
But the 20th anniversary of Genesis was this week too.

3035
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
And then, of course, Dreamcast is coming up very soon.

3036
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So it's just lots and lots of stuff.

3037
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I remember sitting in that line outside the damn mall and getting so bored that we went over and bought books at Barnes & Noble and came back and got in line.

3038
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,000
The launch of the Dreamcast was during the period where, believe it or not, I wasn't playing a lot of video games.

3039
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Like, the years I was living in Chico, kind of away at college, I kind of fell out of video gaming.

3040
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
My love of gaming for a while. So I kind of missed the launch of the Dreamcast.

3041
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:04,000
But in retrospect, I was able to, you know, kind of catch up on it and see just, like, how awesome of a system it was.

3042
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
This was back in the day when Dan and I were like, we're going to wait for the US system. We're going to wait. We're going to less import it.

3043
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
So we already were playing our Dreamcast for a while.

3044
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:20,000
We even did the Sonic Adventure rental where you could rent a Dreamcast and a special release of Sonic Adventure.

3045
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Nice. I'm kind of surprised, though, that Sega's not even at the bare minimum, like, releasing Crazy Taxi on Xbox Live Arcade or something.

3046
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
You know, like, you know how Sega loves to re-release their old nostalgia stuff.

3047
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
You know, give us a little something some Dreamcast love.

3048
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I mean, I guess, though, okay, now granted, before somebody in chat mentions it, which I'm sure they will, they do have the poll going on right now for the Genesis game that's going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade.

3049
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Did you guys hear about this? They're, like, doing a poll at, what is it, genesispoll.com or something like that to see what game should be the next one they release on Xbox Live Arcade.

3050
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:05,000
And I think right now Earthworm Jim is winning by a landslide, which is too bad, because, like, Wonder Boy and ToeJam and Earl and Revenge of Shinobi are all in that.

3051
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Revenge of Shinobi are all in that poll as well.

3052
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
It'd be nice if it actually load.

3053
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Did the whole thing not load?

3054
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
No.

3055
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
That's weird. You should see a poll in the middle there with the options of the game that would come out next.

3056
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
That's weird that it's not showing up for you. Show it up for me at home.

3057
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Maybe the poll's over? I don't know.

3058
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Maybe.

3059
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Weird.

3060
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
But Earthworm Jim was kicking all the other game's ass. That's the one that's going to win.

3061
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Yeah.

3062
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
So.

3063
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Earthworm Jim was actually a really good game.

3064
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:38,000
And I'm sure that they're probably all slated to come out. It's just, which one do we want to release first?

3065
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Exactly. I'm sure they're all being worked on right now.

3066
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Which is kind of cool, because, you know, it's nice to know we'll get all those games eventually, even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Genesis remakes on Xbox Live Arcade.

3067
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Although, oddly enough, I do love the Mega Collection, because I think the Mega Collection's a really, really good value.

3068
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:04,000
But I think the ones by themselves don't bring that much to the table outside of achievements and, you know, just being a rehashed version of the old game.

3069
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But, heck, same thing as Virtual Console, I guess.

3070
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
If we want to put it that way.

3071
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Alright, so too bad that we won't see more Dreamcast 11 on September 9th of 2009, but I guess it was just ahead of its time.

3072
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I don't know what else to chalk it up to.

3073
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Let's move on with some more news.

3074
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Alright. Well, we talked a little bit before about Guitar Hero 5 and the free game.

3075
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Well, now you can do some song imports into it as well.

3076
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Kind of a feature that, you know, Rock Band 2 started off with.

3077
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:45,000
But now it's nice, at least, Guitar Hero 5 will allow you to import your tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.

3078
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:52,000
And, apparently, Guitar Hero Smash Hits as well.

3079
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I guess the newer games now are coming with a code in the manual that basically has...

3080
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:09,000
It's like a code in the back of the manual that's individual to each game that you can basically plug in to get, you know, your, I guess, authorization to download them.

3081
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
For costs, of course, just like Rock Band was five bucks.

3082
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
No pricing, though, has been announced yet for it.

3083
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:23,000
But the options, though, for PS3 and Xbox 360, you can download the whole lump of songs, or you can pick and choose which ones you want.

3084
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:38,000
And, apparently, most of the tracks will be available, including, I guess, 152 of the 158 tracks that are available right now for download content for Guitar Hero World Tour will be compatible with Guitar Hero 5.

3085
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:47,000
The other cool thing, though, is, apparently, Band Hero also will be backwards compatible with these other games as well.

3086
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So, that's kind of cool. No word, though, on if you can import the Band Hero songs into Guitar Hero 5 or vice versa.

3087
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Isn't, literally, Band Hero just a different skinned version of Guitar Hero 5, though?

3088
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Yes.

3089
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Like, literally?

3090
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Literally, it is.

3091
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Just different skinned version with different songs?

3092
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:08,000
And it's different track lists. It's more geared towards kids, supposedly, but it's just basically...

3093
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
In other words, I like it more.

3094
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
It's another excuse to put out, you know, another version of the game.

3095
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:20,000
It's another thing that they can go, hey, look, you know, Guitar Hero's out selling Rock Band, like, ten times over.

3096
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Yeah, because you're releasing ten times more games, stupid!

3097
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I don't know. It's just, it's getting ridiculous now.

3098
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Thankfully, I think a lot of people are seeing that, and they've figured out, hey, you know what? I don't want to buy all these games.

3099
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,000
And, you know, before I used to pick up some of the Guitar Hero games, even though I didn't really play them.

3100
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Not anymore. I'm not really touching them, because I do realize that they're just all stuff that could be available for, you know...

3101
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
They're download content. They only have a few tracks to come out each month.

3102
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Rock Band has a few tracks to come out each week.

3103
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
And it's a real bummer. It's a real bummer that my Xbox died when it did.

3104
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Because I had just downloaded Janus Joplin, Piece of My Heart, which I was so looking forward to playing.

3105
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
And the Gorillaz Pack, too. And never got to play them, because of my Xbox dying.

3106
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,000
But anyhow, you know what, though? Loki, I actually think I'm going to pick up Guitar Hero 5.

3107
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Because the song list looks pretty awesome.

3108
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
And I skipped World Tour, though. I didn't buy World Tour, ever.

3109
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I probably will get Guitar Hero World 5. At least the game by itself.

3110
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I probably won't get the whole... I don't need the drums and all that bullshit.

3111
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
And you know what you can do? Pro tip here?

3112
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Just go rent World Tour and get the code from the back, and hopefully no one else has thought of that.

3113
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Hopefully. Hopefully.

3114
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Eh, it's a big deal. I'm sure the game will come down in price, big time, used at some point.

3115
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Well, then again, I won't be able to get the code, huh?

3116
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Well, no. If it's used, you may still will, too.

3117
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Because the codes really don't mean anything right now. They aren't used for anything.

3118
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So if you do happen to find it used, you can still use it.

3119
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
You know, there's still probably kind of price to use.

3120
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,000
And I don't know if I... I don't think there were any songs in World Tour I wanted that badly.

3121
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
And then the other thing, too...

3122
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Rock Band 2 right now is $99 for the bundle. Which is not bad, I mean, if you haven't picked up.

3123
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Okay, that's a funny thing right here.

3124
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
There's the Beatles Rock Band bundle that they have right now.

3125
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
We found out that the title's going to be heavily allocated, which means they're only going to release limited quantities to distributors.

3126
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
And, you know, retail stores are probably going to get them.

3127
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Because they're going to be really hard to find, basically.

3128
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:40,000
It's actually cheaper to buy Rock Band 2, the bundle, and then buy Beatles Rock Band the game only.

3129
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
You'll literally save almost $100 and you'll get two games instead of one.

3130
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I mean, if it's that important that your instruments look like the Beatles' instruments...

3131
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I mean, we're talking a plastic guitar here...

3132
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
If it's really... is it $100 important?

3133
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I mean, seriously, if you really want to spend the extra $100, you can buy another guitar that looks...

3134
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
You know, one of the two separate guitars that they have available as well.

3135
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:12,000
But, I mean, seriously, if you're just holding out for that bundle, just buy Rock Band 2 and then get the other game.

3136
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
But aren't they going to phase out the Rock Band 2 bundles eventually?

3137
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Probably not, because not everyone's going to want Beatles Rock Band.

3138
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I'm sure Rock Band 2 will be around for a while until Rock Band 3.

3139
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Probably Rock Band 3 will be coming out probably next year.

3140
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
So they'll probably keep Rock Band 2 around until 3 comes out.

3141
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I wonder what 3 will do that really ups the ante.

3142
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Probably offer the same stuff that they did in Beatles Rock Band, like the 3-part harmonies.

3143
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Maybe some sort of... I don't really know.

3144
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I'm hoping, though, it at least does the whole thing where your Rock Band 1 and Rock Band 2 library can be exported,

3145
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
and you're just going to have this gigantic jukebox of songs available.

3146
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Definitely. I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.

3147
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:04,000
The only thing that they may have is obviously the older songs won't support the 3-part harmonies, but who cares?

3148
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
You don't need to have that.

3149
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
And they could always maybe patch it in.

3150
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Yeah, I doubt they'll do it, but they could.

3151
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
They could.

3152
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Probably the songs they release going forward will all have that.

3153
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:20,000
And who knows, if they know that that's coming, maybe some of the songs that come out over the next year are going to secretly have it in there.

3154
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I would think, but maybe not. I don't know.

3155
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Maybe?

3156
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Did you talk about Roadie Battle?

3157
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
No, not yet.

3158
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:38,000
What's kind of neat, though, with the Wii version, they're actually doing something called Roadie Battle, which, surprisingly enough, is actually something innovative.

3159
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,000
What it's going to be is it's a mode that you use with your DS.

3160
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Basically, you need two DSs to do this, I guess, if you're playing with two humans using the DS.

3161
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And then the other two people will play a versus battle on Guitar Hero and on the Wii.

3162
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And so during that time, you have little mini-games that you play on the DS.

3163
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Like, for example, you're sabotaging the other player, so you unscrew the amp.

3164
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:12,000
So you actually make the little motions like you're screwing in something, and basically that will screw up the other person.

3165
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Or they'll have one where you have to reset the soundboard.

3166
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And so they have little marks where the sliders need to be, and you have to slide your stylus to move the sliders.

3167
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I think that's kind of cool.

3168
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:31,000
And I think that would be kind of cool as a standalone multiplayer game or something like that on the Wii for Guitar Hero 5.

3169
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Just say you want to play a little mini-game or something like that. Different. That would be kind of neat.

3170
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I guess any new future is kind of cool, I guess, if nothing else.

3171
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:46,000
If you don't have two people, you know, you don't have two DSs or something like that, you can actually play against a computer.

3172
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
But it's neat.

3173
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
All right. Very cool.

3174
02:09:50,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Hey, a lot of things that, or I should say, a lot of complaints have been made about the Xbox 360's friends list and the fact that it's limited to basically 100 friends.

3175
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Well, and people are wondering, why doesn't Xbox just up the friends list?

3176
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
And, you know, honestly, guys, it's not as easy as just flipping a switch, you know.

3177
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Probably this is, you know, takes a lot of work on the server ends and so forth.

3178
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
You know, if things were built a certain way, then they're kind of stuck that way.

3179
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But apparently, a lot of this dates back to Halo 2.

3180
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Apparently, original Xbox games were coded to be limited to 100 friends, and that limit was brought into the current generation.

3181
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And this has to do with a report from G4, I guess, talked to a high level Microsoft source.

3182
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,000
The real reason why they cannot up the friends list is because more people are still playing Halo 2.

3183
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
So if you want the friends list to be upped, Halo 2 has to go away, I guess.

3184
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Or they're going to have to make some major fixes to Halo 2. I don't know if they can really do that.

3185
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,000
So it's probably going to take a long time for that limit to go away.

3186
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But really, I mean, I've found myself struggling with the 100 friend limit.

3187
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But at the same time, I just kind of will remove people I've never talked to since the day they add me or never have played a game with or what have you.

3188
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And that seems to work okay.

3189
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I just remove people after they've been offline for like 30 days.

3190
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Yeah, then you kind of figure they're not coming back.

3191
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
And if they do, it's no big deal.

3192
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Or, you know, obviously if it's my friends or something like that that I know in real life, you know, I won't take them off there.

3193
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,000
But, you know, for the most part, I will take people that are not on there for 30 days.

3194
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And the thought is maybe some folks will get off of Halo 2 once Halo 3 ODST comes out in September.

3195
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
But you know what? I don't know. I think there's always going to be some people playing Halo 2.

3196
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,000
When they pull the plug on Halo 2 someday, there are going to be some pissed off gamers.

3197
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
But the question is, you know, how many are they willing to risk pissing off to do it?

3198
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Or why can't they just like, I don't know, limit your friends list to show just the first 100 in Halo 2 and then just have it later, you know, more later or something like that.

3199
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Just limit it to the first 100.

3200
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Alright. Well, let's get into the mailbag.

3201
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

3202
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:15,000
And the lovely DarkSakura opens up the email bag and dives in and picks a few of her favorite emails to read here on the program.

3203
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:21,000
So, who's emailed us this week? mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. DarkSakura.

3204
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:29,000
We have one from Mark who says, I'm a new fan of your show and I added your video game talk show to my podcast to my Yahoo RSS feed so I can hear you all the time.

3205
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Now, what are all your PlayStation 3 PSN names?

3206
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I don't have one because I don't play on it.

3207
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Wouldn't that buy me a game of your favorite PS3 games?

3208
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
What? No, your PSN name.

3209
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Oh, PSN name? Um, Green Sky but IE instead of Y.

3210
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Loki, OLR, caps. I can't remember if there's a space though in between Loki and OLR.

3211
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Mine's all one word, all lowercase.

3212
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Mine's, I think on the PlayStation Network, he caps spaces. So, maybe you can.

3213
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I think, I don't remember. It's in the forums. Go look in the forums.

3214
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Next email. Oh, it's by the same person.

3215
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Well, I'm not going to read one by the same person twice.

3216
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Well, I don't know.

3217
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Read it at the end.

3218
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Well, I'm actually closing it right now.

3219
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
This one comes from Redertainment.

3220
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Hi, I'm a resident of Utah and frequent the Best Buy store where the pilot program that was discussed last week is taking place.

3221
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I didn't ask the manager about it under the guise of doing a story for a gaming site.

3222
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:42,000
What I learned is that they are taking the trade in values from the Gamestop website.

3223
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Also, not all the games are subject to this program, just ones that are out of print and are hard to sell.

3224
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I couldn't get any other details as I am not an employee.

3225
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Also, Super Mormon Brothers, really? Come on, you can come up with better.

3226
02:13:53,000 --> 02:14:05,000
For instance, Grand Theft Auto, LDS and City, Sim Missionary, DDR Mormon, Tabernacle Choir Mix, and Are You Smarter Than a Member of the Quorum of the Seventy?

3227
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
That's all I have.

3228
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Staycare? Redertainment.

3229
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:16,000
This message brought to you by the Utah State Legislature where racism, classism, and homophobia are not just encouraged, it's rewarded.

3230
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,000
That is so funny that we actually did have a listener in that town that we were talking about last week's show. That's great.

3231
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
This is from Robert M.

3232
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Interesting you mentioned Johnny Cash in Guitar Hero 5.

3233
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I love the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, Lisa 1 and 2, especially the soundtracks of those games.

3234
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
It seems to lose focus creatively and musically with Underground and Underground 2.

3235
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:39,000
The later of which containing such random artists as Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and, yes, Cash.

3236
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I can accept such an eclectic variety of artists in a music slash rhythm game more readily than in a skating game, though.

3237
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I'm not sure how I feel about the character model in 5 yet, excuse me, nor have I made up my mind about Hendrix being in World Tour.

3238
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
We just had commentary from Shermy.

3239
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:06,000
To play freaking morons advocate, I get the feeling that Mr. Kotick meant to say that he felt retail costs, I think we discussed this,

3240
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:12,000
may need to increase as project budgets marketing increase. Of course, if that's what you mean, say that.

3241
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:23,000
In an ideal world, which this isn't, Bobby wouldn't trip over a scorpion and fall into an alligator pit and be replaced with Gary Kitchens and or David Crane after a merger with their company Skyworks Technologies.

3242
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Moving forward. Yes, I'm reading at rapid speed.

3243
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
This is from Jeff.

3244
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Hi Jeff.

3245
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Hey guys, I'm a new listener, love your show. I wanted to know if all of your episodes can be downloaded off iTunes or only a certain amount.

3246
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Also, my condolences to Loki and his wife for their loss. I also wanted to know if any of you are looking forward to Uncharted 2 or Ratchet and Clank.

3247
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Uncharted 2, in my opinion, is going to be a big seller for the PS3.

3248
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
The PS3 is coming into its own finally. Big name titles coming their way for the system. Thanks guys and keep up the great podcast.

3249
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I've heard good things about Uncharted 2. I haven't checked it out myself. I need to get the demo for it, which I will probably do now that I'm Xbox-less for a little while until I figure out what I'm going to do to replace that.

3250
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:10,000
What was the first part of that? Something about iTunes. Oh, only the last 10 episodes are available on iTunes.

3251
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:25,000
OLR PSP.com, you can get the last 20. It's the one site where it goes back a little further, but unfortunately we don't really offer any further back than that. I do know some OLR listeners have scrounged up old episodes.

3252
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Just because of server load and space, every show is 90 megabytes. It's a huge amount of bandwidth, so we can't offer every show. We have a bunch of listeners who have old shows and there's this OLR archive.

3253
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I tried to go to it today, though, and I got a bunch of spam, so I don't know if the link is no longer good, but apparently they dug up the old, old episodes. Episode 1 even, I think. I don't know if folks in the chat room can confirm it tonight.

3254
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Did you find all the old stuff? I think that's the old ones. Did you put it? I haven't burned them yet.

3255
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Somebody said season 1 is on the OLR archive now, but you have to remember, just remember, if you're going to go back and download episode 1, episode 2, it was a totally different show 7 years ago.

3256
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:25,000
We grew. It was less mature. Totally different. Just warning you. And I had a migraine the whole first episode, just warning everyone. And then I think that was, wasn't that when I went to go sleep in the Harry Potter room?

3257
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:42,000
That was later, I think. That was later, yeah. I slept in a little bed under the stairs. Jason and Raichan found the old episodes. They had them somehow. I must have burned them off for Raichan when I sent her the ferret years ago. I bet I did. How funny.

3258
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:55,000
So, moving forward now. And actually, this is one of those weeks where I've actually had to pick different emails because we've got so many. So, if your emails aren't getting read, I'm sorry. It's just we really do have to move through here.

3259
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Shook here, or is it Shookay? I don't know. Lately, I've been thinking about getting Final Fantasy X on PS2 for my 13th birthday on October 17th. The thing is, my old man, who's just about as heartless as a grizzled non-vet, won't let me get what he calls quote pussy jab stuff. End quote. Ew.

3260
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:24,000
That's not racist at all. No, not at all. Could you give me some advice as to coercing him into letting me get it? It'd be much appreciated. Tell him it's localized for American audiences.

3261
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:39,000
That's about it. Or do what I used to do in sneak. Buy it yourself. It's Final Fantasy X for the PS2? Yeah. Dude, that's like 20 bucks now. You can do it. Sell back some old games to GameStop and just buy the game yourself.

3262
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:50,000
And, dude, Final Fantasy X had Blitzball. That's pretty hardcore. And thank you for being a lot more open-minded than your father. No insult's intended towards your father, but he sounds bigoted.

3263
02:18:50,000 --> 02:19:01,000
He sounds like an asshole and complete ill-will meant towards your father. Sorry. Ill-will meant. I mean, I don't like to insult people's parents. Yeah, I know.

3264
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Because even though our parents may be, you know, my dad is fairly racist and thick-headed, but I still love my dad. Well, when my mom and dad say stupid shit, I call them on it.

3265
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But that's just the way we are in our family, you know? They call me on stuff, I call them on stuff. So, what can you do? Is Shermie smelling the microphone? I'm trying to get her to say something. No.

3266
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Oh, you almost strangled poor Shermie. Poor Shermie. Go sit on Dan's desk. She likes people, she just is nervous, okay?

3267
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Yeah, tell your dad, you know, to get with the times. Ooh, this one's for me from Cheeseburger.

3268
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Jamie, what's a good starter pinball machine for under $1,000? Oh, and post more videos on YouTube, they're great. Just for the record, T-H-E-R-E is for location. T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E is what you intended.

3269
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Good pinball tables under $1,000. Good look on eBay and Craigslist, seriously. You're gonna pick up a beater, just so that you know, typically for that low.

3270
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But you can, it's a good way to get started, you know. If you pick up a beater machine that needs a little bit of work, and start putting the work into it yourself, you can trade it later on for other tables for things that you want better.

3271
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Yeah, those are really, also, there's a, Dan's not here for me to get the name of it from him, but there's a Sacramento Pinball Group actually puts up a purchase stuff every so often, and that's a group that my husband's a part of.

3272
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:51,000
But eBay and Craigslist, really, you just need to make sure that you look for, you know, everything works, or, you know, if there's a problem with it, don't make sure there's no, like, board problems.

3273
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:03,000
You know, something that you're gonna have to instantly get into soldering up a board together, you know. Playfield, you know, if you see cabinet damage, playfield damage, at least make sure that it's in good working condition before you get it.

3274
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Cabinet damage and playfield damage can be repaired. And if they can't, let you just buy a new one later on.

3275
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
So, last email?

3276
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Okay.

3277
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:29,000
From Geekboi2424, Hey guys, with the summer of Arcade coming to an end, and Rob's obsession with Super Metroid, I wanted to know if you're interested in Shadow Complex. What makes it look good to you, or makes it look bad? Thanks for the opinions, and I love the show. Logan, aka Geekboi2424.

3278
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I have to be honest, I don't know much about the game, and especially because my Xbox 360 fried this week, I don't think I'll be getting this anytime soon, but I love the idea of a game influenced by Super Metroid, and I'm all about that.

3279
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:55,000
You know, I'll check it out, at least the demo, just based on that alone. Just the fact that it's that whole exploration and power-ups, and I just love that kind of design. You know I love my Super Metroid, and I just love the design of that game. I loved Castlevania, too.

3280
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:01,000
The Symphony of the Night, of course. So, I'm all about at least checking it out, if nothing else.

3281
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Alright.

3282
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Sounds good to me.

3283
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Get your mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us more emails to read in the future. In the meantime, it's time to get into our FUs of the week. Thankfully, there wasn't a lot of stupidity out there on the internet last week, at least we didn't find any, so we don't really have anything to dedicate this week's FUs to. Oh, except for the fact that my Xbox 360 fried itself.

3284
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:44,000
My FU goes to how much my hand hurts and the freaking suture that was left in it. The end.

3285
02:22:44,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Lucky. FU goes to all the drinks that I just had because I feel really full, and also to the guy that's on the Neo Geo forums that's selling all the candy cabinets that won't get back to me. I know a lot of people are antsy because they're waiting here back for them, and I want to put back my deposit to guarantee my cabinet. That's it.

3286
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I don't know. I don't really have a lot of FUs. FUs to the fact that I nap too much. That's my FU this week. FU to napping. Although, actually napping is awesome. I shouldn't say FU to it because it's really cool, actually. I just do it too much. That's the problem.

3287
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I like naps.

3288
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Naps are cool. Unless you nap all the time like me. Alright, just a couple more stories, and then we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. But we have a few more stories before we get to that. So, Loki.

3289
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Are you a girl and a gamer who wishes that there were more girl gamer perspectives for you? Yes, yes I am. Well, you're in luck because now there's the Gamers Girl, which is a brand new blog that you can find at thegamersgirl.blogspot.com, and it's a website geared towards women who are dating gamers.

3290
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:15,000
And they have interesting little articles. One of them that they're highlighting, of course, is the Gamer Widow. Basically, a woman that has lost their boyfriend to gaming.

3291
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:31,000
They offer tips for gamers to keep their significant other from resenting or interrupting their game time needlessly. Like, for example, setting aside a half an hour right when you get home from work to lavish affection on your partner before you switch on the 360.

3292
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:52,000
And I gotta tell you, from my own experience, that does work. So, you might want to follow that advice. But yes, it's neat, I guess. I also found out from a spam ad that popped up on Go Nintendo the other day that there's actually a gamer and geek dating site.

3293
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Geek to geek? I've seen sites like that before. I don't think that was the particular one I'd seen before. It's like GK to GK? Yeah, there's some of those out there.

3294
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Well, there's some for everybody, I guess. Yep. Alright, hey, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna go to the Skype line, and this story has to do with something that women and men and everybody can bond over.

3295
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Pokemons! Let me show you them. There are some new Pokemans games coming out this spring. The Heart Gold version and the Soul Silver version.

3296
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And what these are, these are remakes of Pokemon Gold and Silver, and they'll now be on the DS. So, yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know, right? They're coming out Spring 2010.

3297
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Let's see, what is the little quote here? Announcing these much anticipated game launches at the Pokemon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokemon.

3298
02:25:50,000 --> 02:26:01,000
We want to thank these loyal fans by revealing the details to them first, but of course now we all know. That quote, by the way, from JC Smith, the Pokemon Company International's Director of Marketing.

3299
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:14,000
So, there you go, remakes coming for the DS. As far as what features and so forth on them, don't know yet, but there's a trailer out there, and it looks like it does have Wi-Fi battling going on on it, so that's kind of cool, I guess.

3300
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I actually had, um, was it Gold and Silver I had? No, the last one I think I had was Ruby. I think it was the last one I had. It was an advanced game.

3301
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
But I'm kind of, I'm kind of not into Pokemon anymore. You don't want to show people your Pokemans? Not anymore. I'm not as into them as I used to be.

3302
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I think I remember you playing that, or maybe it was Shane playing that on the Game Boy Advance thing for the GameCube.

3303
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I was playing Ruby on that one for a while. I think I had Ruby and he had Sapphire and we were doing the training thing for a little bit.

3304
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I was playing Pearl for a while when I would go to the gym and play Pokemans.

3305
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I don't know, Pokemon's just so repetitive to me. That's my problem with it. It just got too repetitive.

3306
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:03,000
You know what, nothing will ever top Pokemon Snap in terms of coolness.

3307
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Awesome. I love Pokemon Snap. I still play that on Virtual Console once in a great while, but it happens.

3308
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Hey, how about that Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We're going to go ahead and open it up and take your calls.

3309
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:22,000
While we wait for your calls, how about some last minute stories? Do we have any last minute stories tonight, Loki?

3310
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Yes, RedBox is test marketing video game rentals in their kiosk for $2 a night. They're testing this right now in their Reno, Nevada market.

3311
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Okay, we got a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3312
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Hey, it's Ranma. What's going on, everyone?

3313
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,000
You always seem to get through, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?

3314
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Not too much. Once again, I take another one for the team. I went out, I dropped $5 on Rock Revolution.

3315
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I heard about this insane price drop for Rock Revolution, that it was coming way down in price, so you actually picked this up, huh?

3316
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Yes, actually it was retailing for $16.99 at most places. It's a place right across from my job price match GameStop for me, which was pretty cool.

3317
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Nice. So, uh, well?

3318
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,000
If I paid more than $5.99, I mean $4.99, I would have thrown it across the room.

3319
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Well, since you only paid $5, doesn't that make it eligible to be thrown across the room?

3320
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:31,000
The fact that it has twisted scissors, we're not going to take it. It slides because of that. Any song, any game that has that song works for me.

3321
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Wait, isn't that a cover?

3322
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Yeah, aren't they all bad covers?

3323
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I don't care. It's still awesome.

3324
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:51,000
So, I mean, but how's the game itself? I mean, how's the interface? How does it run? I mean, are we just picking on Rock Revolution because it's, you know, the bastard child of music games, or what's the reason to really hate this game?

3325
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Because it's nothing more than, like, Guitar Freak's Drum Mania hyped up on some really bad coke and steroids.

3326
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
How so?

3327
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Okay, first off, when playing with the drums, I keep forgetting that there is an actual cymbal for the foot pedal instead of the lines. I keep forgetting about that.

3328
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Overall, the game plays where three songs, your song goes, the album goes gold. If you complete five songs, the album goes platinum.

3329
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And there are options, one of the objectives is, where you play one of the songs, it goes up in three levels of difficulty as you're playing, but it tells you on the screen what level you're at.

3330
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And another one is where you practice a certain part of the song, and you have to play it back fully memorized.

3331
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
That is kind of weird.

3332
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Well, after two albums, you get the pick of an arena, no, they give you an arena, you pick three songs and you play it right through, which is not so bad.

3333
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Wow, but having to play them from memory, that's kind of dumb.

3334
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I know it is, but it's only for like, not the whole song, it's maybe like 30 seconds of the song. It goes through with you twice, and then it goes over again from memory.

3335
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I guess that's not terrible.

3336
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
That's not so bad.

3337
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I don't know, I actually am thinking of trying to find this game and pick it up. I mean, it's only $5. I mean, whatever, I've spent more than that on crappy Xbox Live arcade games.

3338
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I think that describes most of us.

3339
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:30,000
AJ Mixon Chat says, if you're going to buy Rock Revolution for $5 just for the Bomani Pack, stop. Do not.

3340
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Believe it or not, much as I enjoy playing drums, I am more really curious about going on eBay and getting the drum kit, because I Best Buy has an outlet store on eBay, and the auction starts at like $30.

3341
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Unfortunately, it comes with the game, so knowing me, I buy the drum kit and just give the game away to somebody.

3342
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Can't you still get the drums for Rock Revolution somewhere? And keep in mind, they're not compatible with anything. Aren't the drums in Rock Revolution not compatible with any of the other games?

3343
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Pretty much, yeah.

3344
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I do, active have me worried saying that, oh, the Rock Band drums don't work with the game.

3345
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:14,000
You know what, look on Harmonix, we talked about this last week, Harmonix's website has a compatibility chart that includes Rock Band, and it will tell you right there, so take a look.

3346
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Works for me.

3347
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

3348
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Um, no, not all fan.

3349
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Alright. Have a good one, Raman, thanks for calling.

3350
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
No problem. Later.

3351
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:33,000
GameGuru says, Rock Revolution is like a train wreck, you can't look away. That comment, of course, with all our other chat comments at chat.orangelandsradio.com.

3352
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Rock Revolution, the Yaris of music games.

3353
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Aw, that was sad. I almost feel kind of bad for it.

3354
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:55,000
No, I don't. I don't feel bad, because they had their opportunity, for like years they had their opportunity, but they decided, you know what, we're just going to license the rights to our guitar peripherals or whatever, we're going to license those for the guitar hero arcade game.

3355
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:58,000
And they only embarrassed themselves at E3 a few years ago, didn't they?

3356
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Yes.

3357
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lands Radio, who's this?

3358
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
This is DS Master 25.

3359
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Hi, DS Master 25, what's on your mind?

3360
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Uh, not much, just you guys talking Rock Revolution, um, I've actually, I've had the ROM for like, probably about two days now.

3361
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:23,000
You're not supposed to tell people we have ROMs.

3362
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:35,000
This is translated, and it's really crappy on DS, other than it has one part of the game that is missing from the console versions.

3363
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
What's that?

3364
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
The singing.

3365
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
That's right, the console versions don't even have the singing, because they're covers, huh, so they can't really match up.

3366
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:50,000
But yeah, you, uh, you, now I can't think of a lot of DS games where you do that, you actually sing in the microphone, right?

3367
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Yeah, it has the pitch bars, you know how Karaoke Revolution works, right?

3368
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Yeah.

3369
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Basically, it's that interface, so it's a little bit iffy, unless you have the DS headset, then you're fine, so don't use the mic on the DS.

3370
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I see.

3371
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Well, here's my question about it, and this is the will it blend question of gaming, because you know, you can always ask, but will it blend?

3372
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Here's my question, but is it fun?

3373
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Uh, this thing, part in drumming, was about as fun as it got. The bass, I saw it first, because I had the Guitar Hero peripheral for the DS.

3374
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:47,000
So I figured, oh, they might have something, you know, along the lines of Guitar Freaks, when you're getting this sort of spiel, so I plugged it in expecting, you know, like the down, the upward note chart going on, but that wasn't the case, it was just like strum up, strum down, strum up, strum down.

3375
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Same thing for the bass, but with the four strings. It's stupid.

3376
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:58,000
So, basically, to sum it up, it's about as fun as dark grey notes on a black background.

3377
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Have you heard, though, Konami's not giving up?

3378
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Pretty much.

3379
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Guitar Freaks has a new version coming out in Japan, and apparently now they've finally caught on to the five fret thing, they're going to go up to five frets.

3380
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I do not like that idea. What the, ugh.

3381
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:28,000
You know what's funny? Do you remember this? Do you remember this years ago? Years and years ago, do you remember when Red Octane, before Guitar Hero came out, their business was making money off of peripherals for Konami games.

3382
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:40,000
They actually released a controller, like, seven, six, five, I don't remember, five, six years ago, before Guitar Hero was out, they released a controller for Guitar Freaks with five buttons on it.

3383
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:51,000
And everybody always asked, why the hell are there five buttons on this controller? Oh, there must be a new Guitar Freaks game coming out with five buttons, and then it turns out, well, it was a precursor to them putting out Guitar Hero.

3384
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Probably the fact, probably Konami's not revitalizing their series kind of probably drove Red Octane to do it themselves, and ended up being very successful with it.

3385
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Yeah, but I could not, see, but I was a Guitar Freaks player before I played Guitar Hero, and my uncle kept telling me, like, start going up on medium, use that fourth and fifth button.

3386
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I'm like, I can't, I'm too used to the three button pressing system that was on Guitar Freaks, I'm so used to the Japanese guitar game.

3387
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:34,000
It takes time, you just practice and it takes time. Four isn't as hard to do, because you can do four without really moving your hand, it's five that gets tricky because you have to learn how to move your hand back and forth.

3388
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:44,000
That's when it gets really hard, but four, most Guitar Freaks players can do four pretty easy because it's still one hand, you just have to get your pinky, you have to do pinky exercises every day, and you'll get better.

3389
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:56,000
See, and actually get this, my school, for fundraisers for the music program, they've been having Guitar Hero tournaments all these years, and actually they finally had a rock band last year.

3390
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Now it's just a matter of time before they, because with DJ Hero coming out, do you think, I think you guys might have heard this before, but it still makes me think, because I've been working on this whole mod with Disney rock songs on Guitar Freaks, kind of like how people have been modding Guitar Hero tracks for a while.

3391
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I've been doing it with Guitar Freaks, but now it's all Disney stuff because they haven't done a Disney Guitar Freaks for Drummania, so basically, why haven't they done Disney with anything else other than DDR and Poppin?

3392
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Don't give them ideas, because Disney has their own studio, Disney has their own gaming studio, and for whatever reason, well because DDR is Konami's thing, Disney can't really rip it off for themselves, but Konami, as you can see, does not have the locks on guitar games, so if Disney wants to do their own guitar game, they will. That's probably the reason behind it.

3393
02:36:50,000 --> 02:37:13,000
But here's one thing I kind of figure, around the lines, no one helped operate the Jonas Brothers that are just speaking Disney. I was actually at a Demi concert, and there was this supposed preview coming up with the Jonas Brothers talking Guitar Hero, and possibly an expansion pack for them.

3394
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I could see that happening, and well, you look at the way that Gabe stopped, instead of teenage boys, you're going to be seeing tween girls in one line.

3395
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:31,000
As Kevin Smith says, in six years, those girls will be 18.

3396
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Alright, DS Master, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, alright?

3397
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Alright, just one last question.

3398
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Do you think, especially with DJ Hero and Scratch coming out, do you ever think there's ever going to be a revitalization for Beatmania, period?

3399
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Sadly, the closest you're going to get is these knockoff games coming out. Not the DJ Hero, but the other one, the Scratch Ultimate DJ.

3400
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Scratch is as close to Beatmania as you're going to get, and it is pretty damn close to Beatmania.

3401
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Konami just doesn't care about Bomani anymore, and a lot of that has to do with the closure of their Northern California office. Sorry to say.

3402
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Which sucks.

3403
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
It does suck, but there's not a lot we can do.

3404
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Alright, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.

3405
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Peace out, and keep the shows rocking.

3406
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
We'll try.

3407
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:26,000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call, try to get through here on the line.

3408
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
We'll probably take maybe one more call, and then we'll probably be done here.

3409
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,000
DarkTit2, you want to remind us that 2DX17 is coming out.

3410
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Oh, right there.

3411
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Jesus Christ, I didn't even say hello.

3412
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Let me guess, this Legend of Zaku.

3413
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Of course, how would you have guessed?

3414
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Did you, because you cut me off, did you know that they are releasing an Atari Lynx game named after you?

3415
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Really?

3416
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Yes.

3417
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Oh wow.

3418
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I'm not kidding, there's an Atari Lynx game coming out called Zaku. Check it out.

3419
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Better not be, better not rip off a Gundam or anything like that.

3420
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Well, the only thing I'm going to warn you is that Zaku is a chick, so somehow something got misinterpreted, so you'll have to go take it up with them.

3421
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Whatever, anyways, something just came up to my attention recently.

3422
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:24,000
I don't know if you noticed, but apparently Sega is pulling the plug on the ChromaHounds 360 servers.

3423
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:38,000
In other words, the $50 that we pay for Xbox Live every year isn't really helping us, isn't really keeping the servers on for an unlimited amount of time.

3424
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:46,000
In other words, we're paying $50 and yet our servers are more likely not going to, they don't look like they're going to be safe.

3425
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Because if Sega could pull the plug on that, what's going to stop other companies from doing the same thing?

3426
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Is this really news, though? Because I thought, at least on the original Xbox, that servers were being shut down for the old sports games.

3427
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Am I correct or am I wrong on that?

3428
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,000
No, they were.

3429
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:07,000
So this has happened before, it's just I think this is the first time we've heard of this happening on the Xbox 360.

3430
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:17,000
And the fact that it's a non-sports title that, you know, ages, you know, the ages gets old and replaced with a new sports title, you know, that both kind of plays into it, too.

3431
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I mean, it sucks, but it's also kind of not the first time.

3432
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:27,000
But I mean, I understand your point, you know, what are we paying $50 for if it's not for the maintenance of these servers?

3433
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I mean, I don't get it that we're paying that much money and we're getting, you know, the fact of the matter is this, just getting shafted for, I don't know, I guess it's because it has the, you know, the potential to set precedent.

3434
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:51,000
And Sega could do it that anyone else has the potential to just say, oh, we'll pull the plug on the server, even though you're paying $50 a year.

3435
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:55,000
I can understand them pulling the plug on the server if literally no one is using it.

3436
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I mean, even if it's just a handful of people, I mean, are there listeners?

3437
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I mean, honestly, I want an honest poll of the listeners.

3438
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Is anyone still playing ChromeHounds online at least once a week?

3439
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I mean, I don't know, you know, and again, I understand what you're saying about precedent and all that stuff.

3440
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:26,000
But I can also understand that if they need to close down this server to make room for a new game that, you know, there is a finite amount of space out there and an amount of bandwidth that maybe they just need to get rid of.

3441
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Does it suck, especially considering we're paying for it? Yeah.

3442
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I mean, the fact of the matter is that we're pretty much paying $50 for dedicated servers, and then all of a sudden we find out that aside from the sports games, which are seasonal, I bet, you know, which are obviously seasonal, and it's expected that they close out a few servers for an outdated Madden game, for example.

3443
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:59,000
But for something like ChromeHounds, which is completely non-sports, just to have the servers close and we're still paying for it, it's just, I don't know, it's just mind-boggling.

3444
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Deathwishing in chat says he plays. I find matches every night. Yeah, I think he's called in about ChromeHounds before, so that kind of doesn't surprise me. I don't think I see anyone else, though.

3445
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Hmm. Well, you know, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. I mean, unfortunately, I think it's one of those things where they'll just take a chance on pissing off a few people to make room for some new game they've got coming out.

3446
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:31,000
It's Sega Sky. I doubt they would even have the ability to follow up on ChromeHounds unless, of course, they were financially inclined to do so.

3447
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:43,000
It's a recurring theme, though, tonight, though, is that we keep getting screwed on all these things, yet we just kind of seem to take it. The Xbox Red ringings, the servers getting shut down.

3448
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:50,000
At least for PSN, I kind of expect the servers will go down because they're free, so they're only up for a limited amount of time.

3449
02:42:50,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Except for popular games, but we expected that in the older PS2 days when a server is free, but not for something that we pay for.

3450
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Hmm. I don't know if there's an easy answer, Zaku. We have to speak with our wallets. The Starcraft thing. That was the other thing I was going to mention.

3451
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Alright, Zaku, do you have anything else for listeners today before we go and wrap it up?

3452
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Alright, I don't know. Is it just me that I've noticed that Quake Live, apparently John Carmack actually said over the weekend in QuakeCon, is that that free online version of Quake, Quake Live, can't really sustain itself on ads.

3453
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I'm not surprised.

3454
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Which brings me to the point, is there even chance or any room for a viable business model for a game that just relies heavily on ad revenues?

3455
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Because I think if Quake Live proves one thing, is that even in a tight economy, this one was hemorrhaging money.

3456
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Hence the need for them to actually start releasing premium content. Or actually, no, I take that back. It's like a premium subscription where you actually create your own servers.

3457
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I think in order to answer that question, you have to ask yourself, how often do you click on ads?

3458
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Well, it's not that you click on the ads. It's that the ads are actually strewn all over the actual maps in the game.

3459
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I see.

3460
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:44,000
So it's not necessarily clicking the ads. It's just the fact that, I guess, if it's something nostalgic like Quake, and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't even enough even on ads to break even, then I don't know if it might be viable for future business models with that same type.

3461
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I don't know.

3462
02:44:46,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I don't think there is enough money to be made there, because I don't think people really act on that stuff. I don't know. I think the business model is going to have to be incorporating some paid content into it for the hardcore section of it.

3463
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I mean, EA managed to get some sort of assurance in the fact that with Battlefield Heroes, at least that paid content is for the most part optional.

3464
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:23,000
I remember reading before tonight's show about this and that Quake Live, they're actually going to do a paid thing where you will be able to set up your own private rooms and so forth.

3465
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Right. I mean, with Battlefield Heroes, it's kind of like the other side of the coin where EA is not forcing you to buy certain content in order to play the game.

3466
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:46,000
It's just mostly aesthetics and just to level up your character a lot quicker. So you can pretty much sustain without having to resort to buying DLC.

3467
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:53,000
So I don't know if that's a viable model that could supplement ad revenues as well.

3468
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Well, one way to find out. We'll see.

3469
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Alright, Zaku, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?

3470
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Alright, have a good one.

3471
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,000
You too.

3472
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:07,000
And he needs to check out that Atari Lynx game thing going on. We have a conference call coming in.

3473
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3474
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D.

3475
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Hi.

3476
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I'll let everyone else introduce themselves, I guess.

3477
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
And who do you want, sir?

3478
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And it's Shadowclaw.

3479
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:26,000
So we have a conference call coming in. We usually don't take these very often, but my curiosity has peaked tonight. So what do we owe the conference call tonight?

3480
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Honestly, most of it is because I wanted to call in and we were talking on Skype at the time, so we just decided to, instead of actually editing the conference call, to just call in.

3481
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Awesome. Well, hello everybody. What's on your mind, Rob?

3482
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:45,000
Well, I thought I'd talk about my interesting experience at the Chicago Comic Con last week.

3483
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Please.

3484
02:46:47,000 --> 02:47:03,000
So I went there. They wanted to get some anime and manga programming in, so I figured, you know, I'd submit a panel. I actually wanted to do a panel about localizing American comics in Japan, which you can talk about a lot there, like the Spider-Man manga, the Spider-Man live-action show, and stuff like that.

3485
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:14,000
And, yeah, it turns out they didn't actually advertise any of the anime and manga panels anywhere at the convention, so I ended up getting one person to come in on Sunday.

3486
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Wow. Oh, I think I read about this in your journal. This is that same convention. Like, horrible signage and stuff, right?

3487
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Yeah. Well, you've been there. It's the same place that ASEN was at, so imagine if everything was at the convention center where you registered and they didn't have any signs pointing toward the hotel at all.

3488
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Like, who would go there?

3489
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Wow. Okay. Did the convention actually have a lot of people?

3490
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Yeah. I don't know exactly how many. In 2006, they got, I think, 60,000 people. I have no idea how many they got this year. I'm sure it's been down a lot since then. I mean, the convention itself was pretty much just a garage sale full of bootlegs and old comics.

3491
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Was it in the program or anything?

3492
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:57,000
There was a two-page spread in the program with no schedule and no panels in there.

3493
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Wow.

3494
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
No descriptions in there.

3495
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Someone really made you the bastard child of the convention.

3496
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Pretty much.

3497
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. I mean, for those who haven't been to that little area in Chicago, you have to, I mean, that walkway is no short trip either to get from one to the other, so if you don't know where to go, I mean, during ASEN, you can figure it out because there's tons of people traveling through there all the time.

3498
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:23,000
But, yeah, if it's not being trafficked, people don't know where to go.

3499
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And just to make this gaming related, they had a ton of gaming bootlegs there, too. Like, people were selling full sets of ROMs on the floor. They had a main cabinet going with a couple tournaments throughout the day.

3500
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
That's pretty bold.

3501
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:44,000
There was a gaming section. Actually, it was kind of funny. They had a Street Fighter IV tournament, or they were supposed to, and they wanted people to pay $20 to enter, and of course, no one did, so they didn't end up having it.

3502
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Huh.

3503
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,000
It was an interesting convention. I can't say I'd want to go back, and if I didn't get a free badge, I don't think I would have gone.

3504
02:48:51,000 --> 02:49:02,000
But at least, you know, now you know, and at least it wasn't, like, that wasn't the focus. I mean, you know, for, I guess, maybe a comic book convention, they probably did all right, but that's unfortunate, though.

3505
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Mm-hmm.

3506
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Kind of a waste of time.

3507
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Can I complain about King of Fighters XII a little bit, or do you want to end the Skype?

3508
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Of course you can. I wanted to give the other guys a chance to say something, too, if they wanted to say anything.

3509
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000
It's fine. You can go on.

3510
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
All right. King of Fighters then.

3511
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
We're busy playing World of Warcraft, actually.

3512
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Nice.

3513
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
We're installing Windows 7, which is going fun.

3514
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Much better than Vista.

3515
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Shadow's Light got me hooked on World of Warcraft. It's the default.

3516
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I'm telling you, Ion Online's pretty cool. If you're a Warcraft fan, I got to say, Ion Online, I'm liking that.

3517
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Dude, I keep hearing so many good things about Ion Online. I'm going to give it a try, like, in a couple of days.

3518
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
It's worth a look. Dark Soccer?

3519
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I was actually wondering if his impressions of King of Fighters XII were the same as mine.

3520
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I think it's got a great foundation. I like the fighting in it, and I like the graphics, but unfortunately, SNK didn't really...

3521
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I guess they didn't have enough time to animate everything, because too many characters are missing. Half the moves are missing.

3522
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:04,000
It's kind of like making a foundation for a skyscraper and putting up a lemonade stand.

3523
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Well, did you notice what they did, though, with the characters themselves is that they're sprite-wrapped 3D.

3524
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:18,000
It was very interesting, but it also causes some really weird... just things that don't look right graphically with the characters themselves.

3525
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,000
And on top of that, there's, like, no story.

3526
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Yeah, I love the animation in the game, though. I mean, it's got the best animation of any game I've seen since Street Fighter III, really.

3527
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:37,000
But the advantage, though, for them doing it in that manner is that if they want to change anything visually about the character, they can map it over the 3D model without changing movesets.

3528
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:46,000
I'm just hoping we actually get those movesets back, for the most part. I mean, I'm a Clark Steel player, and he's got two moves, literally.

3529
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Is it just me, or is he over-roided?

3530
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Oh, yes. It's going to be impossible for me to cosplay as Clark from now on, certainly in that style, unless I decide to go shopping with Hulk Hogan or Barry Bonds sometime soon.

3531
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I also didn't like that they did Athena in the cutesy anime style.

3532
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I don't mind that so much. Actually, that one's warmed up to me. The change... I'm a little bit iffy on Kenzo so far.

3533
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Yeah. Well, I like, though, that it seems that... I like his outfit in that, though. It seems like they're doing more towards the Psycho-Soldier outfit.

3534
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:23,000
What's up with no Mai? That's a thing. Isn't that weird?

3535
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I don't...

3536
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Well, the other thing that gets me is that there's no interaction between the characters. Like, for example, if you had Leona versus Heidern in the old game, she'd come out and salute him because he raised her in the storyline.

3537
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,000
And, you know, you'd have the Mai and Andy thing about her taunting him over wanting a baby or something.

3538
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Uh-oh. Are we losing you guys? Hello?

3539
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Oh, hello. Sorry.

3540
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Hi.

3541
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Sorry. I think my Skype hiccup's a little bit there.

3542
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
That's alright.

3543
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:55,000
But, I don't know. People didn't really play as Mai that much to begin with. I mean, they were watching her bounce, for the most part.

3544
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I liked Mai.

3545
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Mai is actually a staple of my team because I'm really good with her.

3546
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Fair enough.

3547
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Alright, well guys, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thanks for the call and have fun with all your respective games. Windows 7 and WoW and whatever you're playing these days, Rob.

3548
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Right now I'm playing a lot of Bladesblue, actually. That's what I've been playing all night and training.

3549
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Have fun with that. Hope your Xbox 360 doesn't fry.

3550
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:20,000
You'll be getting your TurboGrafx as soon as we get a paycheck in.

3551
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Yay! I look forward to it.

3552
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Alright. Take care, guys. Have a good one, everybody.

3553
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,000
You too, guys.

3554
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Later.

3555
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,000
See ya.

3556
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Later, everybody.

3557
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
That's funny. We don't get conference calls very often, but...

3558
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
That was fun.

3559
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,000
That was fun.

3560
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:40,000
One of these days I just want every single person listening to all make a mass Skype conference call and then call us. It'll be complete chaos.

3561
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
We can do SkypeCon all on Twitter.

3562
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio!

3563
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Alright, let's start to wrap up, guys, tonight, because it's already after 9 o'clock and we want to get out of here before it's too late.

3564
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:54,000
But more last minute stories. Loki, I don't know if you have anything else.

3565
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,000
I have nothing else.

3566
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Really? Wow. It was kind of a slow news week this week. Compared to other weeks, it was a little slow this week.

3567
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
And nothing else I wanted to talk about. Let me put it that way.

3568
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,000
There was other things to talk about, but there's nothing I wanted.

3569
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
But nothing that big. Alright. Fine. Be that way.

3570
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I'm fighting spyware and it's just pissing me off.

3571
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Oh, how annoying.

3572
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Well, it's stuff I got to do at safe mode and I don't feel like doing it right now, so...

3573
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Ugh.

3574
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:24,000
It's just searching for crap and then I get a wrong page and then it locks your system up because it wants to download spyware and it's a pain in the ass.

3575
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:27,000
You know what's funny, since everybody's talking about this Skype thing.

3576
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I remember for a while, I don't know what ever happened with it, but they were talking about doing another show on All Games after us.

3577
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Like a late night show or what have you.

3578
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:39,000
And I think what would be cool is somebody should just host a Skype thing.

3579
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Like an OLR post show that's just a massive orgy of people on Skype after the show.

3580
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I think that would be kind of fun.

3581
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:48,000
And people can talk about the inside jokes from the show and tonight.

3582
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
That would be fun.

3583
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,000
So, alright. That's it. We're going to wrap up. Go around and give everybody's final thought.

3584
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
DarkSakura, if you have no last minute stories tonight, then why don't you give us your final thought?

3585
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:06,000
My final thought is my dinner was really good but I still want meat.

3586
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Tasty, tasty death.

3587
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
My final thought is I want yogurt.

3588
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Ooh, robins.

3589
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
But all the yogurt places close Sunday.

3590
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
But Baskin-Robbins is open.

3591
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
We'd have to like not do Afterbirth.

3592
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
No, they close at 10.

3593
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
We'd have to hurry through Afterbirth.

3594
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Let's do Afterbirth anyway. I don't care.

3595
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
I'm thinking of the grocery store.

3596
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:29,000
It's totally selfish of me but I'm thinking of...

3597
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Because the arcade cabinet is technically my birthday gift because the wife is letting me have it.

3598
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
And that's a gift alone.

3599
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:45,000
But I am going to open up the unofficial Loki's Greedy Bastard birthday gift fund for arcade cabinet use.

3600
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,000
So links will be in the form.

3601
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I will donate and then I can feel guilt-free when I don't get you anything else.

3602
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
That's fine. You don't have to get me anything at all anyways.

3603
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
That's what everyone says.

3604
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Alright, let's go ahead and close up guys and call it a night.

3605
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Thank you guys as always for downloading and listening to our program. We really appreciate it.

3606
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:10,000
If you want to help us out, just help us spread the word.

3607
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Tell somebody you know about the show.

Help build our community by joining the Twitter.

3609
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:19,000
If you can't be here to listen live, we're trying to think of ways to get you guys to interact anyway.

3610
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
Through Mailbag, through Twitter, Facebook and so on.

3611
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
We want to hear from you.

3612
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Keep spreading the love you guys but use protection.

3613
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
We'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

3614
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
We'll be back to do it all again in 7 days.

3615
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Bye guys. Have a good week.

3616
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,000
