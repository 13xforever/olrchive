00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
Today, August 23, 2009, a new pay-as-you-go business model is announced for a popular

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,000
360 game.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,320
One gaming device will soon allow you to read comic books, and was a recently closed studio

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,760
working on the next Final Fantasy game?

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,960
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Radio.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,560
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
lifestyle.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,720
We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice, because we

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,940
let you call in, we let you chat with us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,500
We let you tweet us, too.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,160
We try to keep up with the times and the new technologies, and it all happens live at six

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,640
o'clock Pacific Standard Time, nine o'clock Eastern Time, at our friends at All Games

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Radio.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
www.allgames.com.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,620
A big shout-out to them for letting us steal their bandwidth on Sunday nights.

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,620
We appreciate it.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
My name is Rob Roberts.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,360
I'll be with you here over the next three hours.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,120
With me as always, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Sommers, Dark Sakura.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Crunchy.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
How are you?

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Crunchy.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,780
Tell the listeners about what you are eating right now, because I find it very interesting.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,800
I really wanted cereal, but I really wanted peanut butter, and then I was like, I've got

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,280
some really tasty bread from Trader Joe's.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,360
So what I did is I took my sprouted wheat bread from Trader Joe's, and put a bunch of

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,240
creamy Jif, and have put- Why not Skippy?

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,760
Annette Funicello is crying somewhere.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,720
Um, oh well.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,120
But I have a layer in between layers of peanut butter of all-brand flakes, so I can get my

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,140
crunchy cereal on.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,040
It's actually pretty delicious, but not quite as epic as I thought it was gonna be, and

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
it hasn't really abated my desire for tacos.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,720
So, to summarize, you are eating a peanut butter and cereal sandwich.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I am.

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,320
It's delicious.

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Orange Lounge Foodio, live Sunday nights.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
I swear we ought to have a spin-off.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,080
This is full of fiber and protein, okay?

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,560
And it's low glycemic, so the world can bite me.

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I swear we ought to have a spin-off show about like food or something.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
It just seems like a natural progression for our show.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Call it Food Chef.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
All right.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,400
So as always, I don't want to ignore him any longer, because he's an important part of

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
our show.

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
What the hell would we do without him?

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Tech master, Loki.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah, those are all lies.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Yeah, mostly.

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
No, I'm kidding.

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
How are you, Loki?

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm fine.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I feel somber, though.

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah?

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I was working out front planting plants.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,000
How is it being a homeowner now, a couple months in, having to do all this housework?

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tiring.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,080
Actually, it's funny, though, because there was this plant that was growing out front

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,920
next to our neighbor's fence, and we weren't really sure if it was our neighbor's plant

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,180
or ours, but technically, it's not our side of the property, so it's ours.

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,000
But apparently, you can pull it apart the way that it kind of grows.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
You can actually pull it apart.

65
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,400
So we took this one giant plant and made like 16 smaller plants out of it, and they're all

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,840
going to grow and expand bigger and take over the entire yard.

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
But yeah.

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
It's like Animal Crossing for real.

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Something like that.

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
I don't know.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
So yeah, that's what I did there.

72
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm surprised you, Loki, with your handiwork.

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,900
You don't get one of those things I've seen on late night television, which is those rolls

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,120
of flowers that you see that you can get at Home Depot, where you just unravel.

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,160
It's like a carpet or something.

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,120
You throw it down, and it's all seeds, so you water it, and then you just get the hometown

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,080
buffet of flowers in your front yard.

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Yeah.

79
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
You can do that with just seeds.

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,920
I mean, you don't need to spend money on it.

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,100
And I don't know if you've ever tried rolling anything down.

82
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,800
I can't roll it straight.

83
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
It would just be awful.

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Like, last night, we got... We were actually doing stuff at the house.

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,400
We bought a rug last night, which Kat decided to start tearing up, because it's the only

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,320
carpet in the house, and now she can scratch it.

87
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,200
And then we bought curtains for the front room to shield the outside world from our

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,560
porn watching, and it's really sunny.

89
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,200
So we put those up and everything, and... But yeah, I mean, we don't need all the flowers

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
up there.

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,900
When are you inviting me over to see all these changes at the house?

92
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Once we're done.

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
I don't know.

94
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
I'm just giving you a hard time.

95
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Come over any time you want.

96
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
I don't know.

97
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,840
Once I get the cabinet in and stuff, but... You need a housewarming party.

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I know.

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
That's what you need to do.

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
It's never clean.

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
No, I understand.

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,720
You've had a lot of busy stuff going on lately, but at some point, you should have a housewarming

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
party.

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
It's almost like... I don't know when the statute of limitations on that stuff is, because

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
we moved in, what, two months ago?

106
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't know when you can... You've gone beyond the point of homewarming parties.

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,280
I think there's a point where you're just like, okay, you forego.

108
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,600
You mean you would give up housewarming presents and not have a housewarming party?

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Hey, I would not be foregoing housewarming presents.

110
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,080
It's just... I don't know.

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,240
It'll be cooler once I get the cabinet in, because it'll be something to showcase, you

112
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
know?

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Right.

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Right now, all I can showcase is like... I don't know.

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
The cat-eating rug?

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
No, it's not eaten yet.

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,800
I mean, she just started pulling out pieces of it and was eating it.

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I don't know.

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
All right.

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,480
Well, let's introduce our chat room as well.

121
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,960
As always, where would we be without the listeners?

122
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's give the chat room a name tonight.

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's call it Rufus.

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Why are we calling the chat room?

126
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Chat room, your name is Rufus.

127
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,560
Why are we calling... Barnaby.

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
Why are we calling the chat room Rufus or Barnaby or Barnabas?

129
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I don't know.

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,640
Which, by the way, I am all about this Tim Burton Dark Shadows movie with Johnny Depp

131
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
as Barnabas.

132
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I know, right?

133
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I can't get here any faster.

134
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Please.

135
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,080
But Johnny Depp is in every Tim Burton movie now.

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
I love Meesa.

137
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Who cares?

138
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
He's a great actor.

139
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
I love Tim Burton.

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
I love Johnny Depp.

141
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
This is great.

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,800
The chat room's name is officially Penelope.

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Why are we calling the chat room by any name?

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,160
We're not calling it... We're not going to get in this weird tangent of stuff.

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Remember last week?

146
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
It got weird.

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Chat room, your name is Penelope.

148
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
See.

149
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,420
And then people are going to tune in at eight o'clock.

150
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,880
People that tune in late who weren't here when the show started on time, they're going

151
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
to be like, who the fuck's Penelope?

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,240
That's why they should have been here, huh?

153
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,000
It's just going to get strange.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,480
I have a feeling we're just going to go.

155
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
That's right.

156
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I need to take more Vicodin.

157
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Excuse me.

158
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
All right.

159
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Let's go to Penelope and read some of the comments that we have tonight.

160
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,860
Alpha Cananagram says about Loki's house, Skye just wants to watch the porn on the big

161
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,080
screen TV, possibly.

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,320
It's not that impressive, really.

163
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,280
I mean, I don't know.

164
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
There are weird things though.

165
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,520
The last time we had Jim and Annie and Christopher over, we actually watched the parody to Friends.

166
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:56,320
When you watch those parody porns, there's nothing sexy about that at all.

167
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,380
They're trying to make the characters look like the characters in the show and they do

168
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,760
a horrible job at it.

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I don't know.

170
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
It's more weird.

171
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,600
It's like watching a very slow-mo car wreck or something.

172
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,200
Have you thought about just watching just a straight up porn that doesn't try to be

173
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
any type of funny thing?

174
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,720
Good luck finding one, okay?

175
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,840
They're all kind of funny and weird.

176
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
I like old people, one of my favorite chat room nicknames, by the way, in Penelope right

177
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
now wants to know...

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,120
Ew, I just said that that person's in Penelope, wants to know, are there naked pics of Penelope?

179
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,640
Well, look, you're... never mind.

180
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
I don't want to...

181
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,520
I like the alpha cananagram referred to Penelope Pitstop because that's old school yo.

182
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
I didn't get that.

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
What is that?

184
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,200
It wasn't... it was from old cartoon.

185
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Is it?

186
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah.

187
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Okay.

188
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I got school people.

189
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
If it wasn't on Nickelodeon, I probably never saw it.

190
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,080
Would that be from Wacky Races?

191
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
I don't know.

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I think it was Wacky Races.

193
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
That sounds like a character from Wacky Races.

194
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Any moment somebody's going to yell it out in chat anyway, so we'll get there.

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Okay.

196
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Suma asks, so we went from Rufus to a girl's name, did Chad have a sex change?

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Apparently Dark Soccer thinks so.

198
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It was indeed Wacky Races.

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
All right.

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,680
And that was just a guess because I wouldn't remember such a horrible cartoon.

201
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
You watch a lot of cartoons.

202
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,040
No, I don't watch horrible cartoons like that, but I mean, come on, Penelope Pitstop.

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,680
It sounds like a racing character.

204
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,740
Her car was called the Compact Pussycat.

205
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,440
It's a compact pussy, okay.

206
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
There we go.

207
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,880
We have three people all just piping up, starting with X-Link, who beat everybody else to it,

208
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Wacky Racers, or Wacky Races.

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go back to video games.

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,800
We have this odd delay too.

211
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
We are live and it's not like we're on a delay because people are afraid we're going to say

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,980
fuck or something, but just the nature of the encoding and the fact that it takes a

213
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,720
minute to go to all game server, then you download it because you're buffering everything.

214
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,960
There's just by nature this 20 second delay.

215
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
So sometimes the last question's in the chat.

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,460
We don't see the answers for 20 seconds.

217
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,320
That's why when you call in, by the way, it's really important that you lower your volume

218
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,120
because there's nothing you can do about that buffer.

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
It will always be there.

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
All right, anyhow.

221
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Look at that, Tiger Claw.

222
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,680
But if you turn the volume up, there's less of a buffer.

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,400
Tiger Claw going straight to Wikipedia for the answer on Penelope Pitstop.

224
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,860
Okay, look, let's try to get into video games here tonight, talking a little bit about our

225
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,720
gaming week.

226
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,380
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

227
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,520
I was actually playing some Blue Dragon and some Ragnarok online, which I got back into

228
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:34,040
and stuff on Gaia, but, uh, I'm not playing anything now.

229
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,280
I have to, when you're playing MMOs, somebody on this show has to keep the added tradition

230
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
going.

231
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,040
I had to stop because I had the rest of that suture removed from my hand on Friday.

232
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Haha.

233
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
You can't bitch slap me.

234
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,240
I got a left hand, Rob, and I got two feet, and you are not protected.

235
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh, I'm actually reading up on Janet Waldo, who did Penelope Pitstop's voice.

236
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
She was Judy Jetson.

237
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Fascinating.

238
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Yep.

239
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,040
Loki, how was your gaming week?

240
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm assuming she's done if she's talking about the Jetsons.

241
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,200
Apparently not as exciting as Wacky Races, but, uh, no, I actually tried to play a few

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
different things this week.

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,160
I, I went and actually played some indie games, and of course people were recommending that

244
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,520
I play, um, you know, I made a game with zombies in it, and yeah, it was funny, and it was

245
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:37,040
actually pretty fun, um, so I enjoyed that, um, also, for whatever reason, because, you

246
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,880
know, now that they have the rankings in there, where people can actually rate different games

247
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,920
and stuff, um, you can actually, you know, see what the top rated, you know, um, indie

248
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,180
games and stuff are.

249
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,680
So I decided to play the top rated indie game, which is, um, Miner Dig Deep, and I don't

250
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,760
know why, but I'm addicted to that game.

251
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,320
It's almost pointless.

252
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,960
The game, you basically, you're a miner, and you go into a hole, and you actually dig into

253
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,120
the walls, almost like Dig Dug, but there's no, like, you know, dinosaurs around.

254
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,400
Just to point out, though, not the kind of 17 year old miner, right, you're talking about

255
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
a pickaxe.

256
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah, it's like a pickaxe, you know, miner, I don't know, maybe under 17.

257
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,040
Miner 2049er, if you're old school like me.

258
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,840
Um, but anyways, so you're in, you know, going into the ground digging, and you can buy different

259
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,360
things, um, of course you have lamp oil that runs out after a certain amount of time, so

260
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,800
you collect ore and stuff, and you go back up to a little shop, sell it, buy more lamp

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,720
oil and supplies, and you go back down and dig some more, and you do this forever.

262
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,640
This seriously sounds like a game I used to play, like, 15 years ago on old school PC.

263
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
256 color shareware.

264
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Yeah, pretty much, and you do this forever, and I don't know why, but I can't stop playing

265
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
this game.

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,320
I actually, you know, I don't know, I could have been playing, like, Earth Defense Force,

267
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,240
you know, which I did play a little bit of this week, but I kept going back to play this

268
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
game, and I don't know why.

269
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,440
So it sounds like its crown as the top-rated game right now is rightfully deserved, it

270
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
sounds like.

271
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah, it's fun, it's just, I don't really know what the point is, but I don't really

272
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
care.

273
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Azure Edge in chat wants to know what game you're talking about one more time.

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
Miner Dig Deep.

275
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,240
And it's an indie game, top-rated indie game, at least when you downloaded it, who knows,

276
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,880
because those lists can change on a daily basis, right?

277
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Yeah.

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,080
So, you know, what's funny is that, you know, we heard about the new Xbox, and I think it

279
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
was like a dollar.

280
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,360
I mean, seriously, it's worth the dollar.

281
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,960
I think we've heard a lot of chat when this new firmware rolled out about how there was

282
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,880
going to be ratings and so forth, but I don't think we've really heard a lot about how that's

283
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,660
really played out, you know, because I think there was some concern that, just like people

284
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,480
spam Dig, some of these indie developers might try to spam Xbox to try and get their titles

285
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
to the top.

286
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
Does it seem like it's working?

287
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,040
If they are, it's hard to notice because there's so many people voting on stuff that, really,

288
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,400
I don't see how that can be, and actually, it's not a matter of, like, you can place

289
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
a vote for a title.

290
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,880
I mean, you can vote, like, a five, but, like, say later on, something really pissed you

291
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,720
off about it, you can change it to a zero, or one, or whatever.

292
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,760
You can change it whenever you want, so it's basically just, you know, tallies, whatever

293
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,480
people are thinking of it at that time.

294
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,020
When I went in there, you know, because, unfortunately, you know, if you listened to last week's show,

295
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,920
you know I'm Xbox-less right now, but when I was playing with that new patch last week,

296
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,840
one of the first things I did is I went in there and I rated Snake 360, you know, to

297
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,560
support our buddy who was on the show a couple months ago when that game first rolled out,

298
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,760
and I was like, oh, I'm going to rate this a five and see kind of how it takes place.

299
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,200
But it didn't seem like my vote, because, you know, you can see the number of people

300
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,160
that have voted, it didn't seem like my vote took at first.

301
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,080
Like, it almost seems like there's a waiting period before the vote actually registers.

302
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,120
I don't know if they update overnight, or what it is.

303
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
It might take a while.

304
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
It's kind of weird.

305
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
I mean, because I don't think they could do it in real time, it would just be bogging

306
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
everything down.

307
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,720
I did find it very interesting that the game rating worked very similar to the Netflix

308
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,720
rating, how since you don't really have a mouse and pointer to click how many stars,

309
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,980
you have to kind of cycle through all the way to five or back to one, you know, to rate

310
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,360
it by hitting the A button so many times.

311
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,480
And I don't know, it's pretty cool, like, I played Earth Defense Force earlier this

312
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
week as well, and that's rated a solid four now, which it rightly deserves because it's

313
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
awesome.

314
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,000
It just broke 80 hours this week in the game, and I don't know why because it's just really

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,720
hard and frustrating, but I'm actually working my way through it some more.

316
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,560
I finally got one of the higher up weapons and I'm missing, I'm still missing some of

317
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,120
the other weapons though, but in order to farm them, the one level you have to play,

318
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,880
it only drops like one or two weapons a level, and you know, since it's random at what weapons

319
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,120
it picks to me, it could be one of any 200 weapons that are in that game, and I'm missing

320
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,960
like two, and you can see how it could take forever to get what you need.

321
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,560
But I've been playing that and I'm about 80% done with the game, getting almost to the

322
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,200
point where, you know, I need to really get some good people to help out with it, but

323
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,040
I have a friend who's actually playing that at work as well, and so he's been helping

324
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,040
me on breaks and stuff like that when we're not playing Grand Theft Auto, then of course

325
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,520
I played Grand Theft Auto this week and didn't really change anything, although I went over

326
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,920
to my sister's house because she has a modded 360 as well, I got her that for her birthday,

327
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,660
and so I've been giving her every now and then copies of, you know...

328
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,720
Did you really give the gift of piracy for someone's birthday?

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,760
She's poor, she can't, okay before that she had a modded PS2 with games dumped to the

330
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,860
hard drive, so yes, I've been giving the gift of piracy to her because she can't afford

331
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,000
actual games.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
She does rent though, so you know, she rents legitimate games, but I shouldn't be supporting

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
such blatant piracy, but you know, it's out there I guess.

334
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,760
Well she has, to be fair, she does have a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto IV, so she

335
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,640
does have it, legitimately, so the fact that I'm burning off a new copy of it that happens

336
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,280
to be modified, it's still kind of in that gray area, but I mean, it's not like she doesn't

337
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,000
own a legit copy of it.

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, fair enough.

339
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

340
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,080
But anyways, so she, I was showing her because she didn't actually try any of the weapons

341
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,840
that I modified or anything because she doesn't have the phone yet, she's been too busy trying

342
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:32,060
to punch people with the super punch, although for whatever reason, the nuke shotgun that

343
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,360
I built in there, because normally I play Lost and Damned and so some things don't work

344
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,600
quite right how they're supposed to, but since she only has Grand Theft Auto IV, that nuke

345
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,400
shotgun works like a nuke, and it, like, no matter where I shot it, somehow the shockwave

346
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
hit me, killed me every time.

347
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,480
You really do need to YouTube some of this stuff, I know you're working on it.

348
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
I have two hours of footage, okay, I have to go through it, but yeah, it's going to

349
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
be awesome.

350
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,320
Alright, looking forward to seeing it.

351
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,880
One more question I want to ask you about the whole, because as I mentioned before,

352
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
my Xbox 360 is broke right now, so I can't really look at this myself, I don't know if

353
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,760
you've bothered to check it out, maybe a chatter knows, what is the top rated Xbox 360 game

354
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
right now?

355
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
I don't know.

356
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Hmm.

357
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,920
I wonder if that's something that you can look up on Xbox.com, can you see ratings on

358
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Xbox.com now?

359
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I think you can.

360
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,600
I'm sure, maybe a chatter will look that up for us, because if I try to go on Xbox.com

361
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,520
while we're recording the show, it won't like that, so it uses up a lot of memory, so.

362
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm kind of curious, if it's like Mass Effect or, you know, I'm trying to think of the games

363
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,240
that were high rated when I took a peek, but you know, everything was so new at that point.

364
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,400
I know Grand Theft Auto is pretty high up there, it's like a four and a half, I don't

365
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
know.

366
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
I don't think there's anything else to solve five, so it's going to be really hard to distinguish

367
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,880
since, you know, it's sections of a star being shaded there, it's like, is that a half, third,

368
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
I don't know, you know.

369
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,680
Halo 3 says, sex with the elderly is their chat name.

370
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Is that the game tonight?

371
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,040
Everybody's going to name themselves something really foul that I have to read?

372
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Whatever.

373
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,760
I think it's a good idea.

374
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,800
No, it's a terrible idea, I won't read your chats, alright, whatever.

375
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Have fun with it, whatever you like, as long as it's consensual.

376
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Alright, um, I wonder if that's just a lie, I wonder if they just shouted out an Xbox

377
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,880
360 game because they knew I'd read it and just believe them, because I'm a sucker.

378
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,560
Alright, hey, my gaming week, obviously I've been QQing about my broken Xbox 360.

379
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,000
You know, and I'm calmed down a lot this week than I was last week, because it was still

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,160
fresh in my mind last week, I'm a little more mellow this week, I think I have my plan of

381
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,080
action for what I plan to do about it.

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,400
I will not be buying a new Elite, I'll tell you that much, that is one thing I did decide.

383
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,320
Maybe I'll talk a little more about this later on because we're going to get into a story

384
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,400
in a little bit that's kind of related.

385
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,020
But that means obviously I still have a Playstation 3, I still have a Wii, I have plenty of places

386
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
I can be gaming.

387
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,800
I think PS3 kind of wins this week, I've been playing Wipeout HD, I went back and visited.

388
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,120
Oddly enough, the whole controversy about the ads in the game kind of made me think,

389
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,280
oh yeah, I never really played enough Wipeout HD, so I went back and played some, and I

390
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,200
did actually see an ad once while I was playing, I didn't play the new expansion, I was just

391
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,840
playing like old school Wipeout HD, like the, I guess, well how old school is Wipeout HD,

392
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,680
but you know what I mean, the original version of it.

393
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,280
Because damn, I love me some F-Zero, and Wipeout HD really is kind of the closest thing we

394
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,560
have to that on another console, and I really like that mode that's called I think zone

395
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,000
mode when you're racing, it makes the track like all this solid color as you're racing,

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,080
it has this very techno look to it obviously as Wipeout HD does, and then as you race,

397
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,760
like the track changes colors as you accumulate so many points, and yeah, pretty cool.

398
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,880
I'm having fun with Wipeout HD, haven't really played a lot of it online, but it has been

399
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,680
satiating my thirst for gameplay this week with a lack of an Xbox 360.

400
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,400
Obviously the Playstation 3 is a perfectly fine gaming system, and there's some certain

401
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,440
things on it I can't play on 360 that I'm kind of catching up on right now, so Wipeout

402
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
HD is one of them.

403
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm still looking for a cheap copy of Valkyria Chronicles, but from what I understand, because

404
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,960
I remember we reported on the show a while back that Valkyria Chronicles dipped to 1999,

405
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,440
apparently it went back up, because it has been, I don't know if the price dip made it

406
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,560
more successful or it's a cult thing now or what the deal is, but I know that's on my

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,800
hit list of games I want to play until I get my 360 situation resolved, and then of course,

408
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,860
whenever Final Fantasy 13 comes out I will be buying them on PS3, and I was watching

409
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Blu-rays too.

410
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,720
I finally caught up on a few of those.

411
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,280
I think that you should hang out with me and play Dreamcast.

412
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Dreamcast?

413
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
On September 9th I will.

414
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Okay.

415
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
It'll be fun.

416
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,400
I forgot to mention that I also have a System 573 board coming my way tomorrow.

417
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Now for those that don't know what a System 573 board is, what is that?

418
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,960
It's Bomani hardware.

419
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,680
It's actually, well this one in particular is a Dance Maniacs second mix J append, and

420
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,680
so literally if I were to hook it up to a monitor and build controls and stuff like

421
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,080
that, I could play Dance Maniacs as an actual arcade game.

422
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,800
And you can convert the machine into a DDR machine if I really wanted to, but it costs

423
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,980
like an extra $100 to do that.

424
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,480
But I have the actual cartridges and security stuff to do it if I wanted to.

425
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,200
I don't know if I will though, because I can just run Step Mania.

426
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,280
I'm reading some comments from Penelope at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

427
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Tiger Claw says, Zone was a mode first introduced in Wipeout Pure on the PSP.

428
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
I did not know that.

429
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
I missed the PSP version.

430
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,040
SG100Matt says, the top indie rated game is, I made a game with zombies, with 4.5 stars

431
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
and 5081 votes.

432
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
So it sounds like it's changed.

433
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah, it's been getting, well that was like number 3.

434
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,280
It's been getting bigger because, you know, everyone loves it.

435
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Everyone loves zombies.

436
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
It's a dollar.

437
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
It's a dollar.

438
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
It's a good dollar spent, you know.

439
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,880
Definitely recommend you try it.

440
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,600
Has a really, people are calling it this year's, you know, Still Alive basically, has a really

441
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,640
weird catchy song about the game.

442
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Interesting.

443
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,440
It's probably sung, but it just talks about the game.

444
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,640
Does it seem like this whole rebranding of the, what was it, I don't even remember what

445
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,840
was called before, the independent, to indie games, what was it, what the hell was it called?

446
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Community games.

447
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Thank you.

448
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,240
Do you think the rebranding of community games to indie games has been successful?

449
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,520
Because it sure sounds like more people are following what's going on now.

450
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,880
I think though what's making it better is that they've dropped the price, the minimum

451
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
price.

452
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
Because before the minimum price used to be 200 Microsoft points, which is, you know,

453
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
80 points.

454
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Now your lowest amount that you can charge for a game is 80 points or a dollar.

455
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,120
So, you know, surprisingly enough, that's still, a lot of people are just like, hey,

456
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
dollar, whatever.

457
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
You know, throw it in there.

458
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
You know, a lot of people may have 80 points left over after buying something.

459
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,160
So it's kind of cool in that way too.

460
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,920
But yeah, I mean, it's a lot easier just to buy stuff for 80 points.

461
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,240
I mean, it goes really fast.

462
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,120
It is unfortunate that the games don't have achievements.

463
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,480
I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand why.

464
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,360
Because obviously someone would make that game, you know, press A, get 200 gamer score.

465
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,680
But even if they would do achievements with a zero gamer score, or just, you know, because

466
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,120
there are plenty of achievements out there in the retail games that are just zero gamer

467
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
score.

468
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
It's just unlocking it.

469
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,240
Or maybe like a separate type of, not even achievements, but maybe like community badges.

470
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
I don't know what the hell they want to call it, but something maybe separate that, yeah,

471
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,280
that'd be kind of cool because no one let me compete against friends.

472
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
Because, you know, on those games, you can't really do the...

473
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,080
We would never do points because someone could just, you know, go, okay, you started the

474
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
game, 1000 points.

475
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Right, right.

476
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
I get that.

477
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Don't get me wrong.

478
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,200
But just something that, you know, kind of encourages a little bit of competition, you

479
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
know.

480
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
I don't know.

481
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm just kind of brainstorming here.

482
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I think ways they can make it even bigger.

483
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
I think they will later.

484
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
But just not right now.

485
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
All right.

486
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Let's see.

487
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,920
As far as other games I've been playing this week, not really a whole lot.

488
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,620
I was playing Guild Wars for a little bit.

489
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Not a lot.

490
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,080
But, you know, it's one of those MMOs I have that I'm not really paying for because I already

491
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
bought the game.

492
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,520
And Guild Wars' model is that once you buy the game, you can play online for free pretty

493
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
much forever.

494
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,280
So it's kind of cool that you can just go back and revisit it whenever you want.

495
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I did.

496
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,520
Speaking of Guild Wars, and I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, I also watched

497
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,560
that trailer for Guild Wars 2.

498
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,580
Looks pretty sweet, I got to say.

499
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,440
So definitely keeping an eye on Guild Wars.

500
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
All right.

501
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,520
Let's get into some more gaming news tonight.

502
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,040
After some housekeeping, we do of course always want to plug some of the ways you can follow

503
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,520
us and join the community that we sometimes call the O.L. Army.

504
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,040
If you want to join our Twitter, www.Twitter.com slash O.L.R., also you can join us on Facebook.

505
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Just search for the O.L. Army.

506
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,160
We're on LiveJournal as well in Orange Lounge.

507
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Follow us.

508
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Get involved with the community.

509
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,280
We try to read your comments and so forth on every show all the time.

510
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,160
Also some other comments from chat.

511
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,760
INGN0, INGO, I know how to spell this, or he's told me how to pronounce it before and

512
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,440
I always forget, asks, no Wolfenstein question mark.

513
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,000
No, not this week, especially, it's not really the type of game that I've been really eagerly

514
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
anticipating.

515
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,240
I played the old Wolfenstein 3D and that was about it for me.

516
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I don't know.

517
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,560
Wolfenstein, any interest, Loki?

518
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Nope.

519
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,680
I will tell you, this has got to be probably the first podcast or gaming blog anywhere

520
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,360
that did not talk about Shadow Complex this week.

521
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,760
I would have played it if my Xbox worked.

522
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,040
I looked at it and I was like, how much did I play Castlevania Symphony Night when I bought

523
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
that on 360?

524
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,640
Oh wait, no, I didn't buy it.

525
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,580
But still, all the more reason.

526
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm probably not going to buy it.

527
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I don't know.

528
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
I'll think about it.

529
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:59,040
But I haven't finished, you know, Bionic Commando and more than half a dozen, a few dozen games

530
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,280
that I've bought already.

531
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm just kind of taking a break from buying full price Xbox Live Arcade games.

532
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,240
Now, don't get me wrong, if they ever came out with a Bionic Commando sequel that would

533
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,200
be on Xbox Live Arcade done the same fashion as, say, Re-Armed, then yes, I would probably

534
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,640
buy that in a heartbeat.

535
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,360
I have not seen a single person on the interwebs say that Shadow Complex sucks.

536
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,480
I have yet to see a tweet about it.

537
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I don't know.

538
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Chat, does it suck?

539
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Just say it just to say it.

540
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,680
Like, if it really sucks, tell me why.

541
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,160
It seems like the reception of this game has been very, very positive.

542
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,800
And I do love the Metroidvania games.

543
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,200
I was looking at screenshots kind of going, doesn't look like the type of thing I normally

544
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,840
play, but I'll check it out.

545
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
It's fun, it's fun.

546
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,640
Doesn't matter what the theme is or what have you.

547
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,960
By the way, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us on all games radio,

548
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,800
he starts at five o'clock Pacific on Sunday nights.

549
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,620
He is in chat saying, we are the second podcast to not mention Shadow Complex, even though

550
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,100
we did, because he was the first.

551
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,560
My bad.

552
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,640
Give credit where credit is due.

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,800
Beaten by one hour, curses!

554
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Alright.

555
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, Shadow Complex or whatever the game is that we're

556
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
talking about.

557
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,720
And please, don't hear me wrong, I'm not bashing Shadow Complex.

558
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,920
Again, if my Xbox 360 hadn't fried last week, I would have gladly checked it out this week,

559
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,160
but you know, shit happens.

560
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,680
Alright, so Loki, get us started with some gaming news tonight.

561
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Alright, so Microsoft had a little bit of a keynote during Gamescom this week, however

562
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,860
they didn't really discuss a whole lot.

563
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,640
Really the only thing they discussed was Fable.

564
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,120
So of course, I'm totally shocked that they announced a new Fable game, but Fable 3 will

565
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,840
be coming out next year, and they didn't really go into great detail what exactly you're going

566
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,160
to be doing, but apparently you will be, I guess, assuming that they're going to be playing

567
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,020
as the son or daughter of your Fable 2 hero, and you're going to be starting like a revolution

568
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,380
to become the new ruler of Albion, and of course, based on, you know, what you do as

569
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,580
a ruler, you know, that have obviously positive or negative effects on the world around you.

570
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,720
Just like Fable 2, and I'm sorry, but if it's just like Fable 2, then it's going to be all

571
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,600
hype, no content.

572
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, not no content, but not as much content as promised.

573
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,120
I kind of liked Fable 2, but...

574
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,800
It was alright, but it just wasn't like, oh my god, the best game ever, as he was like,

575
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
you know, pitching it.

576
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,080
Well, Peter Molyneux kind of has a reputation for really, really hyping things beyond what

577
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,740
they really end up being, and you know why we all approach this project, Milo, with a

578
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,000
hint of skepticism, at least I do.

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,400
But I did like Fable 2 quite a bit, actually, it's one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of

580
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
last year.

581
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,620
But here's my question about Fable 3.

582
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,480
If you're going to be playing the child of a character in Fable 2, does that mean all

583
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,660
these decisions you made in Fable 2 ultimately are going to impact in Fable 3?

584
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,920
That didn't really happen in Fable 2 with Fable 1.

585
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,680
Yeah, I'm not really sure if that's the case, and they're just saying that the storyline's

586
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,280
basically that your, you know, hero is going to be, you know, it's their children, since

587
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,600
the game starts off in Fable 2 where you pick, you know, a sex, and that's basically it.

588
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,000
But I guess they said the game's going to take place 50 years after the first one, and

589
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,560
you play the child of the hero, Bowerstone has continued moving on, become quite industrial,

590
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,680
and the game's not just about Albion this time.

591
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,000
And they also said that half the game will be spent trying to ascend the power, and the

592
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,480
game will not turn into, like, a micromanagement RTS.

593
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,840
And then they're also going to have the judgment and touch systems, which will be used to influence

594
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
the world.

595
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,160
Basically, a judgment system was people will come to you and say, okay, this poor child,

596
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,240
you know, stole bread from this person.

597
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,860
Do you want to let them go or kill them, you know?

598
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,400
You can just, you know, obviously pick the right or wrong, whatever you feel is right

599
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
or wrong.

600
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
But you can't come up with creative punishments.

601
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,480
You can't say, you know, make them bake bread for the entire town or anything like that.

602
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,280
Yeah, it's like you can, you know, judge her immediately, like the person that stole food,

603
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
or you can investigate the situation.

604
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,560
Or you can set her on fire.

605
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,360
I vote for fire.

606
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,040
Clearly, your character was evil and fabled too.

607
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
No, mine was actually really good.

608
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,640
No, and you set people on fire, and you were good?

609
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,480
No, I just said I vote for fire.

610
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,840
I do like this feature.

611
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,620
Touch apparently will allow players to grab NPCs.

612
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,080
So for example, if, you know, somebody, if a child was in a burning building, you can

613
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,020
actually grab the child and pull them to safety instead of waiting for the child to figure

614
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,320
out how to get out of the burning building and probably dying in the process because

615
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,100
some of the AI wasn't that, I don't know.

616
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,400
That means if you're evil, you could grab them and throw them into the burning building.

617
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,240
That saying, like, you can also shake someone's hand or refuse to.

618
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,200
You can also embrace somebody, snog them.

619
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't know.

620
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Baby shake?

621
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,280
I hope you can throw them off cliffs.

622
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,640
Or even better, jump off a cliff while holding onto them and then drag them with you.

623
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Throw your dog at them.

624
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,080
That would be kind of funny.

625
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,560
So yeah, that's basically the game.

626
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:40,320
It's, you know, becoming the king and it will be the best game ever, I'm sure, and somehow

627
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
they'll probably work in Milo in there or some crap.

628
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
I don't know.

629
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,240
Fable 3, my life as a king.

630
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,640
But yeah, that is, you know, basically Fable 3.

631
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,720
So it's, I don't know, it's neat.

632
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,900
Now the other thing that they talked about, because goddamn if Fable 3 wasn't enough,

633
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,040
they talked about Fable 2 Episodic, and people were thinking, oh my god, there's more content

634
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
coming.

635
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Wrong.

636
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,400
Actually, Fable 2 Episodic is a pay-to-play version of Fable 2.

637
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,820
And basically Fable 2 had different, like, chapter points, I guess, in it.

638
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,520
And so the first chapter is free, and then of course, you know, once you're done with

639
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,320
that, you can choose to buy the next chapter or buy the rest of the game.

640
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,120
And I guess there's five episodes in total, and it's supposed to be released on September

641
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,840
29th.

642
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,040
And they didn't say how expensive the game will be.

643
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,920
I'm guessing around the same price as Fable 2.

644
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,680
Yeah, probably when you buy all five parts, or the last four or whatever it is, it ends

645
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,320
up being the same price as Fable 2, I'm sure.

646
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,180
Kind of an interesting business model, though.

647
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,340
What do you think about this?

648
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,720
It's clearly a test to see how well it's received, but what do you think of the business model?

649
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,520
I actually...

650
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,120
You know, for somebody with gaming ADD like me, who probably only played through a few

651
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,040
chapters of Fable 2, I mean, granted, I like the idea that I can go back and check it out

652
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,440
at any time.

653
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,320
I have to say, I'm actually a little more welcoming of this idea than you might think.

654
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,360
I think it's a good idea because Fable 2 didn't have a demo, and this would be a good way

655
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,800
to check out, you know, a game.

656
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,720
Say for example, you know, it's more of like an extended demo because you get to play through

657
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,560
the first part of the game for free, and then if you just, if you like it, then you can

658
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,680
go ahead and purchase it later.

659
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,900
Or if you're just on the fence about it, you know, you can buy the next chapter and see

660
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,000
if you still like it or something like that.

661
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,600
So it's not just dumping all the money.

662
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,800
But they are getting more money, though, out of you by charging you in an episodic manner

663
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,240
as opposed to buying the whole game.

664
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,080
Well, granted, we don't know how many points each part is going to cost yet.

665
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,040
I would assume so because, I mean, that's typically when you buy, for example, an individual

666
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,980
size of something or when you buy the six pack, you know.

667
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
That's a fair comparison.

668
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,960
Like, I was kind of thinking of it as a pizza, is that when you buy Fable 2, you get the

669
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,520
pizza, but now you can get a slice of pizza.

670
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,160
Oh, pizza sounds good.

671
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Pizza does sound very good, actually.

672
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Let's get pizza.

673
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,960
We might have to during break or something.

674
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,680
Wait a minute, you didn't bring food tonight, Loki.

675
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
You didn't.

676
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I went sushi.

677
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Oh, okay.

678
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,120
And then I had a TNT roll, which is, what is it, and it all comes back to food.

679
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Hey, you asked.

680
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
My fault.

681
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
My fault.

682
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:39,720
So it was like McGrew, I want to say there's spicy yahi and yellowfin and some other stuff

683
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
in there.

684
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
But it was good and hot.

685
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Spicy mayonnaise.

686
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,440
Comments from chat, because of course this seems to be lighting up our chat room a little

687
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
bit.

688
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,640
I think Bobby's on the same page we are.

689
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,720
Black Wolf in chat says, I like the episodic model because that way if I don't continue

690
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,240
the game, I'm not paying for the whole game.

691
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,560
I'm only paying for the part of the game that I finished.

692
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,240
Unfolded Raptor follows up with, but that's like watching 15 minutes of a movie then paying

693
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,000
for another 15 minutes.

694
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
Black Wolf says, well, you know, if I want to walk out of the movie after the first 15

695
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
minutes, I didn't pay for the entire two hour movie.

696
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,580
You know what's interesting is that you do see actually a lot of movie companies putting

697
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,400
out like the first eight minutes of a movie on the internet for you to watch.

698
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,920
Amazon does that with TV episodes that you can download.

699
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
And books.

700
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah.

701
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
We'll give you samples of the books.

702
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,280
I mean, it's a good idea, but I'm thinking that they should offer an incentive that if

703
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,800
you decide after the first episode that you want to buy the whole game, that they give

704
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,520
you an option to pay the difference.

705
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,220
Well that's the thing.

706
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,520
They're going to do that I think.

707
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,920
They're just basically, the first episode's free.

708
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,280
So after the first episode, you can, after each chapter I guess, you have the option

709
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,320
to purchase the rest of the game or just purchase the next chapter.

710
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,720
You know, this really could be.

711
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,420
We could be looking at the future of how we're going to pay for a lot of our games.

712
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,520
Especially if this is successful, I don't know how successful it will be because it's

713
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
not a new game.

714
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,280
I think a lot of people that were interested in this game already got it, but it's certainly

715
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,120
by tempting folks with a free chapter a way to entice folks to check it out maybe and

716
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,640
get a few more extra sales.

717
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,440
I can't see how that's going to be bad news for Microsoft or Lionhead.

718
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,920
It's the pot of the video game world.

719
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,160
Just one hit, man.

720
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,720
But the interesting thing is, I mean think about it, PSP Go, despite the crap we've given

721
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:36,000
it on this show for not being that much better than the PSP and especially price wise, is

722
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,080
going to be completely free of media.

723
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,160
It's going to be digital downloads only.

724
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,840
Nintendo DS, or the DSi I should say specifically is a large part, is going to be digital download

725
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
only.

726
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,200
Some of the biggest components and biggest games you see now on 360, PlayStation Network,

727
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,500
Nintendo WiiWare, are all download games.

728
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,600
I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the major players, Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft,

729
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:13,920
in the next console, and I think if anybody it's going to be Sony, says no media, no discs,

730
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,080
no Blu-ray, or you know this will play Blu-rays but the games do not come out on Blu-rays.

731
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,100
It will be 100% digital distribution.

732
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,400
And it will fail.

733
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
You think?

734
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
It will fail.

735
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,640
What if it's like this though?

736
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
It will still fail.

737
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
And you know why it's going to fail?

738
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,880
Because people like owning stuff and people like the option.

739
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,960
I don't have a problem with adding other ways you can purchase content if you decide that

740
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
you know what?

741
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't feel like buying the game.

742
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,880
I can buy either the episode, I can buy the full digital download which is available on

743
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,680
their service as well, or I can go purchase the retail game out there and do that.

744
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,720
If I'm not given that option then that's kind of crappy and then you know what happens later

745
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,640
on with, say, your console dies.

746
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,040
I know a lot of times with the Playstation 3 and stuff I'm sure you can go re-download

747
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,200
all that stuff later because it's just tied to your account, but still though it's not,

748
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,720
you can't loan out your games, you can't sell used, I mean it's really, there's a lot more

749
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,600
factors in there, and people like the, I mean people like the collector crap.

750
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,120
I mean, hello, Modern Warfare 2 with some fucking night vision goggles.

751
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,920
Can't digitally download night vision goggles.

752
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,780
Look at my vault.

753
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,940
Maybe I'm apples to oranges here a little bit, but then tell me why iTunes and iPods

754
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,400
are so successful.

755
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,240
Because people that purchase Apple products are suckers for that kind of crap.

756
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,600
But you cannot deny iTunes is successful.

757
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,780
But seriously, what phone out there, okay, what phone has cartridges or discs that plug

758
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
into it?

759
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,920
No phone does.

760
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,200
So that kind of content is expected on there, and that's why it's not a big deal.

761
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,320
Now if Apple were to come out with, say, a console and decides that, okay, it's only

762
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,820
gonna be through like their app store, then people might not be so apt to it.

763
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,440
They might go, eh, you know what, I'm just gonna stick with a console that I can actually

764
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,060
purchase physical stuff for.

765
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Very interesting.

766
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,320
A lot of negativity in the chat room on this idea.

767
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Penelope.

768
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Sorry.

769
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,720
In Penelope, there's a lot of, and not necessarily the Fable 2 thing, I'm talking about the what

770
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,800
if the next generation of gaming was all digital.

771
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,880
Let's see, we have Act Def says, it will fail.

772
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
Code Man says, I hate downloading games.

773
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,760
My internet connection is so slow.

774
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,260
Frisbee says, I like having a disc to hold or cart.

775
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,600
And I like this comment from Sex with the Elderly says, I can't wait till people start

776
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,060
stealing PSPs and all their content with it.

777
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,160
Then having no media will suck ass.

778
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:04,240
And I'm sorry, I don't know, we'll get into this later why the PSP goes sucks, because

779
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,600
we have to bring it up on every show, but they're really dumb.

780
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm sorry.

781
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,400
Sony is so retarded, it is just mind boggling.

782
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,720
And if they decided that, you know what, we're not gonna have any media and it's gonna be

783
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,800
a purely digital download system, it's gonna fail.

784
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,280
It's gonna fail.

785
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,760
To be fair, I'm only picking on Sony because if the PSP goes any indication, this is what

786
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
they're thinking.

787
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't think it's a good idea anyways with Microsoft either.

788
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,240
I probably wouldn't buy a console from Microsoft if it didn't have physical media.

789
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,120
And I think that they're gonna be more apt to having physical media because there's a

790
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,080
lot more exposure out there, whereas it's just their service.

791
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,360
What if someone doesn't have broadband internet?

792
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,740
Oops, can't buy your download content.

793
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,740
That's a problem.

794
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,940
But there are people out there that don't have internet, or maybe they're playing their

795
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,680
console in a spot that doesn't have internet and they just don't care.

796
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,480
But still, you know what, they can go out there and buy discs and they can plug them

797
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
into their system.

798
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,000
There's still consumers in that sense.

799
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,040
But if you get rid of that and just say, well, everybody by now should have internet, well

800
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,840
you're gonna still lose some sales.

801
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,880
And that's not a smart thing.

802
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,360
Now what you should do is open up as many different avenues for people to purchase content.

803
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,260
Like this with Fable 2 I think is a good idea because now you have three different options.

804
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,760
You can purchase the full game, you can purchase it by episode, or you can purchase the retail

805
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
copy.

806
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,200
Or hell, you can purchase the used retail copy out there.

807
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,840
So there's a lot of options for you, and options are never a bad thing.

808
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,960
I guess not.

809
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Alright, well let's move on and talk about the Xbox.

810
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,800
And obviously one big topic that dominated last week's show was me bitching about my

811
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,280
Xbox having crashed.

812
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,140
And apparently that wasn't the only story that came up on Xbox failures last week.

813
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,720
Game Informer actually ran a report, and in the latest issue of Game Informer, they actually

814
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,820
did a survey where they surveyed 5,000 console owners.

815
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,960
And according to these 5,000 console owners, the Xbox 360's current failure rate because

816
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,920
of the E74 error, 54.2%.

817
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,160
Now to be fair, they also surveyed for the Playstation 3's, and their yellow light issues,

818
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,240
10.3% on those, and the Wii's, 6.8%.

819
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,920
Granted, despite the anger I was feeling last week, I think this number's a little skewed.

820
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,720
And I think we're all approaching this with a little bit of skepticism because who are

821
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,460
you surveying in this poll?

822
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,880
You're surveying gamers.

823
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:51,720
And I think, I can admit that I think those that go so far as to subscribe to a magazine

824
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,880
or so forth probably use their Xbox 360's on a pretty regular basis, maybe a little

825
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,860
bit heavier than some people who don't subscribe to magazines do.

826
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,640
And so I think, just by nature, the more you use your console, the more you're going to

827
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,080
open it up to failure.

828
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,520
That's just true of any piece of hardware.

829
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,680
The more you use it, the more it's likely to fail someday.

830
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
That's not true.

831
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,200
I mean, I guess it's true in general statement, but it shouldn't be failing at the rates that

832
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
they're talking about.

833
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Well, I'll get to that.

834
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,320
But I'm talking about, it's inevitable that the more you use something, the more likely

835
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
it is to break.

836
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,240
That's just a fact.

837
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,340
But do I think this number is that far off?

838
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Probably not.

839
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,160
I would say the real number is probably somewhere around a third.

840
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,760
But I still look at this and go, most companies that would have that type of failure rate

841
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,840
on some type of thing they put out, like a television, a CD player, a car, would recall

842
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
it.

843
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,120
They would be forced to recall it.

844
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
They can't.

845
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,240
It'd be bad PR.

846
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
And they've kind of-

847
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
And this is good PR?

848
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,960
Yes, it's good PR for them.

849
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,800
Because notice, even though it may have a 54% failure rate, people, they're still the

850
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,320
second largest console share in the United States.

851
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,760
People don't care because people will go out and buy a new console once their console breaks.

852
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,720
If it's out of warranty, they'll go buy a new one.

853
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
Because you know why?

854
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,240
Because the games are good.

855
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,840
They have a good library of games and people don't give a crap.

856
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,640
Well, see, it goes back to the system is only good as the games that are on it.

857
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,180
And you know what's, and actually that's probably the point as to, because I know there's been

858
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,480
people that have been asking, well, if you're so mad about it, why are you going to buy

859
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
another one?

860
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,240
And it's kind of like, well, dude, because I've invested all this money in the games,

861
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,920
not just the physical games and the, um, online games that selling them back.

862
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
That's, that's a waste of my money to just to buy them.

864
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,580
If I sold back all of my games to rebuy them on PS3, I would be able to buy like one fifth.

865
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,400
If that of the games on PS3, you know what I mean?

866
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,040
And plus fact of the matter is some games I want to play are only on Xbox.

867
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,200
You know what I mean?

868
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,280
So yeah, I do feel a little bit pigeonholed where if I'm not able to repair this, then

869
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,680
I'm going to have to just buy a new one.

870
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,640
I would think though that the failure rate is probably around that 54%.

871
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,880
I've had what I have had maybe a total of eight consoles and I think five of them died

872
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
at one point.

873
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,280
Well, it's interesting.

874
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,920
Everybody has their own ideas and everybody has their own interpretations of these results.

875
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,360
You know, I think we can all agree it ain't 54.2%.

876
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,360
That's obviously a skewed statistic, which way it's skewed.

877
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,560
That's open to interpretation.

878
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,440
Microsoft responded to it this week, by the way, and here was their response.

879
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,240
And this was in a statement to T-

880
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,040
I know what I said.

881
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
What's that?

882
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,960
Well, you tell me if this sounds like to you.

883
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Okay.

884
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,080
In a statement to TG Daily, Microsoft stands behind the Xbox 360 as a superior entertainment

885
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,800
console with one of the best warranties in the industry.

886
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,720
We are constantly improving the design, manufacture, and performance of the console through extensive

887
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,160
testing of potential sources of any problems.

888
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,360
Xbox 360 is pleased to maintain the title of most played console and the vast majority

889
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,440
of the Xbox 360 customers have enjoyed a terrific gaming and entertainment experience since

890
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,040
their first day and continue to day in and day out.

891
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,480
That entire statement is true.

892
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,400
But the thing is, they're not addressing the real problem.

893
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,680
That isn't the most smoke up my ass I've ever heard.

894
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,680
No, it's that-

895
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
It is.

896
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,000
That entire statement is true.

897
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But here's the thing though.

898
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,920
They're dancing around the real issue.

899
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
That's the problem.

900
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,160
Yes, they are continually upgrading their systems and making them better and stuff like

901
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
that.

902
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Yes, their warranty is pretty awesome.

903
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,000
Three years warranty is really cool.

904
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,160
And yes, that people do enjoy their console.

905
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,000
However, they failed to address that their first line of systems that came out the first

906
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,440
few revisions suck so bad that more than half of them have failed.

907
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,320
And in fact, I would be surprised if not all of them failing at some point.

908
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,960
The newer systems though, the newer revisions, the newer motherboards and stuff that they're

909
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
putting out, less likely to fail.

910
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Yes.

911
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:09,040
And probably up to par with, I'd say, the other consoles around that 10% range.

912
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,340
But a lot of people did buy to launch or at least relatively close to launch and all their

913
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,960
consoles are going to fail at some point or another and it's just a matter of time.

914
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,560
It's like a ticking time bomb.

915
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
That is the problem.

916
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,360
Yes, you're continually making them better, but you fucked up in the beginning and that's

917
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,080
a big problem and you needed to recall all of them and get them all back and give them

918
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,940
the new revisions.

919
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,460
That would be the proper thing to do.

920
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:43,000
I wasn't going to quite say that much, but I don't know.

921
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,720
It's a tricky issue.

922
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,200
In the age of the internet, in gaming, we haven't really seen something like this before,

923
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,900
but I'm sorry.

924
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:56,240
You can't tell me that the PS3 and the Wii failure rates are anything close to this.

925
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,240
Close to this.

926
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,560
Because they rushed to get it to market and yes, it benefited them in the fact that their

927
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,860
install base is a lot bigger, however, their hardware is kind of shoddy.

928
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,000
I do find it fascinating they dance around the statistic in their response.

929
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,500
They never deny it.

930
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Notice that.

931
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,320
In the response, they don't deny it at all.

932
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,100
I think they expected it.

933
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,520
But here's the thing, what they say at the end of their statement, as much as that's

934
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,040
blowing smoke up my ass, it's true.

935
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,860
The fact that they do have a choke hold on a lot of the big games out there on the market

936
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,600
right now that can only be played on Xbox 360 and that they are doing a lot of things

937
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:43,280
right in that regard outside of just the system itself is kind of hard to deny.

938
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,340
That's why I'm essentially, I guess some of you might say, taking it a little bit.

939
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:56,840
But at the same time, I think if you're a consumer out there and you haven't bought

940
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,200
a 360 yet and you're worried that, okay, if I buy a 360 it's going to fail, I think that

941
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,280
worry right now, it shouldn't be a worry because now the systems have gotten to the point though

942
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,200
where they aren't failing like they were doing before.

943
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,600
And I think it is safe to buy it now because of all the hardware revisions they've done.

944
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,440
What they really should have done is all those revisions before the console was released,

945
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,440
but hey, they made a huge mistake and now they're in the process of trying to pick up

946
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,240
the pieces and fixing the problem.

947
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,200
But yeah, will people forget about this?

948
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,280
Will people remember this for the next console launch?

949
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,060
Yeah, you better damn believe it and there will be a lot of people probably waiting and

950
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,300
seeing if there's going to be issues with their next console.

951
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,920
By the way, if you're curious what I decided to do with my Xbox 360, I am-

952
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,160
He's going to set it on fire and throw it off a cliff.

953
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
I might.

954
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:51,160
No, I decided I'm going to, although that would be kind of fun actually, but I'm going

955
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,160
to give it a try.

956
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,080
I'm going to let Loki try to fix it because he knows how to fix them apparently, so I

957
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,080
will let him try.

958
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,960
I have a 50% success rate here.

959
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,400
Well, I'll take my chance.

960
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,280
This way I don't have to ship it off and pay those costs or anything and Loki will do it

961
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
for free.

962
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Yep.

963
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,640
And I'll pay for parts or whatever.

964
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,080
Also, if it doesn't work, then I know Bobby has a friend that will buy for parts, so I

965
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,840
will send it to the junkyard to be scrapped at the pick and pull basically of Xbox 360s.

966
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,080
I will do that unless they don't want it because Loki ruins it, then I will set it on fire

967
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
and throw it off the cliff.

968
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,080
I'll try not to ruin it too much.

969
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,840
All right, try it please because I do want to send it off to the virtual pick and pull

970
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,880
if that happens.

971
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,440
And I will, if I have to because Loki can't fix it, not that I don't have faith in Loki,

972
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,440
but if Loki can't fix it, then I am not going to buy an Xbox 360 Elite.

973
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,920
I'm not going to wait for the price drop because I decided that was a stupid idea.

974
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,800
Why would I in turn give Microsoft more money for their high-end console?

975
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,400
Because the first one failed.

976
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
That was dumb.

977
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,960
That was an e-jerk reaction of mine.

978
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,120
I take it back.

979
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:01,440
I would instead buy the lowest, cheapest end Xbox 360 I can buy that's not used.

980
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
Because if I go for the $199 Xbox Arcade, I don't need a hard drive.

981
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
I have one.

982
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,800
I don't need the fancy black color or whatever.

983
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,320
The HDMI is on the arcades now.

984
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,360
I'm fine.

985
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,560
And then at least I'll have HDMI moving forward.

986
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,880
That's my plan.

987
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,680
And Bobby is saying that his friend will want it even ruined.

988
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
Great.

989
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,780
So Loki, have fun.

990
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,780
If you fix it, great.

991
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,640
If you don't, off to the pick and pull.

992
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,360
I'm hoping that we're on the positive end of my 50%.

993
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
Let's see.

994
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
We'll see.

995
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
Hey, I've got to tell you the one-

996
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,580
We'll update your win-loss ratio here on our Twitter.

997
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,120
And the one that did work, that was successful, still works today.

998
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
It still works.

999
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
It's awesome.

1000
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,880
I keep waiting for it to fail again, but-

1001
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,440
I will donate my 360 to science.

1002
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
That is what I'm doing.

1003
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
Alright.

1004
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,000
Well, hey, question.

1005
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,600
When you did your repairs, was your failure rate closer to the beginning or closer to

1006
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
the end?

1007
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
It was the end.

1008
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
Uh-huh.

1009
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,200
The first one worked flawlessly.

1010
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,400
Second one, not so much.

1011
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,240
Well, that's okay, because you know what?

1012
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,560
You can still be in business, because your failure rate is close to Microsoft's failure

1013
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,560
rate, and they're still kicking.

1014
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Exactly.

1015
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,560
So you know what?

1016
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
Off to Loki's repair shop.

1017
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,080
And I blame their console for my failure anyways.

1018
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Alright.

1019
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,920
Let's move on, because I'm just going to get more angsty comments if I continue on this

1020
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,000
whole tirade with the 360 and so forth.

1021
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,560
It is a tricky line here.

1022
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:33,840
I do feel a sense of, damn it, shit, fuck, with the whole Xbox 360 red ringing.

1023
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,320
But at the same time, I do understand shit happens.

1024
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,120
But it just makes me- I don't know if angry is the right word.

1025
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,120
It makes me irritated.

1026
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Did you try doing it without the-

1027
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
Shut up.

1028
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,520
It makes me irritated that so many people are having the same problem, and yet Microsoft

1029
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,360
just says, well, but we're still cool.

1030
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
We're still the best.

1031
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,280
Did you try it without the hard drive?

1032
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
You know what?

1033
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,280
I didn't.

1034
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,920
I just decided I've been having, in my personal life, I've been having the most shitty week

1035
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
you could possibly imagine.

1036
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm faking it really well on the show tonight.

1037
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,240
Here's the thing, is that I just decided I'm not going to make my week worse by even trying

1038
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
that 360 this week.

1039
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Alright.

1040
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
No problem.

1041
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
I'll take care of it.

1042
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,240
I promise.

1043
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
I will.

1044
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
Well, how about other stuff, huh?

1045
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Yes.

1046
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:19,920
How about some stuff about something that I particularly am sick of hearing about, but

1047
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,320
it is newsworthy.

1048
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
How about some World of Warcraft stuff?

1049
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Alright.

1050
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,040
For all of you addicts, pop the vein.

1051
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,040
It's time to go.

1052
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,480
Well, you know, they had the whole cataclysm, whatever the fuck thing that they're doing,

1053
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,680
and they have the new races, the goblin and wargun, which actually look kind of cool.

1054
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,040
I thought, like werewolves-

1055
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
Shocking.

1056
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,560
That's totally unexpected.

1057
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:51,240
And they've raised the cap to 85 for levels, but now they're going back and revamping old

1058
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,420
zones and changing them completely.

1059
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:01,440
Like since the big cataclysm thing, some areas are destroyed, and then some of the places

1060
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:09,240
like Desolace and the Barrens are becoming green.

1061
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,260
They're redesigning cities so that you can fly.

1062
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:21,040
And actually in Undercity 2, they are actually having more interaction with the terrain.

1063
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,800
You can have flooding happen.

1064
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,440
So also seven new zones.

1065
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:35,720
Like Uldum, Mount Hyjal, and the Sunken City, which is an undersea zone, so you get underwater

1066
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,800
mounts and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1067
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,680
Twilight Highlands, and Deepholm.

1068
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,060
Sounds very dwarfy in name.

1069
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,640
So all the rumors we heard about last week were essentially true.

1070
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Yeah.

1071
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,040
It's a new profession, archaeology.

1072
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,080
Oh, so you can be your Indiana Jones, but a goblin.

1073
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,000
You know what, that actually would be enough to have me try it out.

1074
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The archaeology edition.

1075
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Really?

1076
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, because I'd really like to see how something like that would enhance your character.

1077
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,840
It's been a while since I've played, but honestly though, I'm sticking with RO.

1078
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,400
I don't know if this is enough to get me back to WoW.

1079
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,520
I guess I have to see it when the expansion comes out.

1080
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Never say never.

1081
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,760
I said I would never go back to Final Fantasy XI, and I did for a month, so whatever.

1082
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,720
But you know, I do think it's interesting because they've been talking about revamping

1083
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:29,400
old Azeroth for a long time, and now they're going to do it and make you pay for it.

1084
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,120
But I mean, to be fair, it does sound like they're doing a lot to it, and from what I

1085
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,440
understand, even the free players, or I shouldn't say free players, but even those without the

1086
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,060
expansion will still get some of those benefits because Azeroth is going to change basically

1087
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,680
to accommodate this new expansion.

1088
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,640
So it's interesting.

1089
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,720
I do think some of the other things that they've talked about briefly, like the guild leveling

1090
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,880
and the guild charts and so forth, it will probably lead to more guild drama, but I do

1091
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
find it interesting.

1092
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,920
Well, there is some other stuff.

1093
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,320
There's a little bit more as far as the racial abilities for the new races.

1094
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,520
For Worgen, you can switch between human and Worgen form instantaneously at will.

1095
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,320
You have Dark Flight, which increases movement speed by 70% for 10 seconds with a 3 minute

1096
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,840
cooldown.

1097
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:25,200
Viciousness, you have Flare, and then Goblins are basically like the Ferengi of the Horde.

1098
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
They're the businessmen.

1099
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
Makes sense.

1100
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
Yeah, that's a good comparison.

1101
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,160
So you can...

1102
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
There's actually a...

1103
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
You kind of look like Qwark too.

1104
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,960
A skill called...

1105
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,480
I wonder if you can give them Umax.

1106
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
You know where...

1107
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Anyway.

1108
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,320
I wonder if they can make me a warp core breach.

1109
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,040
Do they have the lobes for business?

1110
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,480
God, it's so nerdy.

1111
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,280
But Best Deals Anywhere is one of their skills.

1112
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,700
Better Living Through Chemistry, which increases Alchemy skill by 15 points.

1113
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,800
And I like Time is Money.

1114
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,280
So it increases attack and casting speed by 1%.

1115
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:06,240
The Archeology skill gives you the ability to excavate hidden items in ruins.

1116
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:13,320
You can do research notes that let you unlock new abilities for the Path of the Titans character

1117
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,640
progression.

1118
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,980
So go flip that whip.

1119
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,120
I think personally as a WoW player, I think Goblins are annoying.

1120
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,880
I would never want to play as one.

1121
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,440
I was disappointed to hear that.

1122
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,760
Well the...

1123
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,640
For other stuff going on with that, with the new dungeons, I actually have the level list

1124
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,840
up for the 5-man dungeons.

1125
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,800
You know, I don't want to say 5-man, I'm going to say 5-character dungeons.

1126
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,040
That works for me.

1127
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,320
Or a party of 5.

1128
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Or Sentai.

1129
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Ahhhh.

1130
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Anyway.

1131
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,680
Grim Battle is 85.

1132
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,920
Skywall is 80-82.

1133
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,160
Abyssal Maw is 80-83 and an 82-84.

1134
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,040
Deep Home is 80-83.

1135
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,320
Uldum is 83-84 and an 85.

1136
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,080
Blackrock Caverns for level 85.

1137
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:14,560
And then they do 5-person versions of 2 of the older dungeons.

1138
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,960
The Deadmines has a level 85 version and Shadowfang Keep.

1139
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
Also new...

1140
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,040
And for those that don't know, those are some beloved old school instances from original

1141
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,400
WoW.

1142
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:34,920
And then for new raids, 2 of them have been revealed.

1143
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:42,540
One is the Firelands, and one of them is called Nefarian's Throne Room, which features Blackwing

1144
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:47,440
Lairs and Boss Nefarian, hence the name Har Har.

1145
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,320
I do think it's interesting, this whole heroic Deadmines thing, because if you play original

1146
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,240
Deadmines at the level you're supposed to be playing Deadmines at, it takes forever.

1147
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,680
So it's going to be interesting to see if they scale it back so Deadmines does not take

1148
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,040
as long to get through, or if it's still going to be like an epic 4 hour run.

1149
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,520
Well they're also putting in, with the 3.3 patch, there's a panel that's cross-server

1150
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:19,160
LFG for 5-man dungeons, so you can get more people together to do.

1151
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
They're also...

1152
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
That's needed, actually.

1153
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,960
There's also new race combinations available now.

1154
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:30,120
You have Human Hunter, Orc Mage, Night Elf Mage, Blood Elf Warrior, Dwarf Shaman, Dwarf

1155
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:36,560
Mage, Undead Hunter, Tauren Paladin, Tauren Priest, Gnome Priest, and Troll Druid.

1156
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:43,720
There's a stat overhaul, the stats are being simplified.

1157
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:52,520
So you have your spell power, MP5 armor penetration, all of that's gone.

1158
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,880
It's really just a whole bunch of them, it's actually all up on the WoW page.

1159
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:04,160
For other class changes, just look on the panel on your thing, it's all there.

1160
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:12,320
Flying mounts are available in Azeroth, so you can fly around all you want to.

1161
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,440
And thank heavens.

1162
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,800
You have your guild progression, they actually have a numerical method now.

1163
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:26,760
You have rated Battlegrounds, new PvP changes, a bunch of other crap.

1164
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,280
And a bunch of other stuff that I personally don't care about.

1165
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,280
It sounds like it's going to be a pretty good expansion, a good swift kick in the pants

1166
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,360
to the game.

1167
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,280
That's one thing Blizzard likes to do, they really like to change that game up.

1168
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,720
That game is nothing like it used to be, you know what I mean?

1169
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:47,840
I think that that's, honestly, the whole point that I see with that is, this is how, going

1170
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,680
through their head, well, people get tired of the same old, same old, same old, same

1171
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,680
old.

1172
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,080
You know, people are going to leave when they get bored with it.

1173
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,200
Well, why not give them no excuse to get bored, why not make something new?

1174
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:06,400
However, the thing that bored me was the way the game plays in general, and the fact that

1175
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,120
there's a bunch of idiots playing it, so that's still not enough to- I mean, I would like

1176
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,120
to-

1177
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,360
You probably have to find the right click to play with.

1178
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,160
I would like to check it out.

1179
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,320
You know, I think I might consider looking at it.

1180
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,200
You know, I certainly haven't installed World of Warcraft on this computer, and I still

1181
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,200
have my account, you know.

1182
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:34,480
It might be worth it for me to check out, but certainly not until I'm, you know, healed

1183
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,160
up enough to be able to play a game that requires a keyboard.

1184
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,160
And we'll see.

1185
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,680
I have other MMOs I want to check out for now.

1186
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,680
Please play R.O. with me.

1187
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,000
I want to look at Aion, Aion's out next month, I'm definitely going to pick that up.

1188
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I want to play that.

1189
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's out next month, you should.

1190
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Check it out.

1191
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Aion-

1192
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Star Trek!

1193
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And then Star Trek next year, and Final Fantasy XIV.

1194
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Yeah.

1195
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,840
No, some of the gameplay video came out for that from Gamescom, ho ho ho ho ho.

1196
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
That looks sweet.

1197
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Did you see it?

1198
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
Doesn't it look sweet?

1199
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
Uh huh.

1200
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,840
I am sorry, but I am all over Final Fantasy XIV.

1201
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
Star Trek!

1202
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Because I have to-

1203
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
That looks great.

1204
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:14,840
I have to make the O.L.A.rian, and I've already started picking races that I want to make

1205
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,240
the O.L.A.rians from.

1206
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,880
Well you go on with your bad self.

1207
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,880
They're going to be orange.

1208
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,400
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

1209
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,480
Well speaking of something that leaked out way early anyways, the PS3 Slim has finally

1210
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
been announced.

1211
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,400
Oh my god, didn't know that was coming.

1212
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,320
But yes, it is coming out and oddly enough, or I guess it's not really odd at all, but

1213
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,120
you remember all those box shots and stuff that were being leaked out and that kind of

1214
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
stuff?

1215
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,120
Yeah, those were all authentic.

1216
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:53,800
So, the new Slim system is 30% smaller, or actually 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and uses

1217
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,200
34% less power.

1218
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:05,680
It comes with a 120GB hard drive, and of course, at the new price of $299, and that is actually

1219
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:13,600
going to be released supposedly in the first week of September, but you know, according

1220
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,520
to Gamestop, it's actually supposed to be coming out next week, or as early as next

1221
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:27,960
week, but basically we'll be replacing the 80GB system and the 160GB system that they

1222
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,680
had out already.

1223
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,920
Which just goes to prove that whenever you try to put out a cease and desist, you're

1224
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,200
only validating the material.

1225
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:44,040
Yep, and on top of all this, they dropped the 80GB system to $299 as well, and they

1226
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:49,800
also dropped the 160GB system to $399, which begs the question, why the hell did you do

1227
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,800
that?

1228
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,800
At least in that order.

1229
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,960
I mean, they totally don't get it.

1230
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,760
Why would you drop the price of those two systems?

1231
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,400
I understand to clear them out.

1232
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
That's fine.

1233
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,720
That makes perfect sense.

1234
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,720
But then you announce the new system at the same time.

1235
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:09,880
Okay, great, so now I have these new Slim 120GB systems in my store with 80GB systems that

1236
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,880
are the same price.

1237
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
Duh!

1238
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,920
Am I going to buy the new system?

1239
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,280
Does it have a larger hard drive for the same price?

1240
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,080
Yeah, I think I will.

1241
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,280
And at the same time, would you really spend an extra $100 for an extra 40GB on your hard

1242
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,560
drive?

1243
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,560
Probably not.

1244
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,760
So you've just rendered those two other systems completely useless.

1245
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,560
Maybe they'll bundle in a game or a movie?

1246
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,560
They bundle in a game.

1247
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,360
They bundle in the first Uncharted with the first one, with the 160GB system.

1248
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,720
But really, is that still worth the extra?

1249
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,000
You're basically paying for the game and then a little bit extra for the hard drive, so

1250
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,360
that's not really a good deal anyways.

1251
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,200
And you can probably buy Uncharted for cheap anyways.

1252
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,240
Yeah, I don't know all that.

1253
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,080
There's also been a discovery, apparently when they were registering the Slim, I guess,

1254
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:01,040
with the FCC and all this, you know, trademarks and that kind of stuff, they were using false

1255
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,040
business names.

1256
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,480
I guess Sand Dollar Enterprise, some fictitious businesses.

1257
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,880
Thank you Sony, now you have been found out and people are going to be looking for that

1258
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,880
crap now.

1259
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,840
So, and they did, and they now found that there's also been an FCC, I guess, filing

1260
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:25,480
for another SKU that's going to be with a 250GB hard drive, so that's probably coming

1261
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,480
later on.

1262
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,760
So, great!

1263
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,720
Now we know that there's a larger hard drive system coming out later on, why the hell are

1264
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,480
we going to, you know, if you're really not in a hurry to buy a system, you'll probably

1265
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,480
want to wait.

1266
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,200
Well, this other one might be more money too.

1267
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
It probably will be.

1268
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,280
Plus, I still don't really know, what do I put on this hard drive?

1269
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,080
All those games installs, because, you know, most of the games that are released now on

1270
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:53,200
BluRay do require an install because their drive is slow.

1271
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:00,880
And the other thing too, in case you're wondering, the system did get rid of the alternative

1272
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,680
operating system install as well, so if you're thinking about installing Linux on this Slim

1273
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,800
system, you are dead wrong, that will be happening.

1274
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
So uh...

1275
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
They'll find a way.

1276
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,400
So way to go, Sony, removing features from your system as well now.

1277
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,960
We know they're going to find a way, the Linux community is stubborn.

1278
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:25,480
Plus, how many people really, honestly, are getting the Playstation 3 to install Linux

1279
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
on it?

1280
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,600
And it's not like the fat ones are hard to find.

1281
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,120
It's only offering them a challenge now.

1282
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:37,080
I mean, seriously, I mean, people may have been okay with not doing it because, you know,

1283
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:43,000
it's readily available now, but the thing is, why would you remove that?

1284
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,080
I understand that you don't need to necessarily do that, but really, did that cost anything

1285
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,080
to them?

1286
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,080
No?

1287
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
Not really?

1288
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,560
Oh, the other funny thing too is it takes two seconds longer to boot up each time, for

1289
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,560
whatever reason.

1290
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,560
Strange.

1291
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Yeah.

1292
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,560
Hmm.

1293
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,280
Maybe it must be some of the new chips they're using or something.

1294
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,280
It's the new firmware.

1295
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,280
Ah.

1296
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,000
Well, speaking of the new firmware, that is coming out soon, 3.0 Firmware is going to

1297
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,240
be doing a total revamp at the cross-media bar, and adding a new What's New section.

1298
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,160
It's replacing the information board, and I guess now, whenever you start your PS3,

1299
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,960
you're going to get this interactive Playstation news, whatever that means.

1300
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,120
It'll actually be under the Playstation Network icon, and you can see the latest game, video,

1301
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,400
Playstation Network news release in some type of animated format.

1302
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,960
I'm assuming that's like that whole, when you hover your mouse over, or not the mouse,

1303
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,360
but you know what I mean, when you have the thing in place, you can kind of see in the

1304
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,520
background, some of the stuff, except now you can interact with that background, if

1305
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,640
that makes sense at all.

1306
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,160
Also, a status indicator is coming.

1307
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,640
This will be located in the top right corner of your Playstation 3.

1308
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:52,280
It'll show your user icon that you have, however many friends that you have that are online,

1309
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,200
and also, most importantly, a little mail indicator if you have any new messages.

1310
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
So, that's pretty cool.

1311
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,760
Also, we'll have a little scrolling tick bar with the latest news from PSN, which I think

1312
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,160
they already kind of have.

1313
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,720
So, that'll just be adapted into this new status indicator.

1314
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,520
Also, apparently, now when you hit the PS button, no longer will the battery life indicator

1315
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,000
sit right on top of the clock.

1316
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,760
You know what's kind of cool, though, is those new dynamic themes that they have.

1317
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,280
Have you seen those?

1318
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,120
They're animated themes now, that you can have in the background, so like they have

1319
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,600
a little big planet one where the Sackboy's running on, you know, a planet.

1320
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,240
And I guess you also now have premium avatars, they're saying.

1321
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,640
Animated avatars.

1322
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,600
Like your little icons that you have?

1323
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,240
Yeah, we'll be animated now.

1324
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,240
Interesting.

1325
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,680
The friends list is getting also reformatted.

1326
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,080
Shortcuts to the Playstation store, because naturally they want to make it easier for

1327
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,720
you to buy stuff, and apparently a big change coming to trophies.

1328
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,880
With 3.0 firmware, game developers will now be able to modify how trophies are displayed

1329
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,160
for add-on content.

1330
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,600
So apparently you still have the list combined when you're looking at the Playstation network

1331
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,800
or what have you, but I guess the developers have the freedom to use subcategories and

1332
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,800
all this stuff.

1333
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Could be interesting.

1334
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,800
Well, that's cool.

1335
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,240
Did it add a trophy room that they promised us years ago for this thing?

1336
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,160
Yeah, but that was a home update, wasn't it?

1337
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
Well, yeah.

1338
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
But still.

1339
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
Where's my trophy room?

1340
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,360
I'm just kind of curious what ever happened to that.

1341
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,800
I guess they had some big problems, I don't know.

1342
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Oh, I know what it is.

1343
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,840
Let's promise and then wait to deliver.

1344
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:29,920
Sg100Matt in our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com asks an interesting question about Playstation.

1345
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,800
Why is it that with each new incuration of the PS3, it keeps losing features?

1346
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,640
It's lost backwards compatibility, flash card reader, fewer USB slots, and now the inability

1347
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,000
to install an OS onto it.

1348
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,240
Is it just me, or shouldn't a console evolve with each new SKU?

1349
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,920
From the looks of it, it's devolving so much that we will lose controller support in two

1350
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
years.

1351
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,520
Obviously, that part was sarcastic.

1352
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,800
They're dropping stuff out of the system to cut the cost of the system because that's

1353
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,520
the only way they can drop it to $299 without losing $500 or whatever on each system.

1354
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,480
But I thought backwards compatibility was all software based now.

1355
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,080
And it's not the whole PS2 in your PS3 like it was at the beginning.

1356
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,280
I thought so too, but for whatever reason, maybe licensing.

1357
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,080
I can't imagine it would be licensing though because Linux is free.

1358
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,000
I mean it's not even really, I mean you don't even have to...

1359
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,920
You're buying, or you're not really buying, you're downloading Linux anyways off the internet

1360
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,160
and installing it to it.

1361
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,280
It's not like it's already there or something like that.

1362
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,400
Alright, we got one more story from Jamie, then we're gonna get into some release dates.

1363
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,600
Um, I got a pony.

1364
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,600
There's my story.

1365
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,600
No, I'm kidding.

1366
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Congrats.

1367
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,200
Um, well you know me, a big comic book nerd.

1368
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,200
Well this is news that makes me particularly happy as long as they get good comics.

1369
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:49,160
There's a digital comic reader that's gonna be on the PSP in December.

1370
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:56,960
They actually are working with Marvel to have hundreds of comics available, which is actually,

1371
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,040
it really goes in along with what Marvel's been doing lately with their digital comics

1372
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,880
and their motion comic that they've been doing lately.

1373
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,200
So um, but this is pretty cool.

1374
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:17,440
You get also Archie and Image comics and um, but they're not saying though if it's gonna

1375
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,440
be a free upgrade or if it's something that you have to buy or if you have to buy the

1376
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,440
comics or whatever.

1377
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,080
I'm sure you have to buy the comics themselves.

1378
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,120
Well I mean, you know what I mean, if you get a subscription service or something.

1379
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Oh okay.

1380
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:34,640
So they haven't listed the specifics, but we should be hearing something before too

1381
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,600
long.

1382
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
What do you guys think?

1383
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,320
Is this something as a comic book fan you uh, are really excited about, Dark Saga?

1384
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,480
Um, well I like actually buying comics.

1385
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:54,520
I mean I love going to the store and I mean I, I read a bunch of digital comics anyway,

1386
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:01,800
but you know what, actually now that I think about it, I will, I don't really use our PSP

1387
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,080
that much, but if I did, I would be interested in it because I actually have downloaded a

1388
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,200
number of comics um, on my iPhone.

1389
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:17,240
I was, I read like the first uh, three graphic novels of Bone on my uh, on my uh, iPhone

1390
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:23,120
and I downloaded the uh, Star Trek uh, movie countdown, the tie-in that was supposed to

1391
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:29,360
be the prequel to the events in the movie and I, I thought that was very convenient.

1392
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,160
It was definitely cheaper than going and you know, paying three bucks for the issue.

1393
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:39,960
Um, but then again, I've gone right out and I've bought the, I'm reading the, the Nero

1394
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,600
comics about you know, the deleted scenes pretty much for what happened in the movie.

1395
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,080
Um, it's, it's a good idea.

1396
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
I think it's a good idea.

1397
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:52,120
I think that a lot of people use their PSPs as a multimedia tool and I think it's going

1398
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,760
to be a really good thing and Marvel I know would have to be behind it because they have

1399
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,280
been pushing the whole digital comic thing, you know, pretty hardcore, so.

1400
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,640
Um, Akdeft in our chat room says, I hope it's subscription based.

1401
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,720
SH-2100 Matt says, what does DC Comics have to say about this?

1402
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,640
They did make the DC Universe game PS3 exclusive and now they're supporting its competition.

1403
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,560
But this doesn't strike me as the type of thing that DC Comics like, couldn't get in

1404
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,040
on as well if they wanted to.

1405
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Yeah.

1406
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,360
I, I think that, well and on top of that, you know, DC and Marvel have teamed up before,

1407
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,720
I mean, for a number of, of things, I think that, you know, DC would have to hop in on

1408
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,560
this and it's, it would be good for all the, the businesses and you know what I would actually

1409
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,120
like to see, is see, um, some of the indie comic companies be included in this.

1410
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,120
You know, um, maybe even a web comic reader.

1411
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:46,120
Well, they are going to have, um, it's not just, um, Marvel though.

1412
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,920
Well, so I said Archie and Image are involved as well, but I didn't mention anything on

1413
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,920
DC.

1414
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,200
I wouldn't see why DC couldn't jump in on that.

1415
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,800
I don't know.

1416
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,840
They're more than welcome, I guess.

1417
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,320
Just haven't done it yet.

1418
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,320
Hmm.

1419
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:07,680
Alright, well, let's move on to some release dates before the, uh, comics get here and

1420
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,880
we lose Dark Soccer because she'll be too busy reading them.

1421
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,000
Alright, well, this week, um, we've got a few things coming out, um, actually some good

1422
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
stuff.

1423
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,560
The Metroid Prime Trilogy on the Wii is, uh, making its way out and of course you get three

1424
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,840
games to the price of one there, uh, even though they've all been released before.

1425
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,000
Uh, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box making its way out on DS this week.

1426
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,760
Uh, Raven Squad Hidden Dagger on Xbox 360, um, also on PC.

1427
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:45,120
Cursed Mountain on the Nintendo Wii, uh, Sudoku Ball Detective on DS, also Harvest Moon Frantic

1428
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,720
Farming on DS, kind of the sequel to Puzzle Day Harvest Moon.

1429
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:58,560
Um, also this week, um, Batman Arkham Asylum making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

1430
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:08,240
360, uh, Fallout 3 Broken Seal and Point Lookout available on PC and on Xbox 360, Dissidia

1431
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:14,680
Final Fantasy making its way out on the PSP, which will be really awesome, Real Fishing

1432
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:20,760
Angler's Dream on the Nintendo Wii, uh, this is going to be an excellent title for the

1433
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,760
DS.

1434
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,400
Uh, The Click, Diss, and Make Up, and of course I'm being sarcastic there, it's probably going

1435
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,400
to really suck.

1436
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:35,000
Um, same with this one, Wizards of Waverly Place, uh, based on the Disney, I don't know,

1437
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,320
teen comedy, um, Emergency Room Real Life Rescues on the DS, um, Harvest Moon Magical

1438
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:52,960
Melee being ported to the Wii, Mana Kimia 2 Fall of Alchemy getting its limited edition

1439
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,640
on PlayStation 2, and that would be it.

1440
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,960
Alright, let's move into some Japanese release dates, and after a couple of slow weeks, we

1441
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,520
finally have a pretty busy week over in Japan, uh, look at the Xbox 360 Dream Club comes

1442
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,260
out on the Xbox 360, and I'm sorry, I have to read the description of this game, uh,

1443
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,840
it certainly does not sound like something we will be getting over here, but it looks

1444
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,600
uh, all kinds of awesome.

1445
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,040
Do you have a pure heart?

1446
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,040
Welcome in.

1447
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,400
Beautiful women are bowing at you as you sweep across the luxurious lounge, pick your favorite

1448
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,820
hostess and drink with them to get to know them more.

1449
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,560
You have an annual ticket to the Dream Club.

1450
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,840
In this 365 days, enjoy the company of these ladies fully.

1451
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,160
Earn money, plan your schedule, and improve your alcohol capacity.

1452
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,280
Chat with the ladies to persuade them to drink with you.

1453
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,800
They may divulge secrets about themselves if you prove to be a good conversationist

1454
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,920
and drinker.

1455
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,960
The ladies are not just companions, they are performers as well.

1456
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,320
Watch them sing and dance.

1457
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,800
The better you know them, the more songs they will perform.

1458
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:50,120
Be sure to get to the club during the special event nights instead of the usual maid outfits.

1459
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,800
The ladies will welcome you in get-ups such as yukatas and bikinis.

1460
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,320
Have a lovely clubbing experience.

1461
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,060
Get your VIP card today.

1462
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,880
That game again is Dream Club from D3, and it sounds pretty fucking amazing and I want

1463
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
to play it.

1464
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,600
You know if it's D3, we may get that over here, because D3, they're, um, likely to put

1465
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,920
out crazy shit like that over here, especially since the women in this game from the screen,

1466
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,760
based on the screenshots, have giant boobies.

1467
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,760
Of course.

1468
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,440
Another game with chicks with giant boobies, also on the Xbox 360 this week, Memories Off

1469
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
6 Next Relation.

1470
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,640
Yeah, Next Relation.

1471
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,840
Well, hopefully, she's not related if, uh, if it's Memories Are Off.

1472
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,640
Uh, moving on to other consoles on the PlayStation 3.

1473
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,680
Grand Theft Auto 4 gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

1474
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,360
By the way, Fear 2 also making its way out to Japan this week.

1475
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,880
That was also on the Xbox 360, just so you know.

1476
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,300
Uh, also Kane & Lynch Dead Men gets a price reduction in Japan this week, but those other

1477
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,760
two games I mentioned look to be exclusive to the Xbox 360.

1478
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,360
However, on the Nintendo Wii, you have a game called Tamaran coming out this week from Ignition

1479
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,880
Entertainment, and if we move on back to the PlayStation 2, there's a couple of games coming

1480
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,880
out.

1481
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:08,720
Uh, Gendai Daisenryaku Ishoku Soku Hatsu comes out this week.

1482
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,080
I have no idea what the hell that is, but it has something to do with balance, is in

1483
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,080
the title?

1484
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,640
No, it looks like a war game.

1485
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:20,960
Looks like, uh, looks like actually kind of like a, oh, looks like kind of like an RTS

1486
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,840
type of strategy, it looks like a strategy command and conquer-ish type of game on the

1487
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,840
PlayStation 2.

1488
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,080
Uh, Memories Off 6 is getting a PlayStation 2 port.

1489
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Go figure.

1490
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,000
Uh, Tomb Raider Anniversary and Legend to get price reductions if you never caught those

1491
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,160
on the PlayStation 2.

1492
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:41,440
On the Nintendo DS, Supa Robo Gakuen comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.

1493
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,800
Gakuen is high school.

1494
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,680
That Supa, so it's Robot High School, is that what this is?

1495
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,680
Yeah, is it G-A-K-U-E-N?

1496
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,680
Yes it is.

1497
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,060
Yeah, that would be high school.

1498
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,760
So yeah, looks like Robot High School is the game here, and I'm trying to look at screenshots

1499
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,340
but can't, but it looks like a little type of a strategy type game coming out this week

1500
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,680
on the DS.

1501
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:08,660
And uh, lastly, looking at the PSP real quick, um, well you can import in Japan the English

1502
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:14,120
language version of Final Fantasy Dissida if you, if you want, because obviously that's

1503
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,160
a big game we're getting out here this week.

1504
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,440
I do want to point out though, Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is out in Japan this week.

1505
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,120
That is the new Soul Calibur game on PSP, so I bet we do have some hardcore Soul Calibur

1506
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,280
fans that will want to import that.

1507
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,280
Probably not.

1508
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,880
We can then get that actually.

1509
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,880
Fine.

1510
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,040
That's going to do it for PSP releases and Japanese releases.

1511
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:40,680
Well for our UK releases, on the 26th we have Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao, and

1512
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,000
Watchmen, The End is Nigh Part 2 on Xbox 360, both of those.

1513
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,040
On the 27th, um, for PS3 is Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao.

1514
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:57,080
On the 28th we have Allied Ace Pilots on DS, Batman Arkham Asylum, Xbox 360 and PS3,

1515
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:05,920
King of Fighters XII, meh, um, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on DS, Soul Calibur Broken,

1516
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:13,320
uh, Destiny on PSP, um, Supercar Challenge, and World Cup of Pool.

1517
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,240
What is it?

1518
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,240
World Cup of Pool?

1519
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,240
Pool.

1520
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,240
Oh.

1521
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,240
Let me, let me make sure.

1522
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:24,040
It makes it sound like it's a cup full of pool, but I'm, it's like chlorine flavored

1523
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,040
water, but I'm assuming it's...

1524
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,040
I'm a sinking cup of poo.

1525
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,160
I'm assuming it's like a swimming game or something.

1526
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,160
Cup of poo.

1527
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,160
I hope.

1528
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,160
Ew.

1529
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,160
If it's a cup of poo.

1530
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,160
Two girls, World Cup.

1531
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,680
La la la la la.

1532
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,360
Um, anyways, I don't know how to follow that.

1533
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,240
But um, we'll talk about the PlayStation Network.

1534
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:51,320
Sony, one of the things they announced while they were talking about, you know, secret

1535
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:55,280
console revisions and stuff like that.

1536
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,320
Is that they're...

1537
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,880
This was also something that was totally not rumored to be announced at, you know, Gamescom.

1538
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:08,520
But Sony introduced minis, which are byte-sized downloads, I guess, that are on the PlayStation

1539
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,520
Network.

1540
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,000
They're gonna be available for the PSP and the PSP Go.

1541
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And basically these titles will have 100 megabyte size limits.

1542
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,560
They'll be exclusive to the PlayStation Network.

1543
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:25,240
And basically they will start on October 1st, which is the same day that the PSP Go is really

1544
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,480
released.

1545
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,400
And they will apparently be less costly to develop for.

1546
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,420
And cost less to gamers, of course.

1547
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,920
No real prices have been announced yet.

1548
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:41,200
They plan on having 15 at launch and 50 by the end of the year.

1549
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,600
And some of the titles that they did mention were coming out include Tetris, Field Runners,

1550
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,960
Heroes of Sparta, and Minigore.

1551
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,760
And once again, goes back to the question, why exactly would I need a PSP Go?

1552
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:03,320
Because, you know, if they had made this exclusive for the PSP Go, that might make it a little

1553
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,560
bit worth it because then...

1554
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,440
But if they hadn't, you would have bitched about it.

1555
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,440
And I would have bitched about it.

1556
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,800
We all would have bitched about it.

1557
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,680
Because, you know, it doesn't sound like...

1558
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:16,200
It's like there's no hardware feature that, you know, there's no reason these games can't

1559
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,560
be on the original PSP.

1560
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,560
So why not?

1561
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,560
Exactly.

1562
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,280
Which, you know, begs the question, why would I buy the PSP Go?

1563
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,800
Why would anybody buy the PSP Go other than the fact that it has a sliding screen?

1564
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,040
Is that really worth more money?

1565
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,740
I will buy a PSP Go when the price drops.

1566
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,380
And it won't take long.

1567
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,080
I bet you anything it will not take long.

1568
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,920
It may be 2010, but it won't take long.

1569
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,920
No.

1570
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,920
And I'll get...

1571
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,520
When the price of the PSP Go matches the price of the PSP, which has to happen eventually,

1572
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,520
I will buy one.

1573
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,080
You know what they're going to do?

1574
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,480
They're going to get rid of the original PSP.

1575
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,480
And then they're going to make you buy that.

1576
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,880
Of course, it's not going to happen anytime soon, because you've got, like, bundles now

1577
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,200
for this idea.

1578
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,160
You've got a bundle for Gran Turismo coming out in September.

1579
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:06,920
You've got a bundle with Assassin's Creed coming out, you know, in November.

1580
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,780
There's no reason that you can't find a PSP 3000.

1581
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:13,920
Alpha Catanagram in chat says, I would buy a PSP Go when the price drop occurs and use

1582
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,620
it as a belt buckle.

1583
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,620
Actually sounds kind of awesome.

1584
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,520
Have you ever seen those belt buckles with, like, the scrolling text on them?

1585
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,440
And like, it gets everybody to look at your crotch?

1586
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,920
You can order those at ThinkGeek.

1587
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,920
I've seen those before.

1588
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,240
The LED belt buckles.

1589
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,240
Yeah.

1590
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,240
Kind of cool.

1591
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,560
Imagine having a PSP Go, like, showing a little movie on your crotch.

1592
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,760
It'd be fun.

1593
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,720
Which is actually footage of your crotch.

1594
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,720
You nasty.

1595
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,720
Which would be fun.

1596
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,120
Well, did they ever say what's going to happen with my UMDs?

1597
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
How I'm going to put my UMDs on my Go?

1598
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:49,200
No, but I read a funny article by GameStop, you know, they were saying that they expect

1599
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,560
them to be traded in.

1600
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,320
Not that there's going to be an official program, it's just that people are going to be so,

1601
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,560
you know, I don't know, enamored with PSP Go that they're just going to, you know, throw

1602
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:05,800
all their UMDs out and re-buy the content again because they love Sony so much.

1603
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,800
Right.

1604
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,800
Yeah.

1605
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,240
Well, I'm sure there are some fanboys that will, but I just don't see it being an epidemic.

1606
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,480
No, it's, I'm sure that people would do that because, you know, obviously Sony's not giving

1607
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:24,560
them a way to, and you know, my thing is that at the same time, if you do own an original

1608
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,560
PSP system, and they may just say, you know, fuck you, you own an original PSP system,

1609
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,480
why the hell do we need a method for you to, you know, dump your UMDs on there, just buy

1610
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,920
new games, or, I don't know, just don't buy a new system because you have a PSP system

1611
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
already.

1612
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,320
Why would you buy another system, you idiot?

1613
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
That's just my opinion there.

1614
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,240
I don't know, yeah, I'm just still not seeing the reasons to jump ship.

1615
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:57,000
The Go, though, I think is, would be good for people who don't already own.

1616
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,160
Even then, it's not the right price.

1617
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,060
I would say if you don't own a PSP, buy a PSP.

1618
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:07,480
You don't need the PSP Go yet, there's nothing that super that it gets you unless you really

1619
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,560
need a quiet system or something, I don't know.

1620
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,440
And there are ways you can run stuff off your memory card even now.

1621
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:19,580
I mean, no, legit ways, actually, I mean, you can still purchase all those games online

1622
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:24,160
if you do want to do digital downloads, just buy your own memory card.

1623
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:32,440
What do you want to bet that half of the games in this mini thing are virtual console rehashes,

1624
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:38,320
you know, old games sold yet again, Galaga on my PSP?

1625
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:43,200
They already have PlayStation Network games that are, you know, independent titles.

1626
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,440
They're like PlayStation Network games, like Super Stardust and stuff like that.

1627
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,440
How's that any different?

1628
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,100
Okay, the file sizes are smaller, they're gonna be cheaper, whoop the shit, okay?

1629
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,180
Just make them cheaper and make the file sizes smaller.

1630
01:25:56,180 --> 01:26:00,360
You don't need to necessarily make it a whole new category of games, I guess if you want

1631
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:05,640
to draw more attention to the PSP or something, you can do that, which is what they did, but

1632
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,060
I don't know.

1633
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:11,600
Making something cheaper and, you know, cheaper to develop for doesn't really, I don't know,

1634
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,320
doesn't really warrant them putting another bullet point in their system, I guess.

1635
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,920
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week, and I

1636
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,600
want to talk about a classic band, of course, the Beatles.

1637
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,120
Rumor was this week that a SingStar version of the Beatles was going to be coming out

1638
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,960
around the time that the Beatles rock band was coming out, and it turns out, I guess

1639
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,880
that was a British gaming outlet that reported the whole SingStar Beatles coming out, but

1640
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,360
it is not true.

1641
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,140
MTV Games and Harmonics came out this week and said, nope, we have the exclusive rights

1642
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,580
to create music games based on the Beatles.

1643
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,880
They have an exclusive partnership with Apple Core Limited, so there will be no SingStar

1644
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,880
Beatles.

1645
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,520
So why this rumor then?

1646
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:56,460
Apparently they are thinking about a version of the Beatles rock band that would be the

1647
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,640
game, and only microphones.

1648
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,800
So basically it would be a singing version of the game, no instruments.

1649
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,400
Beatles karaoke revolution.

1650
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,980
Well, it's still rock band, it's just a singing version of it, so you don't have the instruments,

1651
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,960
you just have the singing parts.

1652
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,380
To be fair, you know, again, it's about options, it goes back to what we were talking about

1653
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:19,760
earlier in the show, it's just another way to buy the game, and you know what, there

1654
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,520
are some people that don't really want all those plastic instruments.

1655
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:30,440
And I could see this really being aimed at the Beatles fans who are wanting to have the

1656
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,640
game, but they don't want all this plastic instrument crap in their house.

1657
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,480
Those people are communists.

1658
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,480
But I understand.

1659
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
I'm kidding.

1660
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,920
It might be a small audience, but it's an audience, and certainly they want to sell

1661
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,160
this game to as many people as possible.

1662
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,160
That's true.

1663
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,440
Or perhaps you already own all the instruments and everything and you just want some extra

1664
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,880
microphones so you can do your three part harmonies.

1665
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,160
This is actually a certainly plausible outcome as well.

1666
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,740
So no singing star Beatles, but you know, hey, rock band Beatles, it's not like it looks

1667
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,740
that bad or anything.

1668
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,040
It looks pretty awesome, actually.

1669
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,080
I'm really looking forward to it.

1670
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,240
And if they are planning on releasing this, they sure as hell haven't told anyone yet.

1671
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,560
Well, this might also only be in Britain.

1672
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,040
Keep in mind, all this news is coming out of Europe, so it may not be something that's

1673
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:15,720
actually planned here, but it might be just planned over there, so who knows?

1674
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,720
Yeah.

1675
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,600
So it's that time of the show where we're going to take a trip down History Lane and

1676
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:26,520
take a look at gaming's past and take a trip into the vault and find a game that Dark Soccer

1677
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:30,680
thinks you kids ought to be playing right the hell now.

1678
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,680
So Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1679
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:40,480
The Classic Game of the Week is Silfied for Sega CD.

1680
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:47,760
It actually originally came out in Japan on the PC-8801 in 1986, and then the Mega CD

1681
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:54,960
version came out, which of course was the Sega CD over here.

1682
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,480
They've actually made a ton of improvements over the PC-88 version.

1683
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:07,760
Instead of just having the static background, the background for each level is full motion

1684
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:20,120
video with a polygon overlay for all the ships and asteroids and everything coming at you.

1685
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,400
And it's a really, really good game.

1686
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:35,540
There was an FM7 version that was also released, and it came out in the US for PC, but that

1687
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,320
was put up by Sierra Online.

1688
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:46,920
At any rate, it was actually a competitor with Star Fox for the day, except Star Fox

1689
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:58,000
was all fully rendered on the cartridge, and like I said, this had a full motion video

1690
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:07,760
background, and it still is a traditional kind of shooter.

1691
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,720
Honestly though, graphically it was better, but it didn't have that innovative feel to

1692
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,680
it that Star Fox did.

1693
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:22,400
So yeah, terrorists take over the earth, and we get these cool ships, we get to shoot people

1694
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,800
in the end.

1695
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:32,760
I did have a sequel, which was Silphed The Lost Planet, which was a PS2 game.

1696
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:41,440
And then Project Silphed was actually a spiritual successor, not really a game in the series.

1697
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:53,560
A little bit of trivia about Silphed 2 is that there was a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh that's

1698
01:30:53,560 --> 01:31:02,080
called Silphed, and in Mahoro-Matic there's actually a jetpack that Mahoro used that's

1699
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,800
called the Silphed.

1700
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:11,520
And then in BlazBlue, Silphed is the name of Rachel Alucard's drive.

1701
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:17,320
This game also has one of the best intros ever.

1702
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,440
It's really one that you have to watch and listen to, and the other thing that I really

1703
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:27,520
dig about this one, as opposed to the original version of it, is as you're flying through

1704
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:35,760
the level, you get radio feedback, you know, from the rest of the fleet.

1705
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,760
Like in Star Fox.

1706
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:41,600
No, it's not quite the same.

1707
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,480
In Star Fox, it's your, like, if you go back earlier in that file, we'll play a little

1708
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,480
bit of it, it's a little different.

1709
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,480
There we go.

1710
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,480
It does have really good music, too.

1711
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,480
I heard it yelling.

1712
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,480
There you go.

1713
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:18,480
Yeah, and see, as in Star Fox, the way it's going, the way it's going, the way it's going,

1714
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:27,720
the way it was, is that it was your squadron, your formation of ships, you know, you had

1715
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:35,920
your partners, and this is, you're getting, like, have you ever, alright, I know this

1716
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,680
is kind of old school, but have you ever listened to just CB channels?

1717
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
Back in the day, yeah.

1718
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:47,040
When you can hear the other conversations going on, you're hearing the communications

1719
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,080
going up from the fleet, because, like, you know, look at it in a realistic sense.

1720
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:58,800
If you were part of the squadron, and orders went out, or feedback went out, or some sort

1721
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,360
of announcement, it may not be necessarily directed to you, but you're still gonna hear

1722
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,360
it.

1723
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,360
Do people still use CB?

1724
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,360
Yes, actually.

1725
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,360
Wow.

1726
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:14,440
Um, well, trackers do, um, but if you see, though, in that sense, then it actually adds

1727
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,480
a sense of realism to the game.

1728
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:20,560
And for the record, in, in terms of, if you're traveling with people, like, and you're in

1729
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,680
separate vehicles, having a CB is actually very good for areas that you're in that you'll

1730
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,160
lose, uh, cell reception.

1731
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,000
Plus cell cost minutes, anyway.

1732
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,440
Not always.

1733
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:38,720
But, um, but at any rate, you know, I think it's a fantastic game.

1734
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,720
Alright, so there it is, Silpheed.

1735
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,720
Silpheed.

1736
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,720
At least I didn't say Slipheed.

1737
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,720
Alright.

1738
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,440
I got people used to do that all the time, too.

1739
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:53,040
Your classic game of the week, not the newer one that came out on 360.

1740
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,560
This is the, uh, old school one on Saturn.

1741
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,720
Well, the sequel, though, is PS2.

1742
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,720
Huh.

1743
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,720
I think I played that one.

1744
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,720
I think I played that one.

1745
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,720
I think I have it somewhere.

1746
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:08,680
And, and for the record, they were talking about Policenauts earlier.

1747
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,760
I came very close to using Policenauts as, uh, the classic game.

1748
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,640
You know, we're gonna get into a story about Policenauts later, but I'll, uh, I'll leave

1749
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,640
that for later.

1750
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:18,640
Oh, I didn't mean to.

1751
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,640
No, that's alright.

1752
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,640
It's a Twitter thing, so it's gonna come up later.

1753
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,640
Yeah.

1754
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,640
Alright.

1755
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,720
Alright, speaking of Twitter, we'll get into Twitter topics right after a little bit of

1756
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,720
a break.

1757
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,720
We are gonna take a break, though, here in studio to do, uh, cover more.

1758
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,120
Um, actually, we take the break, though, to, uh, you know, get energized.

1759
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,120
To pee.

1760
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,120
To pee.

1761
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,120
To, uh, maybe order pizza.

1762
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,120
We'll see.

1763
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,120
Mmm, Becky's bringing me tacos.

1764
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,120
We can do all that.

1765
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,120
Oh, lucky.

1766
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:43,960
But, I was going to offer to you on the air, guys, do you want me to make you guys pizza?

1767
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,440
Oh, that's actually okay.

1768
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,480
I probably shouldn't, cause I had, I had a big ol' crepe earlier today.

1769
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,760
I have organic mushroom and black olive pizzas.

1770
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,560
That does sound kinda good.

1771
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,800
I also have, um, plain cheese pizzas.

1772
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,800
Maybe.

1773
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,440
No, I don't want any unless you're gonna have some.

1774
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,640
Dude, if I make pizza, I can just have it for lunch tomorrow.

1775
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,640
Hi.

1776
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,640
We'll see.

1777
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,640
Alright.

1778
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,600
My man, by the way, is not here, so I am gonna be going stir crazy.

1779
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,640
So people will be seeing me at IRC.

1780
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,640
Whee!

1781
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,640
Alright.

1782
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,640
We're gonna take a break.

1783
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,840
We'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1784
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,680
We have plenty more to talk about in Part B tonight, including our rapid fire news and,

1785
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:25,560
uh, talk about, um, a new interesting achievement on Xbox 360 for killing 1,000 children in

1786
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,280
a game and, uh, a possible revamp of DSiWare and, uh, a Final Fantasy game you will probably

1787
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,560
never ever see.

1788
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,680
We will talk about all of that in Part B after a quick break, so stay tuned here on Orange

1789
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:45,280
Launch Radio.

1790
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:51,280
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, episode number 335 for this Sunday,

1791
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,280
August 23rd, 2009.

1792
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,240
Of course, we are taping live on All Games Radio.

1793
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,880
Our friends over there let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night, so come join

1794
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:00,880
in the fun!

1795
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,280
There's, uh, programming such as the Bobby Black Wolf Show also on Sunday nights, the

1796
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,520
tapes with us, and there's, of course, programming on All Games Radio throughout the week.

1797
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,720
And, um, you can take All Games in your pocket with you everywhere you go if you're an iPhone

1798
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,720
owner.

1799
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,760
There's an All Games Radio app available on the store, which is actually pretty cool.

1800
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,080
I gotta give kudos to whoever wrote it, because what I like about it is that it actually shows

1801
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:25,960
a little picture of, uh, like the video game that song, that song is playing, uh, not always

1802
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,560
during our show, because our tags during the break aren't standardized, but, uh, like,

1803
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,560
and when we're on the air, it actually shows a little picture, our little Orange Launch

1804
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,120
Radio album art while we're actually live, which I think is kinda cool.

1805
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,960
So, uh, kudos to whoever wrote that application, I know somebody at the All Games staff did

1806
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,960
that, so, good job.

1807
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,400
Hopefully we see something like it for other phones and other platforms soon, who knows,

1808
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,400
I don't know how, uh, how easy other things are to develop for.

1809
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,640
But I do know we have a PSP website.

1810
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,640
I don't think there's a lot of-

1811
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,640
That never gets updated!

1812
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:59,760
Not, we should work on that, I just paid to have our domain names extended a couple, uh,

1813
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,080
actually this past week.

1814
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:07,640
I paid something like 60 bucks to extend OrangeLaunchRadio.com and OLRPSP.com for two years, because I use

1815
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:12,280
the, um, anonymous things, I don't want my address out there on the internet, but, uh,

1816
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:16,160
yeah, so, uh, it costs me a little more money since I do that, but, you know, whatever.

1817
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,760
I still have a OLR-We, but I haven't done anything with that.

1818
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,760
Do you?

1819
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,760
Yeah.

1820
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,760
And we need, like, an OLRPS3.com or something like that.

1821
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:25,760
Yeah, maybe.

1822
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,760
We'll see one these days.

1823
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,760
I'll work on it someday.

1824
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,040
You know, if you're interested in helping us build websites and develop, you wanna,

1825
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,000
for that, we pay great, nothing.

1826
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,920
But pat on the back and job well done.

1827
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,920
Eventually.

1828
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
It just, I don't know.

1829
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,680
Well, we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in a little bit, but I do wanna

1830
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:46,480
mention, actually we're gonna get into Twitter topics in a minute, but I do wanna mention

1831
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,200
before we get to Twitter topics tonight, um, I wanna mention, I went to Dave & Buster's

1832
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,880
yesterday, which is a place I have not been for a while, and, uh, you know, if you haven't

1833
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,960
been to Dave & Buster's, it's like, I guess there's another chain on the East Coast called

1834
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,960
Jillian's.

1835
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:58,960
It's very similar to it as well.

1836
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,800
Um, it's kind of like Chuck E. Cheese, but for adults, because there's an open bar.

1837
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,200
But oh my God, the bar's a ripoff.

1838
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,520
Do you know how much a drink cost me at Dave & Buster's?

1839
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,600
I ordered a Malibu and pineapple.

1840
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,600
You know how much that cost me?

1841
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,600
Uh, seven bucks.

1842
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,600
Seven fifty.

1843
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,600
Damn close.

1844
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Six fifty.

1845
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,600
That's what it got.

1846
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,160
And after I left a tip, really, it's seven fifty.

1847
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,160
Because I always tip.

1848
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,400
Well, you know, though, I used to go for my birthday every year, and...

1849
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,720
I miss that.

1850
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:27,280
And between everyone who bought me drinks and buying drinks for myself, I would probably

1851
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,560
easily go through about seventy dollars worth of liquor.

1852
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,560
You've seen me do it.

1853
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,560
Yep.

1854
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,560
Good times, though.

1855
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,560
It's basically gambling for tickets.

1856
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:40,060
But I have on my card eight thousand five hundred tickets, which is almost enough for

1857
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,200
me to get a free Xbox 360 game.

1858
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,360
It's nine thousand tickets for an Xbox 360 game.

1859
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,480
I have eighty five hundred tickets.

1860
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,880
Now, what's interesting also about Dave & Buster's, the reason why I want to bring it up.

1861
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:56,200
They were actually, um, had for sale a little like, I hadn't seen this, like a little table

1862
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,220
top arcade cabinet.

1863
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:01,040
Not a full size arcade cabinet, but a table top arcade cabinet.

1864
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,240
It was some type of Namco twenty fifth anniversary thing.

1865
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,240
Yeah.

1866
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:09,000
So it was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Galaga were all on it.

1867
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,040
They wanted a hundred and ninety five thousand tickets for that thing.

1868
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,600
That's like three thousand dollars in real money.

1869
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,000
They're, trust me, they're not really that expensive.

1870
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I was going to say.

1871
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Dang.

1872
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,800
Probably a few hundred bucks, that's it.

1873
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,440
You could build one cheaper.

1874
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,440
Probably.

1875
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,440
But it did look pretty cool.

1876
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,940
I was kind of curious to get one, but whatever.

1877
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:31,940
It was fun.

1878
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,960
Um, we have some questions in chat room.

1879
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:39,760
Um, I can't pronounce this name, but T-O-A-G-A-C. Toagak wants to know, where is this PSP radio

1880
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,000
app?

1881
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,960
We haven't talked about the radio app in a while, but we do have a radio app that will

1882
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,240
work on your PSP, right, Logie?

1883
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,240
Yeah.

1884
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:51,800
It works on, um, the actual PSP, O-O-L-R PSP site, you can download it.

1885
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:58,480
It's basically, um, something that you replace your, or it's a radio player, you just install

1886
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,640
it to your memory stick, where you would put your radio players, I think there's a guide

1887
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:07,400
on there somewhere, um, to do that, and once you do that, it will connect to a website,

1888
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:12,240
and you can literally listen to the all-game stream, um, straight from your PSP, just like

1889
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,400
you would, you know, the stations, and there's some RSS feeds and stuff, and I hope it still

1890
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,880
works correctly, because I know they've changed their website since then, I used to pull stuff

1891
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:26,240
off the all-game site, so God knows, because I haven't used my PSP in a long time, but,

1892
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,240
um...

1893
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,240
I think it still works.

1894
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,240
The stream's still in the same place, that's the important part, right?

1895
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,240
The stream's still in the same place, yes, but like, some of the stuff that I've made

1896
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,680
for it, because it was all fancy-looking.

1897
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,520
So it may be a little broken, but it'll still get you the stream, so you can listen to us

1898
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,720
on the iPhone on the all-games app, you can listen to us on the PSP on the O-L-R app,

1899
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,720
you're covered.

1900
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,720
One way or another.

1901
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:46,720
Alright, uh, Twitter topics tonight, every night we invite you guys, we need a theme

1902
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,500
song for Twitter topics, I don't have anything, I'll have to think about that for next week.

1903
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,440
Like, Conan O'Brien has a little theme song for his Twitter segment.

1904
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:58,040
You know what, you should do, um...

1905
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,040
I don't know, yeah, it's...

1906
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,040
Rislem.

1907
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,040
I don't know.

1908
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,040
Yeah, I don't know.

1909
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,040
I was picking something up.

1910
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,040
I'm not picking something up next time.

1911
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,560
Alright, in the meantime, don't call me during the show, why are my parents calling me during

1912
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,560
the show?

1913
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,520
You should use the beep, you should use that beep.

1914
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,600
What beep?

1915
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,640
That beep-beep should be the theme for Twitter topics?

1916
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,440
Alright, yeah

1917
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,180
We have I'm not reading the name in chat cuz they're all naming themselves immature names

1918
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:24,800
But I see Twitter tracker Twitter tracker Twitter tracker. That's what the from the Tonight Show by the way change your names to something more mature

1919
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,080
I'm not reading black cock all right

1920
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,720
Let's see you haven't had that in a while Twitter topics tonight. We'll start with them

1921
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,440
ray

1922
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:42,960
Ayanami wants us to talk about raystorm HD and not just because his name is in it, but apparently there is a new game coming out called

1923
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:48,660
Raystorm HD. This is a remake possibly of an old-school title game

1924
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,320
apparently they

1925
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:57,720
It appeared on partner net that's where they saw it partner net is Xbox's little testing grounds for us

1926
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:05,760
Let's talk about partner net somebody did ooh, so there it is raystorm HD. I don't remember the first one very well is this

1927
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,880
I I almost feel like I should bring it up on YouTube and look at a clip of this does anyone know the game Jamie

1928
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,660
Do you know raystorm if it has to do with what was a ray crisis?

1929
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
Then I think so

1930
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,600
Hold on I'm bringing up some of the gameplay here in studio, so I can check this out

1931
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:29,600
Oh, this is like a punch. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it okay fun series

1932
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,760
So if you shmup fans all right well the graphics of nice

1933
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:38,040
Major targeting and this is an arcade game originally wasn't it I?

1934
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,960
Don't remember, but I've got I've got all kinds of versions of that series

1935
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:49,160
Is that a vertical game that looks like a vertical the graphics are kind of rad for something this old school

1936
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,160
I imagine it has to be an arcade game

1937
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,680
I might have to check that game out that looks kind of cool. I don't know much about it, but I like a little clip

1938
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,680
I'm seeing you could probably borrow ours

1939
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:02,700
Cool, all right. Uh let's see moving on

1940
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,760
Take array wants to know to KO ray. Sorry wants to know

1941
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,480
Would the ol army be interested in raising money for extra life?

1942
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:16,060
I hope you can discuss this tonight, and then gave me a link and this is kind of interesting. It's a

1943
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:19,220
A fundraiser that's going on called extra life

1944
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:24,340
And they're calling it a 24-hour gaming marathon to fund pediatric cancer research and treatment

1945
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:27,500
And I guess this is taking place on October 17th of this year

1946
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:32,980
And they're trying to get all these sites to come together to raise money for this

1947
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:39,780
Extra life charity, and it's to raise money for pediatric cancer which sounds like a great cause honestly

1948
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:44,660
It's going to be 8 a.m.. On October 17th, and they have all these groups participating

1949
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,660
I guess our tech sarcastic gamer

1950
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:50,620
I've not listened to that show, but I've seen their thing on iTunes

1951
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,260
This part of this

1952
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:58,940
Destructoid is apparently on board as well limit break radio. I guess they'll probably be doing a Final Fantasy 11 marathon

1953
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,540
Wants to know if we could come on board as well um

1954
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,700
Maybe I don't want to commit to something if I can't give it a hundred percent

1955
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:10,220
But I think it's a great cause and I think if we don't do it ourselves

1956
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:14,120
We'll have to support somebody else doing it, but I don't know what do you guys think gaming marathon?

1957
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:17,740
October 17th could we do it probably 24 hours worth of games?

1958
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:22,780
Obscure fucking vault games would be the theme of our marathon. I don't think anybody else could do that I

1959
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:28,300
Think that would be good and to keep the the continuation going

1960
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:30,740
We'll have a different systems hooked up to that

1961
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:35,580
While one systems going we can switch games to a new one and just pass a controller over so that we don't have a lull

1962
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:38,140
I'm playing maybe like a new game every hour or something works for me

1963
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:42,460
So I figured out because I don't know if we could do that here because it might be just adventure marathon

1964
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,660
It might be too small of a space here. We might have to do it at the

1965
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:48,460
Room, but maybe I don't know if we could get all this stuff

1966
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,740
I think because there's also that the weather should be better

1967
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,780
We could always go back to the garage

1968
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:57,820
But we'll see if we do it on the big TV though we can actually put up a cam footage without it

1969
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:01,500
Without a

1970
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,420
refresh hmm

1971
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:07,460
Because you've seen me take pictures off of my TV. I Loki would you be willing to do it too?

1972
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:13,980
Could we do this for 24 hours you do it? I have HD capture stuff now mm-hmm, so I could capture

1973
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:21,700
Once I figure something out we let's you I don't want to commit to we're 100% sure we can give it our all

1974
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:22,700
But we are interested

1975
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:27,140
I think we've been talking about doing a gaming marathon for a long time so it'd be fun to get in on something like this

1976
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:30,220
with some other podcasts and things like that and certainly the causes is

1977
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:35,260
Great, so we want to help I still I still though wanted

1978
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,940
you know along the same lines want to do a

1979
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,860
a

1980
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:47,580
Classic game segment every week too. You know I think we should do nothing, but classic games like we should just do obscure

1981
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:49,580
Fuck I'm not talking about for that. I'm talking about

1982
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:55,260
You know us having a classic gaming. No like on YouTube or something. Yeah, might be fun

1983
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:59,340
I don't know if you guys have some ideas I get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch ready calm

1984
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:05,580
I'd be curious what you guys think would be fun for the marathon, so we'll see um so

1985
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,540
Thanks for the heads up on that

1986
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:11,540
I'm not sure I'll have to read a little more in that website about who we contact for more information

1987
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:17,100
But if you're out there listening, please get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch rated calm because I think

1988
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,860
That could be fun

1989
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:28,340
Tweet from act deft to our Twitter, or wants us to mention the police knots English localization apparently there is a fan

1990
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:33,900
Translation of police knots that was finished now this game of course was out on the PlayStation 1

1991
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:40,020
It was also on the Sega Saturn and get this the 3do and what makes this game notable is that it was a Hideo?

1992
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:43,780
Kojima game that was the the thing that made this game notable

1993
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,380
I don't know a whole lot about this game, but it looks like kind of a very cutscene heavy game

1994
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:53,380
Which is no surprise at all because it was a Hideo Kojima game, but it also looked like a point

1995
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:57,260
Yeah, it's like a point-and-click game like it's like a shadow gate or deja vu kind of game, right?

1996
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:04,620
What's point-and-click game so it has but it never came out in English, but the fans got together and translated it

1997
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:07,980
And it's a patch that you can apply to your

1998
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:12,220
Rom, I'm supposing of police knots. I don't know what version it is

1999
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:16,380
That they patched I'm assuming it's got to be the ps1

2000
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:22,180
That's probably the easiest one, but there you go, so if you want to check out police knots you can do that now

2001
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:26,060
In a completely non-legit way well

2002
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,780
I mean if you actually own the import game

2003
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:33,940
And you make a copy of it dump your own copy of it with whatever programs out there, and you patch it with this yeah

2004
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:39,860
You probably know that most people aren't going to do this all right that are downloading this or probably getting it illegally

2005
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:45,220
But I know what it's the game is 13 years old, and I say if they if they cared that much about it

2006
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,220
They would have translated to English 13 years ago

2007
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:51,420
Obviously they don't care at this point. Nope. They don't care so

2008
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:57,740
There you go all right all right the dark soccer. I think is like digging it out of the vault right now

2009
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,740
so

2010
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:04,460
And act F2 says in chat right now that I think it's the ps1 version so there you go

2011
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:11,500
Um a couple more quick Twitter topics technicolor with the three wants to know what are our thoughts on the halo 3 o DST

2012
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:15,860
Tour truck thing going around the country right now. I wonder if they have one of those at the state fair

2013
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:19,940
They had Rock Band 2 there last year. It's only going game stops. Oh is it yeah?

2014
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,700
I guess if you want to check out the game is certainly a good way to do it

2015
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:26,540
No publicity is gonna be bad publicity in that regard. It's like a little slice e3 in your backyard

2016
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:32,800
It's only a few more weeks away. I was like a month away. I mean is that close. Yeah, it's coming on 22nd

2017
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:37,500
September interesting I don't know any okay

2018
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:44,140
Play halo 3 there. There's a good impression on what halo DST is gonna be like I mean really they haven't changed too much

2019
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:47,980
I mean yeah, you're playing you know the shock trooper

2020
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:53,700
But and it's not the scales been kind of dropped down a little bit, but I don't know

2021
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,500
It's not like it's like night and day gameplay. I think

2022
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:05,940
Hmm all right well last more Twitter topics tiger claw 305 says Blizzard is planning a pseudo land support for Starcraft 2 and possibly

2023
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,940
Diablo 3 and links us to a story

2024
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,500
Talking about I there was a quote in here. I wanted to read

2025
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,500
where

2026
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:20,180
The interviewer and this is from Shaq news.com asked the developer if they were possibly working on a solution

2027
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:24,420
That would be like a pseudo land connection where the game will check in with battle net to authenticate

2028
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:28,300
And then it'll go back to acting like a LAN and they replied something like that

2029
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:30,660
Maintaining a connection with battle.net

2030
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,300
I don't know if it's once or periodically

2031
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:37,980
But then also having a peer-to-peer connection between players to facilitate a very low ping high bandwidth connection

2032
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:43,520
So those are the things that they're working on so a bit of an olive branch to the community. Maybe I don't know

2033
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:46,540
Hopefully I would think this type of thing was probably always planned

2034
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:50,580
But they they're gonna want the regular pings to battle.net to make sure the game is legit

2035
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:55,940
You know because if they only pinged at once somebody would figure out a way to patch that they're gonna figure out a way to patch

2036
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,660
It anyways it doesn't matter

2037
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:02,740
I think I think the planners are gonna have to give the concession that they're gonna have to attach to battle net to give this

2038
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:09,380
Game, but they'll at least not have to play through battle net because that would suck if battle net goes down your whole game is fucked

2039
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:15,460
Right so yeah, hopefully there'll be some type of a concession there SB. Hale tweets us and says

2040
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:20,380
$300 ps3 definitely not an under-the-radar story, but for those of us Xbox 360

2041
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:26,860
And we owners do you feel there's a need to own all three consoles besides the fact that the ps3 is a blu-ray player of course

2042
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:29,860
I've yet to find a good reason why I shouldn't pick one up at that price

2043
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:34,260
Hmm well you know the golden rule of gaming here at orange lounge radio

2044
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:38,860
Is that a system is only as good as the games that are on it the interesting thing about the PlayStation though?

2045
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:43,960
As a console is that you also have that added blu-ray in so you do I mean whether?

2046
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,540
You know you say besides that or not you have to factor that in a little bit to your decision

2047
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,540
But I think the question is really going to be

2048
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,360
It does what the PlayStation 3 offer

2049
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:59,220
As far as exclusive games and things you can't get on your Xbox 360 is that what you want?

2050
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,140
Do you want games like little big planet?

2051
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,460
Do you want mag do you want you know some of the Final Fantasy 14?

2052
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:10,660
And some of these games that are PlayStation 3 exclusive is that worth the $300 to you if so then yeah?

2053
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,620
You got to get one if not right now

2054
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:14,300
Then you can stand away a little bit

2055
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:19,240
But also don't discount the other features of the PlayStation 3 the fact that it is a pretty good media device as well

2056
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:25,420
You know that it does have home if that's something that interests you and the whole fact that you can have that the online movie

2057
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:31,620
Store which has some different offerings than the Xbox 360 does if that you know the HD movies and all that are important to you

2058
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:33,240
I think you have to consider all of that

2059
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:39,220
But in the end if you're getting everything that you possibly need out of gaming on your 360 then no you don't need a ps3

2060
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:44,460
but if there's something that the ps3 offers you that you need and

2061
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,900
It I will say it's a hell of a lot quieter

2062
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,700
Then go for it

2063
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:55,740
But if you oh by the way if you don't have an HDTV though, there's no point in getting blu-ray it really isn't but

2064
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:58,180
I'm assuming you probably are an HDTV owner and

2065
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:02,980
Zebun Chow wants to point out Final Fantasy 14 is gonna be on the PC too. That's a good point

2066
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:09,140
So you know and that may be where most people want to play it and there we go Dark Sakura found her copy of police

2067
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:10,900
Nauts on the PlayStation 1

2068
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:14,660
There it is. I wish we had webcam in this studio, but we don't know well

2069
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:20,920
But it's definitely all in Japanese. You won't put down the website the pics orange lounge radio. All right, there we go

2070
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:26,100
One more and sorry if we didn't get to all the tweets tonight, but Matt OS

2071
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:30,480
I can't say his last name. It says this j100 Matt Matt

2072
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:37,060
Ostrowski, I think says interesting story about a company that is close to making the first ps3 mod chip

2073
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:41,440
Who could a mod chip be coming soon to the PlayStation 3? Have you heard about this?

2074
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:45,860
Loki, no, but that would be a pain in the ass to burn stuff on to

2075
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:50,940
You know blu-ray and stuff blu-ray discs are really expensive and that's like, you know

2076
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,580
almost 50 gigs of data

2077
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:59,340
But I know for a fact that every every single PlayStation 3 game that comes out is being dumped

2078
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:04,940
So, you know just in case for whatever happened, you know, whatever they do come up with a mod chip

2079
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:13,220
Well, apparently it's a mod chip that's gonna happen and it's called the bells are chip and it works on all models all regions

2080
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:19,940
Direct boot of ps3 original import and backup games direct boot of ps2 original important backup games

2081
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:25,460
I'm assuming that means only if your console plays ps2 games does multi region blu-rays multi region DVDs

2082
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:31,640
No configuration disk needed. It's a transparent stealth operation. They call it no USB interface

2083
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,920
It's up-to-date only 12 wires to solder

2084
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,640
solder yeah, sorry solder

2085
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,280
tempting

2086
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, but still you have to solder and what if what if they fix it with a patch that's gonna you're gonna be screwed because

2087
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,440
That thing's hardwired to your system. My Wii is

2088
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:55,200
Soldered and it has a soldered in mod chip. I'm not worried about it because you get that that thing has an on-off switch, huh?

2089
01:53:56,200 --> 01:54:01,000
Yeah, but I don't use it. Hmm. It's always on I mean they have it just in case

2090
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
And it's only really have them been updated once and really I don't need the on-off switch on there

2091
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,200
that's just an optional thing you can install in there and

2092
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,800
I

2093
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:17,380
mean worst case scenario if for whatever reason this decided, you know, they broke it or something or they

2094
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:24,920
You know disable the chip. You can always clip those wires that you solder. Hmm. Yes, that's true. I am interested

2095
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:30,000
Well, there's a whole thing on Twitter. Look at the you the tweets to olr ask as I share 100 Mac

2096
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,280
Cuz he opposed so much. All right

2097
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,480
Huh, I don't know I didn't see on that site. So check it out. All right

2098
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:44,720
If you want to tweet us a story that's we like stuff that's under the radar because obviously you knew this week

2099
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,840
We were gonna talk about Wow cataclysm. You knew we were gonna talk about the ps3 slim

2100
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,840
But usually the stuff that might fall off the radar

2101
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:53,360
We definitely want you to bring to our attention on Twitter or any topics you want us to discuss

2102
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:57,600
Keep an eye out Sundays a couple hours before we go live. I usually put a shout out on there

2103
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:03,640
All right. Let's get into some rapid-fire news Loki. You're gonna need just you need to stop reading tweets

2104
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,840
By the way, the first picture is up

2105
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:10,680
Oh the police knots game and that's what an orange lounge radio.com in our picture gallery, right? Cool. I've been waiting

2106
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:16,360
I'm ready to go. All right, Loki rapid-fire news. All right, Robin. You may remember that Sega had a

2107
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:24,040
You know a survey asking what should be the next game that they published on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and we were well

2108
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,920
Earthworm Jim won that however

2109
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,760
they had to pull Earthworm Jim because

2110
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:36,120
Unfortunately interplay at the same time also announced that they're making a new Earthworm Jim game for PlayStation Network

2111
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:39,600
We were an Xbox Live Arcade as well as mobile platforms. So

2112
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:46,560
New Earthworm Jim coming, but there's still another Xbox Live Arcade Genesis poll. So

2113
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,620
You'll have to see who wins that I think currently right now

2114
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,320
Toe jam and Earl was winning that one

2115
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,320
Um

2116
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,840
There is a rumor that

2117
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:01,760
Looks like Canada will be getting a new elite bundle

2118
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,640
It's gonna be coming with halo 3 and on top of that

2119
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:12,360
They're also going to be throwing in a wireless network adapter, which is kind of cool and all that can be had for

2120
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,940
349.99. I think that's Canadian dollars and

2121
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:22,840
And um apparently it is available it's actually gonna be

2122
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,780
It's available at right now at the source

2123
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:33,520
Which is I guess is a circuit circuit city affiliate out of Canada and they have the online offer. It's actually for

2124
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:36,300
329.99 and

2125
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:38,940
That's pretty interesting

2126
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:40,660
Wow

2127
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,100
huh

2128
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,100
anyways, um

2129
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:47,700
And then finally in Guitar Hero 5

2130
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:51,580
Their download content will be incompatible with world tour

2131
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:52,300
So that's right

2132
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,220
if there's new

2133
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:59,780
download songs that come out now for Guitar Hero 5 you will not be able to download them for world tour because apparently they're adding new

2134
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:01,780
features to them and

2135
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:03,660
I

2136
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,660
guess only

2137
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,380
Also the download content for

2138
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:11,460
world tour I guess of the

2139
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:14,060
158 songs are on world tour and

2140
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:18,860
Smash hits you'll only be able to download 152 of those

2141
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:23,060
Back to your console, I guess when you're importing songs

2142
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:27,740
but I mean that makes sense because rock band there was like five tracks you couldn't download because or three or

2143
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:32,660
Three or five tracks that you couldn't download because of licensing stuff. So hmm

2144
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:38,540
All right. Well, by the way, the chat wants us to mention that toe jam and Earl was the new winner of the poll

2145
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:42,020
Yeah, that's what I thought. It was earthworm Jim remake was mentioned

2146
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:46,800
Getting into some rapid-fire news over in my corner Diablo 3

2147
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:52,400
Had its fourth character class revealed and it was spoiled a little bit early by a Korean website

2148
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:58,820
But it was barbarian witch doctor wizard and monk monk is the fourth class there

2149
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:02,500
I don't know if that's gonna be the last one or if there'll be more after that

2150
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,340
I imagine it's got to be at least one or two more

2151
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:08,780
But monk by the way was originally in the Hellfire expansion in the original Diablo

2152
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:12,260
Where barbarian bard rogue sorcerer and warrior showed up?

2153
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:15,060
So I assume there's gonna be at least a couple more classes that show up in Diablo 3

2154
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:19,180
Although not too many because you know, they got to do the expansions later on, right?

2155
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:27,080
Mm-hmm. Hey the Wii and the DS are getting new Tetris games next year. That's right

2156
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,060
It's a partnership between Majesco and Tetris online

2157
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:34,380
They'll be coming out on the Wii and the DS in the spring of 2010

2158
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:40,060
No idea what the Tetris game is going to be like, but you know what Tetris DS is pretty badass

2159
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:42,060
I don't know if we necessarily need another one. Oh

2160
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:50,420
Well, I have judgment is making its way to the PSP that was announced at gamescom this way

2161
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:54,900
You will get a basically a version of the Eye of Judgment, but of course there is no eye

2162
01:58:54,900 --> 01:59:01,860
Okay, that's why there's no bet there's still a lot of questions as to whether this will use the same cards or what-have-you

2163
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:05,780
We just know the game is coming out and Loki says it will not count towards the bet

2164
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:09,860
Why not look the reason why I won't count towards the bet because it's not as ridiculous as the Eye of Judgment

2165
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:16,420
The Eye of Judgment is an actual physical card game that you had to play, you know using the PlayStation eye camera

2166
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:21,020
Basically, it was you know, the camera in the game portion of it was completely

2167
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:25,580
You didn't need it. I mean, it's like playing Magic the Gathering with someone filming you on camera and you know, something like that

2168
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:29,140
This is actually a card game that's in digital form

2169
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:34,500
That's an actual game that counts that that's that's you know, fine that makes sense

2170
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,420
you know, that's how they should have done it in the first place, but

2171
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:43,780
However, if it did come out with like, you know, if they decided to release a version that was a camera

2172
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:47,260
You know and played the same way as the normal Eye of Judgment

2173
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:51,260
Then yes, I would probably count towards the bet but it's not so sorry

2174
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:54,260
And you're getting booed from the chat room, but you know what they can do

2175
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:55,260
Not too bad

2176
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,260
I completely understand why you're doing that

2177
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,260
You know, even

2178
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:59,260
You're right

2179
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:03,260
The whole reason we made fun of the game in the first place was the fact because it had the camera to look at the cards

2180
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,260
That was a little silly

2181
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:10,260
I mean, it doesn't matter even if I did add the Eye of Judgment to the bet or whatever

2182
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:14,260
It's still wouldn't meet a million units and it it but it's not so bad

2183
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:19,260
It doesn't meet a million units and it but I'm not gonna do that because it's just stupid

2184
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:20,260
Okay, the whole

2185
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:21,260
You need to move on

2186
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:22,260
Yes, we need to move on

2187
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:25,260
Yes, we need to find a new cause and a new outfit

2188
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:26,260
Exactly

2189
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:29,260
Alright dark soccer

2190
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:30,260
Do you have some rapid-fire news for us tonight?

2191
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,260
I do indeed

2192
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:38,260
Actually Midway Europe is now Trade West games

2193
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:41,260
They were purchased

2194
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:47,260
So, that's actually gone through. It's being fully rebranded.

2195
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:55,260
Also, LittleBigPlanet is getting a re-release with 18 new levels and 7 download content packs.

2196
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:57,260
Pretty cool, huh?

2197
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:00,260
Yeah. I remember when Tradewest, by the way, did Double Dragon back in the day.

2198
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:06,260
They were a big 8-bit developer. I don't know if it's the same company, but I just remember that name.

2199
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:16,260
Well, the LittleBigPlanet packs are going to be the Metal Gear Solid level pack featuring the Paintinator.

2200
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:22,260
Metal Gear Solid costumes, monster costumes, monster packs, history costumes, history pack, and animal costumes.

2201
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:30,260
Did you see the new announcement that they're going to be adding a new expansion pretty much as epic as the Paintinator and all that stuff?

2202
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:35,260
Where you actually have real water in the game now. That's going to be pretty awesome.

2203
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:37,260
Hopefully we'll get some new levels.

2204
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:42,260
I love that they're still adding big stuff to the game even though it's been out a while. Props to a media molecule.

2205
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:52,260
Since we've had some discussion about Hideo Kojima, he actually has said that he finds the Metal Gear Solid series very puzzling too.

2206
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:59,260
Which is why he keeps detailed timelines for all of the characters in the game.

2207
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:07,260
He says, and I quote, this is especially tricky when you create the future first and then go back in time to create something new.

2208
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:12,260
There are a lot of small aspects where sometimes it doesn't match completely. Sounds like Marvel Comics.

2209
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,260
Or Star Trek.

2210
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:18,260
Seriously. Well, yeah, but they fixed all that with the movie.

2211
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:21,260
Not the newer canon. Just saying.

2212
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:29,260
By the way, one other thing I wanted to mention though was the whole little big planet stuff.

2213
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:33,260
I forgot what I was going to say. Forget it.

2214
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:36,260
The water levels coming out soon. There's something I wanted to say about that.

2215
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:42,260
The water, it's real water now so you can actually make real water levels and that kind of stuff.

2216
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:53,260
One more comment from chat. Amazatsuma on the whole tingle bet says, we will move on once we see Loki dress as Tingle. Am I right, Penelope?

2217
02:02:53,260 --> 02:03:00,260
I renamed them back to OL Army. However, they were balls for a little while.

2218
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:05,260
You had your opportunity. I can't help it if you can't come through with your end of the bargain.

2219
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:10,260
You know what? It's just like, I don't know. I make bets that I know I'm going to win.

2220
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:15,260
For example, there was somebody, one of my customers was betting me on the top grossing game this year.

2221
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:21,260
And he said that, you know, he bet that Wii Sports Resort was going to be the top grossing game.

2222
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:29,260
Not only was he cocky about it, but he said that they would beat out anything, the number two one by two million units.

2223
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:37,260
And he also said, you know, so my guess, of course, was Modern Warfare 2 because you're a fucking idiot if you think Wii Sports Resort is going to sell that many units.

2224
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:44,260
And he's like, fine, I'll give you Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. I'm like, you are so stupid.

2225
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:48,260
But OK, I'll take that bet.

2226
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:51,260
I will win that bet as well.

2227
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,260
What is the bet?

2228
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:58,260
We haven't figured it out yet what the actual prize of the bet will be, but he's so confident he's going to win that he'll probably do something stupid.

2229
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:02,260
So I just have to wait for him to act on it.

2230
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:05,260
Fair enough. Let's get back to some more gaming stories.

2231
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:09,260
We have the mailbag coming up before too long, whether Dark Soccer likes it or not.

2232
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:14,260
And the Skype line tonight, which will probably be kind of short tonight because we've been doing a lot of talking.

2233
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:18,260
We've taken a lot of calls in the past couple weeks, but we'll at least get a couple of you on the line.

2234
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:22,260
1877 game OLR, but that won't be for a little while now. So, Loki.

2235
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:34,260
OK. Well, there's apparently an achievement that was discovered for the new game, Fairy Tale Fights, where you get some points for killing 1,000 children.

2236
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:38,260
Yes, lots of child homicide.

2237
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:46,260
Of course, the game is actually a beat-em-up that's extremely bloody. Think of like a Castle Crashers type of thing.

2238
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:58,260
And of course, Yu-Gi-Oh! is reporting though that while this achievement is currently in the works, it's most likely going to be removed from the final game.

2239
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:01,260
I don't know. I think they should keep it because that'd be funny.

2240
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:07,260
So it's kind of one of those things that's lolsy for now, you know, in their little development, but probably won't actually get out there?

2241
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:08,260
Yeah.

2242
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:12,260
Boy, oh boy. Can you imagine if it really did-

2243
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:15,260
Your pizza's burnt!

2244
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,260
Dark Soccer burnt my pizza.

2245
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:19,260
I'm smelling it. It's smelling nice and toasty.

2246
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:24,260
I know. It does smell- Oh, no. Is it really, like, crispy? I kind of want to see it, but we're trying to do a radio show.

2247
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:26,260
Can you do a monologue, Loki, while I go look at the burnt pizza?

2248
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:32,260
Can I do a monologue? I don't know what to talk about. We just talked about fairy tale fights.

2249
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:35,260
The game looks okay. I don't know.

2250
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:42,260
But they're investigating a burnt pizza as if you haven't seen a burnt pizza before. It's just black and crispier!

2251
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:45,260
I don't know.

2252
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:54,260
So yes, going back to the bet, there is no way that I'm going to add Eye Judgment PSP to it, even though I am confident if I did that it wouldn't matter.

2253
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:59,260
But see, that's the problem, though, is once we add Eye Judgment PSP, then where does it stop?

2254
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:02,260
I'm just going to have to keep adding games until you eventually win.

2255
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:08,260
And who really wants to play that way? That's not a bet. You should have won the first bet in the first place.

2256
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:14,260
Why is everybody so curious about the burnt pizza?

2257
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:17,260
Oh, they're weird.

2258
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:19,260
Anyways, um-

2259
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:21,260
Come back, come back, come back. Sorry.

2260
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,260
Alright, alright.

2261
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:30,260
No, I'm making her upload a picture of it to the pictures blog at orangehonestrader.com so you can see the fail.

2262
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:32,260
Because it's pretty amazing.

2263
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:38,260
And Becky is here and just brought Dark Sakura tacos. You, ma'am, are possibly the nicest friend ever.

2264
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:43,260
Because she's been complaining about winning a taco all night long, and look at this.

2265
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:49,260
She doesn't just bring her a taco. She brought the taco on a fucking silver platter. Look at that.

2266
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:53,260
It's a dish covered in tin foil. It's a silver platter.

2267
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:59,260
It's aluminum platter.

2268
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:03,260
I'm getting yelled at from the kitchen. Technically, it's aluminum alloy.

2269
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:06,260
I thought it was aluminium.

2270
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:10,260
Because you're so British.

2271
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,260
God, I wish our microphone would pick up the yelling from the kitchen.

2272
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:15,260
I just literally heard screaming, I'm not British!

2273
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:20,260
And deathwishing says in chatroom, there's an achievement on Dirt 2 called two girls, one cup.

2274
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:27,260
It's actually two cups, one girl. It's about winning two cups in the game with one female driver.

2275
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:30,260
Alright. Let me move on. I'm sorry.

2276
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:35,260
I'm getting into another story that doesn't involve burnt food or what have you now that the whole house smells like crispy.

2277
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:40,260
And I'm eyeing the taco on a silver platter that I want to devour.

2278
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:44,260
Independent Xbox Live game has been banned. Why?

2279
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:48,260
Because of visual sexual assault reminders.

2280
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:52,260
It's a game called And Yet I Love You.

2281
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:54,260
I can't even hear what she's saying.

2282
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:57,260
Well, she's not on the radio, so we're just ignoring her.

2283
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:00,260
If you don't have a mic, I can't hear you!

2284
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:02,260
That's bad radio etiquette.

2285
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:04,260
Terrible radio etiquette.

2286
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:09,260
Alright. It was on the Japanese marketplace. It was pulled because it was too erotic.

2287
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:12,260
It was an independent developer, Naoki Sagawa.

2288
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:14,260
Is this related to the DDR Naoki?

2289
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:15,260
No, probably not.

2290
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:19,260
There is no sex in it. It is not an adult game.

2291
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:24,260
However, apparently there were visual reminders of sexual assault.

2292
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:28,260
Because in one scene, the girl's hands are restrained.

2293
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:33,260
In one scene, a girl is being pushed down and her panties are visible.

2294
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:37,260
That doesn't mean she's being assaulted. They could be having a fight or wrestling.

2295
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:40,260
I mean, that's perfectly harmless.

2296
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:44,260
What's interesting about this is that this was just Microsoft Europe that had a problem with the game.

2297
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:47,260
So Sagawa basically wanted this to be limited to Japan.

2298
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:52,260
However, Microsoft just basically said you need to stop distribution of this game altogether.

2299
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:55,260
And there it was. It was kicked away.

2300
02:08:55,260 --> 02:09:00,260
Now, what's interesting is that I'm reading this story on Kotaku here, and they make a very good point.

2301
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:07,260
And they say, by the way, while this is acceptable, you have Dead or Alive where you punch and kick females.

2302
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:10,260
And you can see their panties pretty well.

2303
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:14,260
You need to take a picture of the taco on a silver platter and put that on the blog, too,

2304
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:17,260
because that's pretty amazing what Becky did there.

2305
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:19,260
The taco is in the platter.

2306
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:21,260
All right.

2307
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:26,260
Oh, I thought that was the taco on the platter. Sorry, hi. Bad radio. Bad host.

2308
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:28,260
Mmm, they're real tacos, too.

2309
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:31,260
I know you're dying for food, but we've got to get your story, Dark Sakura.

2310
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,260
My story? Oh, yeah.

2311
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,260
Yes.

2312
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:34,260
Give me a sec.

2313
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:36,260
All right. Dark Sakura needs a moment.

2314
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:40,260
Dark Sakura needs freaking food real bad.

2315
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:42,260
I feel bad about the pizza, although, you know.

2316
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:44,260
Your pizza's bacon.

2317
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:45,260
Yay.

2318
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:50,260
So, Sony has to make some explanations.

2319
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:54,260
They got some explaining to do.

2320
02:09:54,260 --> 02:10:01,260
When they removed the backwards compatibility from the slim,

2321
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:06,260
they needed to say what exactly was going on.

2322
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:15,260
So, they say, and this is a quote from John Kohler, who's SCEA's director of marketing.

2323
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:21,260
Now that we're at a point where we're three years into the life cycle of the PS3,

2324
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:25,260
there are so many PS3 disc-based games that are available that we think,

2325
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:29,260
and notice this from our research, that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3

2326
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:32,260
cite PS3 games as a primary reason.

2327
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:36,260
So, basically, they're saying, oh, people don't care about PS2 anymore.

2328
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:37,260
What do you think?

2329
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:40,260
Chat? People in the studio?

2330
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,260
Are they right?

2331
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:43,260
Do people not care about PS2 anymore?

2332
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:46,260
Or as Ray Iyanami in chat says, and I love this,

2333
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:50,260
backwards compatibility is so last gen.

2334
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:52,260
I remember seeing an old OLR reference.

2335
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,260
I don't know.

2336
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:54,260
What do you think, Loki?

2337
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,260
Are they right?

2338
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:56,260
No, they're not right.

2339
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:59,260
It's just they're basically saying, why the hell would we give you a feature for free

2340
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:04,260
when you can buy our PlayStation 2 system for $100?

2341
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:07,260
Or soon to be PlayStation 2 downloadable titles.

2342
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:10,260
I bet you that is what you're going to see in the next year.

2343
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:12,260
Then they're going to start releasing the PlayStation 2 as downloadable titles,

2344
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:14,260
just to fuck us all.

2345
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:16,260
But we can't add backwards compatibility, Butch.

2346
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:19,260
We can sure as hell emulate these titles perfectly.

2347
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:21,260
We know software emulation is out there.

2348
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:22,260
We know it's possible.

2349
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,260
They just don't want to give it to us.

2350
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:27,260
Yep. Lame.

2351
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:29,260
And yes, I do kind of want backwards compatibility.

2352
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:32,260
I mean, yes, I realize the games are old, but I still have them.

2353
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:34,260
And who doesn't sit there once in a while and go,

2354
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:37,260
you know, I kind of want to play Magic Pen Gel and draw a giant penis.

2355
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:41,260
You know, it's sometimes we get these desires to play the old PS2 games

2356
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,260
or Final Fantasy 12.

2357
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,260
I never did beat.

2358
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:48,260
Yes, I have a PlayStation 2 that I could go back and hook up if I really wanted to.

2359
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:50,260
But that's valuable shelf space.

2360
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:53,260
I have enough crap in my living room as it is.

2361
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:57,260
I realize Sony likes to live in a world where I don't own a 360 or a Wii,

2362
02:11:57,260 --> 02:12:00,260
but reality check, I do.

2363
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:05,260
And in order to not have a tangled cobweb of wires behind my television,

2364
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:08,260
some things had to go.

2365
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:11,260
That's what twist ties are made for.

2366
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:13,260
Just still.

2367
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:17,260
I am sending updated pictures of my tacos, by the way.

2368
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,260
I love how we have the food blog going on.

2369
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:23,260
I posted a link in chat, but it's on orangelunchrody.com.

2370
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:26,260
And you'll be able to see all these pictures if you're listening on the podcast,

2371
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:29,260
but you probably don't care.

2372
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:31,260
All right, anyhow, I don't know.

2373
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:35,260
I think it's a little silly of them to rid us of the backwards compatibility,

2374
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:39,260
especially when software emulation, at least of some titles, has been done.

2375
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:43,260
It's a little bit frustrating, but whatever.

2376
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:47,260
I mean, yeah, true, I can hook up the PS2 if I really want to play them that bad.

2377
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:52,260
I'm just saying I would be more apt to still buying PlayStation 2 games if they would play...

2378
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:54,260
I haven't bought a PS2 game since Final Fantasy XII.

2379
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:56,260
That was the last one I ever bought.

2380
02:12:56,260 --> 02:13:02,260
Yeah. Well, they'll be happy to sell them to you as a digital download later on.

2381
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:08,260
Well, with the announcement of the PlayStation Network minis,

2382
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:15,260
of course, Nintendo is looking to revamp its DSiWare service to kind of combat it.

2383
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:20,260
And what they're planning on doing, although the pricing won't change on the actual downloads,

2384
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:24,260
they'll basically stick to the $2, $5, $9 price models,

2385
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:29,260
they will have a lower barrier to entry for publishers,

2386
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:34,260
and also they're going to have some size limits as well,

2387
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:38,260
including, for example, a $5 game must be under 200 megabytes.

2388
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:43,260
Otherwise, Nintendo will charge a higher royalty.

2389
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:49,260
Which, that doesn't seem like much of an advantage, but okay.

2390
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:56,260
And, I don't know. I just think they need some better games on there.

2391
02:13:56,260 --> 02:14:00,260
I know from seeing a lot of reviews I've been reading for different things,

2392
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:02,260
I always see reviews for clocks and calculators.

2393
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:06,260
And honestly, I don't need more fucking clocks and calculators.

2394
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:09,260
I don't need a clock or calculator on my DSi.

2395
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:13,260
The DSi has a clock, at least I know the regular DS, I don't have a DSi,

2396
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:17,260
but at least the regular DS has a clock.

2397
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:20,260
So, I don't get it.

2398
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:21,260
It's themed clocks.

2399
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:24,260
Silly.

2400
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:29,260
We don't need more clocks or calculators.

2401
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:33,260
What does Nintendo need on DSiWare in order for people to pay attention?

2402
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:36,260
Virtual console.

2403
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:38,260
Really?

2404
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:43,260
That would- people would be eating that crap up, okay? Seriously.

2405
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:45,260
I guess, but I would just be frustrated,

2406
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:48,260
because you know they're not gonna let me just carry over the virtual console games I already have.

2407
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:49,260
Oh, of course not!

2408
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:50,260
I'd have to re-buy them.

2409
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:52,260
And I don't think I'd be- homie don't play that.

2410
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:54,260
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be-

2411
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,260
Your chair broke.

2412
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:57,260
Did the chair just break live on air?

2413
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,260
Oops.

2414
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,260
Uh oh.

2415
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:01,260
That can't be good.

2416
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,260
Oh, it just popped off.

2417
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,260
Oh, popped off.

2418
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:04,260
No, it broke.

2419
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:06,260
Ah, shoddy chair.

2420
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:12,260
Oh dear, tonight's show is-

2421
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:14,260
I just can't lean back.

2422
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:15,260
Poor Loki.

2423
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:18,260
It's alright, at least it's not a-

2424
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:19,260
Footstool?

2425
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:22,260
Yes, it's not the footstool.

2426
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:23,260
Poor Loki, we need to get-

2427
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:27,260
I almost bought an inflatable chair with my Dave and Buster's tickets.

2428
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:28,260
No!

2429
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:31,260
It's a hot pink inflatable chair with a pair of legs on it.

2430
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:35,260
And now I'm thinking we need one for the studio for Loki.

2431
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:37,260
I'm gonna pick up a folding chair next week.

2432
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,260
Did you know, in the old studio at my house-

2433
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:41,260
So they want a picture of Bork chair?

2434
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:42,260
No.

2435
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:44,260
The couch is now gone.

2436
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:47,260
The ex came and took your couch away.

2437
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:50,260
I'm glad our studio's here.

2438
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:51,260
Alright, anyhow.

2439
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:53,260
Sorry.

2440
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:54,260
Random show is very random.

2441
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,260
Hey!

2442
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:56,260
Grin!

2443
02:15:56,260 --> 02:15:57,260
Remember them?

2444
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:59,260
Well, Grin turned into Frown because they had to close last week.

2445
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:00,260
And that was because-

2446
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:01,260
Ah, Frown.

2447
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:02,260
Yes.

2448
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:03,260
Grin frowned because they got closed.

2449
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:05,260
And we shouldn't laugh though, that's not nice.

2450
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:08,260
But apparently they were the ones behind the Bionic Commando game.

2451
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:10,260
And we didn't end up reporting this on our show last week.

2452
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,260
I mean, it was just kind of a busy show, I guess.

2453
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,260
But they actually closed.

2454
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:15,260
They were the ones that were behind Bionic Commando.

2455
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:20,260
Which was received a little bit lukewarmly, I guess you could say.

2456
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:21,260
I mean, some people-

2457
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,260
I have some friends that are really into it, but not-

2458
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:24,260
It was alright.

2459
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:25,260
It had the sales figure.

2460
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:28,260
It didn't reinvigorate the series like a lot of people thought it would.

2461
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:34,260
And, unfortunately, the studio just had to go bye-bye because of it, I guess.

2462
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:41,260
But, apparently, one of the former employees posted to their LinkedIn profile that Grin

2463
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:43,260
was working on an unreleased masterpiece.

2464
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:49,260
And that masterpiece was a Final Fantasy game that they were working on for Squeenix.

2465
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:55,260
I guess this guy on his personal site, Tomislav Spajek, actually posted to his personal site

2466
02:16:55,260 --> 02:17:01,260
some concept art, and Fortress, apparently, is the game that was like a Final Fantasy game

2467
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:02,260
that was being worked on.

2468
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:08,260
Probably not like Final Fantasy XV or anything like that, but some type of spin-off Final Fantasy game.

2469
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,260
Do I have to close? Does that make them frown?

2470
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:13,260
That's what I already asked. I made that joke a minute ago.

2471
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:14,260
I didn't hear you. I was-

2472
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:15,260
You were too busy stuffing your face full of taco.

2473
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:17,260
No, I was busy kicking someone out of the chat room.

2474
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:18,260
No.

2475
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:20,260
Regulate!

2476
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:22,260
Do not anger, Doc Sockers.

2477
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:26,260
No, you act like a fucking child in the chat room. I'm gonna treat you like a freaking child.

2478
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:28,260
Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.

2479
02:17:28,260 --> 02:17:30,260
This is not a democracy.

2480
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:32,260
This is a cheerocracy.

2481
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:37,260
No, this is a freaking fashion-

2482
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,260
Becky got the reference. Did you hear the wall in the background?

2483
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:40,260
Yes.

2484
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:41,260
Thank you.

2485
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:42,260
Alright.

2486
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:44,260
It's a dark socorosity.

2487
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:49,260
Alright, speaking of dark socorosity,

2488
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:52,260
it's her chance to take over the show for a little bit.

2489
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:57,260
She's gonna have to swallow the taco and get to the mailbag.

2490
02:17:57,260 --> 02:18:01,260
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you send your emails.

2491
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,260
This is not a fish taco.

2492
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:03,260
Every week.

2493
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:06,260
Chew that taco, dark socor.

2494
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:09,260
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. Let's read some emails.

2495
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:15,260
Dear Rob, fuck you. Love, Jamie.

2496
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:17,260
Dear Jamie, fuck you back. Love, Rob.

2497
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:19,260
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

2498
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,260
Anyway, first thing I know.

2499
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:23,260
I'm only on me.

2500
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:24,260
Hey, guys.

2501
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:26,260
Hi.

2502
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,260
This summer has exhausted me.

2503
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:30,260
Are you spent?

2504
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:36,260
Between the summer of Arcade PSN and the two Monkey Island games that have been released, I am worn out.

2505
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:38,260
Need a cigarette?

2506
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:39,260
Just kidding. No smoke.

2507
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:44,260
I just got into the Champions Online beta, and let me tell you, they're doing it all wrong.

2508
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:50,260
There's some real good qualities in that game, but it will take a lot to fix things if they want to attract people to the game.

2509
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:55,260
Then again, with an offer that includes a spot in the Star Trek beta, I don't think they need to.

2510
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:58,260
Okay, I feel I need to ask a question now.

2511
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:01,260
What three games are you looking forward to next month, if any?

2512
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:05,260
I'm waiting on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Scribblenauts, and Beatles Rock Band.

2513
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,260
Uh, keep what you're doing, guys. Peace.

2514
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,260
And that's from Dan Chateau.

2515
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:11,260
Um.

2516
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,260
Excuse me.

2517
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:13,260
I held the microphone away.

2518
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:14,260
Hi, Dan Chateau.

2519
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:18,260
Dude, I'm totally waiting. I totally, totally want Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

2520
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:22,260
Except it's some freaking stupid Civil War crap, and I hate the Civil War crap.

2521
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:25,260
Um, Scribblenauts, I'm also looking forward to, um...

2522
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,260
You make Abraham Lincoln cry.

2523
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:29,260
What?

2524
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:34,260
Oh, shut up. It's the Marvel Civil War crap that they did that I got so sick of.

2525
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:37,260
They could at least do, like, the Skrull War or something.

2526
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:39,260
The Secret Invasion.

2527
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:43,260
Uh, to answer the question for me, Ion, I'm looking forward to.

2528
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:46,260
Uh, Beatles Rock Band is a good example of something else I'm looking forward to.

2529
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:48,260
Um, that'll be very cool.

2530
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:52,260
And, um, I don't know. Everything's kind of a blur for Christmas,

2531
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:55,260
and a lot of the stuff I was interested in got pushed back to 2010.

2532
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:59,260
So, um, I'm not sure. Those are definitely the two at the top of my list.

2533
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:02,260
It depends on if I get my 360 fix soon or not.

2534
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:05,260
Loki? Games you're looking forward to? Any planned purchases?

2535
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:07,260
Um, TJ Hero.

2536
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:10,260
Oh, that would be number three for me. I definitely have to check that out. Good call.

2537
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:12,260
I thought that was October for some reason, not September.

2538
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:14,260
It is October. Oh. Sorry.

2539
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:16,260
But it's almost September, so we can have it.

2540
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:17,260
Eh, good enough. Close enough.

2541
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:18,260
September, I don't really have any...

2542
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:19,260
He'll take that answer and he'll like it.

2543
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:22,260
September, I don't really have anything I'm looking forward to.

2544
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:25,260
Scribblenauts, I guess, would be kind of cool, but...

2545
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,260
I probably won't be buying that.

2546
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:29,260
I don't know. I may be buying that.

2547
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:33,260
Omkara222 in chat says Final Fantasy XIV. I don't think that'll be out next month.

2548
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,260
Keep talking. I'm still eating.

2549
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:38,260
We'd be lucky if the beta would come out next month, but I somehow sadly doubt it.

2550
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:40,260
So...

2551
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:41,260
There you go.

2552
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:44,260
Alright, we're gonna get to the next email as soon as StarSakura finishes chewing.

2553
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:48,260
But a mailbag at Orange L'Anchor, I am so stealing a chip.

2554
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,260
And I just want you... I'm gonna dare you to stop me.

2555
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,260
Oh, uh, is the pizza still cooking?

2556
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:54,260
Um...

2557
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:57,260
Hey, OLR crew, what do you think of Bethesda's Wet?

2558
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,260
It actually looks kind of pretty.

2559
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:04,260
This game looks really interesting. I like the fact that it infuses a sort of kung fu game, a shooter, and a 3D fighter.

2560
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:09,260
What did you guys see of it at E3? Thanks in advance, I like old people.

2561
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:13,260
Oh, and PS, it puts the lotion in the basket.

2562
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,260
Or else he gets the hose again.

2563
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:17,260
Um...

2564
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,260
Let's see, um...

2565
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:22,260
I saw a little bit of it, and it looked cool.

2566
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:28,260
I think Bethesda has a very good way of putting style on a lot of their games, unless it was the Star Trek game.

2567
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:34,260
Um, but every time I hear Bethesda, I'm always like, where's Oblivion V? Where's Oblivion V? Or, I should say, sorry, Elder Scrolls V.

2568
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:36,260
Where's Elder Scrolls V?

2569
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,260
But...

2570
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:38,260
They're working on it!

2571
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:41,260
I still need to go back and play the Call of Cthulhu game.

2572
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:42,260
What now?

2573
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:44,260
Because I still want to play the Call of Cthulhu game.

2574
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:53,260
Wet looked cool, but it didn't seem like the type of game I would probably drop $60 on, just because, you know, I like roleplaying and different styles of games.

2575
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:59,260
Is there a demo out there? Oh, Henderson Man says the demo for Wet is on the European PlayStation Network store, and I thought the demo was awesome.

2576
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,260
So go check it out.

2577
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,260
I will.

2578
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:03,260
Write us a review of it.

2579
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:05,260
Yes, please. I'm curious to know more about it.

2580
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:08,260
I have a profile for every region, so I can do that.

2581
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:09,260
Woohoo!

2582
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,260
Next email.

2583
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:12,260
Next email, these ships are tasty.

2584
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:14,260
Okay, from J-Rod.

2585
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:17,260
Ow, it bit my lip.

2586
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:25,260
Hey guys, I had something to speak up about. I had two Xbox 360s, and both of them ended up dying multiple times.

2587
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,260
Okay.

2588
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:31,260
After I sent them back to be repaired, they eventually died again, and I ended up getting a PS3 in the end.

2589
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:34,260
Rob said that his 360 just died as well.

2590
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:36,260
Now here's what I don't understand.

2591
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:44,260
Why did Rob complain about customers giving Microsoft a free pass for faulty hardware, and then in the same breath say, well, I'm probably just going to pick up an Elite?

2592
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:51,260
The product was rushed to market to beat Sony to the punch, and it couldn't be more obvious that they took shortcuts and screwed the customer to do so.

2593
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:55,260
So this type of behavior is now somewhat rewarded.

2594
02:22:55,260 --> 02:23:02,260
Just because all my friends have one doesn't mean I need to give Microsoft my time and money for absolute shit hardware quality.

2595
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:12,260
The problem is that people use Xbox Live as a MySpace page rather than a game console half the time, so they just keep buying new ones over and over.

2596
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:16,260
The only time a company will learn is if you tell them with your wallet.

2597
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:21,260
Send it back, and if they don't repair it, then scrap it, sell the games, and move on.

2598
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:26,260
I hate to say it, but if Rob buys another Xbox 360, he's basically just part of their problem he's complaining about.

2599
02:23:26,260 --> 02:23:32,260
My current 360 is on its last leg with lockups, and if it dies, out the door it goes to eBay along with my games.

2600
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:34,260
Excuse me.

2601
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:36,260
Don't be a part of the problem, Rob. Be a part of the solution.

2602
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:40,260
I absolutely disagree with you.

2603
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:43,260
I think it's just the viewpoint's a little too extreme for me.

2604
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:47,260
I get what he's saying, and I said earlier in the show, it was wrong of me.

2605
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:50,260
You're right. If I buy an elite system, I'll meet you at that point.

2606
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:55,260
If I buy an elite system, I'm rewarding Microsoft for borking my old system.

2607
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:59,260
So I came to my realization about that earlier this week.

2608
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:04,260
If I get another Xbox 360, which assuming Loki can't fix mine, I'm going to have to go for the low-end system.

2609
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:11,260
So I see you there, but when you talk about this whole sell your games back and the whole thing, that's where you lose me.

2610
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:22,260
Because you're smoking crack if you think that I'm going to sell all of my games back that I've invested hundreds of dollars in for a fraction of the cost.

2611
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:26,260
And therein lies the problem, and therein lies where I'm screwed.

2612
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:34,260
Because I have invested all this money not just in that, but on downloadable content, and some of which does not exist on the PlayStation 3,

2613
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:37,260
that yes, I do like to revisit on a regular basis.

2614
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:40,260
I have to have the hardware to make it work.

2615
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:45,260
But I do agree that I should not reward Microsoft by buying the highest, most expensive version of it.

2616
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:49,260
That I should buy a bare-bones system because I already have the hard drive and all the other crap I've bought.

2617
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:51,260
I don't need all the other crap.

2618
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:57,260
Hey, if you want the right to actually complain, you know, go buy 3% of the stock and then go to shareholder meetings.

2619
02:24:57,260 --> 02:25:05,260
I still do think, and I think most people agree with me, no matter if you think I was being a baby last week or what, no matter where,

2620
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:09,260
I think everybody kind of agrees with me, that Microsoft does need to be held accountable for this.

2621
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:10,260
No, they do.

2622
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:13,260
And history needs to show this negatively on Microsoft.

2623
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:17,260
When the next console comes out, the question needs to be asked.

2624
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:20,260
Have you tested this so that half of them do not fail?

2625
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:27,260
And somebody at Microsoft needs to go on record and assure the public that when and if the consoles fail,

2626
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:30,260
there will be a program in place to do something about it.

2627
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:37,260
And I'll tell you, though, what I'm going to do if this Xbox Red rings, because I think I'm on my third.

2628
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:43,260
But also keep in mind, we can just, you know, go to the store and Dan can get a new one.

2629
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:53,260
But I really think that, well, I don't know, I'd still be in warranty, so technically I'd get a new one for free.

2630
02:25:53,260 --> 02:26:02,260
But regardless, I would still take the time to write a letter and say, you know, hey, I still enjoy my games.

2631
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:10,260
I own more in games than I own in the cost of the three systems.

2632
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:13,260
So to me, it's a justified expense.

2633
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:17,260
You know, it'd be like my computer, okay?

2634
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:20,260
My last computer went kaput. What did I do?

2635
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:24,260
I bought a computer and installed all the old same shit that I had on my last computer on my new computer.

2636
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:28,260
You know, I've got all my Photoshop, my whole CS suite and everything.

2637
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:32,260
I'm using my same tablet, you know, a peripheral.

2638
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:35,260
I'm using my portable hard drive, the same thing.

2639
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:44,260
So if you know a computer's going to be obsolete, you know, in a year, then what's the point of buying a new computer?

2640
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:46,260
Same difference.

2641
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:56,260
I just, at the end of the day, though, I do think it's bull that clearly the Xbox 60 fails more than any other piece of hardware we've ever seen.

2642
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:59,260
Atari 7800.

2643
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:01,260
In the last 15 years.

2644
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:08,260
The Atari 7800 had issues with the power supply and they failed almost as much as the Xbox 360.

2645
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:12,260
All right. Any more in the mailbag?

2646
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:16,260
Oh, yeah.

2647
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:20,260
Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real.

2648
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:23,260
Oh, we already covered this.

2649
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:27,260
But this is actually kind of funny. It's from one, is all I'll say.

2650
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:35,260
Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real and will be coming out the first of next month and the original PS3 will drop $100.

2651
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:41,260
I already saw the box at GameStop. My friend works there and showed me inside where the consoles are.

2652
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:47,260
Also, the Xbox 360 price will be going down after Project Natal is released.

2653
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:51,260
P.S., what is with these women having no bras anymore?

2654
02:27:51,260 --> 02:28:00,260
Don't get me wrong. I love tits. But when someone 50 years older than you does not have a bra on, I barf.

2655
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:04,260
I think we should just let the e-mailers report on the news from now on.

2656
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:05,260
Who did this? Juan?

2657
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,260
Juan.

2658
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:10,260
Juan needs a segment. Oh, my God. This is the same Juan that e-mailed us before, I bet, huh?

2659
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:11,260
I think.

2660
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:14,260
He needs a segment on this program one way or another.

2661
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:16,260
What is up with that?

2662
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:20,260
He's like our new extra fur.

2663
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:22,260
You want a slice of your pizza, DarkSucker?

2664
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:23,260
Yes, I do.

2665
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:24,260
Okay, hold on.

2666
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:25,260
Give me a cheesy piece.

2667
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,260
I will let you pick whatever piece you want.

2668
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:28,260
All right.

2669
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,260
How many more e-mails do we have tonight?

2670
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:31,260
This one, a few.

2671
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:32,260
A few, all right.

2672
02:28:32,260 --> 02:28:33,260
I put this one in the name of science.

2673
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:35,260
Make it snappy.

2674
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:39,260
Shook here. Or is it Shookay? I never was told.

2675
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:47,260
Last week, I sent an e-mail about my Final Fantasy X dilemma and your advice worked.

2676
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:55,260
Oh, yeah, you had the bigot dad. Sorry, no offense.

2677
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:59,260
Oh, yeah, your dad was the asshole. Oh, sorry, no offense.

2678
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:00,260
But you're cool. You're cool.

2679
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:08,260
I'm not in the habit of talking ill of other people's parents, but really, the way that you portrayed your dad made him look to be a major bigot.

2680
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:14,260
But if I were to start with one, you are the winner.

2681
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:19,260
Anyway, I just sold Madden 04, 05, and 06 for about $40 to a privately-owned game store.

2682
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:22,260
I bought Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger and I'm loving both.

2683
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:24,260
I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever.

2684
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:25,260
Yes.

2685
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:34,260
And when you beat it, go back and actually hop on the teleport device right at the beginning of the game and you can beat Lavas from the beginning and get the artist ending.

2686
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:37,260
I'm sitting here in awe that he got that much for those old-ass Madden games.

2687
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:38,260
Props to you.

2688
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:47,260
Well, my dad walked in on me during the opening scene with Blitzball when he asked what it was. I made up something and said it was Super Soccer Extreme 2000 and he bought it.

2689
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:54,260
Again, my huge thanks for the advice.

2690
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:58,260
P.S. Dark Soccer, my username is pronounced as if the K was silent. Oh, sorry.

2691
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:01,260
So, it's shoe.

2692
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,260
K.

2693
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:04,260
K.

2694
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:05,260
K.

2695
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:07,260
Well, I'm glad it worked.

2696
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:11,260
Now move out.

2697
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:14,260
Okay. This is from Rob with Two B's.

2698
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:15,260
Ra-ba-ba.

2699
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:17,260
I'm gonna say Ra-ba-ba.

2700
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:18,260
Hi Ra-ba-ba.

2701
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:25,260
I ran across this crap accidentally coming to a PS3 near you, LittleBigPlanet Water.

2702
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:38,260
There's a trail of, there's a link and it looks like Sackboy will swim materials that float will float and Sackboy will have a hold your breath limit of air and I'm hoping they will give him scuba gear, the water equivalent of the untethered backpack.

2703
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:40,260
So, yeah, we talked about that.

2704
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:44,260
It has a, there's a video of creation mode on here.

2705
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:46,260
So, that's kinda cool.

2706
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:52,260
I can't wait to see how this gives a swift kick in the pants to all the user-generated levels and I agree with Ra-ba-ba.

2707
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:55,260
Sorry, I have a mouth full of pizza.

2708
02:30:55,260 --> 02:31:00,260
I agree with Ra-ba-ba that it would be awesome if there was like a scuba gear or something like that.

2709
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:03,260
Cause that means you can make these levels that were nothing but floating.

2710
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:07,260
And do you know how much that's gonna increase the amount of clone games we see?

2711
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,260
Like space shooters and stuff?

2712
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:11,260
Amazing.

2713
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:13,260
They're gonna reduce space shooters but the thing...

2714
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:15,260
It may be, it'll be easier with the water thing.

2715
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:19,260
Well, I think with the water though you are gonna get limited air supply and that type of stuff that's gonna work into it.

2716
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:23,260
Well, what if there's a scuba gear like Ra-ba-ba suggests? I think that's a great idea.

2717
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,260
Yeah, there will be that.

2718
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:30,260
Well, there's also another email from him.

2719
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:36,260
I just noticed a recent post on NeoFM.com about that old project.

2720
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:40,260
It's not really an update but some smart cookie converted it to Pump It Up.

2721
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:43,260
Both are five panel games in the arcade.

2722
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:49,260
It's at the game zone at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in the Great...

2723
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:54,260
Is it pronounced Olathe or Lathy? Kansas?

2724
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:56,260
Anyway, somewhere in Kansas.

2725
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:58,260
That's great.

2726
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:02,260
But there's details in the article at NeoFM.com.

2727
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:08,260
And then the other...

2728
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:14,260
And yes, I do remember this dancing game. This is the one that was gonna look like a BeatMania controller but it was with feet.

2729
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:16,260
Yeah. So, there you go.

2730
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:18,260
It was lol-worthy.

2731
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:20,260
And they have video of it.

2732
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:22,260
Interesting. And in Kansas?

2733
02:32:22,260 --> 02:32:23,260
Yeah, it's a...

2734
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:25,260
How random.

2735
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:31,260
It's from... It's a tooth... Well, NeoFM and a Pump It Up machine and...

2736
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,260
Well, because the whole thing runs off StepMania.

2737
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:38,260
I'm saying we should send Shane to go look but he won't care.

2738
02:32:38,260 --> 02:32:39,260
I know he won't.

2739
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,260
Oh, I got something for him. Thanks to Becky.

2740
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:43,260
What's that?

2741
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,260
Let me get it.

2742
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:50,260
He'll love it. We should send it to him and autograph it and everything.

2743
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:52,260
He wouldn't care about our autographs.

2744
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:55,260
He probably already has that but you never know.

2745
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:59,260
Okay, well then, I'll do something with it.

2746
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:03,260
Okay, O.O.R. listeners, who wants a copy of High School Musical 3?

2747
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:05,260
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

2748
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:08,260
Let us know and you'll get it.

2749
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:10,260
Because nobody in this room wants it.

2750
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:15,260
Or nobody in the hall either, else it would not be in my house.

2751
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:18,260
No, I'm sure... Ask him. He may not have it.

2752
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:20,260
He may not have bought it for whatever reason.

2753
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:25,260
Yeah, actually it says there's apparently the code leaked out for NeoFM.

2754
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:30,260
So it says, meanwhile some cool cats managed to get their hands on two separate leaks of our code

2755
02:33:30,260 --> 02:33:37,260
and put them in a centrifuge with some fairy dust and in the groove pumping up Linux code.

2756
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:43,260
They're pumping up machines to a local arcade neon FM 2009 machine.

2757
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:48,260
By the way, there's stuff leaked out to the internet a while ago in StepMania format.

2758
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:50,260
I have it, but eh.

2759
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:53,260
Oh, this is good pizza.

2760
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:57,260
Look how much of it I've eaten. It's good stuff. I like it.

2761
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,260
Except it's making me fat.

2762
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:02,260
Alright, any other emails tonight?

2763
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:05,260
Um, no.

2764
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:07,260
Alright, mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

2765
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:11,260
It's time to get angsty and I don't really have a good story to lead us into this tonight,

2766
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:30,260
but what would the show be without the FUs of the week?

2767
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:33,260
You know, I actually didn't have a story to lead us into that.

2768
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:35,260
You want to tell us real fast?

2769
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:43,260
Yeah, well I mentioned it earlier, GameStop saying GameStop expects a UMD dump by new PSP Go owners.

2770
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:50,260
Since, obviously, Sony's not supporting them, Tony Bartell, the GameStop EVP of Merchandising and Marketing,

2771
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:55,260
said we have a very clear roadmap on how we can drive profitability on the sales of games.

2772
02:34:55,260 --> 02:35:03,260
It will also be a strong contribution in their trade-in process when you have people that will have UMD games

2773
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:08,260
and they will no longer work on the platform and they'll fuel additional currency for GameStop.

2774
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:11,260
Hail, GameStop.

2775
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:13,260
That's it.

2776
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:15,260
DarkSaga, you're angst then.

2777
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:18,260
My FU goes to how much my hand hurts.

2778
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:25,260
I had surgery again on Friday for him to pull out the rest of the suture, and what happened is that the suture was in a knot,

2779
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:27,260
which is why it wouldn't come out.

2780
02:35:27,260 --> 02:35:30,260
It had been knotted up inside my hand.

2781
02:35:30,260 --> 02:35:33,260
So when it got tugged on, of course, ow!

2782
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:36,260
So, yeah, suture stuck in hand.

2783
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:42,260
But it's gone now, which means I get two more additional weeks off of work.

2784
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:44,260
That means you'll have the time off when Misty's here, huh?

2785
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:46,260
Sure will, except for my anniversary.

2786
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:47,260
Right, no, I know.

2787
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:48,260
Thank you.

2788
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:52,260
I have to work that day. I hope she has something planned for the day.

2789
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:54,260
We'll figure something out.

2790
02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:59,260
And also announcing to the universe, September 1st is my four year anniversary.

2791
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:02,260
But you've known Dan for like nine on top of that, right?

2792
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:05,260
We've been together for eleven and a half years.

2793
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:06,260
Nice.

2794
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:08,260
Loki, any angst for you tonight?

2795
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:14,260
Not really. I guess I have to wait for my arcade cabinet to come in.

2796
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:18,260
I have to wait another four weeks, basically.

2797
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:22,260
And, yeah, that just sucks.

2798
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:25,260
But, no, that's all I got.

2799
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:29,260
My F.U. of the week, I've had a really, really shitty week.

2800
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:33,260
I just want to say F.U. to people that want to play political games

2801
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:38,260
and all that crap when I'm just not down with it.

2802
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:41,260
You know what? I am a professional individual.

2803
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:45,260
I go to places to get a job done and I'm not interested in playing games.

2804
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:47,260
So I will get my job done.

2805
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:52,260
Also an F.U. to the fact that when I'm having these bad days,

2806
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:57,260
the person I want to turn to to talk about these things about

2807
02:36:57,260 --> 02:37:01,260
is absent with better things to do, I suppose.

2808
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:03,260
I've not had a good week.

2809
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:05,260
I'm going to go home and cry into my pillow.

2810
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:07,260
We're going to get ice cream after the show again.

2811
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:10,260
We've got to finish in the next hour because Baskin Ramen closes at ten.

2812
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:11,260
So step on it!

2813
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:13,260
We'll get you pie later.

2814
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,260
Alright, we've got some news from Loki.

2815
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:17,260
Actually, we're getting to the Skyplane pretty soon.

2816
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:19,260
We're almost to the end of the show, believe it or not.

2817
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:20,260
Yes, we are.

2818
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:26,260
Lots of Rock Band information, including the details on the first download content

2819
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:28,260
that's going to be available for Rock Band Beatles.

2820
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:32,260
The first two albums that they're going to have available will be

2821
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:37,260
Abbey Road and also Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

2822
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:44,260
Abbey Road will be arriving first on October 20th at the price of $16.98

2823
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:55,260
or 1360 Microsoft Points with each individual track running you $2 or 160 Microsoft Points.

2824
02:37:55,260 --> 02:38:00,260
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band will come out in November.

2825
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:06,260
I guess also the next album after that will be Rubber Soul and that will arrive in December.

2826
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:10,260
Lots of tracks coming out, man.

2827
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:13,260
They've got Uber tracks.

2828
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:16,260
And what's going to be kind of cool about that though, I'm assuming,

2829
02:38:16,260 --> 02:38:20,260
is that each one's going to have the different animations in the background.

2830
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:24,260
So some of those songs actually would be kind of cool to see.

2831
02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:27,260
I'm really kind of considering maybe buying this.

2832
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:28,260
I don't know.

2833
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:31,260
I don't really play a lot of Rock Band lately.

2834
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:33,260
But it might be fun. I don't know.

2835
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:35,260
I like some of these songs.

2836
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:38,260
I think I'm totally going to have it.

2837
02:38:38,260 --> 02:38:42,260
I'm so mad my Xbox crapped out right before a song I really wanted to play had come out

2838
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:43,260
and I didn't get to play it.

2839
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:44,260
Here's the problem.

2840
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:47,260
Here's the thing I have a little problem about.

2841
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:50,260
And I'm kind of confused in this sense.

2842
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:53,260
Because some of these songs I thought were already in the game.

2843
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:56,260
Remember how they were showing us different songs like

2844
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:59,260
Octopus's Garden and stuff like that?

2845
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:04,260
I thought that was already in the game.

2846
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:09,260
But for some reason it's listed on the Abbey Road download content here.

2847
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:13,260
Well it might also be that when you download the album you're kind of getting the rest of the album.

2848
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:16,260
Because I think every album has some representation in the game.

2849
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:18,260
So I don't know.

2850
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:22,260
Maybe. I guess maybe they're just listing what's on the album and not actual download content.

2851
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:25,260
That could be because if these people said to the website,

2852
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:27,260
like, hey we're releasing these albums,

2853
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:30,260
the website probably just went to Amazon.com and just wrote out the track list

2854
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:33,260
without thinking, oh this song is probably in the game already.

2855
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:34,260
You know what I mean?

2856
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:35,260
Yeah.

2857
02:39:35,260 --> 02:39:36,260
That makes sense.

2858
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:39,260
And apparently I guess the All You Need Is Love download content,

2859
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:41,260
which is going to be a single,

2860
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:44,260
will be available as a timed exclusive on Xbox 360

2861
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:46,260
and the game's launch is September 9th.

2862
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:49,260
And then also if you purchase a full Abbey Road album,

2863
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:52,260
you'll have the option to play the B-Side Melody,

2864
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:55,260
or B-Side Medley I'm sorry, from

2865
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:59,260
You'll Never Get Me Your Money Through The End

2866
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,260
as one continuous track.

2867
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:03,260
I may not be the biggest Beatles fan in the world.

2868
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:08,260
I'm like, cool, Beatles are cool. I respect that people are in love with them.

2869
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,260
I understand why they have such a place in history and so forth.

2870
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:13,260
But I'm actually really excited about this game.

2871
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:15,260
It just looks so cool.

2872
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:17,260
It's fun to watch and play.

2873
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:18,260
Yeah.

2874
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:19,260
Other stuff.

2875
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:22,260
This week on the Rock Band Store,

2876
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:27,260
they're going to have Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and Jet.

2877
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:30,260
The individual songs, of course, from Billy Idol.

2878
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:32,260
Please say it's Cradle of Love.

2879
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:33,260
No.

2880
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:34,260
White Wedding.

2881
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:35,260
That's already in there.

2882
02:40:35,260 --> 02:40:36,260
No.

2883
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:39,260
It's Mony Mony and Rebel Yell.

2884
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,260
Oh, Rebel Yell's cool. Okay.

2885
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:44,260
And each of those are available for 160 Microsoft points or $2.

2886
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:49,260
Fleetwood Mac, you have Don't Stop and World Turning.

2887
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:53,260
Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow, Baby.

2888
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:55,260
I should sing the Rock Band songs every week.

2889
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:58,260
And Jet, you have She's A Genius.

2890
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:04,260
And then finally, Tom Petty, you have I Won't Back Down and Running Down a Dream.

2891
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:09,260
And those are all available August 25th through the 27th,

2892
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:11,260
depending on which store you're getting in from.

2893
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:13,260
Tom Petty's kind of awesome.

2894
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:15,260
And then, of course, the Wii.

2895
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:17,260
You've got lots of stuff coming there.

2896
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:20,260
A lot of it just previously released stuff on other things.

2897
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:22,260
You have a lot of tracks from Grateful Dead,

2898
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:27,260
Foo Fighters, Dropkick Murphy, White Zombie, that kind of stuff.

2899
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:30,260
And those will all be available for 200 Wii points each.

2900
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:32,260
And those will be available on the 25th.

2901
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:36,260
And then finally on the PSP, you're getting two things of download content on the 27th,

2902
02:41:36,260 --> 02:41:41,260
including the Zombies She's Not There and White Zombie Black Sunshine,

2903
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:43,260
each available for $2.

2904
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:51,260
And finally, Rock Band's download content is expected to hit 1,000 tracks by the holiday.

2905
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:58,260
And there's going to be some new tracks, of course, coming from Queen, Nirvana, Tom Petty,

2906
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:06,260
which we got some this week, Elton John, Iggy Pop, The White Stripes, Pantera, Talking Heads,

2907
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:09,260
Korn, and The Raccoon Tears.

2908
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:11,260
What do you have from Iggy Pop?

2909
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:14,260
I don't think they've given any songs yet, just bands.

2910
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:18,260
No, they're just listing stuff, as well as many more from other artists.

2911
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:20,260
But hey, that's kind of cool.

2912
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:22,260
It's kind of like Elton John, Queen.

2913
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:23,260
Need I say more?

2914
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:24,260
I need to get Sing Star Queen, by the way.

2915
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:25,260
That is out and about.

2916
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:26,260
Oh, need.

2917
02:42:26,260 --> 02:42:29,260
I'm waiting for the price drop, because you know, once the game's out a month,

2918
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,260
it'll be in the clearance bin for 1999.

2919
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:34,260
That's what I'm waiting for.

2920
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:35,260
And that's it.

2921
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:36,260
Sweet.

2922
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:38,260
That was a lot of Rock Band news.

2923
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:41,260
They are busy bees over there, considering there was no Rock Band 3 this year.

2924
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:42,260
500 tracks a year?

2925
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:43,260
That's not bad.

2926
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:44,260
Good lord.

2927
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:46,260
A lot more than certain other music franchises.

2928
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:47,260
Apparently.

2929
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,260
La la la la la.

2930
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:51,260
Alright, hey, Gran Turismo 5 is the last story we have tonight,

2931
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:55,260
before we get to the phone lines a little later on.

2932
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:58,260
Apparently, this was being shown off at Gamescom.

2933
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:01,260
Not just Gran Turismo 5, but Gran Turismo PSP.

2934
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:04,260
There's some images of the game that have leaked out to the internet,

2935
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:07,260
and of course, they are pretty.

2936
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,260
The main menu looks like what you see in-

2937
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:09,260
I like how you said that.

2938
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:10,260
What?

2939
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:11,260
Pretty.

2940
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:12,260
It is pretty.

2941
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:13,260
Look, it's pretty.

2942
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:15,260
I always want to say Grand Theft Auto 5.

2943
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:18,260
It's Gran Turismo 5, because GT-

2944
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:19,260
I just want to put the A in there.

2945
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:24,260
GT5 Prolog uses that same kind of menu.

2946
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:25,260
So there you go.

2947
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:27,260
There's going to be 80 tracks in the game.

2948
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:29,260
1,000 cars.

2949
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:33,260
830 regular ones, and 170 with a little more modeling.

2950
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:38,260
Damage will be in the game, and GTTV is back.

2951
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:40,260
And it can also be run on your PSP.

2952
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:43,260
No release date yet, which you know what that means.

2953
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:45,260
2010.

2954
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:46,260
It's been a long-

2955
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:47,260
It is 2010.

2956
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,260
Considering we got that prologue quite some time ago,

2957
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:51,260
that's a long wait.

2958
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:53,260
That's a very long wait.

2959
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:55,260
Very cool if you're a fan of Gran Turismo.

2960
02:43:55,260 --> 02:43:57,260
I am not as big on the Gran Turismo series,

2961
02:43:57,260 --> 02:44:00,260
because I like my arcade racers.

2962
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:02,260
Gran Turismo is a little too realistic for me.

2963
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:04,260
It's more like Project Gotham and stuff.

2964
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:05,260
It's not that I hate them.

2965
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:08,260
I think they're pretty to watch other people play that are good at it.

2966
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,260
I'm just really bad at them.

2967
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:12,260
So there you go.

2968
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:14,260
Hey, it's your turn to give us a call.

2969
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:16,260
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2970
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:18,260
Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundrio.

2971
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:20,260
The Skype line is open right now.

2972
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:22,260
We're only going to take a couple calls tonight.

2973
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:26,260
But we want to also get any last minute stories that might be out there

2974
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:28,260
while we wait for folks to call.

2975
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:30,260
Yes. Why not?

2976
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:31,260
Go ahead.

2977
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:32,260
Darcy, do you have something?

2978
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:33,260
I like pie.

2979
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:38,260
And you know, and think that I was going to let you go ahead and go first.

2980
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:40,260
That teaches me.

2981
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:46,260
Anyways, UK is getting a pretty cool deal with Guitar Hero 5 purchases.

2982
02:44:46,260 --> 02:44:50,260
Much like how we're getting the free Van Halen over here.

2983
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:57,260
Folks that purchase Guitar Hero 5 in the UK will be eligible to get a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour.

2984
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:59,260
That's more songs.

2985
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:01,260
And you know, probably a better selection.

2986
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:02,260
It's something.

2987
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:03,260
Hey, we've got a call.

2988
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:05,260
Hi, you're on OrangeLaundrio. Who's this?

2989
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,260
It's Deathwishing.

2990
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:09,260
Hey, Deathwishing. What's up?

2991
02:45:09,260 --> 02:45:13,260
Nothing. I just had a really cool week and it's ending really well.

2992
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:22,260
But I wanted to talk about the Halo ODSD tour and how in a way it's kind of crap.

2993
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:24,260
Why is it crap? Someone asked about this on Twitter tonight.

2994
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:26,260
It has an age requirement on it.

2995
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:27,260
Oh really?

2996
02:45:27,260 --> 02:45:30,260
Yeah, you have to be 17 and older. I don't know if they check ID or anything.

2997
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:34,260
I mean, I don't have ID. I don't have a driver's license yet.

2998
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:38,260
You know, in California they make you pay up the ass to get one.

2999
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:41,260
Well, it is a mature rated game.

3000
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:48,260
Yeah, but I just find it really lame because it's just like...

3001
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:52,260
It's a mature rated game and yet we're all going to get our hands on it.

3002
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,260
There's going to be like 8-year-old kids going,

3003
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:56,260
Oh my god, I pwn you, noob.

3004
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:58,260
T-bag.

3005
02:45:58,260 --> 02:46:00,260
That's because parents suck.

3006
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:03,260
Hey, my parents were cool. I was playing Grand Theft Auto back then.

3007
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:07,260
And look at me, I grew up to be perfectly fine.

3008
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:12,260
Are there individuals out there that might debate that comment, Death Wishing?

3009
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:19,260
That one Californian politician who got banned.

3010
02:46:19,260 --> 02:46:21,260
If you know who he is.

3011
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:22,260
No idea.

3012
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:25,260
But did you go to the tour? Are you planning on going to the tour?

3013
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:29,260
I'm planning on going to it. I'm going to try to talk my friend into taking me down to Pasadena.

3014
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:34,260
But I don't see any coming near you guys, sadly.

3015
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:36,260
I'm not sad.

3016
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:40,260
Hey, it's pretty cool. You get free stuff. I think you get t-shirts and stuff for doing it.

3017
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:44,260
Whoopee. I'm not that big on Halo.

3018
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,260
I understand why people love their Halo.

3019
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:51,260
I used to play Halo 2 all the time with my college friends, but I'm kind of over it.

3020
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:56,260
Rob, about your 360, I don't see why yours is broken down so much.

3021
02:46:56,260 --> 02:47:01,260
I'm on my second, but my first one still works.

3022
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:03,260
I just have to close the tray in.

3023
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:06,260
I just open and close it to get games to work, and I'm letting my friend use it because his blew up.

3024
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:08,260
Like, literally exploded.

3025
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:11,260
Wow. That's impressive.

3026
02:47:11,260 --> 02:47:13,260
The amazing exploding 360s.

3027
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:17,260
I call mine the Jesus box because it won't die.

3028
02:47:17,260 --> 02:47:18,260
It just keeps resurrecting.

3029
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:20,260
Alright, well, Death Wishing-

3030
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:22,260
The red ring then came back.

3031
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:25,260
We're going to let you go so we can get as many calls as we can tonight and still have time for ice cream.

3032
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:27,260
But thanks so much for the call, okay?

3033
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:28,260
Boy.

3034
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:29,260
Boy.

3035
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:32,260
I should ask him if he's going to the Silent Hill house.

3036
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:34,260
Because I still want to go.

3037
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:36,260
I still do. I think we're just going to have to go.

3038
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:38,260
We're just going to have to get in the car and go.

3039
02:47:38,260 --> 02:47:40,260
But I'm poor.

3040
02:47:40,260 --> 02:47:42,260
So?

3041
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:44,260
Sell your soul.

3042
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:46,260
No, I already did.

3043
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:48,260
That's why I've-

3044
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:49,260
Never mind.

3045
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:52,260
Alright. Hi, you're on the wrong side. Who's this?

3046
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:54,260
This is DS Master 26.

3047
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:56,260
Hi, what's on your mind, DS Master 26?

3048
02:47:56,260 --> 02:48:00,260
I'm hearing Echo. Try to get the microphone away from the speaker.

3049
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:04,260
Oh, sorry. I'm going off the PSP 3000 here.

3050
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:06,260
It's fine.

3051
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:10,260
Here, I'm going to get my headset in here.

3052
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:14,260
Ironic. DS Master on a PSP.

3053
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:16,260
Ah, whatever.

3054
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:20,260
Basically, I'm here to do a review of a new game.

3055
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:22,260
Yes.

3056
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:24,260
Poppin' Music for Wii.

3057
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:30,260
Oh, you played Poppin' Music for Wii, and you don't sound happy about it. Please tell us all about this game.

3058
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:33,260
It's complete crap.

3059
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:40,260
I've been a long time Beemani fan, and this has done great disgrace to the series.

3060
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:46,260
Okay, I need to know the reason why it's crap, and I need to know how it's different from the Poppin' Music us Beemani fans know.

3061
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:48,260
Basically, all-

3062
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:52,260
You know what they did with the DDR games and thrown those in the crapper?

3063
02:48:52,260 --> 02:49:01,260
Well, it's all licensed stuff like Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus stuff into Poppin'.

3064
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:08,260
And there's no controller with it. You just use the Wii Remote nunchuck like you would on...

3065
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:13,260
Oh, let me see here. Rayman Raving Rabbids in the dancing section.

3066
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:17,260
That's pretty much how it's played. It's complete crap.

3067
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:20,260
Hmm.

3068
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:24,260
Well, that's too bad.

3069
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:30,260
Ray Ayanami in chat is asking, no Konami originals?

3070
02:49:30,260 --> 02:49:37,260
Very few, if any. They tried to put in a revamped B4U song in there somehow.

3071
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:43,260
And then something out of, like it sounds like I've, I don't know if you've heard of this cartoon.

3072
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:48,260
Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. They came out a few years ago.

3073
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:52,260
Puffy's an actual pop band in Japan.

3074
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:57,260
Yeah, and I think one of their songs ended up somewhere in the game.

3075
02:49:57,260 --> 02:50:04,260
I don't remember which one it was, but it was complete crud. It was one of the DLC tracks.

3076
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:09,260
I mean, that's one thing this one has that all the others didn't have was DLC.

3077
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:14,260
I mean, yeah, I'm glad they're finally getting to the next gen and DLC to their music games.

3078
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:21,260
But at the same time, Konami's just disappointing the B-Monic fans left and right.

3079
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:23,260
Hmm.

3080
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:31,260
And, by the way, just to let you know, that line you coded, it's straight off one of my favorite series.

3081
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:34,260
Bring It On.

3082
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:38,260
Only the best movie of all time.

3083
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:44,260
Yes, and they just got a fifth one, and I have a review on that. It is awesome.

3084
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:48,260
They have a fifth Bring It On movie now? I've only ever seen the first one.

3085
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:50,260
Yeah, way too many Bring It On movies.

3086
02:50:50,260 --> 02:50:53,260
I said, brrr, it's cold in here. Alright, forget it.

3087
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:56,260
Anyhow, alright, we're letting you go, DS Masters, we're gonna get some more calls.

3088
02:50:56,260 --> 02:50:59,260
Go watch Bring It On on your PSP.

3089
02:50:59,260 --> 02:51:14,260
Um, no, no, no, but basically I heard rumors of possibly that the choreographer from that is doing a second All Star Cheer Camp game, or whatever, for Wii.

3090
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:15,260
Yes, they are.

3091
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:20,260
Which I actually pointed, it does give you a workout twice as much as Wii Fit will ever give you.

3092
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:26,260
Okay, great, bye. I guess he didn't hear the part where he said I was letting him go, he just kept talking.

3093
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:30,260
It's important that we know about All Star Cheer Camp, though.

3094
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:33,260
Poor guy, I was so rude to him. I hope he hears this.

3095
02:51:33,260 --> 02:51:36,260
You're horrible, Rob. Horrible human being.

3096
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:40,260
Well, did I not say, okay, we gotta wrap up to get some more calls?

3097
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:43,260
He wasn't done yet, okay? That's just wrong.

3098
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:45,260
He was talking about choreography.

3099
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:48,260
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

3100
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:51,260
What?

3101
02:51:51,260 --> 02:51:54,260
Ah, crap!

3102
02:51:54,260 --> 02:52:00,260
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3103
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:03,260
Give us a call if you want to talk.

3104
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:09,260
Our number is 555-4444.

3105
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:12,260
No, it's not really, it's 1877 Game OLR.

3106
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:14,260
Since it's not ringing, I'm gonna give it some more.

3107
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:16,260
If you don't call, we'll get off the cleanse.

3108
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:18,260
Oh, here we go, last call.

3109
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:20,260
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3110
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:21,260
Hi, this is AgDef.

3111
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,260
Hi, AgDef, what's on your mind?

3112
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:28,260
First of all, sorry about your 360. I'm definitely sorry it happened.

3113
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:30,260
Dude, I don't know why you're blaming yourself.

3114
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:33,260
The damn thing was obviously gonna break eventually.

3115
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:37,260
At least I went down in a blaze of glory.

3116
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:39,260
Yeah, that's true.

3117
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:41,260
I'm just joking, man.

3118
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:45,260
Though I am sorry about the thing breaking.

3119
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:47,260
I blame Microsoft, not you.

3120
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:49,260
What's on your mind?

3121
02:52:49,260 --> 02:52:53,260
I wanted to talk about the digital download thing.

3122
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:55,260
You were talking at the beginning of the show?

3123
02:52:55,260 --> 02:52:58,260
Yes.

3124
02:52:58,260 --> 02:53:02,260
I think I made a comment in chat, or in Penelope,

3125
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:11,260
that most people have a really good connection to internet.

3126
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:15,260
Like me, I don't have a really good connection.

3127
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:20,260
I have only one megabyte per second connection,

3128
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:24,260
so it would take me an eternity to download a four,

3129
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:28,260
or maybe six, or bigger game.

3130
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:30,260
That is a damn good point.

3131
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:33,260
That is a damn good point I think a lot of people forget to consider,

3132
02:53:33,260 --> 02:53:35,260
is that you know what? In some parts of the world,

3133
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:37,260
they're still on dial-up.

3134
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:39,260
In fact, I bet there are some places where they're still using

3135
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:42,260
two Dixie cups and a string to connect to the internet.

3136
02:53:42,260 --> 02:53:45,260
Basically.

3137
02:53:45,260 --> 02:53:50,260
It is not all super fast cable connections everywhere in the world.

3138
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:54,260
Granted, I guess not every game company technically does business

3139
02:53:54,260 --> 02:53:56,260
in every part of the world if you want to get technical,

3140
02:53:56,260 --> 02:54:01,260
but still, it is a little bit sad that if they go this digital distribution route,

3141
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:03,260
I mean, how easy would it be?

3142
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:05,260
I know you've called in the show.

3143
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:07,260
You live in Mexico, and I know you've talked about sometimes

3144
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:09,260
coming up to the U.S. to get games,

3145
02:54:09,260 --> 02:54:11,260
or having them shipped down to you or what have you.

3146
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:13,260
Imagine if with this digital distribution stuff,

3147
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,260
they could just say,

3148
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:17,260
oh, block Mexico, it's not their time yet.

3149
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:19,260
We have to wait until we get the localized version for them,

3150
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:21,260
so we're just going to block their IP,

3151
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:23,260
so that they can't get the game.

3152
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:25,260
That would suck.

3153
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:27,260
Yeah, like it happened with Palapon 2.

3154
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:31,260
It's only a digital download in the United States.

3155
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:34,260
Though, Sony made a good decision,

3156
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:38,260
and they brought the UMD over here.

3157
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:41,260
So maybe if they do that in the future,

3158
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:43,260
if you can have the digital download,

3159
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:45,260
or you can have the disk,

3160
02:54:45,260 --> 02:54:49,260
you have the option that maybe it could work better.

3161
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:51,260
But if you only have one option,

3162
02:54:51,260 --> 02:54:54,260
and it's the digital download, it won't work.

3163
02:54:54,260 --> 02:54:55,260
It definitely won't work.

3164
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:58,260
I think, Akdeft, you definitely bring up a good point

3165
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:00,260
about something that I bet a lot of people don't think about

3166
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:03,260
because a lot of us are spoiled with our cable connections

3167
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:05,260
here in the States.

3168
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:08,260
Akdeft, anything else real quick before I let you go?

3169
02:55:08,260 --> 02:55:10,260
No, nothing else.

3170
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:12,260
Okay. See ya.

3171
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:13,260
See ya.

3172
02:55:13,260 --> 02:55:15,260
Thank you for calling.

3173
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:17,260
Yes, thanks as always for calling.

3174
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:20,260
I like it when our callers get us to think about things

3175
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:22,260
that we didn't think about before.

3176
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:24,260
I don't like thinking. It's horrible.

3177
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:26,260
Well, too bad. Think about some other last-minute stories

3178
02:55:26,260 --> 02:55:27,260
while I close up Skype.

3179
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:29,260
If you didn't get through, hey, you can always tweet us,

3180
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:31,260
email us, chat with us.

3181
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:33,260
Or buy me a pony.

3182
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:35,260
Or buy Jamie. Guess what I saw yesterday, Jamie?

3183
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:36,260
A pony?

3184
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:37,260
Derby Owners Club.

3185
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:39,260
Where? Where's the doc?

3186
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:42,260
Dave & Buster's. Milpitas. Still.

3187
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:45,260
Ooh, I love the horsey racing games.

3188
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:46,260
I'm kind of over it.

3189
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:49,260
They needed a sequel about five years ago.

3190
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:52,260
Hey, there's a new game coming to the PS3

3191
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:55,260
called 3D Dot Game Heroes.

3192
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:59,260
It's basically kind of a 3D version of pixel art.

3193
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:01,260
If you were to take, like, an old-school Final Fantasy game

3194
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:04,260
and make it all 3D and high-res,

3195
02:56:04,260 --> 02:56:06,260
that's what the game would look like.

3196
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:07,260
It's kind of cool.

3197
02:56:07,260 --> 02:56:10,260
And that should be coming out in Japan this November.

3198
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:12,260
No word on it coming over to the US,

3199
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:16,260
but I only hope it does, because that would be awesome.

3200
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:18,260
Castle Crashers is getting new download content

3201
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:21,260
in the Necromatic pack,

3202
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:24,260
and that will feature some really cool things,

3203
02:56:24,260 --> 02:56:29,260
including a chainsaw, a golden mace,

3204
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:32,260
a dragon head animal orb,

3205
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:35,260
and also two new characters,

3206
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:39,260
the necromancer and the cult minion you'll get to play as.

3207
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:41,260
So all that available.

3208
02:56:41,260 --> 02:56:44,260
No word on what the cost or when it's coming,

3209
02:56:44,260 --> 02:56:47,260
but hopefully soon.

3210
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:51,260
Ubisoft has officially revealed a new game

3211
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:53,260
that they're putting out called Just Dance

3212
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:57,260
for people who, I guess, want to dance.

3213
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:02,260
And the game itself actually focuses more on arm and leg movements,

3214
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:05,260
mainly arm movements, it looks like.

3215
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:08,260
But, yeah, the people in there,

3216
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:12,260
they call them, I think, the lifestyle shots or whatever,

3217
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:15,260
look absolutely ridiculous.

3218
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:18,260
But it is going to be coming out,

3219
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:22,260
and they have 30 licensed tracks,

3220
02:57:22,260 --> 02:57:24,260
including Groove is in the Heart,

3221
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:26,260
Pump Up the Jam, and You Can't Touch This,

3222
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:32,260
who are, you know, I don't know.

3223
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:37,260
And also, I guess people are slightly interested in this title

3224
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:41,260
because they think that maybe it's being developed by Q Entertainment.

3225
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:45,260
This might be the secret title that they're developing.

3226
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:47,260
Hope not!

3227
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:49,260
It looks like crap.

3228
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:52,260
I hope it's not.

3229
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:56,260
Konami is apparently location testing Pop'n Music 18.

3230
02:57:56,260 --> 02:57:58,260
That's right.

3231
02:57:58,260 --> 02:58:02,260
The new mix, I believe, was...

3232
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:05,260
God, I just had it, too.

3233
02:58:11,260 --> 02:58:14,260
I forgot the name, and I can't find it.

3234
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:16,260
Anyways, Pop'n Music 18. We don't even know the subtitle.

3235
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:19,260
It's not important.

3236
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:21,260
But apparently they're going to be conducting that

3237
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:23,260
starting, actually it was last week,

3238
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:27,260
starting August 20th at AMPIA,

3239
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:30,260
at Kungawa Prefecture,

3240
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:32,260
and that's going to run from the 20th through the 30th,

3241
02:58:32,260 --> 02:58:38,260
and then at Rundown at the Fukuoka Prefecture.

3242
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:40,260
Fukuoka.

3243
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:44,260
Fukuoka Prefecture from the 21st through the 30th.

3244
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:46,260
So you can check that out.

3245
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:49,260
They have more information on the location test site,

3246
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:54,260
that's konami.jp slash AMP slash location test slash Pop'n 18.

3247
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:56,260
So check that out.

3248
02:58:56,260 --> 02:58:59,260
If you live in Japan.

3249
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:01,260
And then, let's see here.

3250
02:59:01,260 --> 02:59:04,260
Modern Warfare 2. Of course, I have talked about in the past

3251
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:06,260
about how Activision is trying to rip people off

3252
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:08,260
with the price of Guitar Hero 5 on the Wii.

3253
02:59:08,260 --> 02:59:10,260
No one seems to give a shit.

3254
02:59:10,260 --> 02:59:13,260
But now that it's available on PC,

3255
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:18,260
apparently they are trying to raise the price of the PC version as well.

3256
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:22,260
Ubisoft Amazon Best Buy are now showing the PC version with a $60 price tag.

3257
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:26,260
Now that might not be a big deal for people that normally buy console games,

3258
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:33,260
but for PC owners, most games only retail at $50 retail.

3259
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:38,260
But see, I told you they were evil, and no one believed me.

3260
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:43,260
But now that it's a more important game, people might listen.

3261
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:49,260
And then finally, Namco Bandai is releasing a new game

3262
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:52,260
on the Playstation Portable in December.

3263
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:54,260
I believe this is coming out in Japan.

3264
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:58,260
It's called Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos.

3265
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:01,260
And Queen's Blade apparently is a...

3266
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:05,260
They call it a Lost World style combat picture book game.

3267
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:11,260
And features characters with large...

3268
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:14,260
Boobies.

3269
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:16,260
Sweet.

3270
03:00:16,260 --> 03:00:19,260
To the point that it's absolutely ridiculous.

3271
03:00:19,260 --> 03:00:23,260
I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous.

3272
03:00:23,260 --> 03:00:27,260
That's how I try to make my character an ion with boobies that big.

3273
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:33,260
So that should be coming out this fall on PSP in Japan.

3274
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:35,260
Alright.

3275
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:38,260
That's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

3276
03:00:38,260 --> 03:00:41,260
but first we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3277
03:00:41,260 --> 03:00:43,260
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3278
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:45,260
Boobies.

3279
03:00:45,260 --> 03:00:48,260
My final thought is ice cream, then boobies.

3280
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:53,260
Loki, I get my arcade hardware tomorrow, but it's no good right now

3281
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:56,260
because I don't have an arcade machine to play it on.

3282
03:00:56,260 --> 03:01:00,260
But I get to stare at it, and caress it, and...

3283
03:01:00,260 --> 03:01:02,260
And boobies?

3284
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:04,260
Boobies.

3285
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:08,260
Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our show tonight.

3286
03:01:08,260 --> 03:01:10,260
We really appreciate it, and...

3287
03:01:10,260 --> 03:01:12,260
Oh, TigerClaus reminded me.

3288
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:16,260
I forgot to mention the Starcraft 2 thing I was going to mention about

3289
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:19,260
the chick from Battlestar Galactica is voicing Kerrigan.

3290
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:20,260
Trisha Helfer.

3291
03:01:20,260 --> 03:01:22,260
Six.

3292
03:01:22,260 --> 03:01:24,260
Hot.

3293
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:27,260
Totally random, but just thought I'd mention it.

3294
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:31,260
Because Jamie would, like, know probably.

3295
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:34,260
I heard that the new, is it Caprica or whatever like that?

3296
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:37,260
That Patton Oswalt's going to have a recurring character on there.

3297
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,260
Ooh.

3298
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:41,260
That means I actually have an excuse to watch it.

3299
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:43,260
Alright.

3300
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:46,260
And so enjoy your Battlestar Galactica, kids, until next week,

3301
03:01:46,260 --> 03:01:48,260
because we'll be back next week to do it all over again.

3302
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:52,260
Hey, if you enjoyed the show, be sure to tell two friends about the show.

3303
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:55,260
Leave us a nice review on iTunes, you know,

3304
03:01:55,260 --> 03:01:57,260
or just tell people about the show.

3305
03:01:57,260 --> 03:02:00,260
Word of mouth is what sells the show and helps us spread around,

3306
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:05,260
because remember, we don't have a big magazine behind us or anything like that.

3307
03:02:05,260 --> 03:02:07,260
So that's going to do it.

3308
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:08,260
We'll see you next week.

3309
03:02:08,260 --> 03:02:12,260
We'll be back to do it all over again on another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

3310
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:13,260
Good night!

3311
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:16,260
