00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:27,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 23, 2009, a new pay-as-you-go business model is announced for a popular 360 game, one gaming device will soon allow you to read comic books, and was a recently closed studio working on the next Final Fantasy game?

2
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:36,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:43,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:51,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice because we let you call in, we let you chat with us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

5
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:52,978
[SPEAKER_09]: We let you tweet us too.

6
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:59,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to keep up with the times and the new technologies and it all happens live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.

7
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,480
[SPEAKER_09]: and our friends at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,501
[SPEAKER_09]: A big shout out to them for letting us steal their bandwidth on Sunday nights.

9
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,081
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

10
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,322
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be with you here over the next three hours.

12
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: With me as always, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

13
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:14,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Crunchy.

14
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:15,184
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

15
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Crunchy.

16
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:19,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell the listeners about what you are eating right now because I find it very interesting.

17
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanted cereal, but I really wanted peanut butter.

18
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:27,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was like, I've got some really tasty bread from Trader Joe's.

19
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:37,009
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I did is I took my sprouted wheat bread from Trader Joe's and put a bunch of creamy Jif and have put... Why not Skippy?

20
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Annette Funicello is crying somewhere.

21
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:39,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

22
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,592
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Foodio, live, Sunday nights.

24
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear we ought to have a spin-off.

25
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,628
[SPEAKER_08]: This is full of fiber and protein, okay?

26
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's low-glycemic, so the world can bite me.

27
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear we ought to have a spin-off show about, like, food or something.

28
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:20,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, it just seems like a natural progression for a show.

29
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:20,853
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

30
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, say hello, as always.

31
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:25,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to ignore him any longer, because he's an important part of our show.

32
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,237
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell would we do without him?

33
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Tech Master Loki!

34
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:29,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are all lies.

35
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:31,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, mostly.

36
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,199
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

37
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,080
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Loki?

38
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

39
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel somber, though.

40
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:35,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

41
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I was working out front planting plants.

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,693
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it being a homeowner now, a couple months in, having to do all this housework?

43
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:43,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiring.

44
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:53,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's funny, though, because there was this plant that was growing out front next to our neighbor's fence, and we weren't really sure if it was our neighbor's plant or ours, but technically it's on our side of the property, so it's ours.

45
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,053
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently you can pull it apart the way that it kind of grows.

46
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:00,256
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually pull it apart.

47
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:04,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So we took this one giant plant and made like 16 smaller plants out of it.

48
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:08,464
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're all going to grow and expand bigger and take over the entire yard.

49
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Animal Crossing for real.

50
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:12,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

51
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:12,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

52
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's what I did there.

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised you, Loki, with your handiwork.

54
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:25,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get one of those things I've seen on late night television which is those rolls of flowers that you see that you can get at Home Depot where you just unravel.

55
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a carpet or something.

56
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:33,871
[SPEAKER_09]: You throw it down and it's all seeds so you water it and then you just get the hometown buffet of flowers in your front yard.

57
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you can do that with just seeds.

58
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:42,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you don't need to spend money on... And I don't know if you've ever tried rolling anything down.

59
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't roll it straight.

60
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:45,776
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just be awful.

61
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:49,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, last night we got... We were actually doing stuff to the house.

62
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:55,500
[SPEAKER_10]: We bought a rug last night, which Kat decided to start tearing up because it's the only carpet in the house and now she can scratch it.

63
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we bought curtains for the front room to shield the outside world from our porn watching.

64
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,250
[SPEAKER_10]: That, and it's really sunny.

65
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,814
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we put those up and everything.

66
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:10,537
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I mean...

67
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,440
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need all the flowers up there.

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,581
[SPEAKER_09]: When are you inviting me over to see all these changes at the house?

69
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:16,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we're done, I don't know.

70
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

71
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Come over anytime you want.

72
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:23,706
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be better, though, once I get the cabinet in and stuff, but... You need a housewarming party.

73
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:24,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

74
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:25,287
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you need to do.

75
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,308
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's never clean.

76
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:27,269
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I understand.

77
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:32,192
[SPEAKER_09]: You've had a lot of busy stuff going on lately, but at some point, you should have a housewarming party.

78
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:36,514
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like... I don't know when the statute of limitations on that stuff is, because...

79
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,576
[SPEAKER_10]: We moved in, what, two months ago?

80
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:47,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know when you've gone beyond the point of homewarming parties.

81
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a point where it's like, okay, you forego.

82
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,539
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean you would give up housewarming presents and not have a housewarming party?

83
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:57,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I would not be foregoing housewarming presents.

84
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, I don't know.

85
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:01,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

86
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:21,299
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, let's introduce our chat room as well.

87
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,641
[SPEAKER_09]: As always, where would we be without the listeners?

88
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Let's give the chat room a name tonight.

89
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:27,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's call it Rufus.

90
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we calling the chat room... Chat room, your name is Rufus.

91
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:32,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Barnaby.

92
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we calling the chat room Rufus or Barnaby or Barnabas?

93
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:36,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

94
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:41,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, I am all about this Tim Burton Dark Shadows movie with Johnny Depp as Barnabas.

95
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:41,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

96
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, can I get here any faster?

97
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Penelope Penelope

98
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:08,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And then people are going to tune in at 8 o'clock.

99
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,940
[SPEAKER_09]: People that tune in late who weren't here when the show started on time, they're going to be like, who the fuck's Penelope?

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they should have been here, huh?

101
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,881
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just going to get strange.

102
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling we're just going to go.

103
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:20,682
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

104
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:21,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to take more Vicodin.

105
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:21,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

106
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

107
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:25,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to Penelope and read some of the comments that we have tonight.

108
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananogram says about Loki's house, Sky just wants to watch the porn.

109
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:33,131
[SPEAKER_09]: on the big screen TV, possibly.

110
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that impressive, really.

111
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

112
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,553
[SPEAKER_10]: There are weird things, though.

113
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:46,375
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time we had Jim and Annie and Christopher over, we actually watched the parody to Friends.

114
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:54,438
[SPEAKER_10]: When you watch those parody porns, there's nothing sexy about that at all.

115
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:00,640
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to make the characters look like the characters in the show, and they do a horrible job at it.

116
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:01,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

117
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

118
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's more weird.

119
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:10,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like watching a very slow-mo car wreck or something.

120
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:16,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you thought about just watching just a straight-up porn that doesn't try to be any type of funny thing?

121
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck finding one, okay?

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're all kind of funny and weird.

123
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:23,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I like old people.

124
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,097
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my favorite chatroom nicknames, by the way.

125
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:29,520
[SPEAKER_09]: In Penelope right now wants to know... Ew, I just said that that person's in Penelope.

126
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:33,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Wants to know, are there naked pics of Penelope?

127
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, you're... Never mind.

128
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:40,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to... I like that Alpha Cananogram referred to Penelope Pitstop because that's old school, yo.

129
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get that.

130
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:42,891
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

131
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:45,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from an old cartoon.

132
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it?

133
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:47,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

134
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:47,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

135
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:48,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to school people.

136
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:51,050
[SPEAKER_09]: If it wasn't on Nickelodeon, I probably never saw it.

137
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be from Wacky Races?

138
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

139
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:54,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Wacky Races.

140
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,892
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a character from Wacky Races.

141
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:59,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Any moment, somebody's going to yell it out in chat anyway, so we'll get there.

142
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:03,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Amaze Satsuma asks, We went from Rufus to a girl's name.

143
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Chad have a sex change?

144
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, DarkSakura thinks so.

145
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It was indeed Wacky Races.

146
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:07,519
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

147
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was just a guess because I wouldn't remember such a horrible cartoon.

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,701
[SPEAKER_10]: You watch a lot of cartoons.

149
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,201
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't watch horrible cartoons like that.

150
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:15,202
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, come on.

151
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:16,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Penelope Pitstop.

152
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,623
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a racing character.

153
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Her car was called the Compact Pussycat.

154
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a compact pussy.

155
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

156
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:23,725
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

157
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:27,806
[SPEAKER_09]: We have three people all just piping up, starting with X-Link, who beat everybody else to it.

158
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:28,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Wacky Racers.

159
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Wacky Races.

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Which goes back to video games!

161
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,744
[SPEAKER_09]: We have this odd delay, too.

162
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:49,594
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live, and it's not like we're on a delay because people are afraid we're going to say fuck or something, but just the nature of the encoding and the fact that it takes a minute to go to all-game server, then you download it because you're buffering everything.

163
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,556
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just, by nature, this 20-second delay.

164
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes the last question is in the chat.

165
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,359
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't see the answers for 20 seconds, so...

166
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,299
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

167
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:29,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I was actually playing some Blue Dragon and some Ragnarok Online, which I got back into, and stuff on Gaia, but, uh... Addict.

168
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:34,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not playing anything now.

169
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to.

170
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,394
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're playing MMOs.

171
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody on this show has to keep the Addict tradition going.

172
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:44,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to stop because I had the rest of that suture removed from my hand on Friday.

173
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha, you can't bitch slap me.

174
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a left hand, Robb.

175
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:51,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got two feet.

176
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:56,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And you are not protected.

177
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:02,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually reading up on Janet Waldo who did Penelope Pitstop's voice.

178
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:03,759
[SPEAKER_08]: She was Judy Jetson.

179
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:05,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Fascinating.

180
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

181
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming she's done if she's talking about the Jetsons.

182
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:13,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently not as exciting as Wacky Races.

183
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually tried to play a few different things this week.

184
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:17,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

185
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:34,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I went and actually played some indie games and of course people were recommending that I play I made a game with zombies in it and yeah, it was funny and it was actually pretty fun so I enjoyed that also

186
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:48,813
[SPEAKER_10]: For whatever reason, because now that they have the rankings in there, where people can actually rate different games and stuff, you can actually see what the top-rated indie games and stuff are.

187
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:53,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So I decided to play the top-rated indie game, which is Minor Dig Deep.

188
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know why, but I'm addicted to that game.

189
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:58,780
[SPEAKER_10]: It's...

190
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:00,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost pointless.

191
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:11,142
[SPEAKER_10]: The game, you basically, you're a miner, and you go into a hole, and you actually dig into the walls, almost like Dig Dug, but there's no, like, you know, dinosaurs right now.

192
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to point out, though, not the kind of 17-year-old miner, right?

193
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,384
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about a pickaxe.

194
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, like a pickaxe, you know, miner.

195
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:19,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, maybe under 17.

196
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Miner 2049er, if you're old school like me.

197
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,499
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

198
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:42,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And you do this forever.

199
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:47,458
[SPEAKER_09]: This seriously sounds like a game I used to play like 15 years ago on old school PC.

200
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,639
[SPEAKER_09]: The 256 color shareware.

201
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much.

202
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And you do this forever, and I don't know why, but I can't stop playing this game.

203
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:57,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, you know... I don't know.

204
00:11:57,522 --> 00:12:01,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have been playing like Earth Defense Force, which I did play a little bit of this week, but...

205
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I kept going back to play this game, and I don't know why.

206
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like it's crowned as the top-rated game right now, as rightfully deserved.

207
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's fun.

208
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:14,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, I don't really know what the point is, but I don't really care.

209
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:18,077
[SPEAKER_09]: As your Ed's in chat wants to know what game you're talking about one more time.

210
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Minor Dig Deep.

211
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's an indie game.

212
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,781
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a top-rated indie game, at least when you downloaded it.

213
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows, because those lists can change on a daily basis, right?

214
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

215
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:50,026
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because I think there was some concern that just like people spam Dig, some of these indie developers might try to spam Xbox to try and get their titles to the top.

216
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it seem like it's working?

217
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:56,352
[SPEAKER_10]: If they are, it's hard to notice because there's so many people voting on stuff that...

218
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I don't see how that can be.

219
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:04,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, it's not a matter of like you can place a vote for a title.

220
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:10,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can vote like a five, but like say later on something really pissed you off about it, you can change it to a zero or one or whatever.

221
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,715
[SPEAKER_10]: You can change it whenever you want.

222
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:16,578
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's basically just, you know, tallies whatever people are thinking of it at that time.

223
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:22,202
[SPEAKER_09]: When I went in there, because unfortunately, if you listened to last week's show, you know I'm Xbox-less right now.

224
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:33,529
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I was playing with that new patch last week, one of the first things I did is I went in there and I rated Snake 360 to support our buddy who was on the show a couple months ago when that game first rolled out.

225
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I went and I was like, oh, I'm going to rate this a 5 and see kind of how it takes place.

226
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:39,773
[SPEAKER_09]: But it didn't seem like my vote, because you can see the number of people that have voted.

227
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:40,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't seem like my vote

228
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,556
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

229
00:13:55,983 --> 00:14:00,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I did find it very interesting that the game rating worked very similar to the Netflix rating.

230
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:11,876
[SPEAKER_09]: How since you don't really have a mouse and pointer to click how many stars, you have to kind of cycle through all the way to five or back to one to rate it by hitting the A button so many times.

231
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:13,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know, it's pretty cool.

232
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:19,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Earth Defense Force earlier this week as well, and that's rated a solid 4 now.

233
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:22,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Which it rightly deserves, because it's awesome.

234
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It just broke 80 hours this week in the game, and I don't know why, because it's just really hard and frustrating.

235
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,061
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm actually...

236
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:58,435
[SPEAKER_10]: working my way through it some more i finally got uh one of the higher up weapons and i'm missing i'm still missing some of the other weapons though but in order to farm them the one level you have to play it only drops like one or two weapons a level and you know since it's random at what you know weapons it picks to me it could be one of the any 200 weapons that are in that game and i'm missing like two i mean you can see how it could take forever to get what you need but um

237
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm about 80% done with the game.

238
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting almost to the point where...

239
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:11,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to really get some good people to help out with it.

240
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:15,078
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have a friend who's actually playing that at work as well.

241
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And so he's been helping me on breaks and stuff like that when we're not playing Grand Theft Auto.

242
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, of course, I played Grand Theft Auto this week and didn't really change anything.

243
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:28,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I went over to my sister's house because she has a modded 360 as well.

244
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I got her that for her birthday.

245
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:33,606
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I've been giving her every now and then copies of...

246
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:38,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you really give the gift of piracy for someone's birthday?

247
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:40,829
[SPEAKER_10]: She's poor.

248
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Before that, she had a modded PS2 with games dumped to the hard drive.

249
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,612
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, I've been giving the gift of piracy to her because she can't afford actual games.

250
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:49,752
[SPEAKER_10]: She does rent, though.

251
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:52,593
[SPEAKER_10]: She rents legitimate games.

252
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:57,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I shouldn't be supporting such blatant piracy, but it's out there, I guess.

253
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:02,297
[SPEAKER_10]: To be fair, she does have a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto 4.

254
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:04,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So she does have it, legitimately.

255
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So the fact that I'm burning off a new copy of it that happens to be modified, it's still kind of in that gray area.

256
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,615
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not like she doesn't own a legit copy of it.

257
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, fair enough.

258
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:23,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I was showing her because she didn't actually try any of the weapons that I modified or anything because she doesn't have the phone yet.

259
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:27,227
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been too busy trying to punch people with the super punch.

260
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:41,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, for whatever reason, the nuke shotgun that I built in there, because normally I play Lost and Damned, and so some things don't work quite right how they're supposed to, but since she only has Grand Theft Auto 4...

261
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:46,329
[SPEAKER_10]: That nuke shotgun works like a nuke.

262
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,891
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter where I shot it, somehow the shockwave hit me and killed me every time.

263
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You really do need to YouTube some of this stuff.

264
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two hours of footage.

265
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to go through it.

266
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.

267
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking forward to seeing it.

268
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:02,016
[SPEAKER_09]: One more question I want to ask you.

269
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:06,237
[SPEAKER_09]: As I mentioned before, my Xbox 360 is broke right now so I can't really look at this myself.

270
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've bothered to check it out.

271
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a chatter knows.

272
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,140
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the top rated Xbox 360 game right now?

273
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:13,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

274
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:17,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that's something you can look up on Xbox.com.

275
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:18,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you see ratings on Xbox.com now?

276
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:22,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure maybe a chatter will look that up for us.

277
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:25,770
[SPEAKER_09]: If I try to go on Xbox.com while we're recording the show, it won't like that.

278
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It uses up a lot of memory.

279
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:30,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious.

280
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's like Mass Effect.

281
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think of the games that were high rated when I took a peek.

282
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:37,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything was so new at that point.

283
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Grand Theft Auto is pretty high up there.

284
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:39,335
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a 4.5.

285
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:42,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

286
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:50,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's anything that's a solid five, so it's going to be really hard to distinguish since, you know, it's sections of a star being shaded there.

287
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, is that a half, third?

288
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:53,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

289
00:17:54,967 --> 00:18:00,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo 3 says, sex with the elderly is their chat nickname.

290
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:02,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the game tonight?

291
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's going to name themselves something really foul that I have to read?

292
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:06,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

293
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:08,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

294
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:20,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that's just a lie.

295
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:25,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they just shouted out an Xbox 360 game because they knew I'd read it and just believe them.

296
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:27,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm a sucker.

297
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,420
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week.

298
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously I've been QQing about my broken Xbox 360.

299
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:38,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm calmed down a lot this week than I was last week because it was still fresh in my mind last week.

300
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:40,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little more mellow this week.

301
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:42,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have my plan of action for what I plan to do about it.

302
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I will not be buying a new Elite.

303
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:45,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you that much.

304
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:46,947
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one thing I did decide.

305
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:49,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll talk a little more about this later on because...

306
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:50,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

307
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play the new expansion.

308
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just playing old school Wipeout HD.

309
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, well, how old school is Wipeout HD?

310
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:21,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what I mean.

311
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:22,917
[SPEAKER_09]: The original version of it.

312
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:26,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, damn, I love me some F-Zero.

313
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:31,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And Wipeout HD really is kind of the closest thing we have to that on another console.

314
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:36,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really like that mode that's called, I think, Zone Mode when you're racing.

315
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes the track all this solid color...

316
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:41,930
[SPEAKER_09]: as you're racing.

317
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,533
[SPEAKER_09]: It has this very techno look to it, obviously, as Wipeout HD does.

318
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:49,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as you race, the track changes colors as you accumulate so many points.

319
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty cool.

320
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:53,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having fun with Wipeout HD.

321
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really played a lot of it online, but it has been...

322
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:01,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Satiating my thirst for gameplay this week with a lack of an Xbox 360.

323
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:04,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously the PlayStation 3 is a perfectly fine gaming system.

324
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some certain things on it I can't play on 360 that I'm kind of catching up on right now.

325
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So Wipeout HD is one of them.

326
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still looking for a cheap copy of Valkyria Chronicles.

327
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:20,698
[SPEAKER_09]: But from what I understand, because I remember we reported on the show a while back that Valkyria Chronicles dipped to 1999.

328
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:21,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it went back up.

329
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:45,811
[SPEAKER_09]: because it has been I don't know if the price dip made it more successful or it's a cult thing now or what the deal is but I know that's on my hit list of games I want to play until I get my 360 situation resolved and then of course whenever Final Fantasy 13 comes out I will be buying that on PS3 and I was watching Blu-rays too I finally caught up on a few of those I think you should hang out with me and play Dreamcast Dreamcast?

330
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,372
[SPEAKER_10]: On September 9th I will It'll be fun

331
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:54,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to mention that I also have a System 573 board coming my way tomorrow.

332
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Now for those that don't know what a System 573 board is, what is that?

333
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:58,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bomani hardware.

334
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:05,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually, well this one in particular is a Dance Maniacs second mix J-Append.

335
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:14,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And so literally if I were to hook it up to a monitor and build controls and stuff like that, I could play Dance Maniacs as an actual arcade game.

336
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:19,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can convert the machine into a DDR machine if I really wanted to.

337
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,170
[SPEAKER_10]: But it costs like an extra $100 to do that.

338
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:27,095
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have the actual cartridges and security stuff to do it if I wanted to.

339
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:29,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I will though.

340
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:30,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I can just run StepMe.

341
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:57,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading some comments from Penelope at chat.orangeloungeradio.com TigerClaw says, Zone was a mode first introduced in Wipeout Pure on the PSP I did not know that, I missed the PSP version SG100Matt says, the top indie rated game is I Made a Game with Zombies with 4.5 stars and 5,081 votes Yeah, it's been getting, well that was like number 3 It's been getting bigger because, you know, everyone loves it Everyone loves Zombies It's a dollar

342
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good dollar spent.

343
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:01,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely recommend you try it.

344
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:08,095
[SPEAKER_10]: People are calling it this year's Still Alive, basically.

345
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:14,797
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a really weird, catchy song about the game that's horribly sung, but it just talks about the game.

346
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it seem like this whole rebranding of the... I don't even remember what it was called before.

347
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:23,643
[SPEAKER_09]: To indie games.

348
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:24,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell was it called?

349
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:25,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Community games.

350
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:25,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

351
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:29,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the rebranding of community games to indie games has been successful?

352
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:32,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it sure sounds like more people are following what's going on now.

353
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:38,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, though, what's making it better is that they've dropped the minimum price.

354
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:41,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Because before, the minimum price used to be 200 Microsoft points, which is $250 now.

355
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,511
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:03,811
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I mean, it's a lot easier just to buy stuff for 80 points.

357
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:06,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it goes really fast.

358
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:08,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It is unfortunate that the games don't have achievements.

359
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:09,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

360
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:13,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand why, because obviously someone would make that game, you know, press A, get 200 gamerscore.

361
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:23,187
[SPEAKER_09]: But even if they would do achievements with a zero gamerscore, or just, you know, because there are plenty of achievements out there in the retail games that are just zero gamerscore.

362
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just unlocking it.

363
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe like a separate...

364
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:34,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell they want to call it, but something maybe separate.

365
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:37,101
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be kind of cool, because no one would let me compete against friends.

366
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:40,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Because on those games, you can't really do the leaderboards and stuff.

367
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:45,024
[SPEAKER_10]: It would never do points, because someone could just go, okay, you started the game, 1,000 points.

368
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:45,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.

369
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:46,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that.

370
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:47,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

371
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: But just something that kind of encourages a little bit of competition.

372
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

373
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of brainstorming here.

374
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Ways they could make it even bigger.

375
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they will later, but just not right now.

376
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,268
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

377
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

378
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,613
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as other games I've been playing this week, not really a whole lot.

379
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing Guild Wars for a little bit.

380
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:12,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot, but it's one of those MMOs I have that I'm not really paying for because I already bought the game.

381
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:19,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And Guild Wars' model is that once you buy the game, you can play online for free pretty much forever.

382
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of cool that you can just go back and revisit whenever you want.

383
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:22,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

384
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:26,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Guild Wars, and I don't think it's in tonight's show role, I also watched that trailer for Guild Wars 2.

385
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks pretty sweet, I gotta say.

386
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,221
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely keeping an eye on Guild Wars.

387
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,875
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get into some more gaming news tonight.

388
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:42,038
[SPEAKER_09]: After some housekeeping, we do, of course, always want to plug some of the ways you can follow us and join the community that we sometimes call the OL Army.

389
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to join our Twitter, www.twitter.com.

390
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you can join us on Facebook.

391
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:50,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Just search for the OL Army.

392
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:52,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on LiveJournal as well and Orange Lounge.

393
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:53,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow us.

394
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:54,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Get involved with the community.

395
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:57,985
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to read your comments and so forth on every show all the time.

396
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:07,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some other comments from chat.

397
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:11,223
[SPEAKER_09]: INGN0 asks, No Wolfenstein?

398
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:12,544
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not this week.

399
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:17,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really the type of game that I've been eagerly anticipating.

400
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:21,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I played the old Wolfenstein 3D and that was about it for me.

401
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:21,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

402
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:22,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Wolfenstein?

403
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Any interest, Loki?

404
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

405
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

406
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll think about it.

407
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:27,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But I...

408
00:25:50,862 --> 00:26:08,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't finished, you know, uh, Bionic Commando, um, and a half a dozen, more than half a dozen, a few dozen games that I've bought already, so, you know, I'm just kind of taking a break from buying full price, you know, Xbox Live Arcade games.

409
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:19,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, don't get me wrong, if they ever came out with a Bionic Commando sequel that would be on Xbox Live Arcade done the same fashion as, say, you know, Rearmed, then yes, I would probably buy that in a heartbeat, but...

410
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:20,353
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

411
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:43,167
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

412
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:08,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

413
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadow Complex, or whatever the game is that we're talking about.

414
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:12,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, don't hear me wrong.

415
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:13,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bashing Shadow Complex.

416
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:18,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, if my Xbox 360 hadn't have fried last week, I would have gladly checked it out this week.

417
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,001
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, shit happens.

418
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:24,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so Loki, get us started with some gaming news tonight.

419
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:30,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Microsoft had a little bit of a keynote during Gamescom this week.

420
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,616
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they didn't really discuss a whole lot.

421
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, the only thing they discussed was...

422
00:27:37,560 --> 00:28:04,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, I'm totally shocked that they announced a new Fable game, but Fable 3 will be coming out next year, and they didn't really go into great detail what exactly you're going to be doing, but apparently you will be, I guess, assuming that they're going to be playing as the son or daughter of your Fable 2 hero, and you're going to be starting a revolution to become the new ruler of Albion, and of course, based on, you know,

423
00:28:05,307 --> 00:28:11,957
[SPEAKER_10]: What you do as a ruler can have obviously positive or negative effects on the world around you.

424
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like Fable 2.

425
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:18,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, but if it's just like Fable 2, then it's going to be all hype.

426
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,440
[SPEAKER_10]: No content.

427
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not no content, but not as much content as promised.

428
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:31,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of liked Fable 2, but... It was alright, but it just wasn't like, oh my god, the best game ever, as he was pitching it.

429
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:38,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter Molyneux kind of has a reputation for really, really hyping things beyond what they really end up being.

430
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence, you know, why...

431
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:44,321
[SPEAKER_09]: We all approach this project Milo with a hint of skepticism, at least I do.

432
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did like Fable 2 quite a bit, actually.

433
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of last year.

434
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:52,927
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my question about Fable 3.

435
00:28:53,567 --> 00:29:00,352
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to be playing the child of a character in Fable 2, does that mean all these decisions you made in Fable 2 ultimately are going to impact in Fable 3?

436
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:03,694
[SPEAKER_09]: That didn't really happen in Fable 2 with Fable 1.

437
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not really sure if that's the case.

438
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:06,836
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just saying that...

439
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:19,401
[SPEAKER_10]: The storylines, basically, that your hero is going to be... It's their children, since the game starts off in Fable 2, where you pick a sex, and that's basically it.

440
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:25,264
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess they said the game's going to take place 50 years after the first one, and...

441
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:27,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

442
00:29:48,898 --> 00:30:16,572
[SPEAKER_10]: um which will be used to influence the world basically a judgment system was people will come to you and say okay this uh this poor child you know stole bread from this person do you want to let them go or kill them you know and you can just you know obviously pick the right or wrong whatever you you know feel is right or wrong but you can't come up with creative punishments you can't say you know make them bake bread for the entire town or anything like that yeah it's like you can um you know

443
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:23,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Judge her immediately, like the person that stole food, or you can investigate the situation.

444
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can set her on fire.

445
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I vote for fire.

446
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,120
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

447
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:01,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the AI wasn't that... I don't know.

448
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,800
[SPEAKER_07]: That means if you're evil, you could grab them and throw them into the burning building.

449
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:08,562
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's saying you can also shake someone's hand or refuse to.

450
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:12,044
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also embrace somebody, snog them.

451
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:14,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

452
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:15,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Baby shake?

453
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:17,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you can throw them off cliffs.

454
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even better, jump off a cliff while holding on to them and then drag them with you.

455
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:27,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Throw your dog at them.

456
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,740
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of funny.

457
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

458
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,442
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically the game.

459
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:39,784
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, becoming the king and... It will be the best game ever, I'm sure.

460
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:42,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And somehow they'll probably work in Milo in there or some crap.

461
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:43,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

462
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Fable 3, My Life as a King.

463
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:51,228
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that is, you know, basically Fable 3.

464
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:52,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's...

465
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:55,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it's neat.

466
00:31:55,707 --> 00:32:02,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the other thing that they talked about, because goddamn if Fable 3 wasn't enough, they talked about Fable 2 Episodic.

467
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And people were thinking, oh my god, there's more content coming.

468
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:07,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Wrong.

469
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:12,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Fable 2 Episodic is a pay-to-play version of Fable 2.

470
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:16,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, Fable 2 had different chapter points, I guess, in it.

471
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:39,890
[SPEAKER_10]: and so the first chapter is free and then of course once you're done with that you can choose to buy the next chapter or buy the rest of the game and I guess there's five episodes in total and it's supposed to be released on September 29th and they didn't say how expensive the game will be I'm guessing around the same price as Fable 2

472
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:41,816
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a test.

473
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:42,076
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a test.

474
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:01,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually a little more welcoming of this idea than you might think.

475
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:42,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a good idea because Fable 2 didn't have a demo and this would be a good way to check out a game say for example it's more of an extended demo because you get to play through the first part of the game for free and then if you like it then you can go ahead and purchase it later or if you're just on the fence about it you can buy the next chapter and see if you still like it or something like that so it's not just dumping all the money

476
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:50,087
[SPEAKER_08]: But they are getting more money, though, out of you by charging in an episodic manner as opposed to buying the whole game.

477
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:54,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, granted, we don't know how many points each part is going to cost yet.

478
00:33:54,168 --> 00:34:03,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume so because, I mean, that's typically when you buy, for example, an individual size of something or when you buy the six pack, you know.

479
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,720
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fair comparison.

480
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of thinking of it as a pizza.

481
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:09,382
[SPEAKER_09]: When you buy Fable 2, you get the pizza, but now you can get a slice of pizza.

482
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:10,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizza sounds good.

483
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Pizza does sound very good, actually.

484
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get pizza.

485
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:14,684
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to during break.

486
00:34:15,024 --> 00:34:16,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute, you didn't bring food tonight, Loki.

487
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:18,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I went sushi.

488
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:25,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a TNT roll, which is... And it all comes back to food.

489
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Not my fault.

490
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was like... Maguro...

491
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:40,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say there's Spicy Yahi and Yellowfin and some other stuff in there.

492
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,533
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was good and hot.

493
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:43,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And Spicy Mayonnaise.

494
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from chat, because of course this seems to be lighting up our chat room a little bit.

495
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Bobby's on the same page we are.

496
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:54,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf in chat says, I like the episodic model because that way if I don't continue the game, I'm not paying for the whole game.

497
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:56,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only paying for the part of the game that I finished.

498
00:34:56,578 --> 00:35:00,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfolded Raptor follows up with, but that's like watching 15 minutes of a movie then paying for another 15 minutes.

499
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,907
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf says, well, you know, if I want to walk out of the movie after the first 15 minutes, I didn't pay for the entire two-hour movie.

500
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:16,978
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's interesting is that you do see actually a lot of movie companies putting out like the first eight minutes of a movie on the internet for you to watch.

501
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:20,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon does that with TV episodes that you can download.

502
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:21,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And books!

503
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:23,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll give you samples of the books.

504
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:35,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a good idea, but I'm thinking that they should offer an incentive that if you decide after the first episode that you want to buy the whole game, that they give you an option to pay the difference.

505
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the thing.

506
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,371
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to do that, I think.

507
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:40,451
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just basically...

508
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:42,607
[SPEAKER_10]: The first episode is free.

509
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:52,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So after the first episode, after each chapter, you have the option to purchase the rest of the game or just purchase the next chapter.

510
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:55,624
[SPEAKER_09]: This really could be.

511
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:59,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We could be looking at the future of how we're going to pay for a lot of our games.

512
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if this is successful.

513
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how successful it will be because it's not a new game.

514
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:08,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of people that were interested in this game already got it.

515
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:15,478
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's certainly by tempting folks with a free chapter, a way to entice folks to check it out maybe and get a few more extra sales.

516
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:18,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see how that's going to be bad news for Microsoft or Lionhead.

517
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the pot of the video game world.

518
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:20,782
But...

519
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one hit, man.

520
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:25,446
[SPEAKER_09]: But the interesting thing is, I mean, think about it.

521
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:38,578
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP Go, despite the crap we've given it on this show for not being that much better than the PSP, and especially price-wise, is going to be completely free of media.

522
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:40,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be digital downloads only.

523
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:48,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo DS, or the DSi I should say specifically is a large part is going to be digital download only.

524
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:56,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the biggest components and biggest games you see now on 360, PlayStation Network, Nintendo WiiWare are all download games.

525
00:36:57,712 --> 00:37:10,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the major players Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft in the next console and I think if anybody it's going to be Sony says

526
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,740
[SPEAKER_09]: No media, no discs, no Blu-ray, or this will play Blu-rays, but the games do not come out on Blu-rays.

527
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be 100% digital distribution.

528
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will fail.

529
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:22,828
[SPEAKER_09]: You think?

530
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:23,589
[SPEAKER_10]: It will fail.

531
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,051
[SPEAKER_09]: What if it's like this, though?

532
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:26,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It will still fail.

533
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know why it's going to fail?

534
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,655
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because people like owning stuff, and people like the option.

535
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem with adding other ways you can purchase content.

536
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:50,446
[SPEAKER_10]: If you decide that, you know what, I don't feel like buying the game, I can buy either the episode, I can buy the full digital download, which is available on their service as well, or I can go purchase the retail game out there and do that.

537
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:55,889
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm not given that option, then that's kind of crappy.

538
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:01,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what happens later on with, say, your console dies.

539
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:10,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of times with the PlayStation 3 and stuff, I'm sure you can go re-download all that stuff later because it's just tied to your account.

540
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:13,413
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, though, it's not...

541
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:15,536
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't loan out your games.

542
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,056
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't sell used.

543
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:20,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's really... There's a lot more factors in there.

544
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:23,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And people like the collector crap.

545
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, hello, Modern Warfare 2 with some fucking night vision goggles.

546
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:30,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't digitally download night vision goggles.

547
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:31,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at my vault.

548
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:37,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm apples to oranges here a little bit, but then tell me why iTunes and iPods are so successful.

549
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:43,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Because people that purchase Apple products are suckers for that kind of crap.

550
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,262
[SPEAKER_10]: But you cannot deny iTunes is successful.

551
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:50,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously, what phone out there, okay, what phone...

552
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,246
[SPEAKER_10]: has cartridges or disks that plug into it.

553
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:54,747
[SPEAKER_10]: No phone does.

554
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:58,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So that kind of content is expected on there.

555
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why it's not a big deal.

556
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:11,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if Apple were to come out with, say, a console and decides that, okay, it's only going to be through their app store, then people might not be so apt to it.

557
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:17,303
[SPEAKER_10]: They may go, eh, you know what, I'm just going to stick with a console that I can actually purchase physical stuff for.

558
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:18,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

559
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of negativity in the chat room on this idea.

560
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:22,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Penelope.

561
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:23,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

562
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:31,027
[SPEAKER_09]: In Penelope, there's a lot of – and not necessarily the Fable 2 thing I'm talking about, the what if the next generation of gaming was all digital.

563
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:31,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

564
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:35,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We have – Actdeft says it will fail.

565
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:38,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Codeman says, I hate downloading games.

566
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: My internet connection is so slow.

567
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, I like having a disc to hold or cart.

568
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:51,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like this comment from Sex with the Elderly says, I can't wait till people start stealing PSPs and all their content with it.

569
00:39:51,961 --> 00:39:53,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Then having no media will suck ass.

570
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:57,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry.

571
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:01,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

572
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:02,409
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get into this later.

573
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:05,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the PSP goes sucks because we have to bring it up on every show.

574
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:06,592
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um,

575
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:09,013
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really dumb.

576
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:10,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

577
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:32,183
[SPEAKER_09]: To be fair, I'm only picking on Sony because if the PSP Go is any indication, this is what they're thinking.

578
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:34,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't think it's a good idea anyways with Microsoft either.

579
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably wouldn't buy a console from Microsoft if it didn't have physical media.

580
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:46,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that they're going to be more apt to having physical media because there's a lot more exposure out there, whereas it's just their service.

581
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,857
[SPEAKER_10]: What if someone doesn't have broadband or internet?

582
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

583
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're going to still lose some sales, and that's not a smart thing.

584
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:24,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, what you should do is open up as many different avenues for people to purchase content.

585
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this, with Fable 2, I think is a good idea because now you have three different options.

586
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,181
[SPEAKER_10]: You can purchase the full game, you can purchase it by episode, or you can purchase the retail copy.

587
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, hell, you can purchase the used retail copy out there.

588
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:40,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there's a lot of options for you, and options are never a bad thing.

589
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Informer

590
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:14,477
[SPEAKER_09]: ran a report, and in the latest issue of Game Informer, they actually did a survey where they surveyed 5,000 console owners, and according to these 5,000 console owners, the Xbox 360's current failure rate because of the E74 error, 54.2%.

591
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:22,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, to be fair, they also surveyed for the PlayStation 3's and their yellow light issues, 10.3% on those, and the Wii's, 6.8%.

592
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,879
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

593
00:42:43,331 --> 00:43:00,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I can admit that I think those that go so far as to subscribe to a magazine or so forth probably use their Xbox 360s on a pretty regular basis, maybe a little bit heavier than some people who don't subscribe to magazines do.

594
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think just by nature, the more you use your console, the more you're going to open it up to failure.

595
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:07,446
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just true of any piece of hardware.

596
00:43:07,486 --> 00:43:09,667
[SPEAKER_09]: The more you use it, the more it's likely to fail someday.

597
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:10,208
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.

598
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:15,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's true in general statement, but it shouldn't be failing at the rates that they're talking about.

599
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:16,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get to that.

600
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:20,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It's inevitable that the more you use something, the more likely it is to break.

601
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:22,556
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a fact.

602
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But do I think this number is that far off?

603
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:27,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

604
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the real number is probably somewhere around a third.

605
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:33,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still look at this and go...

606
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:44,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Most companies that would have that type of failure rate on some type of thing they put out, like a television, a CD player, a car, would recall it.

607
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:46,740
[SPEAKER_09]: They would be forced to recall it.

608
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,400
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't.

609
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be bad PR.

610
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:51,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is good PR?

611
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:57,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's good PR for them because notice, even though it may have a 54% failure rate...

612
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:05,338
[SPEAKER_10]: People, they're still the second largest console share in the United States.

613
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,504
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't care, because people will go out and buy a new console once their console breaks, if it's out of warranty.

614
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,125
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll go buy a new one, because you know why?

615
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:16,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the games are good.

616
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,568
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a good library of games, and people don't give a crap.

617
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:23,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, see, it goes back to the system is only good as the games that are on it.

618
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:30,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, that's probably the point as to because I know there's been people that have been asking, well, if you're so mad about it, why are you going to buy another one?

619
00:44:31,011 --> 00:44:43,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of like, well, dude, because I've invested all this money in the games, not just the physical games and the online games, that selling them back, I'm sorry, that's a waste of my money.

620
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:43,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

621
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:45,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think though that the failure rate is probably around that 54%.

622
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:45,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

623
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:46,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

624
00:45:10,723 --> 00:45:15,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had, what, I have had maybe a total of eight consoles, and I think five of them died at one point.

625
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:16,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's interesting.

626
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has their own ideas, and everybody has their own interpretations of these results.

627
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:23,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think we can all agree, it ain't 54.2%.

628
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:26,799
[SPEAKER_09]: That's obviously a skewed statistic.

629
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Which way it's skewed, that's open to interpretation.

630
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:50,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft responded to it this week by the way and here was their response and this was in a statement to TG Daily Microsoft stands behind the Xbox 360 as a superior entertainment console with one of the best warranties in the industry

631
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:51,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

632
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Translation?

633
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,767
[SPEAKER_10]: and yes, that people do enjoy their console.

634
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:47,471
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they failed to address that their first line of systems that came out in the first few revisions sucks so bad that more than half of them have failed.

635
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:53,674
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, I would be surprised if not all of them failing at some point.

636
00:46:54,294 --> 00:47:01,117
[SPEAKER_10]: The newer systems though, the newer revisions, the newer motherboards and stuff that they're putting out, less likely to fail, yes.

637
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:02,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And probably, you know,

638
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:07,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Up to par with, I'd say, the other consoles, you know, around that 10% range.

639
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:17,881
[SPEAKER_10]: But, a lot of people did buy it at launch, or at least relatively close to launch, and all their consoles are going to fail at some point or another, and it's just a matter of time.

640
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:18,921
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a ticking time bomb.

641
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:20,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the problem.

642
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:31,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you're continually making them better, but you fucked up in the beginning, and that's a big problem, and you needed to recall all of them and get them all back and give them the new revisions.

643
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:33,285
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the proper thing to do.

644
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:41,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to quite say that much, but... You know, I... I don't know.

645
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:43,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a tricky issue.

646
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:47,939
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in the age of the internet, in gaming, we haven't really seen something like this before.

647
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:49,220
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sorry.

648
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,123
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't tell me that the PS3 and the Wii failure rates are anything close to this.

649
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:56,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Close to this.

650
00:47:56,504 --> 00:47:58,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they rushed to get it to market.

651
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:01,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, it benefited them in the fact that their install base is a lot bigger.

652
00:48:02,307 --> 00:48:05,349
[SPEAKER_10]: However, their hardware is kind of shoddy.

653
00:48:06,946 --> 00:48:17,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I do find it fascinating they dance around the statistic in their response they never deny it notice that in the response they don't deny it at all I think they expected it

654
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:48,375
[SPEAKER_09]: but that being but here's the thing what they say at the end of their statement as much as that's blowing smoke up my ass it's true I mean with the fact that they do have a choke hold on a lot of the big games out there on the market right now that can only be played on Xbox 360 and that they do have they are doing a lot of things right in that regard outside of just the system itself is kind of hard to deny yeah well here's my thing and that's why you know I'm essentially I guess some of you might say taking it a little bit

655
00:48:49,130 --> 00:49:08,903
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I think if you're a consumer out there, and you're now worried about, you haven't bought a 360 yet, and you're worried that, okay, if I buy a 360 it's going to fail, I think that worry right now, it shouldn't be a worry, because now the systems have gotten to the point, though, where they aren't failing like they were doing before.

656
00:49:09,104 --> 00:49:12,986
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it is safe to buy it now, because of all the hard revisions they've done.

657
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:17,890
[SPEAKER_10]: What they really should have done is all those revisions before the console was released, but, you know, hey...

658
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,837
[SPEAKER_10]: They made a huge mistake, and now they're in the process of trying to pick up the pieces and fixing the problem.

659
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:25,839
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, will people forget about this?

660
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Will people remember this for the next console launch?

661
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:35,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you better damn believe it, and there will be a lot of people probably waiting and seeing if there's going to be issues with their next console.

662
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,541
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, if you're curious what I decided to do with my Xbox 360, I am... He's going to set it on fire and throw it off a cliff.

663
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:44,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I might.

664
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I decided I'm going to... Although that would be kind of fun, actually.

665
00:49:49,023 --> 00:49:51,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to give it a try.

666
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:53,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to let Loki try to fix it.

667
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he knows how to fix them, apparently.

668
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:56,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to let him try.

669
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:58,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a 50% success rate.

670
00:49:58,905 --> 00:50:00,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll take my chance.

671
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:01,626
[SPEAKER_09]: This way, if...

672
00:50:03,317 --> 00:50:06,000
[SPEAKER_09]: This way I don't have to ship it off and pay those costs or anything.

673
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki will do it for free.

674
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:08,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

675
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:09,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pay for parts or whatever.

676
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:14,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if it doesn't work, then I know Bobby has a friend that will buy for parts.

677
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will send it to the junkyard to be scrapped at the pick and pull, basically, of Xbox 360s.

678
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:20,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do that.

679
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:25,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless they don't want it because Loki ruins it, then I will set it on fire and throw it off.

680
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:26,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try not to ruin it too much.

681
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:32,108
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, try it, please, because I do want to send it off to the virtual pick and pull if that happens.

682
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:40,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will, if I have to, because Loki can't fix it, not that I don't have faith in Loki, but if Loki can't fix it, then I am not going to buy an Xbox 360 Elite.

683
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to wait for the price drop because I decided that was a stupid idea.

684
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:47,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I, in turn, give Microsoft more money for their high-end console

685
00:50:48,522 --> 00:50:49,963
[SPEAKER_09]: because the first one failed.

686
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:50,963
[SPEAKER_09]: That was dumb.

687
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:52,704
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an e-jerk reaction of mine.

688
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:53,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I take it back.

689
00:50:54,265 --> 00:51:00,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I would instead buy the lowest, cheapest end Xbox 360 I can buy that's not used.

690
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:05,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if I go for the $199 Xbox arcade, I don't need a hard drive.

691
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:05,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one.

692
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:08,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need the fancy black color or whatever.

693
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:10,714
[SPEAKER_09]: The HDMI is on the arcades now.

694
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:11,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine.

695
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:15,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at least I'll have HDMI moving forward.

696
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:16,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my plan.

697
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:21,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby is saying that his friend will want it even ruined.

698
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:21,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

699
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:23,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Loki, have fun.

700
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,507
[SPEAKER_09]: If you fix it, great.

701
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:26,108
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't, off to the pick and pull.

702
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:28,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping that we're on the positive end of my 50%.

703
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,812
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

704
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,474
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll update your win-loss ratio here on our Twitter.

705
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:38,697
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that did work, that was successful, still works today.

706
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:39,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It still works.

707
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:40,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

708
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:42,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep waiting for it to fail again.

709
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I will donate my 360 to science.

710
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:46,202
[SPEAKER_09]: That is what I'm doing.

711
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:48,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

712
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, question.

713
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,673
[SPEAKER_07]: When you did your repairs, was your film...

714
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:57,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Was your failure rate closer to the beginning or closer to the end?

715
00:51:57,388 --> 00:51:58,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the end.

716
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:00,710
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one worked flawlessly.

717
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Second one, not so much.

718
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:05,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's okay, because you know what?

719
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:09,775
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still be in business, because your failure rate is close to Microsoft's failure rate, and they're still kicking.

720
00:52:09,815 --> 00:52:10,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what?

721
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:11,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Off to Loki's repair shop.

722
00:52:11,876 --> 00:52:14,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And I blame their console for my failure anyways.

723
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:16,558
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Luke, let's move on.

724
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to get more...

725
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:28,083
[SPEAKER_09]: angsty comments if I continue on this whole tirade with the 360 and so forth it is a tricky line here I do feel a sense of

726
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, shit, fuck.

727
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,384
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, with the whole Xbox 360 red ringing.

728
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:35,887
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, I do understand shit happens.

729
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:39,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just makes me... I don't know if angry is the right word.

730
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:39,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me irritated.

731
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:41,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you try doing it without the... Shut up.

732
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:49,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me irritated that so many people are having the same problem and yet Microsoft just says, well, but we're still cool.

733
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:49,942
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still the best.

734
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you try it without the hard drive?

735
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:52,573
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

736
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:52,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't.

737
00:52:53,513 --> 00:52:58,875
[SPEAKER_09]: This week I decided I've been having, in my personal life, I've been having the most shitty week you could possibly imagine.

738
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:00,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm faking it really well on the show tonight.

739
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:06,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, is that I just decided I'm not going to make my week worse by even trying that 360 this week.

740
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:07,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, no problem.

741
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:07,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take care of it.

742
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:08,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise.

743
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:11,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about other stuff, huh?

744
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:11,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

745
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,773
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some World of Warcraft stuff?

746
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:15,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

747
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,317
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

748
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:53,856
[SPEAKER_08]: They've raised the cap to 85 for levels, but now they're going back and revamping old zones and changing them completely.

749
00:53:54,616 --> 00:54:06,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the big cataclysm thing, some areas are destroyed, and then some of the places like Desolace and the Barrens are becoming green.

750
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,363
[SPEAKER_08]: They're redesigning cities so that you can fly.

751
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:37,322
[SPEAKER_08]: and, um, actually in Undercity too, um, they are actually, uh, having more interaction with the terrain, you can have flooding happen, so, also seven new zones, um, uh, like, um, Oldham, Mount, I guess that's Hyjal, and the Sunken City, which is an undersea zone, so you get underwater mounts and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,

752
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:41,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Twilight Highlands, and Deep Home.

753
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:43,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds very dwarfy in name.

754
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the rumors we heard about last week were essentially true.

755
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:48,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

756
00:54:49,148 --> 00:54:52,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and new profession, archaeology.

757
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you can be Indiana Jones, but a goblin.

758
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:55,946
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

759
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,807
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually would be enough to have me try it out.

760
00:54:57,987 --> 00:54:59,588
[SPEAKER_08]: The Archaeology edition.

761
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:04,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I'd really like to see how something like that would enhance your character.

762
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while since I've played, but honestly, though, I'm sticking with RO.

763
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:12,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if this is enough to get me back to WoW.

764
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I have to see it when the expansion comes out.

765
00:55:14,197 --> 00:55:14,997
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, never say never.

766
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:18,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I would never go back to Final Fantasy XI, and I did for a month, so whatever.

767
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I do think it's interesting because they've been talking about revamping old Azeroth for a long time.

768
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:27,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they're going to do it and make you pay for it.

769
00:55:29,398 --> 00:55:30,279
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

770
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is some other stuff.

771
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:05,974
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit more as far as the racial abilities for the new races.

772
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:11,037
[SPEAKER_08]: For Worgen, you can switch between human and Worgen form instantaneously at will.

773
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:16,919
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Dark Flight, which increases movement speed by 70% for 10 seconds with a 3-minute cooldown.

774
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Viciousness, you have Flayer, and then Goblins are basically like the Ferengi of the Horde.

775
00:56:25,123 --> 00:56:26,123
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the businessmen.

776
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:26,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes sense.

777
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,604
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good comparison.

778
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can... There's actually a... You kind of look like Quark, too.

779
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,753
[SPEAKER_08]: A skill called... I wonder if you can give them Umox.

780
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,554
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're... Anyway.

781
00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:40,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they can make me a Warp Core Breach.

782
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:41,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have the lobes for business?

783
00:56:42,716 --> 00:56:43,496
[SPEAKER_08]: God, so nerdy.

784
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:47,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But Best Deals Anywhere is one of their skills.

785
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:51,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Better Living Through Chemistry, which increases alchemy skill by 15 points.

786
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like Time is Money.

787
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So it increases attack and casting speed by 1%.

788
00:56:59,264 --> 00:57:06,170
[SPEAKER_08]: The Archaeology skill gives you the ability to excavate hidden items in ruins.

789
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:13,876
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do research notes that let you unlock new abilities for the Path of the Titans character progression.

790
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So... Go flip that whip.

791
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:18,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

792
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:22,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, personally, as a WoW player, I think goblins are annoying.

793
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:23,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I would never want to play as one.

794
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I was disappointed to hear that.

795
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:35,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for other stuff going on with that, with the new dungeons, they actually have the level lists up for the five-man dungeons.

796
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,100
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't want to say five-man.

797
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say five-character dungeons.

798
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:41,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That works for me.

799
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:43,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a party of five.

800
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:44,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Or sentai ones.

801
00:57:44,605 --> 00:57:51,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Grim Battle is $85 Skywall is $80-$82 Abyssal Maw is $80-$83 Deep Home is $80-$83 Uldum is $83-$84 and an $85

802
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:13,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackrock Caverns for level 85, and then they do five-person versions of two of the older dungeons.

803
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:19,798
[SPEAKER_08]: The Deadmines has a level 85 version, and Shadowfang Keep.

804
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:26,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those that don't know, those are some beloved old-school instances from original WoW.

805
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:34,534
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for four new raids, two of them have been revealed.

806
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:44,142
[SPEAKER_08]: One is the Firelands and one of them is called Nefarian's Throne Room, which features Blackwing Lairs and Boss Nefarian.

807
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:45,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence the name!

808
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:46,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Har har!

809
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:57,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think it's interesting, this whole heroic Deadmines thing, because if you play original Deadmines at the level you're supposed to be playing Deadmines at, it takes forever.

810
00:58:58,229 --> 00:59:05,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be interesting to see if they scale it back so Deadmines does not take as long to get through, or if it's still going to be like an epic four-hour run.

811
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:17,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're also putting in, with the 3.3 patch, there's a panel that's cross-server LFG for five-man dungeons, so you can get more people together to do.

812
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,622
[SPEAKER_08]: That's needed, actually.

813
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:23,904
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also new race combinations available now.

814
00:59:23,944 --> 00:59:35,591
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Human Hunter, Orc Mage, Night Elf Mage, Blood Elf Warrior, Dwarf Shaman, Dwarf Mage, Undead Hunter, Tarn Paladin, Tarn Priest, Gnome Priest, and Troll Druid.

815
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:38,692
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a stat overhaul.

816
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:41,993
[SPEAKER_08]: The stats are being simplified.

817
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:49,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have your spell power, MP5, armor penetration, all that's gone.

818
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:53,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really just a whole bunch of them.

819
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,897
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually all up on the WoW page.

820
00:59:55,817 --> 01:00:02,439
[SPEAKER_08]: For other class changes, just look on the panel on your thing.

821
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:02,959
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all there.

822
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Flying mounts are available.

823
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:08,584
[SPEAKER_08]: and Azeroth.

824
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:11,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can fly around all you want to.

825
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:13,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank heavens.

826
01:00:14,346 --> 01:00:15,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You have your guild progression.

827
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:18,088
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually have a numerical method now.

828
01:00:18,108 --> 01:00:25,591
[SPEAKER_08]: You have raided battlegrounds, new PvP changes, a bunch of other crap.

829
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:28,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And a bunch of other stuff that I personally don't care about.

830
01:00:30,011 --> 01:00:33,814
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty good expansion, a good swift kick in the pants to the game.

831
01:00:34,015 --> 01:00:35,496
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's one thing Blizzard likes to do.

832
01:00:35,556 --> 01:00:37,077
[SPEAKER_09]: They really like to change that game up.

833
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:39,759
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that game is nothing like it used to be.

834
01:00:39,779 --> 01:00:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

835
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:52,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, see, I think that that's, honestly, the whole point that I see with that is this is how, you know, going through their head, well, people get tired of the same old, same old, same old, same old.

836
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,791
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people are going to leave when they get bored with it.

837
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:58,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not give them no excuse to get bored?

838
01:00:58,372 --> 01:00:59,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not make something new?

839
01:01:00,213 --> 01:01:08,037
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the thing that bored me was the way the game plays in general, and the fact that there's a bunch of idiots playing it, so...

840
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:11,302
[SPEAKER_08]: That's still not enough to read.

841
01:01:11,782 --> 01:01:14,343
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably have to find the right click to play with.

842
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to check it out.

843
01:01:16,703 --> 01:01:20,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I might consider looking at it.

844
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly haven't installed World of Warcraft on this computer, and I still have my account.

845
01:01:28,325 --> 01:01:38,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be worth it for me to check out, but certainly not until I'm healed up enough to be able to play a game that requires a keyboard.

846
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek Star Trek Star Trek

847
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:09,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to make the Olarian.

848
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,865
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've already started picking races that I want to make the Olarians from.

849
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:18,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you go on with your bad self.

850
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,651
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be orange.

851
01:02:20,672 --> 01:02:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

852
01:02:21,547 --> 01:02:22,848
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on to more gaming news.

853
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:55,411
[SPEAKER_10]: The new Slim system is 30% smaller, or actually 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and uses 34% less power.

854
01:02:56,132 --> 01:03:01,755
[SPEAKER_10]: It comes with a 120GB hard drive, and of course at the new price of $299.

855
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:09,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is actually going to be released supposedly in the first week of September.

856
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,120
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

857
01:03:12,495 --> 01:03:28,758
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, according to GameStop, it's actually supposed to be coming out next week, or as early as next week, but, you know, basically we'll be replacing the new, well, the 80 gig system and the 160 gig system that they had out already.

858
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:35,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Which just goes to prove that whenever you try to put out a cease and desist, you're only validating the material.

859
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:36,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

860
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:49,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of all this, they dropped the 80GB system to $299 as well, and they also dropped the $160 to $399, which begs the question, why the hell did you do that?

861
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:51,809
[SPEAKER_10]: At least in that order.

862
01:03:52,009 --> 01:03:53,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they totally don't get it.

863
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:56,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you drop the price of those two systems?

864
01:03:56,798 --> 01:03:58,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand to clear them out.

865
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:58,839
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

866
01:03:58,859 --> 01:03:59,939
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes perfect sense.

867
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,339
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you announce the new system at the same time.

868
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

869
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:10,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have these new slim 120GB systems in my store with 80GB systems that are the same price.

870
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Duh!

871
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:16,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I going to buy the new system that has a larger hard drive for the same price?

872
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:17,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I will.

873
01:04:17,982 --> 01:04:22,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the same time, would you really spend an extra $100 for an extra 40GB on your hard drive?

874
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:24,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

875
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:46,920
[SPEAKER_10]: and all that.

876
01:04:47,942 --> 01:04:51,189
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also been a discovery.

877
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:56,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently when they were registering the Slim, I guess with the FCC and all this...

878
01:04:58,174 --> 01:04:58,935
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

879
01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:24,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess filing for another SKU that's going to be with a 250GB hard drive.

880
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:25,986
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's probably coming later on.

881
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:27,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So, great!

882
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:30,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we know that there's a larger hard drive system coming out later on.

883
01:05:30,268 --> 01:05:33,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hell are we going to, you know, if you're really not in a hurry to buy a system, you'll probably want to wait.

884
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this other one might be more money too.

885
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:37,731
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably will be.

886
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I still don't really know, what do I put on this hard drive?

887
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:52,452
[SPEAKER_10]: All those games installs because most of the games that are released now on Blu-ray do require an install because their drive is slow.

888
01:05:53,092 --> 01:06:03,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other thing too, in case you're wondering, the system did get rid of the alternative operating system install as well.

889
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:07,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're thinking about installing Linux on this slim system, you are dead wrong.

890
01:06:07,942 --> 01:06:08,943
[SPEAKER_10]: That won't be happening.

891
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:10,864
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll find a way.

892
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:14,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So way to go, Sony, removing features from your system as well now.

893
01:06:16,815 --> 01:06:18,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We know they're going to find a way.

894
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:19,716
[SPEAKER_08]: The Linux community is stubborn.

895
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:25,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, how many people really honestly are getting the PlayStation 3 to install Linux on it?

896
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:28,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not like the fat ones are hard to find.

897
01:06:28,499 --> 01:06:30,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only offering them a challenge now.

898
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:38,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, people may have been okay with not doing it because it's readily available now, but

899
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:42,944
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is, why would you remove that?

900
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that you don't need to necessarily do that, but really, did that cost anything to them?

901
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

902
01:06:50,092 --> 01:06:50,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really?

903
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:56,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the other funny thing, too, is it takes two seconds longer to boot up each time, for whatever reason.

904
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:57,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Strange.

905
01:06:58,221 --> 01:06:58,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

906
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:58,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

907
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:00,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

908
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:38,202
[SPEAKER_09]: or not the mouse but you know what I mean when you have the thing in place you can kind of see in the background some of the stuff except now you can interact with that background if that makes sense at all.

909
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, a status indicator is coming.

910
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:44,751
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be located in the top right corner of your PlayStation 3.

911
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll show your user icon that you have, however many friends that you have that are online, and also, most importantly, a little mail indicator if you have any new messages.

912
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

913
01:07:56,441 --> 01:08:01,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we'll have a little scrolling tick bar with the latest news from PSN, which I think they already kind of have.

914
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll just be adapted into this new status indicator.

915
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:12,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, apparently, now when you hit the PS button, no longer will the battery life indicator sit right on top of the clock.

916
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:16,575
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's kind of cool, though, is those new dynamic themes that they have.

917
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:17,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen those?

918
01:08:19,176 --> 01:08:21,718
[SPEAKER_10]: They're animated themes now that you can have in the background.

919
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:25,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, they have a little big planet one where the Sackboy's running on, you know, a planet.

920
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,722
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess you also now have premium avatars, they're saying.

921
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that means

922
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:39,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The Friends list is getting also reformatted.

923
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:43,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Shortcuts to the PlayStation Store, because naturally they want to make it easier for you to buy stuff.

924
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:46,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently a big change coming to trophies.

925
01:08:47,596 --> 01:08:54,100
[SPEAKER_09]: With 3.0 firmware, game developers will now be able to modify how trophies are displayed for add-on content.

926
01:08:55,161 --> 01:09:01,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently you still have the list combined when you're looking at the PlayStation Network or what have you.

927
01:09:01,606 --> 01:09:03,567
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess the developers have the freedom to...

928
01:09:04,568 --> 01:09:05,529
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

929
01:09:25,163 --> 01:09:29,286
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange-radio.com asks an interesting question about PlayStation.

930
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:33,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it that with each new in-creation of the PS3, it keeps losing features?

931
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:39,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lost backwards compatibility, flash card reader, fewer USB slots, and now the inability to install an OS onto it.

932
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:42,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just me, or shouldn't a console evolve with each new SKU?

933
01:09:43,157 --> 01:09:47,321
[SPEAKER_09]: From the looks of it, it's devolving so much that we will lose controller support in two years.

934
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:48,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, that part was sarcastic.

935
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:58,585
[SPEAKER_10]: They're dropping stuff out of the system to cut the cost of the system because that's the only way they can drop it to $2.99 without losing $500 or whatever on each system.

936
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:01,205
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought backwards compatibility was all software-based now.

937
01:10:02,386 --> 01:10:02,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought so too.

938
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:06,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not the whole PS2 in your PS3 like it was at the beginning.

939
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:09,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought so too, but for whatever reason, maybe licensing.

940
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:12,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't imagine it would be licensing though because Linux is free.

941
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you don't even have to...

942
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:21,806
[SPEAKER_10]: You're buying, or you're not really buying, you're downloading Linux anyways off the internet and installing it to it.

943
01:10:21,906 --> 01:10:24,932
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like it's already there or something like that.

944
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:29,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we got one more story from Jamie, then we're gonna get into some release dates.

945
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:31,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a pony.

946
01:10:31,438 --> 01:10:32,118
[SPEAKER_08]: There's my story.

947
01:10:32,378 --> 01:10:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

948
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:34,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Congrats.

949
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:35,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you and me are big comic book nerds.

950
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:41,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is news that makes me particularly happy as long as they get good comics.

951
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:47,826
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a digital comic reader that's going to be on the PSP in December.

952
01:10:49,147 --> 01:10:52,548
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually are working with Marvel to have...

953
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:54,550
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

954
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,758
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

955
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I like actually buying comics.

956
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:47,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love going to the store.

957
01:11:48,823 --> 01:11:54,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I read a bunch of digital comics anyway, but...

958
01:11:56,562 --> 01:12:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, actually, now that I think about it, I don't really use our PSP that much, but if I did, I would be interested in it, because I actually have downloaded a number of comics on my iPhone.

959
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:15,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the first three graphic novels of Bone on my iPhone.

960
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:25,752
[SPEAKER_08]: on my iPhone and I downloaded the Star Trek movie countdown, the tie-in that was supposed to be the prequel to the events in the movie.

961
01:12:26,673 --> 01:12:29,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought that was very convenient.

962
01:12:29,573 --> 01:12:32,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely cheaper than going and paying three bucks for the issue.

963
01:12:34,595 --> 01:12:37,555
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, I've gone right out and I'm reading the Nero book

964
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:45,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And Marvel, I know, would have to be behind it because they have been pushing the whole digital comic thing pretty hardcore.

965
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:07,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in our chatroom says I hope it's subscription based SSJ100Matt says What does DC Comics have to say about this?

966
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:11,630
[SPEAKER_09]: They did make the DC Universe game PS3 exclusive and now they're supporting its competition

967
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:40,964
[SPEAKER_08]: DC and Marvel have teamed up before for a number of things I think that DC would have to hop in on this and it would be good for all the businesses and you know what I would actually like to see is see some of the indie comic companies be included in this you know maybe even a web comic reader

968
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:45,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they are going to have... It's not just Marvel, though.

969
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:51,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's why I said Archie and Image are involved as well, but I didn't mention anything on DC.

970
01:13:51,153 --> 01:13:53,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't see why DC couldn't jump in on that.

971
01:13:55,695 --> 01:13:55,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

972
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:57,775
[SPEAKER_10]: They're more than welcome, I guess.

973
01:13:58,656 --> 01:13:59,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Just haven't done it yet.

974
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:09,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, let's move on to some release dates before the comics get here and we lose DarkSakura because she'll be too busy reading them.

975
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:12,160
[SPEAKER_10]: RavenSquad Hidden Dagger Xbox 360

976
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:46,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Curse Mountain Sudoku Ball Detective Harvest Moon Frantic Farming Puzzle Day Harvest Moon

977
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:59,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman Arkham Asylum, making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

978
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:06,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Fallout 3, Broken Seal and Point Lookout, available on PC and on Xbox 360.

981
01:15:19,108 --> 01:15:21,149

982
01:15:22,009 --> 01:15:23,749
[SPEAKER_10]: The Click, Diss and Make Up.

983
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I'm being sarcastic there.

984
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably going to really suck.

985
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:28,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with this one.

994
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:15,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially since the women in this game, based on the screenshots, have giant boobies.

995
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, another game with chicks with giant boobies.

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully she's not related if Memories are off.

999
01:17:30,273 --> 01:17:32,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to other consoles.

[SPEAKER_09]: Ishoku Sokuhatsu

1005
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks kind of like an RTS type of strategy.

1006
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:24,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a strategy, command and conquer-ish type of game on the PlayStation 2.

1007
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:27,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Memories Off 6 is getting a PlayStation 2 port.

01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:28,465

[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo DS, Super Robo Gakuen comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.

1011
01:18:41,453 --> 01:18:42,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Gakuen is high school...

1012
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's Robot High School?

1013
01:18:45,673 --> 01:18:46,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what this is?

1014
01:18:46,573 --> 01:18:48,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, is it G-A-K-U-E-N?

1015
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:49,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1016
01:18:49,374 --> 01:18:50,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be High School.

1017
01:18:50,995 --> 01:18:53,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it looks like Robot High School is the game here.

1018
01:18:53,616 --> 01:18:55,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm trying to look at screenshots, but can't.

1019
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:58,878
[SPEAKER_09]: But it looks like a little type of a strategy type game coming out this week on the DS.

1020
01:18:59,538 --> 01:19:03,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, looking at the PSP real quick.

1021
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:05,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can...

1022
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:32,971
[SPEAKER_09]: import in Japan the English language version of Final Fantasy Dissida if you want because obviously that's a big game we're getting out here this week I do want to point out though Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is out in Japan this week that is the new Soul Calibur game on PSP so I bet we do have some hardcore Soul Calibur fans that will want to import that probably not you can wait another week and then get that actually fine that's going to do it for PSP releases and Japanese releases

1023
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:44,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for our UK releases, on the 26th, we have Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Hantao, and Watchmen The End is Nigh Part 2 on Xbox 360, both of those.

1024
01:19:44,977 --> 01:19:49,418
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 27th, for PS3, is Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Hantao.

[SPEAKER_08]: Meh, Might and Magic, Clash of Heroes on DS, Soul Calibur Broken, Destiny on PSP, Supercar Challenge, and World Cup of Pool.

1027
01:20:14,512 --> 01:20:15,093
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

1028
01:20:15,962 --> 01:20:17,142
[SPEAKER_09]: World Cup of Pool?

1029
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:17,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Pool.

1030
01:20:18,203 --> 01:20:18,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1031
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:19,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me make sure.

1032
01:20:19,543 --> 01:20:28,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it sound like it's a cup full of pool, but chlorine-flavored water, but I'm assuming it's... I'm assuming it's like a swimming game or something.

1033
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:29,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Cup of poo.

1034
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:31,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Pool.

1035
01:20:31,968 --> 01:20:32,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

1036
01:20:33,068 --> 01:20:34,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Two Girls World Cup?

1037
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: La la la la la.

1038
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:38,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1039
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:41,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, I don't know how to follow that.

1040
01:20:42,216 --> 01:20:46,380
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll talk about the PlayStation Network.

1041
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:55,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony, one of the things they announced while they were talking about secret console revisions and stuff like that is that they're

1042
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:57,990
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1043
01:21:26,361 --> 01:21:32,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will apparently be less costly to develop for and cost less to gamers.

1044
01:21:32,946 --> 01:21:35,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, no real prices have been announced yet.

1045
01:21:35,888 --> 01:21:40,271
[SPEAKER_10]: They plan on having 15 at launch and 50 by the end of the year.

1046
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:47,836
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the titles that they did mention were coming out include Tetris, Field Runners, Heroes of Sparta, and Mini-Gore.

1047
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:50,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And once again...

1048
01:21:51,738 --> 01:21:52,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1049
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:03,893
[SPEAKER_10]: That might make it a little bit worth it.

1050
01:22:03,913 --> 01:22:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they hadn't, you would have bitched about it.

1051
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:07,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have bitched about it.

1052
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:08,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We all would have bitched about it.

1053
01:22:08,578 --> 01:22:13,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it doesn't sound like there's no hardware feature.

1054
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,526
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason these games can't be on the original PSP.

1055
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:17,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not?

1056
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:19,427
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to sell them to the original PSP owners.

1057
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:23,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Which begs the question, why would I buy the PSP Go?

1058
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:26,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would anybody buy the PSP Go other than the fact that it's...

1059
01:22:27,334 --> 01:22:28,695
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a sliding screen.

1060
01:22:28,775 --> 01:22:30,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that really worth more money?

1061
01:22:31,215 --> 01:22:33,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I will buy a PSP Go when the price drops.

1062
01:22:34,676 --> 01:22:35,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And it won't take long.

1063
01:22:36,477 --> 01:22:38,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you anything it will not take long.

1064
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:39,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be 2010, but it won't take long.

1065
01:22:41,058 --> 01:22:46,100
[SPEAKER_09]: When the price of the PSP Go matches the price of the PSP, which has to happen eventually, I will buy one.

1066
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,340
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what they're going to do?

1067
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,361
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to get rid of the original PSP.

1068
01:22:51,397 --> 01:23:04,865
[SPEAKER_10]: and then they're going to make you buy that of course it's not going to happen anytime soon because you've got like bundles now for Dissidia, you've got a bundle for Gran Turismo coming out in September you've got a bundle with Assassin's Creed coming out in November

1069
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:08,904
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no reason that you can't find a PSP 3000.

1070
01:23:09,344 --> 01:23:15,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Catanagram in chat says, I would buy a PSP Go when the price drop occurs and use it as a belt buckle.

1071
01:23:15,028 --> 01:23:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually sounds kind of awesome.

1072
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever seen those belt buckles with the scrolling text on them?

1073
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And it gets everybody to look at your crotch?

1074
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You can order those at ThinkGeek.

1075
01:23:23,092 --> 01:23:24,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen those before.

1076
01:23:24,073 --> 01:23:25,313
[SPEAKER_08]: The LED belt buckles.

1077
01:23:25,693 --> 01:23:26,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, kind of cool.

1078
01:23:26,994 --> 01:23:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine having a PSP Go showing a little movie on your crotch.

1079
01:23:30,596 --> 01:23:31,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be fun.

1080
01:23:31,657 --> 01:23:34,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is actually footage of your crotch.

1081
01:23:34,378 --> 01:23:35,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1082
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:37,219
[SPEAKER_09]: You nasty.

1083
01:23:37,599 --> 01:23:38,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Which would be fine.

1084
01:23:38,419 --> 01:23:40,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, did they ever say what's going to happen with my UMDs?

1085
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:42,863
[SPEAKER_09]: How I'm going to put my UMDs on my Go?

1086
01:23:43,243 --> 01:23:47,307
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I read a funny article by GameStop.

1087
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:50,109
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying that they expect them to be traded in.

1088
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there's going to be an official program.

1089
01:23:52,811 --> 01:24:05,361
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that people are going to be so enamored with PSP Go that they're just going to throw all their UMDs out and rebuy the content again because they love Sony so much.

1090
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:05,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1091
01:24:06,162 --> 01:24:06,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1092
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:12,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there are some fanboys that will, but I just don't see it being an epidemic.

1093
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:30,306
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sure that people would do that, because obviously Sony's not giving them a way to... My thing is, at the same time, if you do own an original PSP system, and they may just say, fuck you, you own an original PSP system, why the hell do we need a method for you to

1094
01:24:30,936 --> 01:24:33,237
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, dump your UMDs on there.

1095
01:24:33,257 --> 01:24:34,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Just buy new games!

1096
01:24:36,299 --> 01:24:40,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, I don't know, just don't buy a new system because you have a PSP system already.

1097
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:42,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you buy another system, you idiot?

1098
01:24:44,182 --> 01:24:46,223
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just my opinion there.

1099
01:24:46,243 --> 01:24:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, yeah.

1100
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:50,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just still not seeing the reasons to jump ship.

1101
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:59,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The Go, though, I think would be good for people who don't already own... Even then, it's not the right price.

1102
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say if you don't own a PSP, buy a PSP.

1103
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,881
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need the PSP.

1104
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:04,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Go yet.

1105
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:08,903
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing that super that it gets you unless you really need a quiet system or something.

1106
01:25:09,164 --> 01:25:09,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1107
01:25:11,485 --> 01:25:14,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are ways you can run stuff off your memory card even now.

1108
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no, legit ways, actually.

1109
01:25:17,348 --> 01:25:21,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can still purchase all those games online if you do want to do digital downloads.

1110
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Just buy your own memory card.

1111
01:25:24,111 --> 01:25:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to bet that half of the games in this mini thing are...

1112
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Virtual Console Rehashes.

1113
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:36,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Old games sold out again.

1114
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:38,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Galaga on my PSP.

1115
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:43,000
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have PlayStation Network games that are independent titles.

1116
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,083
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like PlayStation Network games like Super Stardust and stuff like that.

1117
01:25:48,382 --> 01:25:49,283
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that any different?

1118
01:25:49,363 --> 01:25:51,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the file sizes are smaller and they're going to be cheaper.

1119
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:52,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoop-dee-shit.

1120
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:56,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, just make them cheaper and make the file sizes smaller.

1121
01:25:56,147 --> 01:25:59,710
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need to necessarily make it a whole new category of games.

1122
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:04,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess if you want to draw more attention to the PSP or something, you can do that, which is what they did.

1123
01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:06,234
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I don't know.

1124
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:14,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Making something cheaper and cheaper to develop for doesn't really warrant them putting another bullet point in their system, I guess.

1125
01:26:16,818 --> 01:26:17,098
[SPEAKER_09]: M.T.V.

1126
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:17,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Games and Harmonix

1127
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:40,250
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1128
01:27:02,799 --> 01:27:04,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Beatles Karaoke Revolution.

1129
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's still rock band.

1130
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a singing version of it.

1131
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:09,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't have the instruments.

1132
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:11,142
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have the singing parts.

1133
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:15,323
[SPEAKER_09]: To be fair, you know, again, it's about options.

1134
01:27:15,383 --> 01:27:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes back to what we were talking about earlier in the show.

1135
01:27:17,584 --> 01:27:18,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just another way to buy the game.

1136
01:27:19,145 --> 01:27:19,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1137
01:27:19,685 --> 01:27:22,166
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some people that don't really want all those plastic instruments.

1138
01:27:22,546 --> 01:27:28,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I could see this really being aimed at the Beatles fans who are...

1139
01:27:29,588 --> 01:27:33,510
[SPEAKER_09]: wanting to have the game, but they don't want all this plastic instrument crap in their house.

1140
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Those people are communists.

1141
01:27:36,391 --> 01:27:37,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand.

1142
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:37,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

1143
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:39,553
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a small audience, but it's an audience.

1144
01:27:39,893 --> 01:27:42,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly they want to sell this game to as many people as possible.

1145
01:27:42,935 --> 01:27:43,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1146
01:27:43,915 --> 01:27:49,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Or perhaps you already own all the instruments and everything and you just want some extra microphones so you can do your three-part harmonies.

1147
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:53,418
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a certainly plausible outcome as well.

1148
01:27:54,658 --> 01:27:59,519
[SPEAKER_09]: No SingStar Beatles, but you know, hey, Rock Band Beatles, it's not like it looks that bad or anything.

1149
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:00,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks pretty awesome, actually.

1150
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:01,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really looking forward to it.

1151
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they are planning on releasing this, they sure as hell haven't told anyone yet.

1152
01:28:06,718 --> 01:28:08,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this might also only be in Britain.

1153
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, all this news is coming out of Europe, so it may not be something that's actually planned here, but it might be just planned over there.

1154
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So, who knows?

1155
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:18,092
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1156
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:53,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually originally came out in Japan on the PC-8801 in 1986, and then the Mega CD version came out, which of course for the Sega CD over here.

1157
01:28:54,937 --> 01:28:57,960
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually made a ton of improvements over the PC-88 version.

1158
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:18,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of just having the static background, the background for each level is full motion video with a polygon overlay for all the ships and asteroids and everything coming at you.

1159
01:29:19,991 --> 01:29:21,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a really, really good game.

1160
01:29:22,312 --> 01:29:25,434
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an FM7 version that was also released.

1161
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:54,150
[SPEAKER_08]: and it came out in the US for PC but that was put up by Sierra Online at any rate it was actually a competitor with Star Fox for the day except Star Fox was all fully rendered on the cartridge and like I said this had a

1162
01:29:57,259 --> 01:30:04,186
[SPEAKER_08]: A full motion video background, and it still is a traditional kind of shooter.

1163
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:15,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly though, it had better, graphically it was better, but it didn't have that innovative feel to it that Star Fox did.

1164
01:30:16,219 --> 01:30:23,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, yeah, terrorists take over the Earth, and, uh, we get these, uh, cool little ships that get to, you know, shoot people in the end.

1165
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:32,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it did have a sequel, which was, um, Sylphid the Lost Planet, um, which was a PS2 game.

1166
01:30:32,649 --> 01:30:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Project Sylphid was actually a spiritual successor, um, not really a game in the series.

1167
01:30:39,174 --> 01:30:39,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

1168
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:52,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a little bit of trivia about Sylphid too, um, is that, um, there was, uh, a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh!

1169
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:54,542
[SPEAKER_08]: that's called Sylphid.

1170
01:30:56,083 --> 01:31:02,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, in, uh, Mahiro-matic, there's actually a jetpack that Mahiro uses called the Sylphid.

1171
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:09,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in BlazBlue, um, Sylphid is the name of Rachel Alucard's tribe.

1172
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:15,417
[SPEAKER_08]: This game also has one of the best intros ever.

1173
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:19,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really one that you have to watch and listen to.

1174
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:34,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing that I really dig about this one, as opposed to the original version of it, is as you're flying through the level, you get radio feedback from the rest of the fleet.

1175
01:31:35,712 --> 01:31:36,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in Star Fox.

1176
01:31:36,353 --> 01:31:36,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1177
01:31:39,603 --> 01:31:41,144
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not quite the same.

1178
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:46,927
[SPEAKER_08]: In Star Fox, if you go back earlier in that file, we'll play a little bit of it.

1179
01:31:47,027 --> 01:31:47,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little different.

1180
01:31:49,429 --> 01:31:49,889
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

1181
01:32:04,097 --> 01:32:05,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those have really good music, too.

1182
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:15,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard it yelling... There you go.

1183
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:26,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and see, in Star Fox, the way it was, is that it was your squadron, your formation of ships, you know.

1184
01:32:27,476 --> 01:32:28,457
[SPEAKER_08]: You had your partners.

1185
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:39,262
[SPEAKER_08]: In this, it's you're getting... Like, have you ever... Alright, I know this is kind of old school, but have you ever listened to just CB channels?

1186
01:32:40,595 --> 01:32:41,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, yeah.

1187
01:32:55,715 --> 01:33:03,642
[SPEAKER_08]: and orders went out or feedback went out or some sort of announcement it may not be necessarily directed to you but you're still going to hear it.

1188
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:04,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people still use CD?

1189
01:33:05,244 --> 01:33:07,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, actually.

1190
01:33:07,986 --> 01:33:08,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, trackers do.

1191
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:15,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you see though in that sense then it actually adds a sense of realism to the game.

1192
01:33:16,434 --> 01:33:26,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, in terms of if you're traveling with people, like in your separate vehicles, having a CB is actually very good for areas that you'll lose cell reception.

1193
01:33:28,165 --> 01:33:29,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus cell cost minutes, anyway.

1194
01:33:30,887 --> 01:33:31,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Not always.

1195
01:33:33,389 --> 01:33:38,474
[SPEAKER_08]: But at any rate, I think it's a fantastic game.

1196
01:33:39,475 --> 01:33:40,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so there it is.

1197
01:33:40,596 --> 01:33:41,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Silphied.

1198
01:33:42,157 --> 01:33:42,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Silphied.

1199
01:33:44,127 --> 01:33:45,348
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I didn't say Slipeed.

1200
01:33:45,908 --> 01:33:48,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, people used to do that all the time too.

1201
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:50,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Your classic game of the week.

1202
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:52,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the newer one that came out on 360.

1203
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:55,195
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the old school one on Saturn.

1204
01:33:55,995 --> 01:33:57,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the sequel though is PS2.

1205
01:33:59,157 --> 01:34:00,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I played that one.

1206
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:02,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have it somewhere.

1207
01:34:03,521 --> 01:34:08,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, they were talking about Policenauts earlier.

1208
01:34:08,824 --> 01:34:12,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I came very close to using Policenauts as the classic game.

1209
01:34:13,755 --> 01:34:17,179
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're going to get into a story about police knots later, but I'll leave that for later.

1210
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:17,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't mean to.

1211
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:18,340
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's all right.

1212
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Twitter thing, so it's going to come up later.

1213
01:34:20,562 --> 01:34:21,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1214
01:34:21,843 --> 01:34:22,084
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1215
01:34:22,164 --> 01:34:25,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Twitter, we'll get into Twitter topics right after a little bit of a break.

1216
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:28,350
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to take a break, though, here in studio to cover more.

1217
01:34:29,351 --> 01:34:35,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we take the break, though, to get energized, to pee, to maybe order pizza.

1218
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:35,738
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1219
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:37,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Becky's bringing me tacos.

1220
01:34:37,812 --> 01:34:39,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, lucky.

1221
01:34:39,412 --> 01:34:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to offer to you on the air, guys, do you want me to make you guys pizza?

1222
01:34:43,874 --> 01:34:45,454
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually okay.

1223
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:47,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably shouldn't because I had a big old crepe earlier today.

1224
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I have organic mushroom and black olive pizzas.

1225
01:34:51,217 --> 01:34:52,197
[SPEAKER_09]: That does sound kind of good.

1226
01:34:52,817 --> 01:34:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have plain cheese pizzas.

1227
01:34:56,579 --> 01:34:56,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1228
01:34:56,979 --> 01:34:57,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1229
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want any unless you're going to have some.

1230
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, if I make pizza, I can just have it for lunch tomorrow.

1231
01:35:02,441 --> 01:35:02,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1232
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:06,372
[SPEAKER_08]: My man, by the way, is not here.

1233
01:35:06,572 --> 01:35:10,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am going to be going stir-crazy so people will be seeing me in IRC.

1234
01:35:11,034 --> 01:35:12,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Wee!

1235
01:35:12,975 --> 01:35:13,615
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a break.

1236
01:35:13,635 --> 01:35:15,756
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1237
01:35:15,796 --> 01:35:32,384
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plenty more to talk about in Part B tonight, including our rapid-fire news and talk about a new interesting achievement on Xbox 360 for killing 1,000 children in a game and a possible revamp of DSiWare and a Final Fantasy game you will probably never, ever see.

1238
01:35:33,547 --> 01:35:38,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We will talk about all of that in Part B after a quick break, so stay tuned here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1239
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:02,191
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1240
01:36:20,109 --> 01:36:20,989
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1241
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

1242
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:09,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Anonymous things.

1243
01:37:09,765 --> 01:37:11,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want my address out there on the internet.

1244
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:16,068
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so it cost me a little more money since I do that, but you know, whatever.

1245
01:37:16,509 --> 01:37:19,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have an OLR Wii, but I haven't done anything with that.

1246
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you?

1247
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:21,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1248
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:24,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need like an OLRPS3.com or something.

1249
01:37:24,392 --> 01:37:26,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, maybe.

1250
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:27,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll work on it someday.

1251
01:37:28,214 --> 01:37:33,517
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you're interested in helping us build websites and develop, you want to... We pay great, nothing.

1252
01:37:34,897 --> 01:37:36,498
[SPEAKER_09]: But pat on the back and job well done.

1253
01:37:37,158 --> 01:37:37,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually.

1254
01:37:37,939 --> 01:37:38,199
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just...

1255
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,188
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1256
01:37:44,298 --> 01:37:44,438
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 bucks, $7.50

1257
01:38:12,452 --> 01:38:12,953
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1258
01:38:31,468 --> 01:38:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen me do it.

1259
01:39:01,429 --> 01:39:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It was some type of Namco 25th anniversary thing.

1260
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:06,651
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was Pac-Man, Ms.

1261
01:39:06,671 --> 01:39:08,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man, and Galaga were all on it.

1262
01:39:08,972 --> 01:39:12,293
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted 195,000 tickets for that thing.

1263
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:15,294
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like $3,000 in real money.

1264
01:39:16,135 --> 01:39:18,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, they're not really that expensive.

1265
01:39:18,115 --> 01:39:18,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say.

1266
01:39:19,836 --> 01:39:20,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang.

1267
01:39:21,317 --> 01:39:22,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably a few hundred bucks and that's it.

1268
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:24,978
[SPEAKER_10]: You could build one cheaper.

1269
01:39:25,078 --> 01:39:25,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

1270
01:39:26,118 --> 01:39:27,319
[SPEAKER_09]: But it did look pretty cool.

1271
01:39:27,339 --> 01:39:30,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of curious to get one, but whatever.

1272
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:31,130
[SPEAKER_09]: T.O.A.G.A.C.

1273
01:39:46,977 --> 01:39:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1274
01:40:10,402 --> 01:40:11,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll see you next time.

1275
01:40:34,591 --> 01:40:36,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe a little broken, but it'll still get you to the stream.

1276
01:40:36,813 --> 01:40:38,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can listen to us on the iPhone on the All Games app.

1277
01:40:38,874 --> 01:40:40,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You can listen to us on the PSP on the OLR app.

1278
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:41,056
[SPEAKER_09]: You're covered.

1279
01:40:41,496 --> 01:40:42,017
[SPEAKER_09]: One way or another.

1280
01:40:42,877 --> 01:40:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1281
01:40:43,678 --> 01:40:44,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter topics tonight.

1282
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Every night we invite you guys.

1283
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,641
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a theme song for Twitter topics.

1284
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:48,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything.

1285
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:50,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to think about that for next week.

1286
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:53,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Conan O'Brien has a little theme song for his Twitter segment.

1287
01:40:53,225 --> 01:40:53,606
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1288
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:54,446
[SPEAKER_08]: You should do...

1289
01:40:58,129 --> 01:40:58,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1290
01:40:58,850 --> 01:40:59,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Rizzlem.

1291
01:41:00,211 --> 01:41:00,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1292
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:01,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1293
01:41:01,592 --> 01:41:02,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking something.

1294
01:41:02,253 --> 01:41:03,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll think of something for next time.

1295
01:41:03,534 --> 01:41:03,754
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1296
01:41:04,174 --> 01:41:05,456
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, don't call me during the show.

1297
01:41:05,496 --> 01:41:06,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are my parents calling me during the show?

1298
01:41:07,517 --> 01:41:08,298
[SPEAKER_09]: You should use the beep.

1299
01:41:08,478 --> 01:41:09,319
[SPEAKER_09]: You should use that beep.

1300
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:09,940
[SPEAKER_09]: What beep?

1301
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That beep beep should be the theme for Twitter topics?

1302
01:41:12,442 --> 01:41:12,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1303
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:16,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Black Cock We haven't had that in a while

1304
01:41:34,312 --> 01:41:39,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Ray Ayanami wants us to talk about Raystorm HD and not just because his name is in it.

1305
01:41:40,096 --> 01:41:44,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently there is a new game coming out called Raystorm HD.

1306
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,743
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a remake, possibly, of an old school Taito game.

1307
01:41:49,444 --> 01:41:50,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they...

1308
01:41:52,225 --> 01:41:53,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It appeared on PartnerNet.

1309
01:41:53,306 --> 01:41:54,006
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where they saw it.

1310
01:41:54,366 --> 01:41:58,028
[SPEAKER_09]: PartnerNet is Xbox's little testing grounds for Xbox Live.

1311
01:41:58,048 --> 01:42:00,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, somebody did.

1312
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is, RayStorm HD.

1313
01:42:03,151 --> 01:42:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember the first one very well.

1314
01:42:05,592 --> 01:42:08,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost feel like I should bring it up on YouTube and look at a clip of this.

1315
01:42:08,893 --> 01:42:09,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone know the game?

1316
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:10,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, do you know RayStorm?

1317
01:42:11,635 --> 01:42:13,676
[SPEAKER_08]: If it has to do with, what was it, Ray Crisis?

1318
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:15,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I think so.

1319
01:42:17,437 --> 01:42:20,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, I'm bringing up some of the gameplay here in studio so I can check this out.

1320
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is like a fun show.

1321
01:42:25,689 --> 01:42:26,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's exactly it.

1322
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:27,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1323
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:29,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun series.

1324
01:42:30,892 --> 01:42:32,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you schmuck fans, alright.

1325
01:42:32,753 --> 01:42:33,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, the graphics look nice.

1326
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:35,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like major targeting.

1327
01:42:36,055 --> 01:42:37,856
[SPEAKER_09]: This was an arcade game originally, wasn't it?

1328
01:42:38,857 --> 01:42:43,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember, but I've got all kinds of versions of that series.

1329
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a vertical game?

1330
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that looks like a vertical game.

1331
01:42:46,461 --> 01:42:49,343
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics are kind of rad for something this old school.

1332
01:42:49,403 --> 01:42:50,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine it has to be an arcade game.

1333
01:42:52,182 --> 01:42:53,943
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1334
01:43:19,778 --> 01:43:46,353
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're calling it a 24 hour gaming marathon to fund pediatric cancer research and treatment and I guess this is taking place on October 17th of this year and they're trying to get all these sites to come together to raise money for this extra life charity and it's to raise money for pediatric cancer which sounds like a great cause honestly it's going to be 8am on October 17th and they have all these groups participating I guess Sarcastic Gamer

1335
01:43:47,898 --> 01:43:52,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not listened to that show, but I've seen their thing on iTunes as part of this.

1336
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:55,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Destructoid is apparently on board as well.

1337
01:43:55,846 --> 01:44:01,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Limit Break Radio, I guess they'll probably be doing a Final Fantasy XI marathon, wants to know if we can come on board as well.

1338
01:44:03,454 --> 01:44:04,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1339
01:44:04,495 --> 01:44:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to commit to something if I can't give it 100%.

1340
01:44:06,396 --> 01:44:08,798
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's a great cause.

1341
01:44:09,298 --> 01:44:12,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if we don't do it ourselves, we'll have to support somebody else doing it.

1342
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:12,380
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

1343
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,021
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1344
01:44:13,401 --> 01:44:15,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming marathon, October 17th.

1345
01:44:15,142 --> 01:44:15,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we do it?

1346
01:44:16,103 --> 01:44:16,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

1347
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:17,844
[SPEAKER_09]: 24 hours worth of games.

1348
01:44:18,224 --> 01:44:21,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Obscure fucking vault games would be the theme of our marathon.

1349
01:44:21,446 --> 01:44:22,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody else could do that.

1350
01:44:23,945 --> 01:44:25,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be good.

1351
01:44:25,246 --> 01:44:35,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And to keep the continuation going, we'll have different systems hooked up so that while one system's going, we can switch games to a new one and just pass the controller over so that we don't have a lull in playing.

1352
01:44:36,037 --> 01:44:37,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe like a new game every hour or something?

1353
01:44:37,779 --> 01:44:38,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Works for me.

1354
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to figure it out because I don't know if we could do that here.

1355
01:44:41,082 --> 01:44:42,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic Adventure Marathon.

1356
01:44:42,564 --> 01:44:43,845
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be too small of a space here.

1357
01:44:43,885 --> 01:44:45,767
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to do it at the... Do it in the front room.

1358
01:44:46,682 --> 01:44:48,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we can get all this stuff.

1359
01:44:49,304 --> 01:44:50,785
[SPEAKER_09]: The weather should be better.

1360
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:51,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We could always go back to the garage.

1361
01:44:52,746 --> 01:44:53,106
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1362
01:44:53,586 --> 01:44:59,050
[SPEAKER_08]: If we do it on the big TV, though, we can actually put up a cam footage without a refresh.

1363
01:45:03,755 --> 01:45:05,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you've seen me take pictures off of my TV.

1364
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:07,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, would you be willing to do it too?

1365
01:45:07,756 --> 01:45:09,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we do this for 24 hours?

1366
01:45:09,817 --> 01:45:10,217
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do it.

1367
01:45:10,297 --> 01:45:12,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I have HD capture stuff now.

1368
01:45:13,278 --> 01:45:15,779
[SPEAKER_10]: So I could capture... I don't know.

1369
01:45:15,799 --> 01:45:16,879
[SPEAKER_10]: We could stream it, I guess.

1370
01:45:17,059 --> 01:45:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to figure something out.

1371
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:23,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to commit until we're 100% sure we can give it our all, but we are interested.

1372
01:45:23,341 --> 01:45:28,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've been talking about doing a gaming marathon for a long time, so it would be fun to get in on something like this with some other podcasts and things like that.

1373
01:45:29,023 --> 01:45:31,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly the cause is great.

1374
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:33,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to help.

1375
01:45:33,804 --> 01:45:44,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I still, though, wanted, you know, along those same lines, wanted to do a classic game segment every week, too, you know.

1376
01:45:44,807 --> 01:45:46,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should do nothing but classic games.

1377
01:45:46,527 --> 01:45:47,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we should just do obscure fucking classic games.

1378
01:45:47,867 --> 01:45:48,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not talking about that.

1379
01:45:48,827 --> 01:45:52,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about, you know, us having a classic gaming.

1380
01:45:52,568 --> 01:45:54,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like on YouTube or something?

1381
01:45:54,209 --> 01:45:54,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why not?

1382
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Might be fun.

1383
01:45:55,865 --> 01:45:56,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1384
01:45:56,205 --> 01:45:58,047
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys have some ideas, get in touch with us.

1385
01:45:58,107 --> 01:45:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at Orangelandrader.com.

1386
01:45:59,628 --> 01:46:02,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be curious what you guys think would be fun for the marathon.

1387
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:03,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

1388
01:46:06,453 --> 01:46:07,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for the heads up on that.

1389
01:46:07,614 --> 01:46:08,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

1390
01:46:08,274 --> 01:46:11,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to read a little more on that website about who we contact for more information.

1391
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:14,339
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're out there listening, please get in touch with us.

1392
01:46:14,379 --> 01:46:18,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at Orangelandrader.com because I think that could be fun.

1393
01:46:21,537 --> 01:46:26,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Tweet from Actdeft to our Twitter OLR wants us to mention the Policenauts English localization.

1394
01:46:26,882 --> 01:46:31,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there is a fan translation of Policenauts that was finished.

1395
01:46:31,506 --> 01:46:33,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this game of course was out on the PlayStation 1.

1396
01:46:34,768 --> 01:46:37,611
[SPEAKER_09]: It was also on the Sega Saturn and get this, the 3DO.

1397
01:46:38,051 --> 01:46:40,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And what makes this game notable is that it was a Hideo Kojima game.

1398
01:46:41,154 --> 01:46:41,294
Hold on.

1399
01:46:41,454 --> 01:46:42,755
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1400
01:46:58,483 --> 01:47:22,238
[SPEAKER_09]: point and click game but it never came out in English but the fans got together and translated it and it's a patch that you can apply to your ROM I'm supposing of Policenauts I don't know what version it is that they patched I'm assuming it's got to be the PS1 that's probably the easiest one but there you go so if you want to check out Policenauts you can do that now

1401
01:47:23,686 --> 01:47:25,367
[SPEAKER_10]: in a completely non-legit way.

1402
01:47:25,967 --> 01:47:40,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, if you actually own the import game, and you make a copy of it, dump your own copy of it with whatever program's out there, and you patch it with this, you probably know that most people aren't going to do this, or that are downloading this are probably getting it illegally, but you know what?

1403
01:47:41,032 --> 01:47:46,975
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is 13 years old, and I say, if they cared that much about it, they would have translated it to English 13 years ago.

1404
01:47:48,115 --> 01:47:49,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, they don't care at this point.

1405
01:47:50,016 --> 01:47:50,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, they don't care.

1406
01:47:51,336 --> 01:47:52,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you go.

1407
01:47:55,466 --> 01:47:57,827
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is digging it out of the vault right now.

1408
01:48:00,249 --> 01:48:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And Actdeft says in chat right now that I think it's the PS1 version.

1409
01:48:04,052 --> 01:48:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1410
01:48:05,473 --> 01:48:06,975
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more quick Twitter topics.

1411
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:13,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Technicolor with the three wants to know what are our thoughts on the Halo 3 ODST tour truck thing going around the country right now.

1412
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:15,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they have one of those at the State Fair.

1413
01:48:15,982 --> 01:48:17,243
[SPEAKER_09]: They had Rock Band 2 there last year.

1414
01:48:17,645 --> 01:48:18,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1415
01:48:38,526 --> 01:48:58,683
[SPEAKER_10]: um play Halo 3 there there's a good impression of what Halo ODST is going to be like I mean really they haven't changed too much I mean yeah you're playing you know the Shock Trooper but and it's not the scale's been kind of dropped down a little bit but I don't know it's not like it's like night and day gameplay I think hmm

1416
01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:00,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, some more Twitter topics.

1417
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:26,225
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw305 says, Blizzard is planning a pseudo-land support for StarCraft 2 and possibly Diablo 3 and links this to a story talking about, there was a quote in here I wanted to read, where the interviewer, and this is from ShackNews.com, asked the developer if they were possibly working on a solution that would be like a pseudo-land connection where the game will check in with Battle.net to authenticate and then it'll go back to acting like a land.

1418
01:49:26,565 --> 01:49:28,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And they replied, something like that.

1419
01:49:28,866 --> 01:49:38,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Maintaining a connection with Battle.net, I don't know if it's once or periodically, but then also having a peer-to-peer connection between players to facilitate a very low-ping, high-bandwidth connection.

1420
01:49:38,816 --> 01:49:40,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the things that they're working on.

1421
01:49:40,738 --> 01:49:43,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So a bit of an olive branch to the community, maybe?

1422
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:43,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1423
01:49:44,802 --> 01:49:50,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think this type of thing was probably always planned, but they're going to want the regular pings to Battle.net to make sure the game is legit.

1424
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:54,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because if they only pinged it once, somebody would figure out a way to patch that.

1425
01:49:54,814 --> 01:49:56,556
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to figure out a way to patch it anyways.

1426
01:49:57,197 --> 01:49:57,738
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

1427
01:49:58,178 --> 01:50:06,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the lanners are going to have to give the concession that they're going to have to attach to Battle.net to give this game, but they'll at least not have to play through Battle.net.

1428
01:50:06,789 --> 01:50:07,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that would suck.

1429
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: If Battle.net goes down, your whole game is fucked.

1430
01:50:09,993 --> 01:50:10,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

1431
01:50:10,914 --> 01:50:13,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully there'll be some type of concession there.

1432
01:50:13,817 --> 01:50:23,829
[SPEAKER_09]: SB Hale tweets us and says, $300 PS3, definitely not an under-the-radar story, but for those of us Xbox 360 and Wii owners, do you feel there's a need to own all three consoles?

1433
01:50:24,169 --> 01:50:29,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides the fact that the PS3 is a Blu-ray player, of course, I've yet to find a good reason why I shouldn't pick one up at that price.

1434
01:50:31,515 --> 01:50:36,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio is that a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1435
01:50:36,938 --> 01:50:42,600
[SPEAKER_09]: The interesting thing about the PlayStation though as a console is that you also have that added Blu-ray in.

1436
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:48,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So you do – I mean whether you say besides that or not, you have to factor that in a little bit to your decision.

1437
01:50:48,983 --> 01:50:53,145
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the question is really going to be does what the PlayStation 3 offer –

1438
01:50:55,013 --> 01:50:59,298
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as exclusive games and things you can't get on your Xbox 360, is that what you want?

1439
01:50:59,418 --> 01:51:01,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want games like LittleBigPlanet?

1440
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:02,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want MAG?

1441
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:07,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want Final Fantasy XIV and some of these games that are PlayStation 3 exclusive?

1442
01:51:07,988 --> 01:51:09,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that worth the $300 to you?

1443
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:11,311
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, then yeah, you gotta get one.

1444
01:51:11,972 --> 01:51:14,333
[SPEAKER_09]: If not right now, then you can stand to wait a little bit.

1445
01:51:14,733 --> 01:51:17,034
[SPEAKER_09]: But also don't discount the other features of the PlayStation 3.

1446
01:51:17,274 --> 01:51:20,055
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that it is a pretty good media device as well.

1447
01:51:20,095 --> 01:51:22,236
[SPEAKER_09]: That it does have home, if that's something that interests you.

1448
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:29,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole fact that you can have the online movie store, which has some different offerings than the Xbox 360 does.

1449
01:51:30,019 --> 01:51:31,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The HD movies and all that are important to you.

1450
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you have to consider all of that.

1451
01:51:33,661 --> 01:51:39,223
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the end, if you're getting everything that you possibly need out of gaming on your 360, then no, you don't need a PS3.

1452
01:51:39,963 --> 01:51:48,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there's something that the PS3 offers you that you need, and I will say it's a hell of a lot quieter, then go for it.

1453
01:51:50,307 --> 01:51:53,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, if you don't have an HDTV though, there's no point in getting Blu-ray.

1454
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:54,629
[SPEAKER_09]: There really isn't.

1455
01:51:55,694 --> 01:51:57,996
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm assuming you probably are an HDTV owner.

1456
01:51:58,897 --> 01:52:02,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And Zbunchat wants to point out Final Fantasy XIV is going to be on the PC too.

1457
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:03,120
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

1458
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and that may be where most people want to play it.

1459
01:52:06,923 --> 01:52:07,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And there we go.

1460
01:52:07,603 --> 01:52:10,506
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura found her copy of Policenauts on the PlayStation 1.

1461
01:52:11,306 --> 01:52:11,767
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

1462
01:52:11,827 --> 01:52:14,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish we had webcam in this studio but we don't.

1463
01:52:14,489 --> 01:52:14,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

1464
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,011
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's definitely all in Japanese.

1465
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:18,712
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to put that on the website?

1466
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:19,893
[SPEAKER_09]: The Pix Orange Lounge Radio?

1467
01:52:20,493 --> 01:52:20,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there we go.

1468
01:52:22,478 --> 01:52:37,171
[SPEAKER_09]: One more, and sorry if we didn't get to all the tweets tonight, but Matt Ostrovsky says, Interesting story about a company that is close to making the first PS3 mod chip.

1469
01:52:38,513 --> 01:52:40,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, could a mod chip be coming soon to the PlayStation 3?

1470
01:52:40,815 --> 01:52:41,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you heard about this, Loki?

1471
01:52:42,418 --> 01:52:48,323
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but that would be a pain in the ass to burn stuff onto Blu-ray and stuff.

1472
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:52,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Blu-ray discs are really expensive and that's like almost 50 gigs of data.

1473
01:52:54,468 --> 01:52:56,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Direct Boot of PS3 Original Import and Backup Games

1474
01:53:17,245 --> 01:53:20,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Direct boot of PS2, originally imported back of games.

1475
01:53:20,068 --> 01:53:22,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that means only if your console plays PS2 games.

1476
01:53:23,252 --> 01:53:25,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Does multi-region Blu-rays, multi-region DVDs.

1477
01:53:25,955 --> 01:53:27,596
[SPEAKER_09]: No configuration disk needed.

1478
01:53:27,656 --> 01:53:30,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a transparent stealth operation, they call it.

1479
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,861
[SPEAKER_09]: No USB interface.

1480
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:32,982
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to date.

1481
01:53:33,423 --> 01:53:35,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 12 wires to solder.

1482
01:53:36,005 --> 01:53:36,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Solder?

1483
01:53:36,906 --> 01:53:37,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, solder.

1484
01:53:38,909 --> 01:53:39,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Tempting.

1485
01:53:40,711 --> 01:53:44,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but still you have to solder, and what if they fix it with a patch?

1486
01:53:44,694 --> 01:53:47,695
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be screwed because that thing's hardwired to your system.

1487
01:53:47,876 --> 01:53:51,578
[SPEAKER_10]: My Wii is soldered, and it has a soldered-in mod chip.

1488
01:53:51,818 --> 01:53:52,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not worried about it.

1489
01:53:53,179 --> 01:53:55,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that thing has an on-off switch, huh?

1490
01:53:56,601 --> 01:53:57,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't use it.

1491
01:53:58,202 --> 01:53:58,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always on.

1492
01:53:59,103 --> 01:54:06,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they have it just in case, and it's only really had to have been updated once, and really I don't need the on-off switch on there.

1493
01:54:06,107 --> 01:54:08,088
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just an optional thing you can install on there.

1494
01:54:09,029 --> 01:54:09,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And

1495
01:54:11,124 --> 01:54:21,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, worst case scenario, if for whatever reason this decided, you know, they broke it or something, or they, you know, disabled the chip, you can always clip those wires that you soldered.

1496
01:54:22,873 --> 01:54:23,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's true.

1497
01:54:24,154 --> 01:54:24,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I am interested.

1498
01:54:25,555 --> 01:54:27,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a whole thing on Twitter.

1499
01:54:27,436 --> 01:54:30,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the tweets to OLR, Ask SSJ100Mac, because he posted it there.

1500
01:54:31,019 --> 01:54:31,439
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is it?

1501
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:32,360
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1502
01:54:34,301 --> 01:54:34,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

1503
01:54:34,862 --> 01:54:35,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I said how much is it?

1504
01:54:35,462 --> 01:54:35,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1505
01:54:35,842 --> 01:54:37,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see on that site, so check it out.

1506
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:46,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, if you want to tweet us a story that's... We like stuff that's under the radar, because obviously you knew this week we were going to talk about WoW Cataclysm.

1507
01:54:46,413 --> 01:54:47,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You knew we were going to talk about the PS3 Slim.

1508
01:54:48,213 --> 01:54:53,614
[SPEAKER_09]: But usually the stuff that might fall off the radar, we definitely want you to bring to our attention on Twitter or any topics you want us to discuss.

1509
01:54:53,994 --> 01:54:56,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep an eye out Sundays, a couple hours before we go live.

1510
01:54:56,574 --> 01:54:57,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually put a shout-out on there.

1511
01:54:57,995 --> 01:55:00,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news.

1512
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:03,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you're going to need to stop reading the tweets.

1513
01:55:03,856 --> 01:55:04,836
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, the first picture's up.

1514
01:55:05,436 --> 01:55:06,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Policenauts game?

1515
01:55:06,877 --> 01:55:09,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what, on OrangeLoungeRadio.com in our picture gallery, right?

1516
01:55:09,799 --> 01:55:10,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1517
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:10,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been waiting.

1518
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:11,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready to go.

1519
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,901
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, rapid fire news.

1520
01:55:13,201 --> 01:55:13,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Rapid, rapid.

1521
01:55:14,142 --> 01:55:24,189
[SPEAKER_10]: You may remember that Sega had a survey asking what should be the next game that they publish on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and we were, well...

1522
01:55:25,054 --> 01:55:26,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Earthworm Jim won that.

1523
01:55:26,515 --> 01:55:39,100
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they had to pull Earthworm Jim because, unfortunately, Interplay, at the same time, also announced that they're making a new Earthworm Jim game for PlayStation Network, WiiWare, and Xbox Live Arcade, as well as mobile platforms.

1524
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:49,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So, new Earthworm Jim coming, but there's still another Xbox Live Arcade Genesis pull, so you'll have to see who wins that, I think, currently, right now.

1525
01:55:51,705 --> 01:55:53,246
[SPEAKER_10]: ToeJam & Earl is winning that one.

1526
01:55:55,054 --> 01:56:01,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there is a rumor that looks like Canada will be getting a new Elite Bundle.

1527
01:56:02,156 --> 01:56:10,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be coming with Halo 3, and on top of that, they're also going to be throwing in a wireless network adapter, which is kind of cool.

1528
01:56:11,338 --> 01:56:12,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And all that can be had for $349.99.

1529
01:56:12,758 --> 01:56:13,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think that's Canadian dollars.

1530
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:14,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um,

1531
01:56:19,537 --> 01:56:21,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, it is available.

1532
01:56:21,919 --> 01:56:31,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually going to be... It's available right now at The Source, which I guess is a Circuit City affiliate out of Canada.

1533
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have the online offer.

1534
01:56:32,988 --> 01:56:34,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually for $3.29.99.

1535
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:38,393
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty interesting.

1536
01:56:39,554 --> 01:56:39,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1537
01:56:41,015 --> 01:56:41,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

1538
01:56:42,416 --> 01:56:42,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways.

1539
01:56:43,457 --> 01:56:43,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1540
01:56:46,446 --> 01:56:49,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero 5 will be incompatible with World Tour.

1541
01:57:06,289 --> 01:57:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the download content for World Tour, I guess, of the 158 songs that are on World Tour and Smash Hits, you'll only be able to download 152 of those back to your console, I guess, when you're importing songs.

1542
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:31,679
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, that makes sense, because Rock Band, there was like five tracks you couldn't download, or three or five tracks that you couldn't download because of licensing and stuff.

1543
01:57:32,119 --> 01:57:32,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1544
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:34,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1545
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:42,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, by the way, the chat wants us to mention that ToeJam & Earl was the new winner of the poll once the Earthworm Jim remake was mentioned.

1546
01:57:43,143 --> 01:57:44,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Diablo 3, Witch Doctor, Wizard, Monk

1547
01:58:04,778 --> 01:58:19,283
[SPEAKER_09]: but Monk by the way was originally in the Hellfire expansion in the original Diablo where Barbarian, Bard, Rogue, Sorcerer and Warrior showed up so I assume there's going to be at least a couple more classes that show up in Diablo 3 although not too many because you know they got to do the expansions later on right?

1548
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:25,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, the Wii and the DS are getting new Tetris games next year.

1549
01:58:26,737 --> 01:58:30,241
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, it's a partnership between Majesco and Tetris Online.

1550
01:58:31,062 --> 01:58:33,524
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be coming out on the Wii and the DS in the spring of 2010.

1551
01:58:35,547 --> 01:58:38,931
[SPEAKER_09]: No idea what the Tetris game is going to be like, but you know what?

1552
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Tetris DS was pretty badass.

1553
01:58:40,352 --> 01:58:41,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we necessarily need another one.

1554
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:44,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

1555
01:58:45,586 --> 01:58:48,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Eye of Judgment is making its way to the PSP.

1556
01:58:48,953 --> 01:58:51,477
[SPEAKER_09]: That was announced at Gamescom this week.

1557
01:58:51,618 --> 01:58:55,364
[SPEAKER_09]: You will get basically a version of Eye of Judgment, but of course there is no eye.

1558
01:58:57,930 --> 01:58:59,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why there's no bet.

1559
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:04,331
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still a lot of questions as to whether this will use the same cards or what have you.

1560
01:59:04,671 --> 01:59:05,932
[SPEAKER_09]: We just know the game is coming out.

1561
01:59:06,252 --> 01:59:08,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki says it will not count towards the bet.

1562
01:59:08,532 --> 01:59:09,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not, Loki?

1563
01:59:09,132 --> 01:59:12,533
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why it won't count towards the bet is because it's not as ridiculous as the Eye of Judgment.

1564
01:59:12,573 --> 01:59:19,094
[SPEAKER_10]: The Eye of Judgment is an actual physical card game that you had to play using the PlayStation 9 camera.

1565
01:59:19,134 --> 01:59:22,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it was the camera in the game portion of it.

1566
01:59:23,188 --> 01:59:24,829
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1567
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:54,330
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so sorry.

1568
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:09,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it doesn't matter.

1569
02:00:09,861 --> 02:00:16,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if I did add the Eye of Judgment to the bed or whatever, it still wouldn't meet a million units.

1570
02:00:17,144 --> 02:00:19,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to do that because it's just stupid.

1571
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:21,485
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to move on.

1572
02:00:22,646 --> 02:00:24,926
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find a new cause and a new outfit.

1573
02:00:26,207 --> 02:00:26,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1574
02:00:27,587 --> 02:00:30,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DarkSakura, do you have some rapid fire news for us tonight?

1575
02:00:30,228 --> 02:00:31,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I do indeed.

1576
02:00:33,231 --> 02:00:38,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Midway Europe is now Trade West Games.

1577
02:00:38,153 --> 02:00:41,514
[SPEAKER_08]: They were purchased.

1578
02:00:41,894 --> 02:00:45,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's actually gone through.

1579
02:00:45,935 --> 02:00:47,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being fully rebranded.

1580
02:00:48,216 --> 02:00:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, LittleBigPlanet is getting a re-release with 18 new levels and 7 download content packs.

1581
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:56,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool, huh?

1582
02:00:57,339 --> 02:00:57,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1583
02:00:58,106 --> 02:01:00,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when Tradewest, by the way, did Double Dragon back in the day.

1584
02:01:00,607 --> 02:01:02,227
[SPEAKER_09]: They were a big 8-bit developer.

1585
02:01:02,447 --> 02:01:06,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's the same company, but I just remember that name.

1586
02:01:06,809 --> 02:01:15,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the LittleBigPlanet packs are going to be the Metal Gear Solid level pack featuring the Paintinator.

1587
02:01:16,631 --> 02:01:21,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Gear Solid costumes, monster costumes, monster packs, history costumes, history pack, and animal costumes.

1588
02:01:22,284 --> 02:01:23,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Probs to a Media Molecule

1589
02:01:41,843 --> 02:02:11,054
[SPEAKER_08]: well and since we've had some discussion about Hideo Kojima he actually has said that he finds Metal Gear Solid series very puzzling too which is why he keeps detailed timelines for all of the characters in the game he says and I quote this is especially tricky when you create the future first and then go back in time to create something new there are a lot of small aspects where sometimes it doesn't match completely sounds like

1590
02:02:11,394 --> 02:02:13,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Marvel Comics, or Star Trek.

1591
02:02:13,477 --> 02:02:13,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1592
02:02:14,298 --> 02:02:15,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but they fixed all that with the movie.

1593
02:02:17,982 --> 02:02:19,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the newer canon.

1594
02:02:19,504 --> 02:02:20,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1595
02:02:21,086 --> 02:02:24,050
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, one other thing I wanted to mention, though, was the whole...

1596
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:27,571
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet stuff.

1597
02:02:29,631 --> 02:02:30,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot what I was going to say.

1598
02:02:31,252 --> 02:02:31,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.

1599
02:02:33,173 --> 02:02:34,673
[SPEAKER_09]: The water level is coming out soon.

1600
02:02:35,093 --> 02:02:36,314
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something I wanted to say about that.

1601
02:02:36,714 --> 02:02:41,355
[SPEAKER_10]: It's real water now, so you can actually make real water levels and that kind of stuff.

1602
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,757
[SPEAKER_09]: One more comment from chat.

1603
02:02:46,357 --> 02:02:52,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazatsuma on the whole Tingle bet says, We will move on once we see Loki dresses Tingle.

1604
02:02:52,299 --> 02:02:53,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I right, Penelope?

1605
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:56,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I renamed them back to OL Army.

1606
02:02:56,414 --> 02:02:56,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fine.

1607
02:02:57,796 --> 02:02:59,678
[SPEAKER_07]: However, they were balls for a little while.

1608
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:01,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You had your opportunity.

1609
02:03:02,142 --> 02:03:05,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't help it if you can't come through with your end of the bargain.

1610
02:03:05,186 --> 02:03:06,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know what?

1611
02:03:06,768 --> 02:03:07,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like...

1612
02:03:08,188 --> 02:03:37,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I make bets that I know I'm going to win for example, there was somebody one of my customers was betting me on the top grossing game this year and he said that he bet that Wii Sports Resort was going to be the top grossing game not only was he cocky about it but he said that it would beat out anything the number 2 one by 2 million units and he also said so my guess of course was Modern Warfare 2 because you're a fucking idiot if you think Wii Sports Resort is going to sell that many units

1613
02:03:38,132 --> 02:03:41,493
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's like, fine, I'll give you Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1614
02:03:41,733 --> 02:03:44,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you are so stupid.

1615
02:03:45,053 --> 02:03:46,154
[SPEAKER_10]: But okay, I'll take that bet.

1616
02:03:49,534 --> 02:03:50,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I will win that bet as well.

1617
02:03:51,435 --> 02:03:52,035
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the bet?

1618
02:03:52,795 --> 02:03:58,916
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't figured it out yet what the actual prize of the bet will be, but he's so confident that he's going to win that he'll probably do something stupid.

1619
02:03:59,056 --> 02:04:01,717
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just have to wait for him to act on it.

1620
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:03,499
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1621
02:04:22,549 --> 02:04:32,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, there's apparently an achievement that was discovered for the new game Fairytale Fights, where you get some points for killing 1,000 children.

1622
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:37,168
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to go over well.

1623
02:04:37,228 --> 02:04:39,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I think they should keep it.

1624
02:05:00,845 --> 02:05:01,446
[SPEAKER_10]: because that'd be funny.

1625
02:05:01,586 --> 02:05:07,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of one of those things that's lulzy for now, you know, in their little development, but probably won't actually get out there.

1626
02:05:07,731 --> 02:05:07,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1627
02:05:09,232 --> 02:05:09,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, oh boy.

1628
02:05:09,793 --> 02:05:10,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shoot, your pizza.

1629
02:05:11,134 --> 02:05:12,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine if it really did?

1630
02:05:12,335 --> 02:05:15,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Your pizza's burnt.

1631
02:05:15,658 --> 02:05:16,699
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura burned my pizza.

1632
02:05:17,139 --> 02:05:17,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I was smelling it.

1633
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:18,881
[SPEAKER_10]: It smelled nice and toasty.

1634
02:05:18,941 --> 02:05:19,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it does smell.

1635
02:05:21,063 --> 02:05:21,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

1636
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:22,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it really, like, crispy?

1637
02:05:22,424 --> 02:05:24,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of want to see it, but we're trying to do a radio show.

1638
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:26,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you do a monologue, Loki, while I go look at the burnt pizza?

1639
02:05:26,888 --> 02:05:27,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to do a monologue.

1640
02:05:29,837 --> 02:05:34,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1641
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:39,582
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're investigating a burnt pizza as if you haven't seen a burnt pizza before.

1642
02:05:39,622 --> 02:05:41,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just black and crispier!

1643
02:05:43,144 --> 02:05:43,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1644
02:05:45,526 --> 02:05:50,047
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, going back to the bet, there is no way that I'm going to add Eye of Judgment PSP to it.

1645
02:05:50,407 --> 02:05:54,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I am confident if I did, that it wouldn't matter.

1646
02:05:54,848 --> 02:05:56,108
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, that's the problem though.

1647
02:05:56,188 --> 02:05:58,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Once we add Eye of Judgment PSP, then where does it stop?

1648
02:05:59,189 --> 02:06:02,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to have to keep adding games until you eventually win.

1649
02:06:02,329 --> 02:06:03,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And who really wants to play that way?

1650
02:06:03,970 --> 02:06:04,730
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a bet.

1651
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,890
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have won the first bet in the first place.

1652
02:06:08,891 --> 02:06:11,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is everybody so curious about the burnt pizza?

1653
02:06:14,852 --> 02:06:15,312
[SPEAKER_10]: They're weird.

1654
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:21,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um... Alright, alright.

1655
02:06:23,342 --> 02:06:28,892
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm making her upload a picture of it to the pictures blog at orangemonstrator.com so you can see the fail.

1656
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:31,139
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1657
02:07:00,202 --> 02:07:01,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting yelled at from the kitchen.

1658
02:07:01,903 --> 02:07:03,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Technically, it's aluminum alloy.

1659
02:07:04,265 --> 02:07:05,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was aluminum.

1660
02:07:06,586 --> 02:07:07,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're so British.

1661
02:07:10,469 --> 02:07:12,751
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I wish our microphone would pick up the yelling from the kitchen.

1662
02:07:13,231 --> 02:07:15,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I just literally heard screaming, I'm not British!

1663
02:07:16,133 --> 02:07:20,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And Deathwishing says in chatroom, there's an achievement on Dirt 2 called Two Girls, One Cup.

1664
02:07:20,816 --> 02:07:22,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually Two Cups, One Girl.

1665
02:07:22,757 --> 02:07:26,720
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about winning two cups in the game with one female driver.

1666
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:29,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me move on.

1667
02:07:29,592 --> 02:07:29,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1668
02:07:29,952 --> 02:07:34,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting into another story that doesn't involve burnt food or what have you now that the whole house smells like crispy.

1669
02:07:35,758 --> 02:07:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm eyeing the taco on a silver platter that I want to devour.

1670
02:07:41,403 --> 02:07:44,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Independent Xbox Live game has been banned.

1671
02:07:44,246 --> 02:07:44,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1672
02:07:44,707 --> 02:07:47,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of visual sexual assault reminders.

1673
02:07:48,471 --> 02:07:50,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game called And Yet I Love You.

1674
02:07:52,856 --> 02:07:54,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even hear what she's saying.

1675
02:07:54,416 --> 02:07:56,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, she's not on the radio, so we're just ignoring her.

1676
02:07:56,737 --> 02:07:58,777
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have a mic, I can't hear you!

1677
02:08:00,598 --> 02:08:01,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bad radio etiquette.

1678
02:08:02,678 --> 02:08:03,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrible radio etiquette.

1679
02:08:04,099 --> 02:08:06,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it was on the Japanese marketplace.

1680
02:08:07,019 --> 02:08:08,960
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pulled because it was too erotic.

1681
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an independent developer, Naoki Sagawa.

1682
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that's related to the DDR Naoki.

1683
02:08:13,941 --> 02:08:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: No, probably not.

1684
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:16,541
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no sex in it.

1685
02:08:16,922 --> 02:08:18,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not an adult game.

1686
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:26,989
[SPEAKER_09]: However, apparently there were visual reminders of sexual assault because in one scene, the girl's hands are restrained.

1687
02:08:28,071 --> 02:08:32,056
[SPEAKER_09]: In one scene, a girl is being pushed down and her panties are visible.

1688
02:08:33,268 --> 02:08:34,550
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1689
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:53,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And there it was.

1690
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:55,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kicked away.

1691
02:08:55,571 --> 02:09:00,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what's interesting is that I'm reading this story on Kotaku here and they make a very good point.

1692
02:09:00,772 --> 02:09:09,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, by the way, while this is acceptable, you have Dead or Alive where you punch and kick females and you can see their panties pretty well.

1693
02:09:10,754 --> 02:09:15,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to take a picture of the taco on a silver platter and put that on the blog too because that's pretty amazing what Becky did there.

1694
02:09:17,075 --> 02:09:17,496
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1695
02:09:19,336 --> 02:09:19,556
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1696
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:22,462
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura needs a moment.

1697
02:09:36,755 --> 02:09:38,935
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura needs freaking food real bad.

1698
02:09:40,296 --> 02:09:42,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel bad about the pizza, although, you know.

1699
02:09:42,616 --> 02:09:43,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Your pizza's bacon.

1700
02:09:44,216 --> 02:09:44,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1701
02:09:46,117 --> 02:09:50,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Sony has to make some explanations.

1702
02:09:50,797 --> 02:09:52,438
[SPEAKER_08]: They got some explaining to do.

1703
02:09:54,938 --> 02:10:05,940
[SPEAKER_08]: When they removed the backwards compatibility from the Slim, they needed to say what exactly was going on.

1704
02:10:07,322 --> 02:10:15,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So they say, and this is a quote from John Kohler, who's SCEA's Director of Marketing.

1705
02:10:16,749 --> 02:10:31,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we're at a point where we're three years into the life cycle of the PS3, there are so many PS3 disc-based games that are available that we think, and notice this from our research, that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3 cite PS3 games as a primary reason.

1706
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:34,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically they're saying, oh, people don't care about PS2 anymore.

1707
02:10:36,564 --> 02:10:37,164
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

1708
02:10:37,664 --> 02:10:38,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat?

1709
02:10:38,584 --> 02:10:39,445
[SPEAKER_09]: People in studio?

1710
02:10:40,805 --> 02:10:41,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they right?

1711
02:10:41,585 --> 02:10:43,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people not care about PS2 anymore?

1712
02:10:44,085 --> 02:10:50,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as Ray Iannami in chat says, and I love this, backwards compatibility is so last gen.

1713
02:10:50,667 --> 02:10:52,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Referencing an old OLR reference.

1714
02:10:52,927 --> 02:10:53,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1715
02:10:53,247 --> 02:10:54,047
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, Loki?

1716
02:10:54,107 --> 02:10:54,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they right?

1717
02:10:55,708 --> 02:10:56,488
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're not right.

1718
02:10:56,708 --> 02:11:02,889
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just they're basically saying, why the hell would we give you a feature for free when you can buy our PlayStation 2 system for $100?

1719
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:25,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Or soon to be Playstation 2 downloadable titles I bet you that is what you're going to see in the next year Then they're going to start releasing the Playstation 2 as downloadable titles Just to fuck us all But we can't add backwards compatibility Butch, we can sure as hell emulate these titles perfectly We know software emulation is out there We know it's possible They just don't want to give it to us Yep Lame

1720
02:11:27,526 --> 02:11:49,801
[SPEAKER_09]: and yes I do kind of want backwards compatibility I mean yes I realize the games are old but I still have them and who doesn't sit there once in a while and go you know I kind of want to play Magic Pen Gel and draw a giant penis you know it's sometimes we get these desires to play the old PS2 games or Final Fantasy 12 I never did beat yes I have a PlayStation 2 that I could go back and hook up if I really wanted to but that's valuable shelf space

1721
02:11:50,831 --> 02:11:51,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1722
02:12:13,052 --> 02:12:27,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I am sending updated pictures of my tacos by the way I love how we have the food blog going on I posted a link in chat but it's on orangelaundry.com and you'll be able to see all these pictures if you're listening on the podcast but you probably don't care

1723
02:12:29,798 --> 02:12:30,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

1724
02:12:31,099 --> 02:12:31,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1725
02:12:31,659 --> 02:12:39,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a little silly of them to rid us of the backwards compatibility, especially when software emulation, at least of some titles, has been done.

1726
02:12:39,724 --> 02:12:43,746
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit frustrating, but whatever.

1727
02:12:43,887 --> 02:12:47,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, true, I can hook up the PS2 if I really want to play them that bad.

1728
02:12:47,969 --> 02:12:54,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying I would be more apt to still buying PlayStation 2 games if they would play... I haven't bought a PS2 game since Final Fantasy XII.

1729
02:12:54,413 --> 02:12:55,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the last one I ever bought.

1730
02:12:55,674 --> 02:12:56,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1731
02:12:57,715 --> 02:12:57,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

1732
02:12:58,390 --> 02:13:01,171
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be happy to sell them to you as a digital download later on.

1733
02:13:04,993 --> 02:13:15,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, with the announcement of the PlayStation Network minis, of course, Nintendo is looking to revamp its DSiWare service to kind of combat it.

1734
02:13:16,097 --> 02:13:22,580
[SPEAKER_10]: And what they're planning on doing, although the pricing won't change on the actual downloads, they'll basically stick to the $2, $5, $9 price models.

1735
02:13:24,941 --> 02:13:28,783
[SPEAKER_10]: They will have a lower barrier to entry for publishers.

1736
02:13:29,643 --> 02:13:33,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, they're going to have some size limits as well.

1737
02:13:34,485 --> 02:13:38,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Including, for example, a $5 game must be under 200MB.

1738
02:13:39,127 --> 02:13:42,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, Nintendo will charge a higher royalty.

1739
02:13:44,089 --> 02:13:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, that doesn't seem like much of an advantage, but okay.

1740
02:13:49,271 --> 02:13:49,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1741
02:13:52,153 --> 02:13:52,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1742
02:13:52,913 --> 02:13:55,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think they need some better games on there.

1743
02:13:56,874 --> 02:14:02,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I know from seeing a lot of reviews I've been reading, you know, for different things, I always see reviews for clocks and calculators.

1744
02:14:02,436 --> 02:14:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I don't need more fucking clocks and calculators.

1745
02:14:06,157 --> 02:14:08,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need a clock or calculator on my DSi.

1746
02:14:09,378 --> 02:14:10,659
[SPEAKER_09]: The DSi has a clock.

1747
02:14:11,059 --> 02:14:12,199
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I know the regular DS.

1748
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:16,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a DSi, but at least the regular DS has a clock.

1749
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1750
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:17,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1751
02:14:17,861 --> 02:14:19,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't get it.

1752
02:14:20,021 --> 02:14:21,182
[SPEAKER_10]: It's themed clocks.

1753
02:14:21,622 --> 02:14:21,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Silly.

1754
02:14:24,076 --> 02:14:25,538
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need more clocks or calculators.

1755
02:14:29,142 --> 02:14:32,726
[SPEAKER_09]: What does Nintendo need on DSiWare in order for people to pay attention?

1756
02:14:33,467 --> 02:14:34,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Virtual console.

1757
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:37,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1758
02:14:38,634 --> 02:14:41,057
[SPEAKER_10]: That would... People would be eating that crap up.

1759
02:14:41,197 --> 02:14:41,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1760
02:14:41,737 --> 02:14:42,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1761
02:14:43,604 --> 02:14:49,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, but I would just be frustrated because you know they're not going to let me just carry over the virtual console games I already have.

1762
02:14:49,085 --> 02:14:50,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to re-buy them.

1763
02:14:50,485 --> 02:14:52,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think I'd be... Homie, don't play that.

1764
02:14:52,486 --> 02:14:55,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be... Your chair broke.

1765
02:14:55,146 --> 02:14:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the chair just break live on air?

1766
02:14:56,766 --> 02:14:56,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1767
02:14:58,107 --> 02:14:58,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

1768
02:14:59,267 --> 02:15:00,187
[SPEAKER_09]: That can't be good.

1769
02:15:02,087 --> 02:15:02,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it just popped off.

1770
02:15:02,688 --> 02:15:04,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, popped off.

1771
02:15:04,968 --> 02:15:05,228
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it broke.

1772
02:15:05,248 --> 02:15:05,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, shoddy chair.

1773
02:15:08,309 --> 02:15:08,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dear.

1774
02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:10,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's show is...

1775
02:15:12,435 --> 02:15:12,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Footstool?

1776
02:15:12,876 --> 02:15:14,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's not the footstool.

1777
02:15:22,421 --> 02:15:27,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor Loki, we need to get... I almost bought an inflatable chair with my Dave and Buster's tickets.

1778
02:15:27,464 --> 02:15:27,864
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1779
02:15:28,024 --> 02:15:31,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hot pink inflatable chair with a pair of lips on it.

1780
02:15:31,806 --> 02:15:35,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm thinking we need one for the studio for Loki.

1781
02:15:35,128 --> 02:15:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pick up a folding chair next week.

1782
02:15:36,889 --> 02:15:41,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know, in the old studio at my house... So they want a picture of Bork Chair.

1783
02:15:42,132 --> 02:15:42,352
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1784
02:15:42,532 --> 02:15:43,693
[SPEAKER_09]: The couch is now gone.

1785
02:15:44,313 --> 02:15:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The ex came and took your couch away.

1786
02:15:47,215 --> 02:15:48,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad our studio's here.

1787
02:15:49,356 --> 02:15:51,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, sorry.

1788
02:15:53,277 --> 02:15:54,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Random show is very random.

1789
02:15:54,718 --> 02:15:56,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Grin, remember them?

1790
02:15:56,598 --> 02:15:59,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Grin turned into Frown because they had to close last week.

1791
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:03,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was because... Yes, Grin frowned because they got closed.

1792
02:16:03,601 --> 02:16:04,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And we shouldn't laugh, though.

1793
02:16:04,582 --> 02:16:05,042
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not nice.

1794
02:16:05,362 --> 02:16:08,123
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, they were the ones behind the Bionic Commando game.

1795
02:16:08,143 --> 02:16:09,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't end up reporting this on our show last week.

1796
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:11,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was just kind of a busy show, I guess.

1797
02:16:11,705 --> 02:16:12,745
[SPEAKER_09]: But they actually closed.

1798
02:16:12,765 --> 02:16:16,107
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the ones that were behind Bionic Commando, which was...

1799
02:16:16,667 --> 02:16:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

1800
02:16:17,788 --> 02:16:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

1801
02:16:31,954 --> 02:16:32,955
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1802
02:16:54,295 --> 02:16:54,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Regulate!

1803
02:16:54,655 --> 02:16:54,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Regulate!

1804
02:17:21,308 --> 02:17:22,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not anger, DarkSakura.

1805
02:17:22,648 --> 02:17:24,889
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you act like a fucking child in the chatroom.

1806
02:17:24,969 --> 02:17:26,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna treat you like a freaking child.

1807
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:28,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not taunt, HappyFunBall.

1808
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:30,471
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a democracy.

1809
02:17:31,271 --> 02:17:32,392
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a cheerocracy.

1810
02:17:35,553 --> 02:17:37,933
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is a freaking fashion... Becky got the reference.

1811
02:17:37,973 --> 02:17:39,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear the lull in the background?

1812
02:17:39,474 --> 02:17:39,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1813
02:17:41,855 --> 02:17:42,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1814
02:17:42,835 --> 02:17:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a DarkSakurosity.

1815
02:17:47,116 --> 02:17:49,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, speaking of DarkSakurosity...

1816
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:51,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Rob, fuck you.

1817
02:17:51,579 --> 02:17:51,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Love, Jamie.

1818
02:18:15,697 --> 02:18:17,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Jamie, fuck you back.

1819
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:17,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Love, Rob.

1820
02:18:18,138 --> 02:18:19,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh baby, oh baby.

1821
02:18:20,039 --> 02:18:20,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1822
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:23,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys!

1823
02:18:25,202 --> 02:18:25,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi!

1824
02:18:26,982 --> 02:18:28,583
[SPEAKER_08]: This summer has exhausted me.

1825
02:18:28,923 --> 02:18:29,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you spent?

1826
02:18:30,524 --> 02:18:35,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Between the summer of Arcade PSN and the two Monkey Island games that have been released, I am worn out.

1827
02:18:37,127 --> 02:18:37,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Need a cigarette?

1828
02:18:38,508 --> 02:18:39,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding, no smoke.

1829
02:18:40,209 --> 02:18:44,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got into the Champions Online beta and let me tell you, they're doing it all wrong.

1830
02:18:45,362 --> 02:18:50,345
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some real good qualities in that game, but it will take a lot to fix things if they want to attract people to the game.

1831
02:18:50,485 --> 02:18:55,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, with an offer that includes a spot in the Star Trek beta, I don't think they need to.

1832
02:18:56,548 --> 02:18:58,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I feel I need to ask a question now.

1833
02:18:59,010 --> 02:19:01,351
[SPEAKER_08]: What three games are you looking forward to next month, if any?

1834
02:19:01,451 --> 02:19:04,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Scribblenauts, and Beatles Rock Band.

1835
02:19:06,154 --> 02:19:07,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep what you're doing, guys.

1836
02:19:07,294 --> 02:19:07,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace!

1837
02:19:07,895 --> 02:19:08,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's from Dan Jetto.

1838
02:19:12,372 --> 02:19:13,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I held the microphone away.

1839
02:19:13,673 --> 02:19:14,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dan Shadow.

1840
02:19:15,055 --> 02:19:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I'm totally waiting.

1841
02:19:15,875 --> 02:19:18,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally, totally want Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

1842
02:19:18,717 --> 02:19:22,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Except it's a freaking stupid Civil War crap, and I hate the Civil War crap.

1843
02:19:23,481 --> 02:19:27,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Scribbledots, I'm also looking forward to, um... You make Abraham Lincoln cry.

1844
02:19:28,645 --> 02:19:28,885
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1845
02:19:30,026 --> 02:19:30,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shut up.

1846
02:19:30,927 --> 02:19:34,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Marvel Civil War crap that they did that I got so sick of.

1847
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:37,672
[SPEAKER_08]: They could at least do, like, the Skrull War or something.

1848
02:19:38,072 --> 02:19:38,833
[SPEAKER_08]: The Secret Invasion.

1849
02:19:39,550 --> 02:19:42,877
[SPEAKER_09]: To answer the question for me, Ion, I'm looking forward to.

1850
02:19:43,758 --> 02:19:46,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Beatles Rock Band is a good example of something else I'm looking forward to.

1851
02:19:47,285 --> 02:19:48,087
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be very cool.

1852
02:19:48,648 --> 02:19:48,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1853
02:19:50,513 --> 02:19:50,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1854
02:19:50,953 --> 02:19:54,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's kind of a blur for Christmas and a lot of the stuff I was interested in got pushed back to 2010.

1855
02:19:55,855 --> 02:19:57,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure.

1856
02:19:57,356 --> 02:19:58,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are definitely the two at the top of my list.

1857
02:19:59,917 --> 02:20:01,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on if I get my 360 fix soon or not.

1858
02:20:02,518 --> 02:20:02,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

1859
02:20:03,158 --> 02:20:03,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Games you're looking forward to?

1860
02:20:04,078 --> 02:20:04,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Any planned purchases?

1861
02:20:05,739 --> 02:20:06,339
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Hero.

1862
02:20:07,159 --> 02:20:08,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that would be number three for me.

1863
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:09,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely have to check that out.

1864
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:10,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Good call.

1865
02:20:10,721 --> 02:20:12,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was October for some reason, not September.

1866
02:20:12,721 --> 02:20:13,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It is October.

1867
02:20:13,562 --> 02:20:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1868
02:20:14,202 --> 02:20:14,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1869
02:20:14,722 --> 02:20:16,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's almost September, so we can count it.

1870
02:20:16,143 --> 02:20:16,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Good enough.

1871
02:20:16,443 --> 02:20:16,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Close enough.

1872
02:20:17,223 --> 02:20:18,304
[SPEAKER_10]: September, I don't really have anything.

1873
02:20:18,324 --> 02:20:19,384
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll take that answer and he'll like it.

1874
02:20:19,785 --> 02:20:22,246
[SPEAKER_10]: September, I don't really have anything I'm looking for.

1875
02:20:22,526 --> 02:20:27,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Scribblenauts, I guess, would be kind of cool, but I probably won't be buying that.

1876
02:20:27,788 --> 02:20:28,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1877
02:20:28,089 --> 02:20:28,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I may be buying that.

1878
02:20:29,169 --> 02:20:31,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Amkara222 in chat says Final Fantasy XIV.

1879
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that'll be out next month.

1880
02:20:34,372 --> 02:20:34,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep talking.

1881
02:20:34,892 --> 02:20:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still eating.

1882
02:20:35,512 --> 02:20:38,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd be lucky if the beta would come out next month, but I somehow sadly doubt it.

1883
02:20:40,936 --> 02:20:41,276
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1884
02:20:41,757 --> 02:20:44,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to get to the next email as soon as DarkSakura finishes chewing.

1885
02:20:45,099 --> 02:20:47,740
[SPEAKER_09]: But a mailbag at Orange Entree.

1886
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:48,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so stealing a chip.

1887
02:20:49,441 --> 02:20:51,203
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want you, I'm going to dare you to stop me.

1888
02:20:51,683 --> 02:20:53,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is the pizza still cooking?

1889
02:20:55,093 --> 02:20:57,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR Crew, what do you think of Bethesda's Wet?

1890
02:20:58,317 --> 02:20:59,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually looks kind of pretty.

1891
02:20:59,878 --> 02:21:00,919
[SPEAKER_08]: This game looks really interesting.

1892
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:04,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the fact that it infuses a sort of kung fu game, a shooter, and a 3D fighter.

1893
02:21:05,324 --> 02:21:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you guys see of it at E3?

1894
02:21:07,507 --> 02:21:09,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks in advance, I like old people.

1895
02:21:09,789 --> 02:21:12,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and P.S., it puts the lotion in the basket.

1896
02:21:14,054 --> 02:21:14,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Or else he gets the hose again.

1897
02:21:17,355 --> 02:21:17,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1898
02:21:20,097 --> 02:21:22,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a little bit of it, and it looked cool.

1899
02:21:22,579 --> 02:21:27,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Bethesda has a very good way of putting style on a lot of their games, unless it was the Star Trek game.

1900
02:21:29,365 --> 02:21:31,666
[SPEAKER_09]: But every time I hear Bethesda, I'm always like, where's Oblivion 5?

1901
02:21:32,067 --> 02:21:32,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's Oblivion 5?

1902
02:21:32,927 --> 02:21:34,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I should say, sorry, Elder Scrolls 5.

1903
02:21:35,069 --> 02:21:35,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's Elder Scrolls 5?

1904
02:21:37,111 --> 02:21:38,792
[SPEAKER_09]: They're working on it.

1905
02:21:38,992 --> 02:21:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I still need to go back and get the Call of Cthulhu game.

1906
02:21:41,294 --> 02:21:41,855
[SPEAKER_09]: What now?

1907
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:44,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I still want to play the Call of Cthulhu game.

1908
02:21:45,208 --> 02:21:52,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Wet looked cool, but it didn't seem like the type of game I would probably drop $60 on just because, you know, I like roleplaying and different styles of games.

1909
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:55,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a demo out there?

1910
02:21:55,371 --> 02:21:59,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Henderson Man says the demo for Wet is on the European PlayStation Network store and I thought the demo was awesome.

1911
02:22:00,173 --> 02:22:00,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So go check it out.

1912
02:22:01,573 --> 02:22:01,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

1913
02:22:02,113 --> 02:22:03,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Write us a review of it.

1914
02:22:03,514 --> 02:22:04,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1915
02:22:04,154 --> 02:22:05,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious to know more about it.

1916
02:22:05,754 --> 02:22:08,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a profile for every region, so I can do that.

1917
02:22:08,295 --> 02:22:08,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1918
02:22:09,355 --> 02:22:09,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

1919
02:22:11,356 --> 02:22:11,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

1920
02:22:11,856 --> 02:22:12,596
[SPEAKER_08]: These chips are tasty.

1921
02:22:12,856 --> 02:22:13,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1922
02:22:13,657 --> 02:22:14,237
[SPEAKER_08]: From J-Rod.

1923
02:22:18,066 --> 02:22:20,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, I had something to speak up about.

1924
02:22:20,588 --> 02:22:25,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I had two Xbox 360s and both of them ended up dying multiple times.

1925
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:31,293
[SPEAKER_08]: After I sent them back to be repaired, they eventually died again and I ended up getting a PS3 in the end.

1926
02:22:31,613 --> 02:22:33,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob said that his 360 just died as well.

1927
02:22:34,395 --> 02:22:35,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's what I don't understand.

1928
02:22:36,536 --> 02:22:43,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did Rob complain about customers giving Microsoft a free pass for faulty hardware and then in the same breath say, well, I'm probably just going to pick up an Elite?

1929
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:51,121
[SPEAKER_08]: The product was rushed to market to beat Sony to the punch and it couldn't be more obvious that they took shortcuts and screwed the customer to do so.

1930
02:22:51,681 --> 02:22:54,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So this type of behavior is now somewhat rewarded.

1931
02:22:55,382 --> 02:23:01,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because all my friends have one doesn't mean I need to give Microsoft my time and money for absolute shit hardware quality.

1932
02:23:02,323 --> 02:23:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that people use Xbox Live as a MySpace page rather than a game console half the time.

1933
02:23:09,625 --> 02:23:11,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So they just keep buying new ones over and over.

1934
02:23:12,305 --> 02:23:15,366
[SPEAKER_08]: The only time a company will learn is if you tell them with your wallet.

1935
02:23:16,207 --> 02:23:20,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Send it back, and if they don't repair it, then scrap it, sell the games, and move on.

1936
02:23:20,869 --> 02:23:25,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it, but if Rob buys another Xbox 360, he's basically just part of their problem he's complaining about.

1937
02:23:26,331 --> 02:23:31,853
[SPEAKER_08]: My current 360 is on its last leg with lockups, and if it dies, out the door it goes to eBay along with my games.

1938
02:23:32,774 --> 02:23:33,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

1939
02:23:34,134 --> 02:23:35,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a part of the problem, Rob, be a part of the solution.

1940
02:23:36,635 --> 02:23:38,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I absolutely disagree with you.

1941
02:23:40,363 --> 02:23:43,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just the viewpoint's a little too extreme for me.

1942
02:23:43,345 --> 02:23:44,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I get what he's saying.

1943
02:23:44,286 --> 02:23:46,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said earlier in the show, it was wrong of me.

1944
02:23:47,008 --> 02:23:47,368
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

1945
02:23:47,448 --> 02:23:49,950
[SPEAKER_09]: If I buy an elite system, I'll meet you at that point.

1946
02:23:50,170 --> 02:23:54,833
[SPEAKER_09]: If I buy an elite system, I'm rewarding Microsoft for borking my old system.

1947
02:23:55,313 --> 02:23:58,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So I came to my realization about that earlier this week.

1948
02:23:59,256 --> 02:24:04,399
[SPEAKER_09]: If I get another Xbox 360, which assuming Loki can't fix mine, I'm going to have to go for the low-end system.

1949
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see you there.

1950
02:24:06,821 --> 02:24:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1951
02:24:14,042 --> 02:24:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: You're smoking crack if you think that I'm going to sell all of my games back that I've invested hundreds of dollars in for a fraction of the cost.

1952
02:24:22,665 --> 02:24:37,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And therein lies the problem, and therein lies where I'm screwed, is that because I have invested all this money not just in that but on downloadable content, and some of which does not exist on the PlayStation 3, that yes, I do like to revisit on a regular basis.

1953
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:39,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to have the hardware to make it work.

1954
02:24:40,931 --> 02:24:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1955
02:24:59,029 --> 02:25:09,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I still do think, and I think most people agree with me, no matter if you think I was being a baby last week or what, no matter where, I think everybody kind of agrees with me that Microsoft does need to be held accountable for this.

1956
02:25:10,157 --> 02:25:14,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And history needs to show this negatively on Microsoft.

1957
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:17,202
[SPEAKER_09]: When the next console comes out, the question needs to be asked.

1958
02:25:17,802 --> 02:25:20,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you tested this so that half of them do not fail?

1959
02:25:21,064 --> 02:25:30,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And somebody at Microsoft needs to go on record and assure the public that when and if the consoles fail, there will be a program in place to do something about it.

1960
02:25:31,609 --> 02:25:37,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, though, what I'm going to do if this Xbox Red rings, because I think I'm on my third.

1961
02:25:39,733 --> 02:25:43,075
[SPEAKER_08]: But also keep in mind, we can just go to the store and Dan can get a new one.

1962
02:25:43,155 --> 02:25:43,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1963
02:25:45,976 --> 02:26:14,171
[SPEAKER_08]: but I really think that well I don't know I'd still be in warranty so technically I'd get a new one for free but regardless I would still take the time to write a letter and say you know hey I still enjoy my games I own more in games than I own in the cost of the three systems so to me it's a justified expense you know it'd be like

1964
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:16,732
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1965
02:26:46,474 --> 02:26:54,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, at the end of the day though, I do think it's bull that clearly the Xbox 60 fails more than any other piece of hardware we've ever seen.

1966
02:26:56,679 --> 02:26:57,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari 7800.

1967
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:00,341
[SPEAKER_09]: In the last 15 years.

1968
02:27:01,602 --> 02:27:07,344
[SPEAKER_04]: The Atari 7800 had issues with the power supply and they failed almost as much as the Xbox 360.

1969
02:27:08,305 --> 02:27:08,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1970
02:27:09,906 --> 02:27:10,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more in the mailbag?

1971
02:27:12,207 --> 02:27:12,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

1972
02:27:14,168 --> 02:27:14,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Um

1973
02:27:16,192 --> 02:27:20,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey OLR, I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real.

1974
02:27:20,124 --> 02:27:21,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we already covered this.

1975
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:34,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey OLR, I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real and will be coming out the first of next month and the original PS3 will drop $100.

1976
02:27:34,444 --> 02:27:36,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I already saw the box at GameStop.

1977
02:27:37,005 --> 02:27:40,206
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend works there and showed me inside where the consoles are.

1978
02:27:41,146 --> 02:27:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the Xbox 360 price will be going down after Project Natal is released.

1979
02:27:47,228 --> 02:27:47,528
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

1980
02:27:47,868 --> 02:27:49,769
[SPEAKER_08]: What is with these women having no bras anymore?

1981
02:27:51,181 --> 02:27:56,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong, I love tits, but when someone 50 years older than you does not have a bra on, I barf.

1982
02:28:00,088 --> 02:28:03,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should just let the emailers report on the news from now on.

1983
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:04,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Who did this?

1984
02:28:04,651 --> 02:28:05,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Juan?

1985
02:28:05,031 --> 02:28:06,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Juan.

1986
02:28:06,833 --> 02:28:09,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, this is the same Juan that emailed us before, I bet, huh?

1987
02:28:09,975 --> 02:28:10,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

1988
02:28:10,916 --> 02:28:12,797
[SPEAKER_09]: He needs a segment on this program one way or another.

1989
02:28:13,818 --> 02:28:14,919
[SPEAKER_09]: What is up with that?

1990
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like our new extrovert.

1991
02:28:20,267 --> 02:28:22,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You want a slice of your pizza, DarkSakura?

1992
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1993
02:28:22,491 --> 02:28:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

1994
02:28:22,892 --> 02:28:23,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a cheesy piece.

1995
02:28:24,955 --> 02:28:26,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I will let you pick whatever piece you want.

1996
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:27,620
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1997
02:28:28,462 --> 02:28:29,563
[SPEAKER_08]: How many more emails do we have tonight?

1998
02:28:29,583 --> 02:28:30,165
[SPEAKER_08]: This one, a few.

1999
02:28:30,545 --> 02:28:31,146
[SPEAKER_09]: A few, all right.

2000
02:28:31,307 --> 02:28:32,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I put this one in the name of science.

2001
02:28:32,969 --> 02:28:33,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it snappy.

2002
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:37,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Shook here, or is it Shookay?

2003
02:28:37,277 --> 02:28:38,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I never was told.

2004
02:28:39,358 --> 02:28:46,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week, I sent an email about my Final Fantasy X dilemma, and your advice worked.

2005
02:28:47,303 --> 02:28:49,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, oh yeah, you had the bigot dad.

2006
02:28:49,505 --> 02:28:50,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, no offense.

2007
02:28:55,368 --> 02:28:57,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, your dad was the asshole.

2008
02:28:57,229 --> 02:28:58,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh sorry, no offense.

2009
02:29:00,605 --> 02:29:08,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not in the habit of talking ill of other people's parents, but really, the way that you portrayed your dad made him look to be a major bigot.

2010
02:29:08,773 --> 02:29:13,497
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I were to start with one, you are the winner.

2011
02:29:14,505 --> 02:29:19,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just sold Madden 04, 05, and 06 for about $40 to a privately owned game store.

2012
02:29:20,072 --> 02:29:22,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger and I'm loving both.

2013
02:29:22,575 --> 02:29:24,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever.

2014
02:29:25,058 --> 02:29:25,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

2015
02:29:25,919 --> 02:29:32,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you beat it, go back and actually hop on the teleport device right at the beginning of the game and you can beat Lavos from the beginning and get the...

2016
02:29:34,509 --> 02:29:37,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sitting here in awe that he got that much for those old-ass Madden games.

2017
02:29:38,190 --> 02:29:38,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Props to you.

2018
02:29:39,210 --> 02:29:43,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my dad walked in on me during the opening scene with Blitzball when he asked what it was.

2019
02:29:43,811 --> 02:29:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I made up something and said it was Super Soccer Extreme 2000 and he bought it.

2020
02:29:50,912 --> 02:29:54,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, my huge thanks for the advice.

2021
02:29:54,673 --> 02:29:54,893
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2022
02:29:54,913 --> 02:29:57,453
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, my username is pronounced as if the K was silent.

2023
02:29:57,593 --> 02:29:58,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

2024
02:29:59,053 --> 02:29:59,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's shoe.

2025
02:30:01,874 --> 02:30:01,894
[SPEAKER_08]: K.

2026
02:30:05,391 --> 02:30:12,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran across this crap accidentally coming to a PS3 near you, LittleBigPlanetWater

2027
02:30:25,875 --> 02:30:32,498
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a link and it looks like Sackboy will swim, materials that float will float, and Sackboy will have a hold-your-breath limit of air.

2028
02:30:33,058 --> 02:30:37,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping they will give him scuba gear, the water equivalent of the untethered backpack.

2029
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:41,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, we talked about that.

2030
02:30:41,101 --> 02:30:42,822
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a video of creation mode on here.

2031
02:30:44,762 --> 02:30:45,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's kind of cool.

2032
02:30:46,303 --> 02:30:50,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to see how this gives a swift kick in the pants to all the user-generated levels.

2033
02:30:50,425 --> 02:30:51,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with Robaba.

2034
02:30:52,185 --> 02:30:53,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I have a mouthful of pizza.

2035
02:30:53,726 --> 02:30:53,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2036
02:30:55,785 --> 02:31:24,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Rababa that it would be awesome if there was like a scuba gear or something like that because that means you can make these levels that were nothing but floating and do you know how much that's going to increase the amount of clone games we see like space shooters and stuff amazing they're going to reduce space shooters it'll be easier with the water thing I think with the water though you are going to get limited air supply and that type of stuff that's going to work into it but what if there's a scuba gear like Rababa suggests I think that's a great idea yeah there will be that

2037
02:31:26,783 --> 02:31:30,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's also another email from him.

2038
02:31:30,906 --> 02:31:36,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I just noticed a recent post on NeoFM.com about that old project.

2039
02:31:37,032 --> 02:31:40,915
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really an update, but some smart cookie converted it to Pump It Up.

2040
02:31:41,456 --> 02:31:43,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Both are five-panel games in the arcade.

2041
02:31:44,758 --> 02:31:53,040
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at the Game Zone at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in the Great... Is it pronounced Olathe or Lathy?

2042
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Kansas?

2043
02:31:55,141 --> 02:31:55,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, somewhere in Kansas.

2044
02:31:55,841 --> 02:31:56,221
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

2045
02:31:58,562 --> 02:32:10,625
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's details in the article at NeoFM.com And then the other... And yes, I do remember this dancing game.

2046
02:32:10,665 --> 02:32:14,106
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the one that was going to look like a Beatmania controller, but it was with feet.

2047
02:32:14,591 --> 02:32:16,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2048
02:32:16,432 --> 02:32:17,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It was low-worthy.

2049
02:32:18,153 --> 02:32:19,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have video of it.

2050
02:32:20,274 --> 02:32:20,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

2051
02:32:20,835 --> 02:32:21,395
[SPEAKER_10]: In Kansas?

2052
02:32:22,916 --> 02:32:24,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's... How random.

2053
02:32:26,218 --> 02:32:33,742
[SPEAKER_10]: It's from... Well, Neon FM and a pump-it-up machine and... Well, because the whole thing runs off Stepmania.

2054
02:32:33,982 --> 02:32:37,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying we should send Shane to go look, but he won't care.

2055
02:32:38,805 --> 02:32:39,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he won't.

2056
02:32:39,565 --> 02:32:41,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I got something for him, thanks to Becky.

2057
02:32:41,507 --> 02:32:41,867
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

2058
02:32:43,288 --> 02:32:43,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get it.

2059
02:32:45,910 --> 02:32:46,510
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll love it.

2060
02:32:46,951 --> 02:32:48,851
[SPEAKER_08]: We should send it to him and autograph it and everything.

2061
02:32:50,652 --> 02:32:52,393
[SPEAKER_09]: He wouldn't care about our autographs.

2062
02:32:52,853 --> 02:32:55,034
[SPEAKER_09]: He probably already has that, but you never know.

2063
02:32:55,394 --> 02:32:58,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well then, I'll do something with it.

2064
02:32:59,396 --> 02:33:03,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, OLR listeners, who wants a copy of High School Musical 3?

2065
02:33:03,097 --> 02:33:03,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

2066
02:33:03,758 --> 02:33:04,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

2067
02:33:05,398 --> 02:33:07,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us know and you'll get it.

2068
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:10,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Because nobody in this room wants it.

2069
02:33:11,001 --> 02:33:13,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Or nobody in the hall either, else it would not be in my house.

2070
02:33:15,572 --> 02:33:15,992
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm sure.

2071
02:33:16,993 --> 02:33:17,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask him.

2072
02:33:17,313 --> 02:33:17,934
[SPEAKER_09]: He may not have it.

2073
02:33:18,254 --> 02:33:20,256
[SPEAKER_09]: He may not have bought it for whatever reason.

2074
02:33:20,276 --> 02:33:25,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually, it says there's apparently the code leaked out for Neon FM.

2075
02:33:26,641 --> 02:33:37,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, some cool cats managed to get their hands on two separate leaks of our code and put them in a centrifuge with some fairy dust and in the groove pumping up Linux code.

2076
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:41,813
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pumping up machines to a local arcade Neon FM 2009 machine.

2077
02:33:43,803 --> 02:33:48,965
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, their stuff leaked out to the internet a while ago in Stepmania format.

2078
02:33:49,105 --> 02:33:50,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it, but eh.

2079
02:33:54,527 --> 02:33:55,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Look how much of it I've eaten.

2080
02:33:55,568 --> 02:33:56,228
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good stuff.

2081
02:33:56,868 --> 02:33:57,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

2082
02:33:58,429 --> 02:33:59,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Except it's making me fat.

2083
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:02,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, any other emails tonight?

2084
02:34:04,571 --> 02:34:05,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

2085
02:34:07,887 --> 02:34:14,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to get angsty, and I don't really have a good story to lead us into this tonight, but what would the show be without the FUs of the week?

2086
02:34:24,758 --> 02:34:32,443
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I actually did have a story to lead us into that.

2087
02:34:33,643 --> 02:34:34,544
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to tell us real fast?

2088
02:34:35,154 --> 02:34:46,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well I mentioned it earlier, GameStop saying GameStop expects a UMD dump by new PSP Go owners since obviously Sony's not supporting them

2089
02:34:46,893 --> 02:34:55,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony Bartel, the GameStop EVP of Merchandising and Marketing said, we have a very clear roadmap on how we can drive profitability on sales of games.

2090
02:34:55,561 --> 02:35:08,291
[SPEAKER_10]: It will also be a strong contribution in our trade-in process when you have people that will have UMD games and they will no longer work on the platform and they'll fuel additional currency for GameStop!

2091
02:35:08,932 --> 02:35:09,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo GameStop.

2092
02:35:11,314 --> 02:35:13,576
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2093
02:35:13,596 --> 02:35:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your angst then.

2094
02:35:16,835 --> 02:35:26,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I had surgery again on Friday for him to pull out the rest of the suture, and what happened is that the suture was in a knot, which is why it wouldn't come out.

2095
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:27,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

2096
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It had been knotted up inside my hand.

2097
02:35:30,382 --> 02:35:32,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when it got tugged on, of course, ow!

2098
02:35:33,423 --> 02:35:34,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, yeah.

2099
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:36,371
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2100
02:36:01,072 --> 02:36:02,974
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've known Dan for like nine on top of that, right?

2101
02:36:03,274 --> 02:36:05,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been together for 11 and a half years.

2102
02:36:06,016 --> 02:36:06,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2103
02:36:07,037 --> 02:36:08,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any angst for you tonight?

2104
02:36:09,559 --> 02:36:11,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, eh, not really.

2105
02:36:11,981 --> 02:36:15,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I have to wait for my arcade cabinet to come in.

2106
02:36:15,083 --> 02:36:18,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to wait another four weeks, basically.

2107
02:36:19,406 --> 02:36:22,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, yeah, that just sucks.

2108
02:36:22,629 --> 02:36:24,891
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, no, that's all I got.

2109
02:36:26,645 --> 02:36:34,396
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week... I've had a really, really shitty week, so I just want to say FU to people that want to play political games and...

2110
02:36:36,348 --> 02:36:38,209
[SPEAKER_09]: All that crap when I'm just not down with it.

2111
02:36:38,609 --> 02:36:39,009
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2112
02:36:39,489 --> 02:36:41,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a professional individual.

2113
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:45,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to places to get a job done, and I'm not interested in playing games.

2114
02:36:45,971 --> 02:36:47,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will get my job done.

2115
02:36:48,152 --> 02:37:01,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, an F you to the fact that when I'm having these bad days, the person I want to turn to to talk about these things about is absent with better things to do, I suppose.

2116
02:37:02,077 --> 02:37:02,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not had a good week.

2117
02:37:04,045 --> 02:37:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go home and cry into my pillow.

2118
02:37:05,526 --> 02:37:07,008
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get ice cream after the show again.

2119
02:37:07,788 --> 02:37:10,411
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to finish in the next hour because Baskin Robbins closes at 10.

2120
02:37:10,871 --> 02:37:11,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So step on it.

2121
02:37:12,012 --> 02:37:12,953
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you pie later.

2122
02:37:14,415 --> 02:37:16,477
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2123
02:37:38,799 --> 02:37:55,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Abbey Road will be arriving first on October 20th at the price of $16.98, or 1,360 Microsoft points, with each individual track running you $2, or 160 Microsoft points.

2124
02:37:56,507 --> 02:37:56,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Sgt.

2125
02:37:56,807 --> 02:38:06,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Pepper's Lingling Hearts Club Band will come out in November, and I guess also the next album after that will be Rubber Soul, and that will arrive in December.

2126
02:38:07,032 --> 02:38:07,552
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um...

2127
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:10,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of tracks coming out, man.

2128
02:38:10,261 --> 02:38:13,043
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got uber tracks.

2129
02:38:13,464 --> 02:38:19,789
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's going to be kind of cool about that, though, I'm assuming, is that each one's going to have the different animations in the background.

2130
02:38:20,129 --> 02:38:22,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of those songs actually would be kind of cool to see.

2131
02:38:24,493 --> 02:38:27,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really kind of considering maybe buying this.

2132
02:38:27,435 --> 02:38:27,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2133
02:38:27,975 --> 02:38:29,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't really play a lot of rock band lately.

2134
02:38:31,918 --> 02:38:32,579
[SPEAKER_10]: But it might be fun.

2135
02:38:32,779 --> 02:38:33,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2136
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:34,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I like some of these songs.

2137
02:38:35,101 --> 02:38:36,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm totally going to have it.

2138
02:38:38,544 --> 02:38:44,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so mad my Xbox crapped out right before a song I really wanted to play had come out and I didn't get a chance to play it.

2139
02:38:44,949 --> 02:38:53,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing I have a little problem about, and I'm kind of confused in this sense, because some of these songs I thought were already in the game.

2140
02:38:53,776 --> 02:38:58,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how they were showing us different songs like Octopus's Garden and stuff like that?

2141
02:39:01,562 --> 02:39:04,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that was already in the game.

2142
02:39:05,393 --> 02:39:09,375
[SPEAKER_10]: But for some reason, it's listed on the Abbey Road download content here.

2143
02:39:09,856 --> 02:39:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it might also be that when you download the album, you're kind of getting the rest of the album, because I think every album has some representation in the game.

2144
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:17,941
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

2145
02:39:18,461 --> 02:39:18,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

2146
02:39:18,761 --> 02:39:22,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess maybe they're just listing what's on the album, not actual download content.

2147
02:39:22,283 --> 02:39:33,370
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be, because if these people said to the website, like, hey, we're releasing these albums, the website probably just went to Amazon.com and just wrote out the track list without thinking, oh, this song's probably in the game already.

2148
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:34,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

2149
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:34,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2150
02:39:35,411 --> 02:39:35,931
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

2151
02:39:36,331 --> 02:39:46,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, I guess, the All You Need Is Love download content, which is going to be a single, will be available as a timed exclusive on Xbox 360 and the game's launch is September 9th.

2152
02:39:46,974 --> 02:39:53,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also, if you purchase a full Abbey Road album, you'll have the option to play the B-side melody, or B-side medley, I'm sorry, from...

2153
02:39:55,932 --> 02:40:17,437
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll never get me your money through the end as one continuous trek I may not be the biggest Beatles fan in the world and you know I'm just I'm a cool Beatles are cool I respect that you know that people are in love with them I understand why they have such a place in history and so forth but I'm actually like really excited about this game like it just it just looks so cool it's fun to watch and play yeah

2154
02:40:18,515 --> 02:40:19,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Other stuff.

2155
02:40:19,676 --> 02:40:26,442
[SPEAKER_10]: This week on the Rock Band Store, they're going to have Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and Jet.

2156
02:40:27,703 --> 02:40:30,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Individual songs, of course, from Billy Idol.

2157
02:40:30,426 --> 02:40:31,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Please say it's Cradle of Love.

2158
02:40:32,287 --> 02:40:32,407
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2159
02:40:33,408 --> 02:40:33,828
[SPEAKER_08]: White Wedding.

2160
02:40:33,848 --> 02:40:35,190
[SPEAKER_10]: That's already in there.

2161
02:40:35,870 --> 02:40:37,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Money, Money, Money.

2162
02:40:38,232 --> 02:40:38,973
[SPEAKER_10]: and Rebel Yell.

2163
02:40:39,693 --> 02:40:40,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Rebel Yell's cool.

2164
02:40:40,714 --> 02:40:40,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2165
02:40:41,174 --> 02:40:44,017
[SPEAKER_10]: And each of those are available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2.

2166
02:40:44,757 --> 02:40:48,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Fleetwood Mac, you have Don't Stop and World Turning.

2167
02:40:49,761 --> 02:40:53,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't stop thinking about tomorrow, baby.

2168
02:40:53,704 --> 02:40:55,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I should sing the Rock Band songs every week.

2169
02:40:55,605 --> 02:40:57,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jet, you have She's a Genius.

2170
02:40:59,992 --> 02:41:03,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom Petty, I Won't Back Down, and Running Down a Dream

2171
02:41:13,936 --> 02:41:14,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, the Wii.

2172
02:41:15,577 --> 02:41:17,138
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got lots of stuff coming there.

2173
02:41:17,158 --> 02:41:20,559
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of it just previously released stuff on other things.

2174
02:41:20,579 --> 02:41:22,480
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a lot of tracks from Grateful Dead.

2175
02:41:22,901 --> 02:41:26,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Foo Fighters, Dropkick Murphy, White Zombie, that kind of stuff.

2176
02:41:27,503 --> 02:41:29,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Those will all be available for 200 Wii Points each.

2177
02:41:30,104 --> 02:41:31,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And those will be available on the 25th.

2178
02:41:31,205 --> 02:41:40,910
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, finally, on the PSP, you're getting two things of download content on the 27th, including the Zombies, She's Not There, and White Zombie, Black Sunshine.

2179
02:41:41,330 --> 02:41:41,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Each available for $2.00.

2180
02:41:43,354 --> 02:41:50,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally, Rock Band's download content is expected to hit 1,000 tracks by the holiday.

2181
02:41:51,400 --> 02:42:08,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's going to be some new tracks, of course, coming from Queen, Nirvana, Tom Petty, which we got some this week, Elton John, Iggy Pop, The White Stripes, Pantera, Talking Heads, Korn, and The Raccoon Tears.

2182
02:42:08,834 --> 02:42:09,594
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have from Iggy Pop?

2183
02:42:10,757 --> 02:42:14,040
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as... I don't think they've given any songs yet, just bands.

2184
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:15,301
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're just listing stuff.

2185
02:42:15,801 --> 02:42:18,344
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as many more from other artists.

2186
02:42:18,504 --> 02:42:19,745
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, that's kind of cool.

2187
02:42:20,125 --> 02:42:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, like Elton John, Queen.

2188
02:42:22,307 --> 02:42:22,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Need I say more?

2189
02:42:23,048 --> 02:42:24,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to get SingStar Queen, by the way.

2190
02:42:24,469 --> 02:42:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: That is out and about.

2191
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:26,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, need.

2192
02:42:26,831 --> 02:42:27,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm waiting for the price drop.

2193
02:42:28,012 --> 02:42:31,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know, once the game's out a month, it'll be in the clearance bin for $19.99.

2194
02:42:31,715 --> 02:42:32,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm waiting for.

2195
02:42:34,737 --> 02:42:35,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it.

2196
02:42:36,232 --> 02:42:38,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet, that was a lot of rock band news.

2197
02:42:38,333 --> 02:42:41,555
[SPEAKER_09]: They are busy bees over there considering there was no Rock Band 3 this year.

2198
02:42:42,095 --> 02:42:43,476
[SPEAKER_10]: 500 tracks a year, that's not bad.

2199
02:42:43,576 --> 02:42:44,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Good lord.

2200
02:42:44,237 --> 02:42:47,018
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot more than certain other music franchises.

2201
02:42:47,118 --> 02:42:47,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently.

2202
02:42:49,163 --> 02:42:55,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Gran Turismo 5 is the last story we have tonight before we get to the phone lines a little later on.

2203
02:42:56,009 --> 02:43:01,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, this was being shown off at Gamescom, not just Gran Turismo 5, but Gran Turismo PSP.

2204
02:43:01,994 --> 02:43:05,957
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some images of the game that have leaked out to the internet, and of course, they're pretty.

2205
02:43:07,419 --> 02:43:09,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The main menu looks like what you see in... I like how you said that.

2206
02:43:10,081 --> 02:43:10,361
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2207
02:43:10,401 --> 02:43:10,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty.

2208
02:43:11,202 --> 02:43:11,982
[SPEAKER_09]: It is pretty.

2209
02:43:12,042 --> 02:43:12,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, it's pretty.

2210
02:43:13,424 --> 02:43:15,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft... I always want to say Grand Theft Auto 5.

2211
02:43:15,866 --> 02:43:17,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Gran Turismo 5.

2212
02:43:17,527 --> 02:43:19,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Because GT... I just want to put the A in there.

2213
02:43:19,689 --> 02:43:22,951
[SPEAKER_09]: GT5 Prologue uses that same kind of menu.

2214
02:43:24,192 --> 02:43:24,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

2215
02:43:25,213 --> 02:43:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be 80 tracks in the game, 1,000 cars, 830 regular ones, and 170 with a little more modeling.

2216
02:43:33,639 --> 02:43:37,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Damage will be in the game, and GTTV is back.

2217
02:43:38,603 --> 02:43:40,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And it can also be run on your PSP.

2218
02:43:41,065 --> 02:43:43,587
[SPEAKER_09]: No release date yet, which you know what that means, 2010.

2219
02:43:43,647 --> 02:43:47,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time.

2220
02:43:47,049 --> 02:43:50,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering we got that prologue quite some time ago, that's a long wait.

2221
02:43:51,132 --> 02:43:52,013
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very long wait.

2222
02:43:54,047 --> 02:43:55,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool if you're a fan of Gran Turismo.

2223
02:43:56,008 --> 02:44:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not as big on the Gran Turismo series because I like my arcade racers.

2224
02:44:00,830 --> 02:44:02,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Gran Turismo is a little too realistic for me.

2225
02:44:02,631 --> 02:44:04,192
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more like Project Gotham and stuff.

2226
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:05,713
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that I hate them.

2227
02:44:05,733 --> 02:44:08,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're pretty to watch other people play that are good at it.

2228
02:44:08,755 --> 02:44:09,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just really bad at them.

2229
02:44:10,776 --> 02:44:11,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

2230
02:44:12,745 --> 02:44:14,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's your turn to give us a call.

2231
02:44:14,246 --> 02:44:16,008
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2232
02:44:16,088 --> 02:44:17,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2233
02:44:17,909 --> 02:44:20,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype line is open right now.

2234
02:44:20,431 --> 02:44:27,817
[SPEAKER_09]: We're only going to take a couple calls tonight, but we want to also get any last-minute stories that might be out there while we wait for folks to call.

2235
02:44:28,897 --> 02:44:29,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2236
02:44:30,038 --> 02:44:30,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

2237
02:44:30,919 --> 02:44:31,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

2238
02:44:31,259 --> 02:44:32,260
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you have something?

2239
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:32,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I like pie.

2240
02:44:34,562 --> 02:44:39,846
[SPEAKER_10]: And to think that I was going to let you go ahead and go first, that teaches me.

2241
02:44:41,178 --> 02:44:46,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, UK is getting a pretty cool deal with Guitar Hero 5 purchases.

2242
02:44:47,103 --> 02:44:50,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Much like how we're getting the free Van Halen over here.

2243
02:44:50,966 --> 02:44:57,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Folks that purchase Guitar Hero 5 in the UK will be eligible to get a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour.

2244
02:44:58,371 --> 02:45:00,853
[SPEAKER_10]: That's more songs and probably a better selection.

2245
02:45:00,953 --> 02:45:01,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something.

2246
02:45:01,974 --> 02:45:02,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we've got a call.

2247
02:45:02,815 --> 02:45:03,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2248
02:45:03,776 --> 02:45:04,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2249
02:45:05,457 --> 02:45:06,898
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Death Wishing.

2250
02:45:07,038 --> 02:45:08,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Death Wishing.

2251
02:45:08,359 --> 02:45:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

2252
02:45:09,953 --> 02:45:16,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they check ID or anything I mean, I don't have ID I don't have a driver's license yet in California to make you pay up the ass to get one

2253
02:45:38,743 --> 02:45:40,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it is a mature rated game.

2254
02:45:41,846 --> 02:45:51,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but, uh, it's, you know, I just find it really lame because it's just like, it's a mature rated game and yet we're all going to get our hands on it.

2255
02:45:51,593 --> 02:45:55,577
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be like eight year old kids going, oh my god, I pawn you, noob.

2256
02:45:57,158 --> 02:45:57,879
[SPEAKER_11]: T-bag.

2257
02:45:58,379 --> 02:45:59,720
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because parents suck.

2258
02:46:00,781 --> 02:46:01,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, my parents were cool.

2259
02:46:01,662 --> 02:46:05,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing Grand Theft Auto back then and look at me, I grew up to be perfectly fine.

2260
02:46:08,294 --> 02:46:11,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there individuals out there that might debate that comment, Deathwishing?

2261
02:46:13,675 --> 02:46:16,496
[SPEAKER_11]: That one Californian politician who got banned.

2262
02:46:19,917 --> 02:46:20,757
[SPEAKER_11]: If you know who he is.

2263
02:46:21,317 --> 02:46:21,677
[SPEAKER_09]: No idea.

2264
02:46:22,137 --> 02:46:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: But did you go to the tour?

2265
02:46:24,538 --> 02:46:25,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you planning on going to the tour?

2266
02:46:25,678 --> 02:46:26,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm planning on going to it.

2267
02:46:26,878 --> 02:46:29,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to talk my friend into taking me down to Pasadena.

2268
02:46:29,579 --> 02:46:33,700
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't see any coming near you guys, sadly.

2269
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:35,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sad.

2270
02:46:36,226 --> 02:46:37,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's pretty cool.

2271
02:46:37,908 --> 02:46:38,689
[SPEAKER_11]: You get free stuff.

2272
02:46:38,729 --> 02:46:40,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you get T-shirts and stuff for doing it.

2273
02:46:40,832 --> 02:46:41,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoopee.

2274
02:46:41,453 --> 02:46:42,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not that big on Halo.

2275
02:46:42,654 --> 02:46:45,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand why people love their Halo.

2276
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:50,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to play Halo 2 all the time with my college friends, but now I'm kind of over it.

2277
02:46:51,298 --> 02:46:56,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rob, about your 360, I don't see why yours is broken down so much.

2278
02:46:56,841 --> 02:46:59,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on my second, but my first one still works.

2279
02:47:00,503 --> 02:47:01,163
[SPEAKER_11]: It still works.

2280
02:47:01,263 --> 02:47:04,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have to close the tray in, like open and close it to get games to work.

2281
02:47:04,705 --> 02:47:07,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm letting my friend use it because his blew up, like literally exploded.

2282
02:47:08,227 --> 02:47:08,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2283
02:47:09,768 --> 02:47:10,368
[SPEAKER_09]: That's impressive.

2284
02:47:11,616 --> 02:47:27,766
[SPEAKER_09]: The Amazing Exploding 360s I call mine the Jesus Box Because it won't die It just keeps resurrecting It does We're going to let you go so we can get as many calls as we can tonight And still have time for ice cream But thanks so much for the call, okay?

2285
02:47:28,106 --> 02:47:37,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye I should ask him if he's going to the Silent Hill house Because I still want to go I think we're just going to have to go We're just going to have to get in the car and go

2286
02:47:38,823 --> 02:47:38,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun.

2287
02:47:39,023 --> 02:47:39,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let me...

2288
02:48:08,460 --> 02:48:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna get my headset.

2289
02:48:10,161 --> 02:48:10,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironic!

2290
02:48:11,482 --> 02:48:13,904
[SPEAKER_05]: DS Master on a PSP.

2291
02:48:14,845 --> 02:48:16,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, whatever.

2292
02:48:16,906 --> 02:48:20,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I'm here to do a review of a new game.

2293
02:48:20,849 --> 02:48:21,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2294
02:48:22,350 --> 02:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' Music for Wii.

2295
02:48:25,292 --> 02:48:28,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you played Poppin' Music for Wii and you don't sound happy about it.

2296
02:48:28,735 --> 02:48:30,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell us all about this game.

2297
02:48:31,697 --> 02:48:33,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complete crap.

2298
02:48:33,914 --> 02:48:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a long time B-Money fan and this has done great disgrace to the series.

2299
02:48:40,215 --> 02:48:45,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I need to know the reason why it's crap and I need to know how it's different from the poppin' music as B-Money fans know.

2300
02:48:46,736 --> 02:48:51,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's all, you know what they did with the DDR games and throwing those in the crapper?

2301
02:48:52,457 --> 02:49:00,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's all licensed stuff like Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus stuff into poppin'.

2302
02:49:01,435 --> 02:49:03,056
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no controller with it.

2303
02:49:03,116 --> 02:49:12,280
[SPEAKER_02]: You just use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck like you would on, oh, let me see here, Rayman Raving Rabbids in the dancing section.

2304
02:49:13,041 --> 02:49:14,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much how it's played.

2305
02:49:14,781 --> 02:49:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complete crap.

2306
02:49:20,244 --> 02:49:22,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's too bad.

2307
02:49:25,306 --> 02:49:28,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Ray Ayanami in chat is asking, no Konami originals?

2308
02:49:31,119 --> 02:49:32,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few, if any.

2309
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they tried to put in a revamped B4U song in there somehow.

2310
02:49:37,963 --> 02:49:43,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something out of... Like, it sounds like out of... I don't know if you heard this cartoon.

2311
02:49:43,666 --> 02:49:45,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi?

2312
02:49:46,168 --> 02:49:50,930
[SPEAKER_08]: That came out... Oh, actually, Puffy's an actual pop band in Japan.

2313
02:49:52,571 --> 02:49:57,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and... I think one of their songs ended up somewhere on the game.

2314
02:49:57,314 --> 02:50:00,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember which one it was, but... Um...

2315
02:50:01,656 --> 02:50:02,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Those complete cred.

2316
02:50:02,797 --> 02:50:04,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the DLC tracks.

2317
02:50:04,918 --> 02:50:09,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one thing this one has that all the others didn't have was DLC.

2318
02:50:09,422 --> 02:50:19,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I'm glad they're finally getting to the next gen and DLC to their music games, but at the same time, Konami's just disappointing the Beemani fans left and right.

2319
02:50:23,792 --> 02:50:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And, by the way, just to let you know, that line you quoted...

2320
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:31,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's straight off one of my favorite series.

2321
02:50:31,981 --> 02:50:32,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring It On.

2322
02:50:34,822 --> 02:50:36,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Only the best movie of all time.

2323
02:50:38,124 --> 02:50:38,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

2324
02:50:38,924 --> 02:50:42,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and they just got a fifth one, and I have a review on that.

2325
02:50:42,686 --> 02:50:43,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It is awesome.

2326
02:50:45,228 --> 02:50:46,968
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a fifth Bring It On movie now?

2327
02:50:46,988 --> 02:50:47,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only ever seen the first one.

2328
02:50:48,009 --> 02:50:49,310
[SPEAKER_09]: They have way too many Bring It On movies.

2329
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:52,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, brr, it's cold in here.

2330
02:50:52,231 --> 02:50:52,771
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, forget it.

2331
02:50:53,172 --> 02:50:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

2332
02:50:54,112 --> 02:50:55,433
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're letting you go, DS Masters.

2333
02:50:55,473 --> 02:50:56,513
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get some more calls.

2334
02:50:56,553 --> 02:50:57,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Go watch Bring It On on your PSP.

2335
02:50:59,926 --> 02:51:08,525
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, but basically, I heard rumors of possibly that the choreographer from Thatch,

2336
02:51:09,292 --> 02:51:14,636
[SPEAKER_02]: is doing a second All-Star Cheer Camp game or whatever for Wii.

2337
02:51:14,716 --> 02:51:15,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they are.

2338
02:51:15,276 --> 02:51:16,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I've actually played it.

2339
02:51:16,617 --> 02:51:20,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It does give you a workout twice as much as Wii Fit will ever give you.

2340
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:21,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great, bye.

2341
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:24,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess he didn't hear the part where he said I was letting him go.

2342
02:51:24,942 --> 02:51:26,123
[SPEAKER_09]: He just kept talking.

2343
02:51:27,304 --> 02:51:29,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important that we know about All-Star Cheer Camp, though.

2344
02:51:30,566 --> 02:51:31,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor guy.

2345
02:51:31,126 --> 02:51:32,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so rude to him.

2346
02:51:32,087 --> 02:51:32,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope he hears this.

2347
02:51:32,967 --> 02:51:33,868
[SPEAKER_10]: You're horrible, Rob.

2348
02:51:34,328 --> 02:51:35,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Horrible human being.

2349
02:51:36,138 --> 02:51:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't.

2350
02:51:36,738 --> 02:51:40,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I not say, okay, we gotta wrap up to get some more calls?

2351
02:51:40,119 --> 02:51:41,280
[SPEAKER_10]: He wasn't done yet, okay?

2352
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:42,320
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just wrong.

2353
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:43,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2354
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:44,761
[SPEAKER_10]: He was talking about choreography.

2355
02:51:44,821 --> 02:51:45,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2356
02:51:45,301 --> 02:51:45,581
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2357
02:51:45,661 --> 02:51:45,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2358
02:51:46,341 --> 02:51:46,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2359
02:51:46,921 --> 02:51:47,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2360
02:51:47,421 --> 02:51:47,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2361
02:51:48,062 --> 02:51:48,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2362
02:51:48,502 --> 02:51:48,802
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2363
02:51:49,142 --> 02:51:49,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2364
02:51:51,123 --> 02:51:51,863
Ah, crap!

2365
02:51:54,284 --> 02:51:56,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2366
02:51:57,004 --> 02:52:00,245
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2367
02:52:00,986 --> 02:52:02,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a call if you want to talk.

2368
02:52:03,484 --> 02:52:06,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Our number is 555-4444.

2369
02:52:09,327 --> 02:52:09,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really.

2370
02:52:09,867 --> 02:52:11,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2371
02:52:12,209 --> 02:52:13,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Since it's not ringing, I'm going to give it two more minutes.

2372
02:52:13,869 --> 02:52:15,490
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't call, we'll get over, Clint.

2373
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:16,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here we go.

2374
02:52:16,531 --> 02:52:16,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Last call.

2375
02:52:17,711 --> 02:52:18,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2376
02:52:18,692 --> 02:52:19,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2377
02:52:20,073 --> 02:52:20,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

2378
02:52:21,253 --> 02:52:21,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Actdeft.

2379
02:52:21,854 --> 02:52:22,254
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

2380
02:52:22,274 --> 02:52:22,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

2381
02:52:24,187 --> 02:52:25,528
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, sorry about your 360.

2382
02:52:25,888 --> 02:52:28,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely sorry it happened.

2383
02:52:28,169 --> 02:52:30,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I don't know why you're blaming yourself.

2384
02:52:30,290 --> 02:52:33,071
[SPEAKER_09]: The damn thing was obviously going to break eventually.

2385
02:52:33,531 --> 02:52:36,252
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I went down in a blaze of glory.

2386
02:52:37,493 --> 02:52:38,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

2387
02:52:39,393 --> 02:52:40,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just joking, man.

2388
02:52:41,114 --> 02:52:43,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I am sorry about the thing breaking.

2389
02:52:45,256 --> 02:52:46,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I blame Microsoft, not you.

2390
02:52:47,397 --> 02:52:47,917
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

2391
02:52:49,661 --> 02:52:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about the digital download thing you were talking about at the beginning of the show.

2392
02:52:55,145 --> 02:52:55,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2393
02:52:58,447 --> 02:53:11,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I made a comment in chat, or in Penelope, that most people have a really good connection to internet.

2394
02:53:11,816 --> 02:53:15,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me, I don't have a really good connection.

2395
02:53:15,318 --> 02:53:18,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I have only one megabyte per second.

2396
02:53:19,775 --> 02:53:20,495
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

2397
02:53:46,690 --> 02:53:47,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

2398
02:54:02,677 --> 02:54:04,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know you've called in this show.

2399
02:54:04,678 --> 02:54:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You live in Mexico, and I know you've talked about sometimes coming up to the U.S.

2400
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:11,341
[SPEAKER_09]: to get games or having them shipped down here or down to you or what have you.

2401
02:54:11,801 --> 02:54:16,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if with this digital distribution stuff, they could just say, oh, block Mexico.

2402
02:54:16,123 --> 02:54:17,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not their time yet.

2403
02:54:17,224 --> 02:54:19,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to wait until we get the localized version for them.

2404
02:54:19,365 --> 02:54:22,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just going to block their IP so that they can't get the game.

2405
02:54:24,047 --> 02:54:24,527
[SPEAKER_01]: That would suck.

2406
02:54:24,548 --> 02:54:26,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like it happened with Patapon 2.

2407
02:54:27,569 --> 02:54:29,710
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a digital download.

2408
02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:31,119
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States.

2409
02:54:31,239 --> 02:54:36,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Though, Sony made a good decision and they brought the UMD over here.

2410
02:54:38,902 --> 02:54:48,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe if they do that in the future, if you can have the digital download or you can have the disc, you have the option that maybe it could work better.

2411
02:54:49,185 --> 02:54:53,706
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you only have one option and it's the digital download, it won't work.

2412
02:54:54,267 --> 02:54:55,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely won't work.

2413
02:54:55,569 --> 02:54:58,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it when our callers get us to think about things that we didn't think about before.

2414
02:54:58,831 --> 02:54:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like thinking.

2415
02:55:23,379 --> 02:55:23,739
[SPEAKER_10]: It's horrible.

2416
02:55:23,759 --> 02:55:24,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, too bad.

2417
02:55:24,259 --> 02:55:26,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about some other last minute stories while I close up Skype.

2418
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:30,721
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't get through, hey, you can always tweet us, email us, chat with us.

2419
02:55:31,401 --> 02:55:32,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Or buy me a pony.

2420
02:55:33,742 --> 02:55:34,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Or buy Jamie.

2421
02:55:34,522 --> 02:55:35,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what I saw yesterday, Jamie?

2422
02:55:35,682 --> 02:55:36,062
[SPEAKER_08]: A pony?

2423
02:55:36,162 --> 02:55:36,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Derby Owners Club.

2424
02:55:37,682 --> 02:55:37,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Where?

2425
02:55:38,083 --> 02:55:38,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the doc?

2426
02:55:40,043 --> 02:55:40,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave and Buster's.

2427
02:55:40,803 --> 02:55:41,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Milpitas.

2428
02:55:41,443 --> 02:55:41,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

2429
02:55:42,144 --> 02:55:43,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

2430
02:55:43,564 --> 02:55:45,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the horsey racing games.

2431
02:55:45,924 --> 02:55:46,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of over it.

2432
02:55:46,585 --> 02:55:48,005
[SPEAKER_09]: They needed a sequel about five years ago.

2433
02:55:49,202 --> 02:55:54,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, there's a new game coming to the PS3 called 3D Dot Game Heroes.

2434
02:55:55,224 --> 02:55:58,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically kind of a 3D version of pixel art.

2435
02:55:59,706 --> 02:56:05,708
[SPEAKER_10]: If you were to take like an old school Final Fantasy game and make it all 3D and high res, that's what the game would look like.

2436
02:56:05,828 --> 02:56:06,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cool.

2437
02:56:06,928 --> 02:56:09,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And that should be coming out in Japan this November.

2438
02:56:10,290 --> 02:56:14,211
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on it coming over to the US, but I only hope it does because that would be awesome.

2439
02:56:16,121 --> 02:56:38,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Castle Crashers is getting new download content in the Necromantic, um, pack, and that will feature some really cool, um, things, including a chainsaw, a golden mace, a dragon head animal orb, and also, um, two new characters, the Necromancer and the cult minion you'll get to play as.

2440
02:56:39,074 --> 02:56:40,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So, all that available.

2441
02:56:40,955 --> 02:56:44,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no word on what the, uh, cost or when it's coming, but, um,

2442
02:56:45,711 --> 02:56:48,053
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2443
02:57:15,936 --> 02:57:19,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heart

2444
02:57:41,684 --> 02:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_10]: This might be the secret title that they were developing.

2445
02:57:45,247 --> 02:57:46,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope not!

2446
02:57:46,948 --> 02:57:48,689
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like crap.

2447
02:57:49,370 --> 02:57:50,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it's not.

2448
02:57:52,472 --> 02:57:54,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami is apparently location testing Poppin' Music 18.

2449
02:57:55,314 --> 02:57:56,855
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2450
02:57:58,596 --> 02:58:03,880
[SPEAKER_10]: The new mix, I believe, was... God, I just had it too.

2451
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:03,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

2452
02:58:11,395 --> 02:58:12,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot the name.

2453
02:58:13,097 --> 02:58:13,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't find it.

2454
02:58:14,278 --> 02:58:15,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, Pop Music 18.

2455
02:58:15,579 --> 02:58:16,540
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't even know the subtitle.

2456
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:17,200
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not important.

2457
02:58:19,382 --> 02:58:28,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently they're going to be conducting that starting, actually it was last week, starting August 20th at AMPIA at Kangawa Prefecture.

2458
02:58:29,771 --> 02:58:31,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to run from the 20th to the 30th.

2459
02:58:32,072 --> 02:58:36,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And then at Rundown at the Fukuoka

2460
02:58:37,186 --> 02:58:43,409
[SPEAKER_10]: and Fukuoka Prefecture from the 21st to the 30th.

2461
02:58:43,869 --> 02:58:44,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can check that out.

2462
02:58:44,910 --> 02:58:57,235
[SPEAKER_10]: They have more information on the location test site which is konami.jp slash am slash location test slash poppin18 So check that out if you live in Japan.

2463
02:58:59,252 --> 02:59:17,578
[SPEAKER_10]: and then let's see here Modern Warfare 2 of course I have talked about in the past about how Activision is trying to rip people off with the price of Guitar Hero 5 on the Wii no one seems to give a shit but now that you know it's available on PC apparently they are trying to raise the price of the PC version as well

2464
02:59:18,058 --> 02:59:22,462
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy are now showing the PC version with a $60 price tag.

2465
02:59:22,902 --> 02:59:32,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that may not be a big deal for people that normally buy console games, but for PC owners, most games only retail at $50 retail.

2466
02:59:35,912 --> 02:59:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I told you they were evil, and no one believed me, but now that it's a more important game, people might listen.

2467
02:59:42,438 --> 02:59:42,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2468
02:59:44,599 --> 02:59:53,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Namco Bandai is releasing a new game on the PlayStation Portable in December called Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos.

2469
02:59:59,653 --> 03:00:05,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Queensblade apparently is a, they call it a Lost World style combat picture book game.

2470
03:00:05,915 --> 03:00:12,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And features characters with large boobies.

2471
03:00:14,157 --> 03:00:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

2472
03:00:15,538 --> 03:00:18,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, to the point that it's absolutely ridiculous.

2473
03:00:19,579 --> 03:00:19,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

2474
03:00:21,109 --> 03:00:22,550
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely ridiculous.

2475
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:25,531
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I try to make my character an ion with boobies that big.

2476
03:00:27,511 --> 03:00:31,873
[SPEAKER_10]: So that should be coming out this fall on PSP in Japan.

2477
03:00:33,714 --> 03:00:34,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2478
03:00:35,234 --> 03:00:40,536
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but first we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2479
03:00:41,417 --> 03:00:42,517
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2480
03:00:43,858 --> 03:00:44,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Boobies.

2481
03:00:45,151 --> 03:00:47,693
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is ice cream, then boobies.

2482
03:00:48,553 --> 03:00:55,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I get my arcade hardware tomorrow, but it's no good right now because I don't have an arcade machine to play it on.

2483
03:00:56,118 --> 03:01:01,782
[SPEAKER_10]: But I get to stare at it and caress it and boobies.

2484
03:01:05,510 --> 03:01:08,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our show tonight.

2485
03:01:08,373 --> 03:01:10,055
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

2486
03:01:11,237 --> 03:01:12,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Tiger Claus reminded me.

2487
03:01:12,639 --> 03:01:18,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to mention the StarCraft II thing I was going to mention about the chick from Battlestar Galactica is voicing Kerrigan.

2488
03:01:19,408 --> 03:01:20,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Trisha Helfer.

2489
03:01:20,789 --> 03:01:21,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Six.

2490
03:01:22,351 --> 03:01:22,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot.

2491
03:01:24,403 --> 03:01:25,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an excuse to watch it.

2492
03:01:42,099 --> 03:01:42,419
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2493
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:48,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And so enjoy your Battlestar Galactica, kids, until next week because we'll be back next week to do it all over again.

2494
03:01:48,663 --> 03:01:52,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if you enjoyed the show, be sure to tell two friends about the show.

2495
03:01:52,765 --> 03:01:57,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave us a nice review on iTunes or just tell people about the show.

2496
03:01:57,168 --> 03:02:05,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Word of mouth is what sells the show and helps us spread around because, remember, we don't have a big magazine behind us or anything like that.

2497
03:02:06,553 --> 03:02:07,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna do it.

2498
03:02:07,294 --> 03:02:08,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next week.

2499
03:02:08,555 --> 03:02:12,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back to do it all over again on another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

2500
03:02:12,279 --> 03:02:12,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night!

2501
03:02:29,435 --> 03:02:31,940
[SPEAKER_00]: or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
