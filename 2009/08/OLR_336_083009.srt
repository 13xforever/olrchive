1
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:19,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 30th, 2009, is yet another novelty controller on the way for the Wii?

2
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:22,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Could your local Walmart's arcade soon be expanding?

3
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about new details on the Rock Band Network.

4
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:45,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:46,737
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:51,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

9
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:54,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And TechMasterLoki.

10
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:55,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

11
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,463
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys doing tonight?

12
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:57,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

13
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:57,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm full.

14
00:00:58,545 --> 00:00:59,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Full of what?

15
00:00:59,485 --> 00:00:59,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Crap.

16
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Crap.

17
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Leftover pasta from Olive Garden because right now the Neverending Pasta Bowl is going on.

18
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh damn, we need to go there.

19
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:10,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I had whole wheat linguine with Alfredo sauce.

20
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, apparently we had some type of unannounced contest that was win a night stay in the vault here at OLR Studios and Misty won it because she's actually on her way right now to hang out with us.

21
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:26,537
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not going to be on the show tonight because of the way the whole schedule works.

22
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,338
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't fly so she took a bus.

23
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,179
[SPEAKER_03]: She's hitting Reno tomorrow.

24
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

25
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess she's going to be here and kind of staying in the vault.

26
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:38,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm thinking Misty needs to be taken out for the full OLR Olive Garden experience.

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,571
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have to make that happen.

28
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: How about... Well, shoot.

29
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:43,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think because...

30
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:45,296
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

31
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and say, because, you know, it's a big deal for me.

32
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,700
[SPEAKER_02]: My wedding anniversary is on the second, not the second, the Tuesday.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking Tuesday is second day.

34
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Tuesday, the first.

35
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:20,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I will have been married for four years, and the entire time I haven't killed him.

36
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

37
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

38
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:22,946
[SPEAKER_07]: On both counts.

39
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been together for over 11 years, so, yeah.

40
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no.

41
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:57,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just a quiet night at home with the wife?

42
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:58,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

43
00:02:58,867 --> 00:02:59,907
[SPEAKER_07]: At least go out to a nice dinner.

44
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,747
[SPEAKER_07]: You and the wife like Benihana, right?

45
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:06,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, usually the family will take me out, then her family will take me out, then she'll take me out.

46
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get good dinners all weekend.

47
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I have a present for you.

48
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a can of air missing the nozzle.

49
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I could use that because my other can of air is kind of out of air.

50
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, take it.

51
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

52
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You're missing a nozzle.

53
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I can put the nozzle in there.

54
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,811
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really need the nozzle, actually.

55
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,731
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.

56
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:28,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to our chat room because our chat is always up and running.

57
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,183
[SPEAKER_07]: We love... Wait, wait, wait.

58
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:30,544
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

59
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally off topic, but since we were talking about food anyways.

60
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:34,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

61
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:39,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the wife has been really looking... Sorry, chat room, you've been bumped in favor of food.

62
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,289
[SPEAKER_06]: But this also ties in with possible birthday ideas.

63
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine, fine.

64
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my wife's been really interested in watching this new show that's on the Food Network called What Would Brian Boitano Make?

65
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,429
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, I kept hearing about it.

66
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, it's going to be very underwhelming, you know.

67
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:03,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it can't possibly be, you know, first off, there's no way that they're going to use the theme song from, you know, South Park.

68
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:04,317
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way that's going to happen.

69
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And this show is probably just going to suck.

70
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it came on today.

71
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:20,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only did they use the theme song from the South Park episode, which is fucking awesome already, but the episode was a bacon episode, dedicated to all these different party foods using bacon.

72
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like, sold?

73
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So that show's actually pretty funny.

74
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,431
[SPEAKER_06]: But he is very flamboyant.

75
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm serious, he's very flamboyant.

76
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:34,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can't go wrong with an episode dedicated to bacon.

77
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all sorts of awesome stuff.

78
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:36,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Bacon muffins.

79
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacon corn muffins would be really delicious.

80
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,360
[SPEAKER_06]: They are bacon corn muffins.

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,020
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess in honor of this, the chat rooms name tonight will be Bacon.

83
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go to Bacon right now.

84
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:51,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should name him Kevin.

85
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:53,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

86
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin Bacon.

87
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Your name is Kevin!

88
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:27,178
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf, our old buddy who tapes live before us, who's not going to be live next week because he's traveling to PAX.

89
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:27,698
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not.

90
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:28,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get into that in a minute.

91
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,862
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf in chat says, she sounds as excited about being married as I am to going to PAX.

92
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:38,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you listen to Bobby's show this week, he's kind of like, yeah, yeah, you know, PAX.

93
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:44,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm really excited about being married, but my excitement gets spread out over, you know, 365 slash 356 days, you know, a year.

94
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy.

95
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard.

96
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:59,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like being excited about my finger.

97
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a part of me.

98
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a useful part of me, you know?

99
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, I woke up today and I still had all ten fingers.

100
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:07,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited.

101
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this finger.

102
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this finger.

103
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:13,152
[SPEAKER_02]: This finger loves you.

104
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:18,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Some days I wish we were a TV show because I'll just leave it to your imagination which finger I was holding up.

105
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob, I like these two fingers.

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw in Kevin says, Good thing Dan knows the date of the anniversary.

107
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:28,786
[SPEAKER_07]: If he didn't, there's no telling what Dark Sakura would do.

108
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:30,067
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

109
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks.

110
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:43,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft follows up the Orange Lounge Foodio on AllSnacksRadio.com right after the Bobby Hot Dog Show.

111
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost feel like there ought to be a parody website or something.

112
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:50,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, forget it.

113
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:54,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go and talk about your gaming week, or I guess your food week if you want.

114
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,120
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

115
00:06:56,676 --> 00:07:06,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really didn't play that much this week because the skin on my hand is kind of getting really sore.

116
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: In that stage of healing where it gets really sore.

117
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't done a lot of gaming except for playing a little bit of RO, a little bit of...

118
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:23,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Sims, lots of that MMO on Gaia just because I was sitting here.

119
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But I started school.

120
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first week of school.

121
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I played a lot of Peggle.

122
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Played a lot of Peggle before class.

123
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:43,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But my gaming weeks in the future are going to be rather dull coming up because the two classes I'm taking are going to be a lot of work and I go back to work in two weeks.

124
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to get ahead of my school work.

125
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being responsible!

126
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:50,094
[SPEAKER_07]: No Sims 3 even?

127
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:51,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I need to boot that up right now.

128
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:54,177
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not even playing during the show.

129
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised.

130
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,839
[SPEAKER_02]: It's customary.

131
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, what was it?

132
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever a Harry Potter book would come out, I would ignore the show in favor of reading the Harry Potter book.

133
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:05,004
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this.

134
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember.

135
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:08,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never ignored the show to play games, I'll have you know.

136
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: as you were playing Flash games during the show.

137
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:17,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen he's been playing Flash games or hacking, downloading torrents while we're trying to broadcast the show.

138
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't really ignoring the show, by the way.

139
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just caught up in my book.

140
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do not ignore the show to play Sims.

141
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I am multi-talented and can multitask like a mofo.

142
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:29,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

143
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

144
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

145
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:32,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart!

146
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

147
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was alright.

148
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:34,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

149
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:41,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Grand Theft Auto, because I do that every day anyways, so that's a given.

150
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing really interesting happened there.

151
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:50,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And played more Earth Defense Force, because I'm slowly getting back into that, because I'm determined to finish the damn game!

152
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:55,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been like 80 hours already, and it's so damn hard!

153
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,950
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to finish it, and...

154
00:08:59,329 --> 00:08:59,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

155
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:22,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

156
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:37,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And the trial, you know, is all in Japanese, so I couldn't really figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.

157
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:40,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know, it's a basic rip-off of Zelda.

158
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, it looks like they made Zelda kind of Flash-looking.

159
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:48,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't the games have to go through, like, some type of check where they make sure they're not ripping something else off?

160
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were TurboGrafx games that were almost complete Zelda rip-offs.

161
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,385
[SPEAKER_02]: The Newtopia series.

162
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different enough to where it's not Zelda, but it's Zelda, okay?

163
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously a top-down Zelda game, which is all right.

164
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:01,829
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got a point, though.

165
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,830
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever played Newtopia, it's a lot like Zelda 2.

166
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were a lot of games in that era that were kind of like that.

167
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:13,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And then speaking of rip-offs of games, there was a Mario Kart rip-off on there as well called Wacky Karts that I tried playing.

168
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:16,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was less wacky, more bland.

169
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played that for a little bit.

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It was alright, I guess.

171
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:27,345
[SPEAKER_06]: But the one game I did play a demo of that was really awesome and will be coming out in a few weeks here is Wet.

172
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

173
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:52,753
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one scene that you play in the demo where you're on, like, cars on a freeway, you know, with traffic and everything.

174
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:58,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's just cars flying through the air and you're jumping from car to car and shooting people in slow motion.

175
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's awesome.

176
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:02,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real fun action-packed game.

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So, one that kind of wasn't really on my radar.

178
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I like the poster for it.

179
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:12,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I'm actually thinking about picking it up because it was pretty sweet.

180
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely check out the demo.

181
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on live, so check it out.

182
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:21,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it may be on the PlayStation... I'm not sure if it's on the PlayStation 3 network yet, but it will be soon.

183
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:25,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's it.

184
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I really played.

185
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,240
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:54,519
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

187
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Launching from Home

188
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:52,842
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really the first one I can think of that's really... Well, I know they do it for Resident Evil 5, and I think there's another game at home that they do it for, too.

189
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is the first one that's really easy to test because you can do it with demos.

190
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just kind of stinks.

191
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

192
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:05,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that... You know, if this is supposed to compete with Xbox Live and launching games out of parties and stuff, no.

193
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't... It's very, very slow.

194
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd fail.

195
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:09,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

196
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:10,932
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did have... You know, I...

197
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,273
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

198
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:30,523
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

199
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:51,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put another tweet out when I'm home, either later tonight or tomorrow, and say, give me your names.

200
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:53,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can come visit the OLR club.

201
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I did do a little decorating.

202
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:59,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually plopped down some of the things that I got in the Namco games.

203
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,391
[SPEAKER_07]: All the arcade machines are in our club.

204
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was putting messages on the bulletin board.

205
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to make it not so plain so that people actually want to visit it.

206
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:10,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe during the show one night or something, we can have it up here in studio somehow.

207
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be kind of fun.

208
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,360
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being interior virtual decorator.

209
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

210
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:22,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we here at Orange Launch Radio, over the past seven years, we try to be on top of every new interactive technology.

211
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,889
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our taglines we say here is where every gamer has a voice.

212
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:28,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So when Skype came out, we tried to get on Skype.

213
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,172
[SPEAKER_07]: When Twitter came out, we tried to get on Twitter.

214
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that Home's been out, we're trying to just...

215
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,155
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

216
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,311
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

217
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,156
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

218
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:32,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, they didn't play a lot of new games.

219
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still waiting for ION this month.

220
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a big game.

221
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,617
[SPEAKER_07]: My Xbox 360 is still out of commission.

222
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got a really interesting email today that I need to follow up on.

223
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Because apparently, OLR has listeners in all sorts of interesting places.

224
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,359
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I found out today.

225
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knew?

226
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So more on that next week.

227
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,680
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully I'll have an Xbox 360 back very soon.

228
00:15:55,322 --> 00:16:05,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the chatroom for some comments, Bochikawa in chat says, I checked out home when I got my PS3 and never went back.

229
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth taking a peek.

230
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:11,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you haven't been there in months, you're going to find a lot of really interesting stuff.

231
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Namco Arcade is really cool looking, too.

232
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:19,773
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a whole little zone for the Namco Arcade where they have all the different machines set up.

233
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of feels like an old 80s arcade, so it's kind of cute.

234
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:28,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Loki is pimping out his Loki Arcade Cabinet Fund in chat.

235
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,598
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this all about, Loki?

236
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:30,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about it.

237
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:35,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just where people can donate money so I can finance the cabinet because it's expensive.

238
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I see, so it's basically give me money.

239
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's pretty much... PayPal me money.

240
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:41,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, fair enough.

241
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, also in chat...

242
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:50,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Iannami says, I'm not sure if I want a PS3 Slim.

243
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, $300 for a PS3?

244
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:55,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah, but does it have enough good exclusives?

245
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, yeah, it has Blu-ray, but I see no point in it because I don't have an HDTV.

246
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:00,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point.

247
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you don't have an HDTV, Blu-ray doesn't really give you a whole lot.

248
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:08,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say plop down to $300 and get a decent HDTV.

249
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:09,713
[SPEAKER_07]: They're starting to come down in price.

250
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:14,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, be careful because a lot of these cheap HDTVs only are capable of 720p.

251
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:19,837
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get a good Blu-ray player now for about $100 and something.

252
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:25,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I think especially in the holiday season this year, you're going to see these HDTVDs and Blu-ray players big time.

253
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Price reductions.

254
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye out for that.

255
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Just remember, the longer you wait, the cheaper they'll get.

256
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

257
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:35,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.

258
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's one other thing I forgot to mention.

259
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.

260
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:40,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really anything I played, but I saw it on the indie games.

261
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:48,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely check out all the Japanese games, or Japanese named games, because obviously they're from Japanese companies.

262
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:50,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But they had one on there that was a sequel to Dodgeball.

263
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:52,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the old NES Dodgeball game?

264
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:52,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

265
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw one of those on DS.

266
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,998
[SPEAKER_03]: We reviewed that as one of the Kunio games, too.

267
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw a copy of that on DS when I was at shopping this week.

268
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have something very similar to that on the indie games, and it was pretty cheap.

269
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they have some good shmups on there.

270
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a bunch of stuff.

271
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, the indie games are worth checking out.

272
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:14,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's new stuff coming on there every day, and the rating system works really well now.

273
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:16,823
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know.

274
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, I'm interested in the Japanese games because there's a lot of interesting stuff on there.

275
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:22,632
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

276
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we get into gaming news.

277
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:27,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Housekeeping.

278
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually do have something to pimp this week.

279
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:35,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Our friends at the podcast, The Ultimate Quest, located at ultimatequest.net, invited me on their show this week.

280
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,679
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a little bit of a roundtable talking about MMOs.

281
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out.

282
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:39,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be episode 85.

283
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be wrong.

284
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Check that out, though, at ultimatequest.net.

285
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a roundtable.

286
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't just me, but...

287
00:18:46,943 --> 00:19:14,160
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody I run into at a lot of the industry shows I go to, Ninja Sista from Electric Sista Hood was on and her co-host Panda was also on the show and I don't remember his online name but I know his name was Wes and he was from the Control Point which is a Team Fortress 2 podcast but it's part of a larger network that unfortunately I forgot the name of but I know they had like a WoW podcast and stuff because he knew his stuff when it came to MMOs so we were talking a little bit about MMOs but it also got into other subjects like I know we were talking about actually Sony Home for a

288
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:21,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, it's all hosted by Xenocore, who calls into this show once in a while.

289
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out.

290
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be out this week at some point.

291
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:26,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not there right now, but I'm sure it'll be out during the week.

292
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, of course, we always want to pimp the ways you can follow us online.

293
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:31,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our Twitter at OLR.

294
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,575
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our Facebook at OL Army.

295
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:34,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Just search for that.

296
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, our Facebook at username Orange Lounge.

297
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have a MySpace we check like once a month.

298
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

299
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So be on the lookout for that.

300
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:00,718
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:44,293
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course the arcade is still going to be at $199 and the pro to kind of clear it out dropped down to $249 but once they're gone you know they're gone so I don't know it's always good to drop the prices of those and you know at least not a bad system but I guess if you don't want you know a black system then

302
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,103
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slight bit of deception in this price drop, though, is that they removed the cables.

303
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:55,226
[SPEAKER_07]: The HDMI cable, I think, used to come with the Elite.

304
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it came with a component, too.

305
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:58,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be wrong.

306
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:01,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But those component cables, dude, those are like proprietary by Microsoft.

307
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can get an HDMI cable cheap.

308
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:13,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But if your TV only has one HDMI port currently occupied by your PS3 like mine does or, you know, what have you, and you want to hook up through component cables, those component cables are like $40.

309
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:15,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And they took those out.

310
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they may have dropped the price by $100, but they also dropped the value by $40.

311
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:25,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But their excuse is that they're offering the same thing that Sony is.

312
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:30,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony, in all their excuses, no matter what, it's always been just the standard AV cables.

313
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:32,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suppose that's fair.

314
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:35,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, we do need to look at both sides of it.

315
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:39,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that, you know, yeah, the Xbox 360 is dropping in price, but it's not quite what it was.

316
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

317
00:21:41,559 --> 00:22:11,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're both guilty of it look at Sony, oh they dropped the system price oh but they removed backwards compatibility or oh we dropped the system price and now we removed some USB ports or we removed this or that I don't know they're all guilty of it and yeah you can probably find cheap third party cables for a lot less than you know maybe for Playstation 3 but I don't know about Xbox 360 they've got like universal cables I thought they were proprietary on that

318
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:12,129
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

319
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:12,550
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

320
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,110
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

321
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:27,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The HDMI stuff, you can use just a straight HDMI cable, but if you want your audio to go out not over the HDMI and you want it to go out either optical or just stereo RCA, you've got to have their proprietary cable.

322
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:39,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, you have to have their proprietary cable just because if you were to plug in another AV cable or whatever, it happens to block the HDMI port or something like that.

323
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:40,248
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a little fat.

324
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:40,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

325
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:43,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

326
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think they waited so long to announce this price drop officially?

327
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:06,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we kind of knew this was coming for two weeks based on all the rumors and leaked marketing.

328
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:10,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, was it timed to compete directly with the PS3 Slim?

329
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably to take some thunder out of their announcement.

330
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:17,605
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like, oh, the PlayStation's $299.

331
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:22,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Xbox has been $299, and now the better one's $299.

332
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can basically buy either system with very similar specs.

333
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and now it's just the games that kind of decide it.

334
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, with the games, you know, the 360 has a larger catalog anyways.

335
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, kind of one thing I want to ask, though, is the PS3 commercial.

336
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen the new Slim TV commercial?

337
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:54,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

338
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, it does everything.

339
00:23:56,717 --> 00:24:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that was in it, there was the one that was about the price drop or whatever.

340
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:05,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy, I recognize him from another commercial, but I can't think of what it was.

341
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:08,486
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's been in some other funny commercials like that.

342
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:10,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was pretty little tongue-in-cheek there.

343
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:14,871
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks like one of those dudes that would be in a movie with Seth Rogen.

344
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:16,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what it looked like to me.

345
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:24,389
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I like how they're saying, I heard a rumor that it's going to drop to $2.99.

346
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,050
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have to say about this?

347
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:27,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you're talking about.

348
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:31,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was kind of funny the way they kind of did that.

349
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:36,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously the slim rumor has been around forever, and it only turned out to be true.

350
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a funny way they did it.

351
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Most console rumors end up turning out to be true.

352
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:44,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we'll have more to go into that later.

353
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,802
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru in chat says, PS3, it does everything except play PS2 games.

354
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But it plays PS1 games just fine.

355
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:54,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it print money?

356
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:55,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

357
00:24:55,565 --> 00:25:04,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a real hard time buying the argument of, well, PS3s don't play PS2 games because you can just go get a PS2 to play them on.

358
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then why do they play PS1 games?

359
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

360
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was like the Metal Gear Solid 80 gig systems.

361
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only a limited amount that were playable, but it had one of the two chips that were in there.

362
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It just emulated the other chip.

363
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:41,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can't do full emulation, but if they decided, hey, we're going to bring back that one chip again, then yeah, you could do it.

364
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not going to because that cuts down the cost of their system.

365
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:55,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on to talking about something Xbox and of course one of the features that's coming to Xbox pretty soon, Twitter and of course Facebook.

366
00:25:56,892 --> 00:26:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I guess there was a little like press release that came out about the price cut and there was kind of a little footnote tucked away in it that mentioned that

367
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:06,598
[SPEAKER_07]: An Xbox Live Gold membership is going to be required for Twitter and Facebook.

368
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:11,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently it is not going to be something that is going to be included as part of the basic Silver package.

369
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:26,264
[SPEAKER_07]: But in an interview with Joystick, or I guess maybe a clarification to Joystick, that's with a Q of course, the gaming blog, a Microsoft representative said to them that Facebook and Twitter on Xbox Live will be free to Gold members with a free trial period available for Silver members.

370
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:32,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not quite understanding what the point of Twitter and Facebook is on Xbox.

371
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have to see it in action.

372
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,322
[SPEAKER_07]: But essentially, if it's just me viewing Twitter updates on my Xbox 360, dude, that's just like using the web.

373
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:43,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And why do I need to pay for gold to have that?

374
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:43,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little silly.

375
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Same reason we have it on our phones.

376
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:49,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if you've already got gold access, it's really a moot point.

377
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not something I would want to use on my Xbox.

378
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have my phone.

379
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:55,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have my computer.

380
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:59,051
[SPEAKER_07]: This just seems like more ammunition for the Sony fanboys.

381
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:11,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the whole thing with Twitter and Facebook, or at least with Facebook, is that you can upload, well, starting soon with games supporting it, you can upload screen caps of you beating certain levels or getting achievements or something like that.

382
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So more crap to spam your Facebook with, basically.

383
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that kind of what the DSi does?

384
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:18,482
[SPEAKER_07]: You can upload the photos from your DSi?

385
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:21,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of interacts like a mobile phone does with Facebook.

386
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is going to be a little bit more game-related, though.

387
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:25,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone with Raptor!

388
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:26,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care!

389
00:27:54,807 --> 00:28:04,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't really... I mean, I guess some people are interested or some people think what they're playing is so important that they have to show everybody every little thing that they've done.

390
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if I saw something funny happen in a game, then I might put a picture up.

391
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when would I put those Blue Dragon pictures up?

392
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:16,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, two months ago when I was up all night bored?

393
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one thing.

394
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's with people who are like, oh, I played this.

395
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm uploading every day, every day, every day, every day.

396
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

397
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:32,109
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'm just really worried that we are going to get nothing but spam tweets and Facebook status of what people are playing.

398
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:33,770
[SPEAKER_07]: If so, then that will be suck.

399
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I kind of agree because Twitter is already kind of ruined for me as it is.

400
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't really like to check Twitter.

401
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:42,293
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too much.

402
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't... Like...

403
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:46,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

404
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:51,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to use TweetDeck so that there's filters, but even then it will only go so far back.

405
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:55,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm only able to check Twitter once a day, I feel like I kind of lose what everybody's up to.

406
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really starting to just not like Twitter.

407
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it got too big too fast.

408
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Friendster.

409
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to go the way of Friendster, where it just starts crapping out too much.

410
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:08,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I never use Friendster.

411
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:10,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but do you remember Friendster?

412
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:17,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to be Facebook and MySpace, but it started crashing every day, and it was down for weeks at a time, so everybody abandoned it for MySpace.

413
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I looked at it and went, it was kind of, I like Facebook, really.

414
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:23,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like Facebook.

415
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to ignore shit on Facebook.

416
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:31,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one thing I love about Facebook is that if there is an app that's publishing things that you don't want to see, ignore, and you never see it again.

417
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:31,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

418
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope with the 360 and the Wii, if it does start publishing those types of updates, you can block those as easily.

419
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:45,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Because unfortunately, Facebook is turning into Twitter, but it's almost getting worse because of all these quiz updates and things.

420
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I may be just as guilty as the next guy, but if you don't check that stuff...

421
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:57,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook is like Rapid Fire Live Journal is really what it is.

422
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was using Facebook for things, you know, like my family's on Facebook, so I actually more or less, it's how I, I put a little bit more important things there so I can keep in touch with my family.

423
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:25,596
[SPEAKER_02]: My Twitter is more like, just how I, it's more for networking now in a lot of the circles that I'm in, you know, for, I use it as a communication tool for people who don't text, you know, because it comes to my phone.

424
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I only use Twitter for the networking aspect of it at this point.

425
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:33,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that most of my personal status updates I'm putting on Facebook.

426
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my live journal again.

427
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:46,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, I can't get into the in-depth thoughts on really deal with my day on Twitter and Facebook the way I can on LiveJournal.

428
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:51,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of sad to see lots of people abandoning LiveJournal for Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff.

429
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got that permanent account and it was a gift and I'm going to damn well use it.

430
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:55,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.

431
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And people warn me that LiveJournal wouldn't be around forever, but at the same time I say, look...

432
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:04,362
[SPEAKER_07]: If it were not for LiveJournal, the show probably would not exist.

433
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's pretty much a given.

434
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:09,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not have met some of the friends that I have in real life.

435
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:16,367
[SPEAKER_07]: My current roommate, one of my best friends, and a couple other of my best friends, I would never have met if it wasn't for LiveJournal.

436
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:20,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that website has had a profound impact on my life.

437
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be a different individual.

438
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:26,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And call me a nerd, call me a dork, whatever you want to call me, for saying that about a website.

439
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

440
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:29,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's true.

441
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:30,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

442
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

443
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:59,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to go to the biggest, baddest, newest thing, but I honestly still think that LiveJournal is remaining a staple for a lot of people.

444
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:09,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Facebook has enough in terms of diverse things to do that it's going to have some staying power.

445
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook also has games, which I find interesting.

446
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:27,128
[SPEAKER_07]: One topic, I think we got into it on Bobby's show a little bit last week, and I can't remember if we got into it on our own show, but I was talking about how Facebook casual games are the future of casual gaming because they're casual MMOs, a lot of these that are coming up.

447
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:30,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Games like The Mafia, The Mobsters, The Sorority Life, The Farmville.

448
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:31,592
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I hate.

449
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my pet society.

450
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:58,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd play that.

451
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be interesting if those could somehow come to Xbox 360, but I don't think that's possible, obviously.

452
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, maybe that's part of the deal, actually, getting the Facebook on is you get the apps with it.

453
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:09,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

454
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Ranma in chat says, Yeah, but Rob, that's not the big reason why people are leaving LJ.

455
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:19,328
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't like the new draconian rules and regulations brought in, thus the exodus.

456
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,152
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules on LiveJournal have never once affected me.

457
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Same here.

458
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:25,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm blogging about my life.

459
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,760
[SPEAKER_07]: That has never been something impacted by the LiveJournal rules.

460
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I think...

461
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:36,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I think, especially live journalers, and boy am I getting off subject, but I don't care tonight.

462
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:42,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I think live journals, almost more than anyone, want to start drama over everything.

463
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:46,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes they're making a big fuss about nothing.

464
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:50,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember when they banned all those accounts because they were getting into...

465
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:51,997
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

466
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that some of it they did take out of context, which is really the big thing that you run into anytime you bring in a corporate entity.

467
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:31,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people will just look for reasons to be offended.

468
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:34,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know how I feel about that.

469
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that because they do have a legal responsibility to protect, I think that they were justified in their actions.

470
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:53,857
[SPEAKER_07]: They just needed to learn the difference between a Harry Potter fanfic and what was legitimately bad, naughty stuff.

471
00:34:54,197 --> 00:35:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it would have been better if they had taken more time or had better filtering in place.

472
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do kind of like that now it's like if you're going if you're not logged in and then it'll ask you right up front it will let you look at certain things if you're underage if it suspects you of being underage

473
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:31,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't like how everybody was so quick to abandon LiveJournal for other just clones, rip-offs of LiveJournal, which, you know, LiveJournal was always open source, so it was very easy to make the rip-offs of, because it was always about the community.

474
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:37,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the community branches off in all these directions, it's exactly what happened to my old WoW guild.

475
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:48,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody started abandoning it because everybody wanted to get something else out of the game, and some people went over here, some people went over here, some people went over here, and the game got ruined for everybody because the community was gone.

476
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:50,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

477
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe I'm going to take some shit for this comment, but some people got a little selfish, and it ruined the community.

478
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:59,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, in the sense, that's kind of what happened to LiveJournal in some sense.

479
00:35:59,446 --> 00:36:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of those people that abandoned it for other sites got selfish.

480
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:06,254
[SPEAKER_07]: But give me shit for that comment if you want.

481
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:08,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I honestly feel, so too bad.

482
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:11,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

483
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:15,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But every time I feel like LiveJournal's dying, I just load up, oh no, they didn't.

484
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm always like, oh, okay, there's still tons of people on LiveJournal.

485
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a new member, by the way, to our cast who wants to comment on this.

486
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,131
[SPEAKER_07]: What in the hell is that?

487
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:27,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Tribble.

488
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:29,472
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Angus.

489
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:35,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we don't have the ferret in this studio, I suppose Angus will have to do Angus the Tribble.

490
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:36,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Angus the Tribble.

491
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:36,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

492
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,888
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

493
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:06,526
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

494
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,758
[SPEAKER_02]: We're Orange Tangent Radio.

495
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:38,443
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, though, in more Xbox news, on the Amazon German site, there was a listing for 250 gigabyte Xbox 360 Elite that was promptly yanked right after it posts.

496
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:41,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for €297.99.

497
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,067
[SPEAKER_02]: and had two wireless controls.

498
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:54,511
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a copy of Forza Motorsport 3 which is coming out in October.

499
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:12,704
[SPEAKER_02]: We know about the price cut so this could be something that they're going to do to produce more money to put in a bit more profit but there's no comment from Microsoft yet.

500
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:19,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think like most rumors, this one's going to inevitably prove true as well.

501
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:38,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of funny, too, because in South Africa, apparently the website xboxgaming.co.za also had another Elite console bundle with also two wireless controllers and a 250 gigabyte hard drive as well.

502
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

503
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:46,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I think these are probably inevitable for Christmas.

504
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:51,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, these big bundles that come with lots of games and lots of storage, I think it's the Christmas.

505
00:38:52,073 --> 00:38:53,534
[SPEAKER_07]: It's setting the stage for the holiday season.

506
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:54,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.

507
00:38:55,455 --> 00:39:04,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's inevitable you're going to see these larger drives come out, especially what's funny, if those rumors about the PS3 Slim with the 250 gigabytes are true, this is just right on par with that.

508
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:05,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

509
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's, you know, aware of what everyone else is doing, and so why not?

510
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:09,546
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

511
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:38,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And sell it for like $150 and you would make just tons and tons and tons and tons of money.

512
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: What, just like call it the red light special or something?

513
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Just big brick of porn or something.

514
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:46,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just sell like crazy.

515
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:47,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Big brick of porn.

516
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

517
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something that's being offered, well...

518
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy

519
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:15,718
[SPEAKER_06]: How about a good game?

520
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:17,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Infamous is a good game, so is Killzone 2.

521
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they've been out for a little bit.

522
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:42,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, you probably have a lot of people who already own all those games.

523
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:51,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, they don't have a lot of games coming out that are made by Sony that are brand new, so this is going to have to do for now.

524
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's no Uncharted 2 yet.

525
00:40:54,678 --> 00:40:54,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

526
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of funny though.

527
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:00,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are they letting people get away with that?

528
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:06,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So people bring in their PS3s and say... Because they have a 30-day return policy or whatever, and they can go... For any reason?

529
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:07,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

530
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:08,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, yeah.

531
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:11,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then I guess it sucks to be them for putting up that reason in the first place.

532
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have a clause in there.

533
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's because probably people are pissed off that they just bought it.

534
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew that the price drop was coming.

535
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:31,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we kind of all knew that the price drop was coming, but essentially they may have known that the price drop was coming, and now that it has, you know, they just sold the console to a guy for $100 more for, you know,

536
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:39,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Be mad at Sony, or be mad at yourself for not paying more attention to what's going on, because we all knew this was coming for months.

537
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:40,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

538
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:41,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Be an informed buyer.

539
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,578
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

540
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

541
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:48,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would be able to imagine yourself kind of throwing this football and then hitting maybe a button to release the ball or something as you're throwing it.

542
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the type of controller.

543
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently this was patented with the motion and plus as a part of the football, by the way.

544
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,001
[SPEAKER_02]: How many broken TVs are we going to see?

545
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:58,981
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'd be worried about.

546
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:01,862
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently there's a big old strap on this football that you put your hand through.

547
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's supposed to prevent that.

548
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:06,163
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know some dumb kid's going to throw this through a TV.

549
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:09,144
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure they'll have all the safety warnings and all that stuff.

550
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:10,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

551
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:12,647
[SPEAKER_06]: These are dumb.

552
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what's sad?

553
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:18,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the next real idea they come out with is going to be very dumb as well.

554
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:20,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

555
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii Vitality Sensor.

556
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:28,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just want to also say about this football real quick is that it's also supposed to be able to interpret running.

557
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:32,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's supposed to notice your body motion and so you can actually detect running.

558
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe this is for some type of full-blown...

559
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo-based football game coming out in the near future or next year's Madden.

560
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:41,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

561
00:43:41,062 --> 00:43:41,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds lame.

562
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:42,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know why?

563
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:47,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why do I need to buy another peripheral to do something that I could probably do with the remote by itself anyways?

564
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:52,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe to kind of match that feel of actually holding the football in your hand.

565
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:58,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they should try something else more innovative instead of having to create a new peripheral for every fucking game that comes out.

566
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:03,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you create some new peripherals that can be used for more stuff than just like

567
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:04,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

568
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:28,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally getting one.

569
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:51,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Go out to the Fries and Roses.

570
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,941
[SPEAKER_07]: They had shelves and shelves of them.

571
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:58,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I went down there too and I saw the Rock Revolution bundles and I'm like, I gotta see how much they were.

572
00:44:58,287 --> 00:44:59,749
[SPEAKER_07]: It was $20 on the PS3, right?

573
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But still $60 on the Xbox 360, which I thought was weird.

574
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:04,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

575
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,356
[SPEAKER_06]: $20 though for the full drum set.

576
00:45:06,376 --> 00:45:07,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, nope, still not worth it.

577
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 cents!

578
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:10,470
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'll buy it for.

579
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost picked up the game, but I still have a broken Xbox 360.

580
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:18,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it might actually be good to convert into a Drum Mania controller or something like that.

581
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:19,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, when it's 90 cents.

582
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:45,927
[SPEAKER_07]: comments from chat chat.orange.com excuse me Kevin going to Kevin tonight for some comments Bochikawa asks Wii Motion Plus can sense running can't it yeah I would think so I mean isn't that a part of the Wii Remote can sense running EA Active has running in it and Wii Fit has it and you're running in place Frisbee says Nintendo because we spread ourselves too thin

583
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:48,289
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

584
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: ZapperShell, Awful

585
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:30,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take the perfect shot any day.

586
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:37,028
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru in chat says, just watch, this will be included in Super Mario Football and it will sell millions.

587
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what they do.

588
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:48,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I don't want to hear any fucking bitching when they're complaining that they can't figure out why the hardcore gamer doesn't want anything to do with them.

589
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:01,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Next console cycle.

590
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:04,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they not want to play our games?

591
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:09,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like we're focusing only on children's games like we did at the GameCube and then bitched about that too.

592
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

593
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:15,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... I don't think you need to do this stuff.

594
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make better games.

595
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:23,171
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, a comment in chat made me think to remind for our international listeners, when we are talking about football, we're talking about American football.

596
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:24,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Not football as the rest of the world knows it.

597
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:25,352
[SPEAKER_02]: As in crap.

598
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:25,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

599
00:47:26,854 --> 00:47:29,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in chat says Nintendo, play Mario's dick with new dick peripheral.

600
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:30,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not family friendly, you see.

601
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:31,056
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why that wouldn't happen.

602
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:32,297
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not for the whole family.

603
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:58,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It is fun for Mario.

604
00:47:58,215 --> 00:48:01,117
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii Vitality Sensor for old people.

605
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:02,218
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're going to put on it.

606
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:03,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be the slogan.

607
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:05,120
[SPEAKER_06]: In the pack-in game, you're going to die soon.

608
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:11,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be like that banner ad you always see on the internet.

609
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:13,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, click to find out when you will die.

610
00:48:14,066 --> 00:48:15,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you put your mouse over it.

611
00:48:15,147 --> 00:48:16,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It says 666 and all this.

612
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:17,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever seen that ad?

613
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:18,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

614
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:19,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it on MySpace once.

615
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It just cracked me up.

616
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's why I don't go to MySpace.

617
00:48:22,452 --> 00:48:24,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would somebody click on that, really?

618
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:25,629
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

619
00:48:52,698 --> 00:48:58,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say once I saw one with OJ Simpson and as she moved the mouse he was wielding a knife and it was so wrong.

620
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:04,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But really funny and I still remember it to this day which I guess is what advertising is all about.

621
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I just don't remember what product it was for.

622
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:09,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Win a free Xbox.

623
00:49:09,943 --> 00:49:11,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It was for ShamWow.

624
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:13,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, ShamWow.

625
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:14,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

626
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:16,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got release dates coming up but first another story.

627
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:20,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um... There's actually something to be in next week's.

628
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Famitsu is a game called Okamiden.

629
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:31,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Which, um... It actually was, uh... Put out for the Japanese 7-Eleven website.

630
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:34,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a Capcom trademark.

631
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um... They mentioned it in 2chan.

632
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:41,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh... Now everyone's talking about it.

633
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rumor is that it's a sequel to Okami.

634
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:45,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

635
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:57,707
[SPEAKER_02]: What it's looking like is it could either be Okami Gaiden or Okami Densetsu, which would be either Okami Side Story or Okami Legend.

636
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:00,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

637
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not surprised.

638
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:04,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Okami was a pretty critically praised game.

639
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:08,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how it did sales-wise, but I think it did okay.

640
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:12,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly as well as other games that get sequels made of them.

641
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But Capcom broke with Clover Studios.

642
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,024
[SPEAKER_07]: SILENT HILL SILENT HILL

643
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:49,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, well, next week actually got some pretty decent stuff coming out.

644
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:55,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting off with, of course, Guitar Hero 5, which will be coming out on the 1st.

645
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:59,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be on PlayStation 2, PS3, Wii, and 360.

646
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:08,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you buy your copy during the month of September, you will also get a free copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen if you remember to register it online by the end of October.

647
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:17,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out will be Command & Conquer Red Alert Commander's Challenge on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this week.

648
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and 360 Although if I remember correctly I think that's actually the week after I think that day is wrong Section 8 on PC and Xbox 360 this week Soul Calibur Broken Destiny on PSP Seven Wonders 2 on DS and Champions Online on PC

649
00:51:41,457 --> 00:51:49,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Also another Xbox, or actually I think this is on both Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine.

650
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:54,691
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually build up some of your players for the new NBA game.

651
00:51:55,232 --> 00:52:00,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fate Unlimited Codes on PSP, which is a digital download only title.

652
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those are the big ones for this week.

653
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:11,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I do need to get my 360 fixed soon because I do want to pick up Guitar Hero 5 just because I like the song list in it.

654
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, what the hell?

655
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I may not be the biggest Van Halen fan, but hey, free game?

656
00:52:16,871 --> 00:52:18,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to ignore, right?

657
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:18,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

658
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot some other ones here.

659
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:23,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Warriors of Rochi 2 on PSP was coming out as well.

660
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

661
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Warriors Orochi 2

662
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:45,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

663
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely looks kind of interesting.

664
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: A game coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week, Sweet Honey Coming is the name of the game.

665
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:16,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That's C-O-M-I-N-G.

666
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:21,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks kind of like a date sim game because there's all these girls and practically upskirt shots of some of them.

667
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:22,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure that's the

668
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:25,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I remember correctly, I believe I saw an article on this on Kotaku, and they've actually...

669
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Warrior's Orochi 2

670
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:16,701
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

671
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,324
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your Japanese release dates for the week.

672
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:20,269
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a trip to the UK, DarkSakura?

673
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:27,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what we have coming up on the second is Defense Grid The Awakening, and then a bunch of stuff on the fourth.

674
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Champions Online, Cursed Mountain, Dissidia Final Fantasy, Guilty Gear 2 Overture, IL2's Stromovic Birds of Prey, Metroid Prime Trilogy, The Humans, and Warriors Orochi 2 on PSP.

675
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:49,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

676
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:08,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just going to keep going.

677
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:10,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this year, everybody's afraid of Modern Warfare 2.

678
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Why, I don't know.

679
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:16,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a lot of games that normally come out in November that are coming out early.

680
00:55:16,448 --> 00:55:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 is coming out at the end of October instead of the middle of November.

681
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,174
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of things are actually crammed in there.

682
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, especially next week with, like...

683
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:28,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Dirt 2 Mini Ninjas Rock Band Information

684
00:55:49,454 --> 00:56:16,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Including, you may remember we talked about the Rock Band Network How you can, well first off they're going to have some original content coming to there as well But another update that's supposedly going to be coming soon, I guess this November Is they're going to allow demos of songs that are available on their actual store Which is pretty cool, you get 30 second playable samples that you can check out And um

685
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:19,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's pretty sweet.

686
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:39,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rock Band Network Store will be coming to the PlayStation 3 as well, however not to the Wii.

687
00:56:58,096 --> 00:57:23,585
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know as of right now though the development tools to put songs on the actual Rock Band Network are only available through the XNA program but they are going to pick select songs from that Rock Band Network and actually put them on to the PlayStation 3 so basically the PlayStation 3 will kind of have the greatest hits of the Rock Band Network whereas you know the 360 will still have the bulk of the songs

688
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,721
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

689
00:57:43,621 --> 00:57:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, apparently what's involved with it says, not every song on the Rock Band Network will be available for PlayStation 3 owners.

690
00:57:51,664 --> 00:57:59,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The option to bring over a song to the PS3 version of the store will be offered at Harmonix's discretion, and even then it will be an opt-in.

691
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:07,989
[SPEAKER_06]: The artists have to do some paperwork to properly port their songs to the PlayStation Network, a process that Harmonix believes no one will refuse.

692
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:08,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more revenue.

693
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

694
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:14,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so excited, by the way, about Rock Band Beatles, can I just say?

695
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:15,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so looking forward to this game.

696
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the demo that they had at Fry's?

697
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:17,971
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

698
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:18,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

699
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,212
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't see the demo at Fry's.

700
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have the demo at Fry's.

701
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they really?

702
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:22,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed it.

703
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:25,475
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I saw some other demos, but not of Rock Band Beatles.

704
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:27,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a Rock Band demo, but it wasn't the Beatles.

705
00:58:27,596 --> 00:58:28,357
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some kid playing it.

706
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:28,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

707
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:30,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they actually had Rock Band Beatles.

708
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:34,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why, I'm just really excited about it, even though I'm not a huge Beatles fan.

709
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:38,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, certainly I respect them and they have a lot of great songs.

710
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't consider myself a rabid Beatles fan, you know what I mean?

711
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think this game is going to be so cool.

712
00:58:44,635 --> 00:58:47,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, what a tribute to...

713
00:58:48,627 --> 00:59:13,008
[SPEAKER_07]: what they're doing over there with this game that it's making a whole new generation I mean obviously I'm a little older than most people that probably listen to this show but I would say a lot of the you know college kids that listen to this show are probably excited about this too what a testament to that that you know Rock Band's making people excited about the freaking Beatles all over again I think it's neat I agree so I'm looking forward to it you know I'm gonna get it oh yeah

714
00:59:14,212 --> 00:59:18,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have a rock star party one night and get our Beatles on.

715
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:18,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be fun.

716
00:59:18,796 --> 00:59:19,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

717
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:30,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, hey, but if you don't want to play music games, one thing you can do with your 360 or PS3 or soon the Nintendo Wii is this new service called Play On.

718
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:31,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually already on the 360 and the PS3.

719
00:59:32,828 --> 00:59:35,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently the service is about to be going into beta for the Wii.

720
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:41,430
[SPEAKER_07]: This service will actually stream both Netflix and Hulu to your Wii.

721
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically builds a bridge between your computer and your Nintendo Wii.

722
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:53,134
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, it's a way to get these services on your television if all you have is a Wii.

723
00:59:53,294 --> 00:59:58,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a 14-day free trial, but after that you have to pay $40 if you want to keep the service.

724
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:01,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Themediamall.com is where you can pick this up.

725
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Diversity already did that for free.

726
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:10,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at least, I'm not sure about the Netflix, but I know, I think you can stream Hulu with, um, Diversity.

727
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:14,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Diversity for a little while, but it was kind of hard to figure out.

728
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I use it all the time for our, we watched, um, a Riff Trax movie on that the other day.

729
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:20,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

730
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Prisoner of Azkaban.

731
01:00:21,258 --> 01:00:21,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

732
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, yeah, we use it for streaming movies and pornography all the time.

733
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:24,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha!

734
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: G4, I think it does Hulu, and then some other stuff.

735
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,040
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's free, so I would try the free solution first if that doesn't work out for you.

736
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:57,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't checked that out.

737
01:00:57,188 --> 01:01:00,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I haven't looked at Diversity in a year and a half, so maybe that's why.

738
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:01,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love it.

739
01:01:01,932 --> 01:01:02,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It works pretty good.

740
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:08,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'd be definitely curious to check that out, but of course you can't get that on the Wii.

741
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:10,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it does work on the Wii, actually.

742
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:11,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

743
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done through a web interface or something.

744
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it did.

745
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be completely wrong because I don't ever use it on the Wii.

746
01:01:16,662 --> 01:01:17,783
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Wii can't do high def.

747
01:01:17,843 --> 01:01:19,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it stream high def if it's available?

748
01:01:19,644 --> 01:01:21,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it can stream high def for standard definition.

749
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:22,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been watching high def porn?

750
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:49,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I tend not to download the high def stuff because the file size is larger and it takes a lot longer so no but we have streamed high def movies over on it and it works pretty well of course you know Wi-Fi probably wouldn't work well with high def and definitely not on the Wii alright well we're just about to the end of part A tonight of our show there's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio still to come but of course we can't say goodbye to part A tonight without the classic game of the week

751
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:51,655
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

752
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's classic game is a little shooter called Robo Aleste.

753
01:02:26,902 --> 01:02:29,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone else knows this game.

754
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:38,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, um, it was a Sega CD game, and it's actually, it really is a fun game.

755
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:41,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It was put out by Tengen in 1992, um, in Japan, 93 in America.

756
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:42,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

757
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like feudal Japan having giant mecha.

758
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: is pretty much the story of the game.

759
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the pilots is fighting against the other feudal lords.

760
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:10,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And you play someone named Kage, who is one of Nobunaga's robot ninja army.

761
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:17,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're flying the Aleste, which is a big robot with a gun who looks very much like samurai armor.

762
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:21,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, pretty...

763
01:03:22,213 --> 01:03:24,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a weird storyline, but it's pretty funny.

764
01:03:24,574 --> 01:03:27,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in Japan, by the way, it was called Denin Aleste.

765
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's one of those vertical shooters.

766
01:03:32,257 --> 01:03:39,040
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your enemies coming forward and behind you and to the side, and you have a boss, and yeah, shooter.

767
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you've got different kind of weapons.

768
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:45,743
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Reisenha, which is a lightning attack.

769
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:46,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You have...

770
01:03:47,363 --> 01:03:52,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Husha Shuriken, which is like big stars.

771
01:03:54,646 --> 01:04:03,409
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hiei Meppujin, which is also called the Flying Shadow Formation, so you can have options that fly up in front of you.

772
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:07,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Bakuryu Hosenka, which is Exploding Flower.

773
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like little bombs going out.

774
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty cool little game.

775
01:04:11,632 --> 01:04:14,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not really much else to say, it's just a shooter.

776
01:04:15,513 --> 01:04:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's fun.

777
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:21,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and by the way, it was developed by Compile, so it's in that family.

778
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:21,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

779
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:26,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool game, what do you think?

780
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, it sounds kind of fun.

781
01:04:27,902 --> 01:04:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at this, it looks like a fun little shooter.

782
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:35,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost looks widescreen to me.

783
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:36,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's just the way they capture it.

784
01:04:36,428 --> 01:04:40,311
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I guess this is kind of a standard size, but... Kind of interesting.

785
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:42,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously they didn't make games on widescreen back then, but...

786
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:47,034
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they occasionally did make some shooters where you could turn your TV sideways.

787
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you do that?

788
01:04:49,395 --> 01:04:50,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that dangerous for your TV?

789
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:53,037
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think about how shooters are built?

790
01:04:55,038 --> 01:05:05,603
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually quite a number of games that are made with the monitor being in the top of the cabinet and using a mirror.

791
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:07,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game will play reverse.

792
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:11,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mirror will show it right side.

793
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:12,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've seen one of those before, yeah.

794
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's done a lot of times for purposes of getting the right kind of screen shape.

795
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:25,039
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Wait, are you saying Feudal Japan didn't have mechas?

796
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,941
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Feudal Japan did not have mechas.

797
01:05:28,302 --> 01:05:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have giant enemy crabs.

798
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:32,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Frisbee just asked, or giant enemy crabs.

799
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:33,566
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

800
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:36,629
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a movie I saw that had giant enemy crabs set in Japan.

801
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:38,651
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

802
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:41,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called The House Where Evil Dwells.

803
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:46,795
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a movie that I had been looking for since I saw it when I was like 6 or 7.

804
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:51,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the early American movies that did Japanese style horror.

805
01:05:52,179 --> 01:05:54,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about these people that moved to Japan.

806
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:57,203
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is a writer and he wants inspiration.

807
01:05:57,643 --> 01:05:59,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Except they end up being possessed by ghosts who live in the house.

808
01:06:00,546 --> 01:06:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a scene where the daughter gets thrown out of a tree by a giant demon crab.

809
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:08,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what to think of this.

810
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:09,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make grunting noises at her.

811
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:13,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty, whatever you're into.

812
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:13,946
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

813
01:06:14,687 --> 01:06:18,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Robo Aleste is your classic video game of the week on the Sega CD.

814
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, you can get it in English.

815
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:27,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It is available, so check that out if you're a Sega CD owner and you want to see feudal Japan with giant enemy robots.

816
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:46,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, we've got plenty more to come in Part B, including your phone calls, your Twitter topics, and rapid-fire news, as well as we're going to be talking a little bit about Walmart and the possibility about arcades in Walmart's future, beyond just the couple of games you might see in the lobby.

817
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:51,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about all that when we come back for Part B, so stay tuned here on Orange Lounge Radio.

818
01:06:58,334 --> 01:07:11,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, August the 30th of 2009, where we, of course, tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio from 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time till, I don't know, around 9, whenever we feel like quitting.

819
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:16,145
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the great thing about being on a flexible station like All Games Radio.

820
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:25,431
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a set time limit when we have to finish, but poor Bobby, the show before us, he has to finish by 6 o'clock because that's when we're usually on, but he's flexible, too.

821
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:43,290
[SPEAKER_07]: and sadly he won't be on next week because he's going to Penny Arcade Expo and hopefully will be calling us next week from Penny Arcade Expo to give us the rundown we are all too poor to go this year actually I'm saving up to go to PAX East I don't know about my wonderful co-hosts but I know that's my goal is to get to Boston next year so we'll see I'm saving up for more pasta

822
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:44,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not traveling.

823
01:07:45,616 --> 01:07:46,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big traveler?

824
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:46,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

825
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:50,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I will represent OLR if no one else wants to.

826
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:52,077
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys can do a show without me that week.

827
01:07:52,097 --> 01:07:53,097
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be tons of fun, won't it?

828
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:53,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

829
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:59,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's get back into some more gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio.

830
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:00,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, wait, I lied.

831
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:01,840
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start with Twitter topics.

832
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,880
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start off Part B with some Twitter topics.

833
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually got us a little theme song this week.

834
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:08,321
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

835
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:10,462
[SPEAKER_07]: A little smooth jazz for your Twitter topics.

836
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:19,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off, reading some of the responses on Twitter at OLR and things you want us to talk about tonight.

837
01:08:19,981 --> 01:08:25,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Blade3 asks, laptop with fold-out panoramic screens, good for gamers, possibly 3D?

838
01:08:26,146 --> 01:08:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard of this.

839
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:28,628
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a laptop now with fold-out monitors?

840
01:08:29,008 --> 01:08:29,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, have you heard of this?

841
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:31,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, but it sounds cool.

842
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:35,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds cool, but isn't that kind of expensive?

843
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:35,193
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

844
01:08:36,214 --> 01:08:37,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It would seem kind of pointless.

845
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:38,616
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be kind of ridiculous.

846
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:43,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, a PC with panoramic monitors, I can get behind that.

847
01:08:44,861 --> 01:08:46,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft wants to know... Oh, I'm sorry.

848
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:47,723
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a plug for our show.

849
01:08:47,763 --> 01:08:48,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Actdeft.

850
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:58,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Sertour wants to know... From what I've been reading, there are certain aspects that are definitely slower.

851
01:08:59,412 --> 01:09:01,413
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, my Slim will be here Thursday.

852
01:09:01,473 --> 01:09:03,835
[SPEAKER_07]: My first new console since the NES.

853
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:04,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Game suggestions...

854
01:09:07,192 --> 01:09:12,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy some used $20 games or something It's like buying a Commando drop down price

855
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:42,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan Shadow says, OLR, the indie game PB Winterbottom is finally coming to Xbox Live after a great showing at E3 2008.

856
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:43,581
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks good.

857
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:45,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard of this, PB Winterbottom.

858
01:09:45,983 --> 01:09:46,423
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard of this?

859
01:09:46,763 --> 01:09:52,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is actually one of the games that 2K is actually publishing on Xbox Live Arcade.

860
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:56,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an independent game, but they're publishing two games that are going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

861
01:09:58,109 --> 01:09:59,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard too much about it, but it looked neat.

862
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

863
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:05,821
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on the horizon for PS3?

864
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:07,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know any other features on the horizon?

865
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:25,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they have any press conferences though at PAX.

866
01:10:50,197 --> 01:11:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the PlayStation 3 goes, there's supposed to be a lot of stuff for the 3.0 firmware upgrade, like the animated themes and the What's New portion of it.

867
01:11:05,526 --> 01:11:06,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Ayanami says, Oops, I guess I read it anyway.

868
01:11:06,507 --> 01:11:08,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the new one that they've talked about that's supposed to be coming out on Wii?

869
01:11:08,408 --> 01:11:09,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this a whole new Tetris game?

870
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:10,509
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's DS and Wii.

871
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:12,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Tetris Party or something like that.

872
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:12,710
[SPEAKER_07]: It was different.

873
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:31,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless that's what he's calling Grandmaster for.

874
01:11:31,194 --> 01:11:35,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'm getting a picture right now of what this new little dual screen laptop looks like.

875
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that looks actually kind of crappy.

876
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a bad Photoshop or something.

877
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:43,201
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awful.

878
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:46,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, one more tweet from Tigerclaw305.

879
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:50,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine sitting next to someone on a plane with that watching a movie.

880
01:11:50,665 --> 01:11:53,007
[SPEAKER_07]: God, as if the overweight people weren't bad enough.

881
01:11:53,928 --> 01:11:59,005
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw305 says Piracy protection is why PSP Go's battery isn't removable

882
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:20,205
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as not removable Apparently the whole Pandora's battery thing is the reason why the PSP Go is battery, you can't take it off Yeah, but they forget one thing No one's going to buy the PSP Go And if you really want to put homebrew and pirate stuff, you're going to buy PSP 3000 Which is also readily available for less than the PSP Go What if they stop making PSP 3000?

883
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:22,326
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to You think?

884
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:25,329
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll piss off a lot of people if they do that

885
01:12:27,059 --> 01:12:34,303
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, there's a comment right here from John Collar, the Sony Computer Entertainment Association, America's president.

886
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:38,506
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't be able to rip your games and play them on the PSP Go system.

887
01:12:38,546 --> 01:12:39,887
[SPEAKER_07]: The firmware precludes that.

888
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:43,989
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no external battery, so there's a number of protections put into place on the system.

889
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, ho, ho, ho, you're just throwing out another challenge, aren't you?

890
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:48,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stop doing that.

891
01:12:48,552 --> 01:12:51,734
[SPEAKER_06]: They really want to take it apart to get to the battery they can't.

892
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, people will take apart their systems to mod it if they really need to.

893
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:03,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And just saying that you can't do it doesn't mean it's not possible because every single firmware that you've released has been cracked immediately.

894
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's enough for Twitter topics.

895
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:10,049
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have more you want to contribute, we'll open up the Skype line a little later in the show.

896
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if we didn't get to your tweet, but we want to get to some rapid fire news.

897
01:13:14,412 --> 01:13:16,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, some quick topics to start us off tonight.

898
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Curry makes every game better.

899
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:45,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in other news, Space Invaders and Bust a Move are headed to the BlackBerry.

900
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:52,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Mainly, you see a lot of new games coming to the iPhone, but yes, it's nice to see that the BlackBerry is getting some new stuff as well.

901
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:58,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of those are going to be available, I guess, for $4.99 and feature two different control schemes.

902
01:14:00,684 --> 01:14:28,222
[SPEAKER_06]: and then finally, Peggle Nights is coming to Xbox Live Arcade via an expansion for Peggle and of course that will pretty much double the amount of levels that are available in there and will feature three new achievements worth a total of 50 Microsoft points or I guess achievement points, not Microsoft points no word yet on what the expansion is going to cost but it will be coming out sometime this fall

903
01:14:29,793 --> 01:14:30,514
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

904
01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:03,068
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a monkey, a little monkey instead of a little seahorse or whatever it was in that game.

905
01:15:03,609 --> 01:15:04,849
[SPEAKER_06]: He's much cuter than Seaman.

906
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:05,329
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

907
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:09,990
[SPEAKER_07]: N Plus is developing a new game called Scrap Metal.

908
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:12,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Slick Entertainment made N Plus.

909
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:16,672
[SPEAKER_07]: They are now making a new game called Scrap Metal that's had a little trailer released this week.

910
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:23,554
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a top-down racing game and it looks kind of like, if you remember, Super Off-Road, which is like the quintessential pizza parlor game.

911
01:15:23,614 --> 01:15:25,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or like Super Sprint or something like that.

912
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:27,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock and Roll Racing is another game that's being compared to.

913
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:28,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All those games.

914
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, a newer type of physics engine.

915
01:15:31,758 --> 01:15:36,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the track doesn't all show on the screen at once, but it looks pretty cool.

916
01:15:36,861 --> 01:15:37,922
[SPEAKER_07]: It does look really sweet.

917
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:41,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet this game will be a lot of fun to play on Xbox Live Arcade, so keep an eye out for that.

918
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:44,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, some of your Rock Band updates this week.

919
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:49,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the songs that will be coming out to Rock Band this week include The Talking Heads,

920
01:15:50,268 --> 01:15:55,933
[SPEAKER_07]: and she was Cross-Eyed and Painless, Girlfriend is Better, Once in a Lifetime and Take Me to the River.

921
01:15:56,053 --> 01:16:01,718
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those games coming out on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of Rock Band this week as well as some individual songs.

922
01:16:02,901 --> 01:16:07,625
[SPEAKER_07]: from Avenged Sevenfold, The Jam, Oasis, and Rage Against the Machine.

923
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:10,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Gorilla Radio is coming out on Rock Band.

924
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:14,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Oasis, by the way, a live song coming from them, Supersonic.

925
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently you won't be seeing Oasis live anymore as one of them threw a hissy fit as tends to happen.

926
01:16:20,636 --> 01:16:28,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like how it was said in an episode of Phineas and Ferb.

927
01:16:28,883 --> 01:16:30,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a diva tantrum.

928
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,892
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think Perez Hilton said that too.

929
01:16:35,694 --> 01:16:36,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

930
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:38,597
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some of my rapid fire news.

931
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:39,298
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

932
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move forward with all that other stuff.

933
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:46,187
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as my computer catches up.

934
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

935
01:16:47,387 --> 01:16:50,649
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed the date for the release of Scribblenauts in the UK.

936
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:57,474
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's actually going to be pushed out until October 9th instead of September 15th.

937
01:16:57,594 --> 01:16:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

938
01:16:58,954 --> 01:17:01,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're getting it on September 15th.

939
01:17:01,156 --> 01:17:02,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I'm being empathetic for them.

940
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is a Star Wars adventure game using the Scum Engine.

941
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:45,346
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's actually fan made it's called Han Solo Adventures and it's one of the it's an adventure game studio game so it gets the old LucasArts type game but it's supposed to be based off the early life of Han Solo Han Solo, the early years taking Star Wars fanboy wank to a whole new level Mr. Eyeshot first

942
01:17:47,426 --> 01:17:52,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other news, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is getting four new characters.

943
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them being Tatsunoko characters and two of them being Capcom characters.

944
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's being announced at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show.

945
01:18:01,872 --> 01:18:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows?

946
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:07,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll get Joe from Gatchaman.

947
01:18:07,755 --> 01:18:08,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix Wright, please.

948
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank West, Frank West, come on.

949
01:18:12,057 --> 01:18:14,758
[SPEAKER_07]: That would actually be a really good one for Western audiences too, I think.

950
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:16,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank West.

951
01:18:17,179 --> 01:18:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Tatsunoko vs. Capcom except the end boss is a bitch.

952
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,861
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we're getting Kaze?

953
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:25,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

954
01:18:25,562 --> 01:18:26,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Puzzle Fighter Dan.

955
01:18:29,423 --> 01:18:30,643
[SPEAKER_06]: They could draw a bunch of red bricks.

956
01:18:31,364 --> 01:18:32,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get back into some long discussions.

957
01:18:32,944 --> 01:18:35,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a few topics we're going to spend a little more time on tonight.

958
01:18:35,734 --> 01:18:42,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well there's a rumor going around that EA is the one responsible for holding back PS3 cross-game chat.

959
01:18:43,237 --> 01:19:02,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason being is that one of their older games, and people are not exactly going to say which one, although I remember reading somewhere that they think it's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apparently doesn't support custom soundtracks, I guess, or something to that effect.

960
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,545
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it, uh...

961
01:19:05,589 --> 01:19:11,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was one of the ones I guess that didn't use an in-game cross-media bar or something like that in support.

962
01:19:11,694 --> 01:19:23,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I don't know why your old Harry Potter game would be a big game for them still, because of that game, they didn't want the other games making that game look bad or something like that.

963
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:25,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but what's our source on this?

964
01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:28,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is this coming from a respectable... It's from an insider.

965
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking the Ars Technica mole who's usually pretty believable?

966
01:19:31,949 --> 01:19:32,930
[SPEAKER_06]: No, some other dude.

967
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Some dude on a forum?

968
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:36,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have more respect for him if he was called Secret Squirrel.

969
01:19:36,831 --> 01:19:37,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Squirrel.

970
01:19:38,192 --> 01:19:39,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Secret Squirrel.

971
01:19:40,432 --> 01:19:44,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be your mole name if you were to spill trade secrets on a web forum, Secret Squirrel?

972
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:45,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be Secret Squirrel.

973
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:45,874
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

974
01:20:01,144 --> 01:20:06,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom tonight asked, so I can't play Dragon Force while I play Harry Potter.

975
01:20:06,248 --> 01:20:06,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

976
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:07,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't sound like it.

977
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, PS3 titles... I don't understand why that would hold up voice chat, though.

978
01:20:12,314 --> 01:20:12,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So what?

979
01:20:12,734 --> 01:20:14,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have the cross-media bar in an old-ass game.

980
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:21,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's basically... What it was is custom soundtracks is actually what was the problem holding it back.

981
01:20:21,382 --> 01:20:23,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, PS3 titles have to be developed with...

982
01:20:25,345 --> 01:20:27,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

983
01:20:44,397 --> 01:20:44,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Boohoo.

984
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:48,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it is something the Xbox has that, you know, the PS3 doesn't have.

985
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also just don't like to talk to people while I'm trying to play other games.

986
01:20:51,983 --> 01:20:55,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if we're playing a game together, yeah, of course I like to talk to people.

987
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, 1 vs. 100, yeah, you have to do party chat in those games.

988
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:58,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way more fun.

989
01:20:59,048 --> 01:21:04,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if somebody else is playing, or especially if I'm trying to focus on a first-person game, like, I don't...

990
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:05,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

991
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:30,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't own Gears of War 2

992
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:38,655
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Max Technica

993
01:22:05,692 --> 01:22:13,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but apparently the other interesting thing, there's actually a test going on at a Walmart right now in Santa Clarita.

994
01:22:13,815 --> 01:22:16,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It's happening at a Walmart Supercenter store.

995
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:22,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, and this is why I wanted to bring this up, DJ Max has been location testing for quite some time.

996
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:27,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's really news, but I think what is news about this is the fact that it's happening at a Walmart.

997
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:33,102
[SPEAKER_07]: This is being reported by MamaniStyle.com, who really keeps tabs on what's going on with these music-based games.

998
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:40,666
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's interesting about this is that apparently they're trying to actually kind of move into the arcade business at Walmart.

999
01:22:41,507 --> 01:22:53,954
[SPEAKER_07]: And rumor is going around that if these tests work, that they're expanding some of these arcades in certain locations, that many of the Walmarts everywhere are going to see more floor space dedicated to a dedicated arcade.

1000
01:22:54,574 --> 01:22:55,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess the big...

1001
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it the Cabela's Game Hunter games?

1002
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:01,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Deer Hunters and all that.

1003
01:23:01,224 --> 01:23:03,426
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not bringing as much money in as they were before?

1004
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:06,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we did have Jumbo Safari at Walmart for a long time.

1005
01:23:08,091 --> 01:23:08,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1006
01:23:08,552 --> 01:23:11,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see Walmart's arcades and stuff.

1007
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:13,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I think all it really takes is just...

1008
01:23:13,874 --> 01:23:15,895
[SPEAKER_06]: replacing the games they have with some better games

1009
01:23:44,635 --> 01:23:45,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll make a lot of sense.

1010
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:46,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

1011
01:23:46,356 --> 01:23:50,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember back in the day when they had arcade games, regardless of the source.

1012
01:23:51,241 --> 01:24:02,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember we used to have like a, was it a FoodMax or like a big warehouse food store that had a Neo Geo multi-game system in there.

1013
01:24:02,692 --> 01:24:05,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And I used to love playing Magician's Lord and stuff like that.

1014
01:24:05,755 --> 01:24:06,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

1015
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that game in the vault.

1016
01:24:07,897 --> 01:24:12,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm all for more places having arcade games.

1017
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:16,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, there's even 7-Elevens I see now that do not have an arcade game in them.

1018
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:17,602
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

1019
01:24:18,543 --> 01:24:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: That is just blasphemy right there.

1020
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of 7-Elevens don't have arcade games anymore.

1021
01:24:23,445 --> 01:24:24,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, what the hell?

1022
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:25,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That was where I used to play Mortal Kombat 2.

1023
01:24:25,646 --> 01:24:27,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a 7-Eleven, it was a knockoff.

1024
01:24:27,087 --> 01:24:28,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Quick Mart.

1025
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:29,968
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little place in the town I grew up.

1026
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:30,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 2.

1027
01:24:30,669 --> 01:24:33,890
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually had Mortal Kombat 2, and when it first came out, they had it.

1028
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:34,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.

1029
01:24:35,424 --> 01:25:04,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter 2 and I remember there was a local diner that had Captain Commando oh we used to play that all the time wouldn't that be weird though if arcades make a comeback thanks to Walmart although I don't think it would be the same type of arcade like if it is a babysitting place at Walmart this is an arcade I want to stay the hell away from but it's going to be weird if they have stuff like DJ Max Technica and like the cool new games people want to play well maybe the whole DJ Max Technica testing at Walmart is to test it's durability

1030
01:25:07,087 --> 01:25:10,068
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be big resources because you have to bring in people to fix those machines.

1031
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:16,850
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, something huge like Walmart, you could have a dude that just goes around all the different Walmarts in the area and fixes all the arcade machines.

1032
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:19,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure the machines would make decent money.

1033
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he'd shoot himself at the end of the week.

1034
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:26,853
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to have the most top-of-the-line games, I'm sure, at a Walmart arcade to be able to make some money.

1035
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously these Deer Hunter games are making some money.

1036
01:25:30,034 --> 01:25:31,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a dude play in those games.

1037
01:25:32,955 --> 01:25:33,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I played one once.

1038
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:38,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember there was a Walmart near here that had a DDR solo machine in it.

1039
01:25:38,088 --> 01:25:39,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, what the fuck?

1040
01:25:39,388 --> 01:25:40,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that.

1041
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:41,849
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

1042
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so Walmart might possibly be the next resurgence of arcade gaming.

1043
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:51,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure how I feel about that, but to be continued.

1044
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me feel kind of dirty.

1045
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:58,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good word for it.

1046
01:25:58,829 --> 01:25:59,369
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dirty.

1047
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:06,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, luckily you can get bath soap and all sorts of things to clean yourself off with at Walmart in the bathing aisle.

1048
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:09,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, moving on with more gaming news.

1049
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:15,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic the Hedgehog, Blue Sphere, Chaos Level

1050
01:26:38,362 --> 01:26:40,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with Sonic 2, you'll be able to play as Knuckles.

1051
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:43,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you know how it worked with Sonic 3.

1052
01:26:43,528 --> 01:26:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool.

1053
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:49,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so if I have those other games on Xbox Live, I get that?

1054
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:51,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Or does this all come free with Sonic & Knuckles?

1055
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:54,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes free with Sonic & Knuckles, the add-on capability.

1056
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,003
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had the cartridges, it'd work the same way.

1057
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:00,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But do I have to have the other games downloaded, do you think?

1058
01:27:00,645 --> 01:27:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have to have the other... You have to have Sonic 2 to be able to play Knuckles in Sonic 2.

1059
01:27:05,866 --> 01:27:06,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1060
01:27:06,486 --> 01:27:07,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like owning the cartridges.

1061
01:27:08,346 --> 01:27:08,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1062
01:27:08,707 --> 01:27:10,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wasn't sure if because... You know, this is different.

1063
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,848
[SPEAKER_07]: This is in cartridges now, so I was just kind of wondering if they were coming with the download or what have you.

1064
01:27:15,308 --> 01:27:16,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, it's all in GameTap anyway.

1065
01:27:16,888 --> 01:27:18,709
[SPEAKER_07]: If I play those games, it's usually where I go to play it.

1066
01:27:20,489 --> 01:27:20,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1067
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1068
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:22,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1069
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:27,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really interested in purchasing those games, especially since you can just buy the...

1070
01:27:27,847 --> 01:27:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have the Mega Collection, which I don't know if it has Sonic & Knuckles on it.

1071
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:30,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

1072
01:27:30,932 --> 01:27:31,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

1073
01:27:31,533 --> 01:27:34,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it has Sonic & Knuckles, but I don't think it has the add-ons like this does.

1074
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:38,864
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a feeling this wouldn't work with the Genesis Mega Collection.

1075
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:39,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a feeling.

1076
01:27:39,866 --> 01:27:40,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It would not.

1077
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:42,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll just buy the other games.

1078
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:42,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Or buy them again.

1079
01:27:44,672 --> 01:27:57,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So, speaking of companies holding back other companies for doing things, I don't know if we touched on this last week about Final Fantasy XIV and the reason why it's not coming to the Xbox 360.

1080
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:02,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently Microsoft was holding them back from putting an MMO on there.

1081
01:28:03,864 --> 01:28:06,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently the same thing is now happening with Champions Online.

1082
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:15,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, it's just Microsoft doesn't have the framework built in place, or they're just not willing to conform to what they're looking for.

1083
01:28:16,712 --> 01:28:17,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI?

1084
01:28:17,653 --> 01:28:19,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they do, but XI's a little different, I think.

1085
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:27,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, XI had that whole play online front end, but it was a little awkward on the Xbox 360.

1086
01:28:28,217 --> 01:28:29,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it was no different from PlayStation 2.

1087
01:28:30,258 --> 01:28:31,499
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually function very similar.

1088
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:38,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to just log in through the play online front end first, and the same thing on the PC, and then you can get into the game, but it was always kind of a little weird.

1089
01:28:38,665 --> 01:28:51,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess because Final Fantasy XI was the exception to the rule, I guess, but apparently there's something that they're doing, some sort of red tape that's holding up a bunch of different games from being on there.

1090
01:28:51,906 --> 01:28:54,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think this could be a bad misstep by Microsoft?

1091
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:57,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Because PlayStation 3 is going to be getting some MMOs, right?

1092
01:28:57,109 --> 01:28:59,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the DC Universe coming out, we know that.

1093
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:07,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, though, when DC Universe and the agency and stuff like that starts coming out on the PS3, that might put a little bit more pressure on them to get their act together.

1094
01:29:08,656 --> 01:29:11,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I am kind of surprised that we haven't really seen a lot of MMOs on 360.

1095
01:29:11,818 --> 01:29:17,141
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposed to be that Marvel one that kind of fell through, so I don't know.

1096
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:47,161
[SPEAKER_07]: but yet they have Final Fantasy XI but I guess I don't know if that front end makes the difference or what because I heard Final Fantasy XIV does not have play online they're doing away with that whole thing which is good play online was crap it was interesting at first but I mean the thing is that it really served no purpose unless you also played Tetra Master which very very very very very few people did play online was originally supposed to be like a front end for I think all these other

1097
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:56,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in Japan there might have been one or two others, but there really was nothing anywhere else, and it made it kind of pointless.

1098
01:30:04,193 --> 01:30:09,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI, I don't have to update anything because it's still the play online viewer or whatever.

1099
01:30:11,542 --> 01:30:18,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't have it on one console and not have it on the other unless the players were independent of each other, which I don't think is going to happen.

1100
01:30:18,551 --> 01:30:19,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see them going that direction.

1101
01:30:21,303 --> 01:30:24,946
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Play online was a waste of space on my hard drive.

1102
01:30:25,327 --> 01:30:25,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty pretty.

1103
01:30:25,867 --> 01:30:27,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And you couldn't really delete it, you know?

1104
01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you had to go through the uninstall.

1105
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,893
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to put back in the disk just to uninstall the game.

1106
01:30:31,953 --> 01:30:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you tried to delete it, it would kind of screw things up.

1107
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:38,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a nuisance.

1108
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pure and utter nuisance to deal with.

1109
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:44,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they're going to be smarter about it with Final Fantasy XIV, which it sounds like they're going to do.

1110
01:30:44,624 --> 01:30:45,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, cool.

1111
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, right?

1112
01:30:47,306 --> 01:30:47,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1113
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:55,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, kind of something interesting came to light this week about the new Rock Band Unplugged demo that's out there and available right now.

1114
01:30:57,393 --> 01:31:06,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, though, the PSP Go is coming with a voucher that you get an exclusive demo of Rock Band Unplugged for the PSP Go.

1115
01:31:06,519 --> 01:31:11,603
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you get your PSP Go, you'll get to download this demo for Rock Band Unplugged.

1116
01:31:12,103 --> 01:31:15,885
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing about this demo, it will also play...

1117
01:31:16,966 --> 01:31:29,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloads from the Rock Band Unplugged store So the demo comes with five songs But if you don't really want to buy the game You don't have to You can just buy the additional songs you want to play

1118
01:31:30,504 --> 01:31:34,445
[SPEAKER_07]: and add those to your game and just continue to play Rock Band Unplugged that way.

1119
01:31:34,785 --> 01:31:41,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So, are they trying to do that to... See, I don't really get that.

1120
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems in the long run, wouldn't they end up losing some money on it?

1121
01:31:44,569 --> 01:31:46,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but they gain the money from the song downloads.

1122
01:31:46,849 --> 01:31:47,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's weird.

1123
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just weird.

1124
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,991
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't really heard of a game distributed like that.

1125
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:55,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the song downloads, I mean, later on if you decide to buy the game, they'll still work with the full game too.

1126
01:31:55,492 --> 01:31:55,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1127
01:31:56,192 --> 01:32:02,554
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, really the only asset then of getting the full game is getting the 40 whatever songs that come with the game.

1128
01:32:03,195 --> 01:32:06,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Because apparently the engine itself is going to download all onto your PSP Go.

1129
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:09,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1130
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very interesting.

1131
01:32:12,498 --> 01:32:14,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.

1132
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:21,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if we're going to see more demos like that in the future where essentially all the sales are going to be based off of microtransactions, right?

1133
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:22,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1134
01:32:23,602 --> 01:32:23,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1135
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:32,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, we're going to take a little break here to get to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

1136
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week you guys send us emails and we talk about them here on the program.

1137
01:32:36,144 --> 01:32:41,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The lovely Dark Sakura jumps into the mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails and reads them here live on air.

1138
01:32:41,827 --> 01:32:44,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Sakura, what do we have in the mailbag this week?

1139
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one from Loomies that says, Yeah, we are totally far away from where all that is going on.

1140
01:32:47,532 --> 01:32:50,454
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the Sacramento region, and most of the fires, unfortunately, are happening in Southern California.

1141
01:32:50,474 --> 01:32:51,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about seven hours away from us.

1142
01:32:51,335 --> 01:32:52,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so most of it's far away.

1143
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for thinking of us, and...

1144
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:17,916
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really want to do something, though, I know the Red Cross is always looking for donations and things like that, and during these times, they really need that stuff, so think about it.

1145
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:21,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, next up comes from Rini.

1146
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:31,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings and salutations to the crew, but for once I'd like to extend my admirations to DarkSakura for choosing motherfucking Silphid as the classic game of the week on episode 335.

1147
01:33:31,744 --> 01:33:38,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought that game completely out of randomness for an amazing $10 new, but that's not the point of this email.

1148
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:45,735
[SPEAKER_02]: While not everyone out there will run out to play Silphid, I would like to share a bizarre yet awesome experience with the game.

1149
01:33:46,276 --> 01:33:48,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just started another session of the game.

1150
01:33:48,618 --> 01:33:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the second stage or so, the game crashed.

1151
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: The game screen completely went to a dark screen with white text, and it caught me off guard since Silphid never did that before.

1152
01:33:57,447 --> 01:33:59,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bump my Sega CDX.

1153
01:33:59,069 --> 01:33:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the rare portable one.

1154
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:00,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Windows.

1155
01:34:01,651 --> 01:34:04,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Nor was there anything within the vicinity to jolt my console.

1156
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The game just suddenly glitched itself for no reason.

1157
01:34:07,134 --> 01:34:10,416
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about this whole event is what was on screen.

1158
01:34:10,696 --> 01:34:12,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head brandishing its cleaver.

1159
01:34:12,317 --> 01:34:12,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding.

1160
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:15,639
[SPEAKER_02]: What was on the screen was an apology.

1161
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, the game apologized.

1162
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it even better is that the game was not only able to recover and head back to the title screen, but it also shot off a free continue so I wouldn't lose my progress.

1163
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:35,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I've never been able to replicate this, nor do I believe there is a documented instance over the internet, so I guess it's a sad little cherished memory for me to have and love alone.

1164
01:34:36,055 --> 01:34:39,479
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR Crew, have you had any experiences with unusual game behavior that stood out for you?

1165
01:34:41,661 --> 01:34:45,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pushing having to reset the Genesis in that X-Men game.

1166
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:52,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna have to fuck around with mine then I'm gonna have to actually see if there's anything about that online anywhere There might be, who knows

1167
01:35:10,134 --> 01:35:12,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always thought that the game should apologize for me playing it.

1168
01:35:12,876 --> 01:35:17,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not Sylphie, but maybe like Driver 3 or something like that.

1169
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:19,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry that we made this game.

1170
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it sucks, but hey.

1171
01:35:20,921 --> 01:35:25,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We got apologized to by Blockbuster after renting a game that we brought back an hour later.

1172
01:35:26,644 --> 01:35:31,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We rented WCW Thunder and it was so bad.

1173
01:35:31,587 --> 01:35:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We called Blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back and they said they were sorry.

1174
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,831
[SPEAKER_02]: They let us get another game because it sucked that bad.

1175
01:35:38,376 --> 01:35:41,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks to have to apologize for something they really didn't do, though.

1176
01:35:41,438 --> 01:35:48,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Blockbuster's just the... I understand that that's just good customer service to let you bring the game back and get a new one, but they shouldn't have to apologize for it.

1177
01:35:48,902 --> 01:35:49,622
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't make the game.

1178
01:35:50,342 --> 01:35:52,864
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that's good customer service and blah, blah, blah.

1179
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:55,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving forward.

1180
01:35:56,145 --> 01:35:56,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1181
01:35:56,826 --> 01:35:57,626
[SPEAKER_02]: From Shook.

1182
01:35:58,567 --> 01:35:59,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, OLR.

1183
01:35:59,227 --> 01:36:00,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Shook, Shook, gay duke.

1184
01:36:02,148 --> 01:36:05,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello LLR, first off I want to say there was a typo in my last letter.

1185
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:09,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to say that the K in my name is pronounced as if it were lowercase, not silent.

1186
01:36:09,794 --> 01:36:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shook will suffice from now on.

1187
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:13,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to other things.

1188
01:36:13,897 --> 01:36:21,323
[SPEAKER_02]: My bigot dad, you have my permission to call him whatever nasty name you want, finally discovered that I had Final Fantasy X when he saw me in the middle of a battle.

1189
01:36:21,623 --> 01:36:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a word, he ejected the disc, put it in its case, and put it in his safekeep.

1190
01:36:25,326 --> 01:36:25,866
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bummer.

1191
01:36:26,707 --> 01:36:32,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, he didn't find Chrono Trigger, which is a very good thing because I will guard that game with my life.

1192
01:36:32,892 --> 01:36:33,272
[SPEAKER_02]: No joke.

1193
01:36:33,472 --> 01:36:35,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly have stumbled upon the best thing I've ever played.

1194
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:39,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, DarkSakura, I did do the ending where you beat it at the beginning.

1195
01:36:39,537 --> 01:36:40,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

1196
01:36:40,558 --> 01:36:41,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Proceed to bag on my dad.

1197
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:45,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that that's over, I have a suggestion.

1198
01:36:45,662 --> 01:36:46,903
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back at the end of the email.

1199
01:36:46,943 --> 01:36:49,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to bag on your dad, but we'll come back to that in a little while.

1200
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:51,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a suggestion for the Wii inflatable chair.

1201
01:36:51,914 --> 01:36:58,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet that there's going to be some kind of fetish porn game that involves that inflatable chair so it's not completely bad.

1202
01:36:58,778 --> 01:36:59,078
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1203
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:01,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait to join the OLR Home Club.

1204
01:37:01,219 --> 01:37:03,020
[SPEAKER_02]: My PSN username is MGS654.

1205
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:03,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ask.

1206
01:37:08,003 --> 01:37:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Your dad needs to... Hold on a minute.

1207
01:37:11,845 --> 01:37:15,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to kind of cue something up here because I... The Tribble has a comment.

1208
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,661
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1209
01:37:38,997 --> 01:37:40,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he'll know about it.

1210
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll get in trouble for what you do.

1211
01:37:59,193 --> 01:38:00,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like that kind of person.

1212
01:38:00,695 --> 01:38:04,079
[SPEAKER_07]: All I have to say... Okay, whether you want to replay this or not, I don't care.

1213
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:15,152
[SPEAKER_07]: All I have to say is that he should be thankful that you want to spend your time playing something that takes intelligence, strategy, wit...

1214
01:38:16,929 --> 01:38:17,969
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1215
01:38:35,236 --> 01:38:36,377
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1216
01:39:03,857 --> 01:39:07,663
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how kids sometimes get involved in this is when they rebel, they rebel hard.

1217
01:39:08,585 --> 01:39:13,493
[SPEAKER_07]: You sound smart enough where that's not going to happen, but your dad should be freaking counting his blessings.

1218
01:39:14,654 --> 01:39:15,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

1219
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:20,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I can vouch for that from experience.

1220
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Also one from Deathwishing.

1221
01:39:25,482 --> 01:39:30,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, there is a Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet down the street from me in a pizza shop.

1222
01:39:30,566 --> 01:39:33,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to use it because, well, they are rare, right?

1223
01:39:34,249 --> 01:39:34,549
[SPEAKER_02]: They are?

1224
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:42,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally steal that if stealing was legal, but man, none of my friends will join me because they think fighting games are gay.

1225
01:39:43,756 --> 01:39:44,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care for that terminology.

1226
01:39:46,627 --> 01:39:49,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know a good fighting game that could turn them on to the genre?

1227
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: PS, don't say Street Fighter, they hate it.

1228
01:39:52,804 --> 01:39:53,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Love, Deathwishing.

1229
01:39:56,142 --> 01:39:58,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no, I can't think of a game.

1230
01:39:58,843 --> 01:40:02,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, Street Fighter 2 is like the pinnacle of fighting games.

1231
01:40:02,884 --> 01:40:05,064
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't like that, there is nothing you can do.

1232
01:40:05,184 --> 01:40:08,165
[SPEAKER_07]: There is just, there's no fighting game that's going to work.

1233
01:40:08,225 --> 01:40:16,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you could try cutesy fighting games, but if Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is too gay, then sorry, but the other games are going to be even worse.

1234
01:40:16,807 --> 01:40:17,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Mortal Kombat, maybe.

1235
01:40:19,585 --> 01:40:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You should all make them play... What was that awful fighting game with the... It was really... Pit Fighter.

1236
01:40:26,313 --> 01:40:27,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Make them play Pit Fighter.

1237
01:40:27,234 --> 01:40:30,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I have better... Pit Fighter is the worst fighting game I've ever played in my life.

1238
01:40:30,378 --> 01:40:31,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

1239
01:40:31,499 --> 01:40:32,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my suggestion.

1240
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Get new friends.

1241
01:40:33,782 --> 01:40:34,603
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my suggestion.

1242
01:40:36,007 --> 01:40:36,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Another email!

1243
01:40:37,068 --> 01:40:37,788
[SPEAKER_02]: God, this is long.

1244
01:40:39,229 --> 01:40:40,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello to DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

1245
01:40:40,851 --> 01:40:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for discussing and reading my tweet on the last show.

1246
01:40:43,973 --> 01:40:49,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really passionate about Extra Life and what we gamers can do to make a difference, so I'm glad you brought it up during the show.

1247
01:40:49,897 --> 01:40:51,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you a little bit about Extra Life.

1248
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:56,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra Life was started by the folks at SarcasticGamer.com and its founders, Doc Adams.

1249
01:40:57,402 --> 01:41:01,846
[SPEAKER_02]: He has done some previous work with fundraisers before, but this has become something important to him.

1250
01:41:02,266 --> 01:41:03,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read about his inspiration.

1251
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:05,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the link doesn't work.

1252
01:41:08,608 --> 01:41:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: As for my inspiration, I recently put up a story on Sarcastic Gamer pointing out why I've become involved.

1253
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:14,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read this.

1254
01:41:15,273 --> 01:41:20,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I brought it up to OLR is that you guys have quite a great community.

1255
01:41:20,457 --> 01:41:26,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been listening to this show since it became a podcast a long, long time ago, and I've since become a huge fan.

1256
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:33,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I now listen to you guys on my iPhone on my drive to work or out on my morning runs.

1257
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:39,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy you got to be part of All Games years ago since I listened to Scott and AGI way back in the day.

1258
01:41:39,999 --> 01:41:43,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really was part of your forums or anything, but I always loved listening to the show.

1259
01:41:44,402 --> 01:41:50,146
[SPEAKER_02]: For Extra Life, you can sign up through the main page at extralife.sarcasticgamer.com and click on the sign up button.

1260
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:54,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It will take you to Texas Children's Hospital website and you can put up a donation page there.

1261
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a personal donation.

1262
01:41:56,931 --> 01:41:58,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, but this is something we do, not the listeners, right?

1263
01:41:58,971 --> 01:42:04,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, unless listeners want to be... Oh, because we have a lot of people that have their own things too?

1264
01:42:04,654 --> 01:42:08,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to make sure that people do know about this.

1265
01:42:11,156 --> 01:42:14,138
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a personal donation page that you can edit and change up quite a bit.

1266
01:42:14,438 --> 01:42:19,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, you can send out the link to anyone so they can give you online donations through the site.

1267
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also use PayPal for overseas donations as well.

1268
01:42:23,812 --> 01:42:28,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Now from there, you can also create a team so other participants can join with you.

1269
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:31,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else in your community can sign up and join your team as well.

1270
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We should totally do that.

1271
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:39,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes an aggregate total of those that join your team, and you can see how much the OLR team raises overall.

1272
01:42:39,327 --> 01:42:41,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so then don't go make your own page.

1273
01:42:41,569 --> 01:42:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us do it, which we're going to do in the next week here, and then we'll tell you guys what our little link is so we can all raise together.

1274
01:42:47,755 --> 01:42:48,196
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

1275
01:42:50,467 --> 01:42:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even see how much each team member raises as well.

1276
01:42:53,528 --> 01:42:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: That is if you go there.

1277
01:42:54,528 --> 01:42:59,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what it is is other people can make their own donation pages, but we can band them together as a team.

1278
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1279
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:00,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And it keeps an aggregate amount.

1280
01:43:01,031 --> 01:43:02,871
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to go in there and kind of play with it and see what it looks like.

1281
01:43:03,311 --> 01:43:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: He put up his donation page, which is waystogive.texaschildrens.org slash netcommunity slash Alan Ray, A-L-L-E-N-R-E-Y.

1282
01:43:12,114 --> 01:43:13,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anyone wants to take a look at it.

1283
01:43:14,085 --> 01:43:17,488
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the Gamer Day itself, you can do whatever you want.

1284
01:43:17,588 --> 01:43:24,453
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people will be videotaping and livestreaming their gamer activities, so if you guys and gal want to do it, it'll be cool.

1285
01:43:24,613 --> 01:43:26,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your theme of obscure fucking vault games.

1286
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:27,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha, it would be awesome.

1287
01:43:29,045 --> 01:43:29,885
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1288
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:52,858
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1289
01:44:13,806 --> 01:44:14,926
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what we can do.

1290
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,776
[SPEAKER_02]: To continue, what do you think?

1291
01:44:36,816 --> 01:44:37,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds fun, right?

1292
01:44:37,857 --> 01:44:38,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, yeah, it does.

1293
01:44:38,978 --> 01:44:39,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think of it this way.

1294
01:44:39,919 --> 01:44:42,801
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the most fun thing you do to raise money for any charity.

1295
01:44:42,841 --> 01:44:46,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people train for marathons, like me, or ride a bike across the U.S.

1296
01:44:46,505 --> 01:44:50,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll put out way too many calories and at some point it's going to hurt.

1297
01:44:50,589 --> 01:44:51,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it from me.

1298
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:52,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I hurt my knee training for my marathon.

1299
01:44:53,191 --> 01:44:56,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You will never have more fun raising money and you just have to pick up a game controller.

1300
01:44:57,435 --> 01:45:00,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to have you added to the list of gamer sites participating.

1301
01:45:00,558 --> 01:45:05,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I also hope you can reach out to other shows on the All Games Network like VGO and Bobby Blackwolf and his shows.

1302
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:10,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, thank you for mentioning Extra Life and I hope to hear some good news from you all soon.

1303
01:45:10,626 --> 01:45:14,570
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any suggestions, I'm not going to share Twitter on the thing.

1304
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:15,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time.

1305
01:45:16,031 --> 01:45:17,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from Alan.

1306
01:45:19,178 --> 01:45:20,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're going to do it.

1307
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,341
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all going to go down October 17th.

1308
01:45:24,941 --> 01:45:29,104
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have something posted on our website this week as soon as we get everything set up with more details.

1309
01:45:30,545 --> 01:45:39,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Just from a technical aspect, I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed with how we're going to make it work because we want to do an hour of pinball incorporated in this as well, hopefully.

1310
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, my best advice on this, don't waste time overthinking it.

1311
01:45:45,674 --> 01:45:46,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be easy.

1312
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:47,995
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure it out.

1313
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:49,377
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more than one video camera.

1314
01:45:50,019 --> 01:45:52,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that Loki has the video capture card and we have a switch box.

1315
01:45:53,005 --> 01:45:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a video camera.

1316
01:45:54,367 --> 01:45:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We can borrow, hopefully maybe Victoria will lend us hers.

1317
01:45:58,032 --> 01:45:58,672
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

1318
01:46:22,904 --> 01:46:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the way it's going to work though, we're going to do games from the vault for one hour basically.

1319
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how we're going to pick them.

1320
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:33,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we'll have folks donate.

1321
01:46:33,991 --> 01:46:38,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know if there's any way to kind of show like so-and-so donated money so they pick the next game.

1322
01:46:39,094 --> 01:46:41,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll figure something out.

1323
01:46:41,275 --> 01:46:44,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever donates the most money during one game gets to pick the next game.

1324
01:46:44,757 --> 01:46:46,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe we'll do something like that.

1325
01:46:47,298 --> 01:46:48,759
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to have a list of games or something.

1326
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:49,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Or gets to pick a system.

1327
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll figure something out.

1328
01:46:51,317 --> 01:46:53,118
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll work out the details over the next few weeks.

1329
01:46:53,258 --> 01:46:59,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Although what I see happening is us having the newer systems hooked up in the front room and the older systems hooked up in the vault.

1330
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:03,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have Dreamcastage testify.

1331
01:47:03,741 --> 01:47:07,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to get some more of our local friends involved, so we'll put out the call this week as well.

1332
01:47:07,282 --> 01:47:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone, get off your asses.

1333
01:47:09,703 --> 01:47:11,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email from Rob-a-ba-ba-ba.

1334
01:47:12,535 --> 01:47:19,820
[SPEAKER_02]: In reference to the August 16th podcast, my first PS2 was broken from the start, but in a very odd way that took me two years to notice.

1335
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,522
[SPEAKER_02]: In retrospect, I should have kept the old one for the novelty of it all.

1336
01:47:22,982 --> 01:47:26,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It played all the games fine, oddly enough, and it never physically failed.

1337
01:47:26,464 --> 01:47:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something wrong with the processor clock or math processing.

1338
01:47:29,566 --> 01:47:35,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd play around with Ridge Racer 5, watch the playback, and it would get out of sync with the playback about 20 or 30 seconds in.

1339
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: The car was still maneuvering around the proper order, but being out of sync caused it to repeatedly crash into the walls.

1340
01:47:42,406 --> 01:47:46,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly thought this was a software problem with Ridge Racer 5 because it looked like a software problem.

1341
01:47:47,088 --> 01:47:49,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally we got Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec in the US.

1342
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The replay effect was really bad in GT3.

1343
01:47:53,452 --> 01:47:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally realized that was the strangest hardware problem in a game system ever.

1344
01:47:58,194 --> 01:48:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But massive hardware failures frequently covered under unofficial extended warranties.

1345
01:48:03,255 --> 01:48:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, starting with the original Game Boy, my first two or three Game Boys had the dead-slash-solid-pixel-raster problem.

1346
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nintendo happily repaired-slash-replaced for free.

1347
01:48:13,358 --> 01:48:18,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not certain, but I believe it was because the Game Boy was not rugged enough for typical portable play, i.e.

1348
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:19,180
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying around.

1349
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:23,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I also needed direct sunlight to play, but that was a different issue.

1350
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:27,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the PSP had the problem with the dead pixels in the corner?

1351
01:48:28,123 --> 01:48:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that.

1352
01:48:29,344 --> 01:48:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Some massive hardware failures have been around at least 20 years, but like you said, flaming forums wasn't a big sport back then.

1353
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:39,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, rub-a-ba-ba.

1354
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:41,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1355
01:48:43,091 --> 01:48:46,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that he's just signing it rub-a-ba-ba.

1356
01:48:46,913 --> 01:48:47,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Adopting his title.

1357
01:48:48,174 --> 01:48:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1358
01:48:49,194 --> 01:48:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record...

1359
01:48:52,779 --> 01:48:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have some emails you want to send in.

1360
01:48:57,003 --> 01:49:05,892
[SPEAKER_07]: But we want to take a minute to get our angst on here in studio because, well, you know, sometimes we just read things on the internet that really tick us off.

1361
01:49:06,433 --> 01:49:13,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they do make us very upset, we have to do a little segment here that we like to call the FUs of the Week.

1362
01:49:28,806 --> 01:49:43,741
[SPEAKER_07]: and let me read a little bit of inspiration for our FUs of the week this week and this comes from a GameStop apparently in Jacksonville, Florida apparently somebody tried to rob this GameStop but it wasn't for money

1363
01:49:44,884 --> 01:49:48,265
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he wanted the employee to fill the bag with games.

1364
01:49:48,746 --> 01:49:50,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Copies of Madden NFL 10.

1365
01:49:51,707 --> 01:50:05,132
[SPEAKER_07]: The robber went into a GameStop on a Monday night, unfortunately the guy's not named, otherwise we'd name him by name, was pretending he wanted a 360, but then whipped out a gun and demanded copies for Madden NFL 10 and any other 360 games that would fit in the bag.

1366
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:07,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently he made off with 23 games.

1367
01:50:07,953 --> 01:50:09,193
[SPEAKER_07]: $1,300 is what that's valued at.

1368
01:50:09,213 --> 01:50:09,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Two 360s as well.

1369
01:50:09,814 --> 01:50:09,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yikes.

1370
01:50:15,211 --> 01:50:18,174
[SPEAKER_07]: F you.

1371
01:50:20,015 --> 01:50:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: My F you goes to, it's sort of a pseudo F you, just because I'm kind of happy about it at the same time.

1372
01:50:32,386 --> 01:50:38,871
[SPEAKER_02]: To 250th Anniversary Guinness, F you to being delicious, because I want to go back and drink more of you.

1373
01:50:41,053 --> 01:50:41,714
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more of you.

1374
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very freaking good.

1375
01:50:45,082 --> 01:50:45,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1376
01:50:47,383 --> 01:50:47,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1377
01:50:48,523 --> 01:50:51,024
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to having to go to work tomorrow.

1378
01:50:52,664 --> 01:50:53,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

1379
01:50:54,405 --> 01:50:55,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just don't want to go to work.

1380
01:50:56,406 --> 01:50:57,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the weekends.

1381
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:16,892
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to people that can't see the faults in themselves and like to blame other people for things that they did that think they can do no wrong and some folks need to learn to accept responsibility and yeah, need to learn how to take a break.

1382
01:51:18,794 --> 01:51:19,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1383
01:51:20,835 --> 01:51:22,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to some more gaming news.

1384
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:24,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a couple more and then we're going to get to your calls on the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1385
01:51:28,753 --> 01:51:55,745
[SPEAKER_06]: well there's something kind of I don't know if this is really super interesting but you know it made it into the gaming Guinness Book of World Records which having thumbed through the Guinness Book of World Records for games pretty much anything can make it in there but Arkham Asylum has now set the record for being the most critically acclaimed superhero game ever so what's that mean it was a superhero game that didn't suck so um

1386
01:51:57,645 --> 01:52:02,448
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, really, like, what superhero games have been that awesome?

1387
01:52:02,488 --> 01:52:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, did they say what it took the... Marvel Ultimate Alliance is pretty damn awesome.

1388
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:13,394
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically saying that it's gotten the highest Metacritic review average, I guess, among all the superhero games.

1389
01:52:13,414 --> 01:52:21,219
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just like, that's almost as bad as saying it's the most critically acclaimed superhero game starring Batman that's ever appeared on the consoles.

1390
01:52:21,839 --> 01:52:22,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1391
01:52:24,122 --> 01:52:25,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that a record?

1392
01:52:25,123 --> 01:52:26,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a record.

1393
01:52:26,403 --> 01:52:27,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just people's opinions.

1394
01:52:27,784 --> 01:52:34,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, you know... I'm sorry, but this game book is just really kind of...

1395
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:42,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Watering down all the other records, being the tallest person, that's not really much of an achievement, that's just your DNA.

1396
01:52:42,332 --> 01:52:46,074
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, that's a physical achievement that you have there.

1397
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:46,834
[SPEAKER_06]: You're that tall.

1398
01:52:47,374 --> 01:52:48,895
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just subjective stuff.

1399
01:52:50,836 --> 01:52:55,999
[SPEAKER_06]: If we all wanted to get together with all the reviewers and make a game the highest rated game ever, they could easily do that and rig it.

1400
01:52:56,999 --> 01:52:59,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a little weird that Metacritic is being used by Guinness.

1401
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just weird.

1402
01:53:01,561 --> 01:53:02,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I like that.

1403
01:53:03,422 --> 01:53:04,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just an odd title.

1404
01:53:04,963 --> 01:53:10,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't this reek of like, hi, we're going to pay these guys a lot of money to get this title so we can use it in our marketing?

1405
01:53:10,186 --> 01:53:10,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

1406
01:53:11,847 --> 01:53:17,050
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hear something that I just thought of just now that's kind of a little fishy?

1407
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:23,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Batman Arkham Asylum was published by Eidos, which is owned by Warner Games.

1408
01:53:23,173 --> 01:53:26,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Warner Games also published a game called Guinness Book of World Records The Game.

1409
01:53:27,716 --> 01:53:28,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee...

1410
01:53:29,534 --> 01:53:32,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't have close ties with them, do they?

1411
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:33,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Conflict of interest?

1412
01:53:33,478 --> 01:53:33,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

1413
01:53:33,999 --> 01:53:34,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

1414
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:35,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even think of that.

1415
01:53:35,921 --> 01:53:37,282
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good little comparison.

1416
01:53:37,763 --> 01:53:41,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought of that.

1417
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:48,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get to the Skype line, your phone calls, and your opinions on the latest and greatest in gaming news.

1418
01:53:49,495 --> 01:53:51,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you're going to hear in the background here...

1419
01:53:54,099 --> 01:53:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, you know that old classic song.

1420
01:53:55,942 --> 01:53:57,845
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Guitar Hero 5 ad.

1421
01:53:57,885 --> 01:53:59,628
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a new one that's airing on TV.

1422
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:03,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And it features Playboy Bunnies.

1423
01:54:04,195 --> 01:54:08,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, ten of them, all rocking out to Guitar Hero wearing no pants.

1424
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:10,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the risky business.

1425
01:54:10,662 --> 01:54:11,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's kind of like the ads.

1426
01:54:11,903 --> 01:54:14,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I like variety.

1427
01:54:14,384 --> 01:54:15,784
[SPEAKER_02]: 83 bands, all kinds of rock.

1428
01:54:15,904 --> 01:54:19,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy in September and get the unreleased Guitar Hero Van Halen on the house.

1429
01:54:19,646 --> 01:54:28,490
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the thing that caught my eye about the ad is that they're selling that whole Guitar Hero Van Halen thing on the house.

1430
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Not free.

1431
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:30,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it does say.

1432
01:54:30,571 --> 01:54:33,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the little red text at the bottom of the screen, though.

1433
01:54:33,172 --> 01:54:35,573
[SPEAKER_07]: It just says, buy one, get one.

1434
01:54:35,933 --> 01:54:36,814
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't say free.

1435
01:54:37,154 --> 01:54:37,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

1436
01:54:37,834 --> 01:54:40,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't stay free, because he'll get sued.

1437
01:54:41,595 --> 01:54:42,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

1438
01:54:42,615 --> 01:54:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very interesting way around it.

1439
01:54:44,356 --> 01:54:45,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I thought that was interesting.

1440
01:54:45,916 --> 01:54:48,077
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working that whole Van Halen giveaway into it.

1441
01:54:48,517 --> 01:54:50,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, whatever.

1442
01:54:50,377 --> 01:54:50,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hef thing.

1443
01:54:51,137 --> 01:54:51,998
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

1444
01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's Hef.

1445
01:54:53,638 --> 01:54:54,798
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a cultural icon.

1446
01:54:55,038 --> 01:54:56,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool they got everybody involved.

1447
01:54:56,779 --> 01:55:00,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, they really do need to come up with a new ad for...

1448
01:55:03,465 --> 01:55:03,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1449
01:55:04,005 --> 01:55:10,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there'd be plenty of guys that would argue with you that they could do 10 Playboy Playmates running around without pants on all day long and they'll never get old.

1450
01:55:12,031 --> 01:55:13,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time a trampoline though.

1451
01:55:13,312 --> 01:55:13,833
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

1452
01:55:16,575 --> 01:55:20,598
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Trampoline Hero to come out just for that little ad to come out.

1453
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if we get pantsless rage.

1454
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:26,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I am totally down with that.

1455
01:55:44,468 --> 01:55:46,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

1456
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:49,133
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

1457
01:55:49,273 --> 01:55:52,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1458
01:55:52,977 --> 01:55:57,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems like the show's kind of a little short tonight, but there just hasn't been a whole lot of gaming news this week.

1459
01:55:57,341 --> 01:56:03,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a little bit slow, and I think it's probably one of the whole fact that a lot of folks are going back to school right now.

1460
01:56:03,487 --> 01:56:07,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're kind of at just like a little bit of lull before we're going to get slammed with game releases.

1461
01:56:08,052 --> 01:56:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're trying to kind of keep it quiet as far as news goes because we just had Gamescom and BlizzCon, and now they have to save up some announcements for PAX.

1462
01:56:19,761 --> 01:56:20,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.

1463
01:56:21,483 --> 01:56:21,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1464
01:56:22,544 --> 01:56:23,004
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1465
01:56:23,064 --> 01:56:29,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we are kind of in a lull because probably all the secrets that are yet to be announced are going to be coming through on PAX pretty soon.

1466
01:56:29,589 --> 01:56:30,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's go to the phones.

1467
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:31,090
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a call.

1468
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:33,032
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1469
01:56:33,092 --> 01:56:34,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1470
01:56:34,073 --> 01:56:34,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1471
01:56:36,055 --> 01:56:38,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Ray Iannami.

1472
01:56:38,856 --> 01:56:44,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I got DJ Max Trilogy a few weeks ago.

1473
01:56:44,597 --> 01:56:48,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I should talk about it since the game is like 8 months old.

1474
01:56:49,598 --> 01:56:50,678
[SPEAKER_07]: We're under the radar.

1475
01:57:03,208 --> 01:57:08,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so DJMAX Trilogy is kind of like the old DJMAX Online or kind of like O2 Jammery.

1476
01:57:10,012 --> 01:57:18,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays somewhat like Beatmania, but instead of using a proprietor controller, you use the PC keyboard.

1477
01:57:19,097 --> 01:57:28,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a bunch of button modes in it, and... But there's one thing I really don't like about it that the other new DJMAX games have, and it's a feature called AutoCorrect.

1478
01:57:30,908 --> 01:57:35,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, so this is an online game that you can download, kind of like O2 Jam, you said?

1479
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, you have to buy the physical copy, and then you have to install it from the DVD ROM inside, but once you get it set up, you don't need to disk it anymore.

1480
01:57:49,092 --> 01:57:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's offline, but there's an online mode.

1481
01:57:51,873 --> 01:57:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something that you can only import, or is this available in the U.S.? ?

1482
01:57:57,741 --> 01:58:01,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's import only, but it has an English language option, though it's really crappy English.

1483
01:58:01,165 --> 01:58:01,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

1484
01:58:01,785 --> 01:58:05,869
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes this game good enough to check out for music game fans?

1485
01:58:05,889 --> 01:58:07,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can get to that later, but anyway...

1486
01:58:22,378 --> 01:58:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think it's the fact that, like, the DMX Online has been dead for a few years now, so this kind of gives you a chance to play a rhythm game that isn't set to be on the PC again.

1487
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a feature I wanted to rant about in this game.

1488
01:58:42,842 --> 01:58:43,942
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this feature?

1489
01:58:45,282 --> 01:58:50,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also correct, where basically if you hit the wrong node, but at the right time, you'll still get credit for it.

1490
01:58:51,331 --> 01:59:01,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, say you're supposed to hit the J key, but you hit K, you'll still get the full judgment score for it.

1491
01:59:02,117 --> 01:59:10,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not only the score, you still get 100%, but you have a little bit of a score penalty, but for me, that's good enough to be okay with the feature.

1492
01:59:11,041 --> 01:59:12,522
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems kind of easy.

1493
01:59:12,622 --> 01:59:18,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what's to stop somebody from hitting the key the same the whole time, just because your score will be a little bit lower in the end?

1494
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:20,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but...

1495
01:59:21,247 --> 01:59:27,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to pass songs that you normally would not be able to pass without this feature.

1496
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:30,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even Guitar Hero and Rock Band don't have this feature.

1497
01:59:31,032 --> 01:59:35,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And moreover, I just unlocked a new key mode.

1498
01:59:37,415 --> 01:59:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I unlocked a new key mode, and I'm trying to learn it, but when you have this feature turned on, it makes it confusing to learn, because I don't know if I'm hitting the correct keys or not.

1499
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather be penalized for hitting the wrong keys, because at least I know...

1500
01:59:50,834 --> 01:59:57,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll train me to hit the right keys instead of just guessing which keys I'm hitting incorrectly.

1501
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:59,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, do you have any other thoughts for us?

1502
01:59:59,642 --> 02:00:00,223
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

1503
02:00:00,263 --> 02:00:00,863
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

1504
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:17,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, see ya Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind tonight?

1505
02:00:44,678 --> 02:00:46,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a couple things.

1506
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:56,246
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, I just got off of WhatUp.com and I saw a story on there that I think you may be interested in.

1507
02:00:56,326 --> 02:00:57,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, shoot.

1508
02:00:58,387 --> 02:01:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I just sent a picture to your profile for you to check it out later on.

1509
02:01:05,131 --> 02:01:05,972
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

1510
02:01:07,153 --> 02:01:13,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, there's going to be a new Xbox 360 bundle coming out soon.

1511
02:01:14,369 --> 02:01:18,590
[SPEAKER_04]: According to this picture, they're calling it the Super Elite.

1512
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:23,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the 250 gigabyte system we talked about earlier in Part A?

1513
02:01:24,331 --> 02:01:33,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm not sure what you talked about in Part A. I missed a little bit of the show, so... I just happened to see this on...

1514
02:01:38,228 --> 02:01:41,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, assuming it's the same deal, what are your thoughts on it?

1515
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:49,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something that's necessary for Microsoft to do, or do you think this is just yet another skew out there in the marketplace to confuse me?

1516
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:54,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't know.

1517
02:01:54,058 --> 02:01:56,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a toss-up.

1518
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,041
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't already have a 360 or...

1519
02:02:00,037 --> 02:02:05,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Your 360 is basically dead, then maybe you can use it.

1520
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, no.

1521
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:12,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be able to make use of the hard drive.

1522
02:02:14,663 --> 02:02:15,384
[SPEAKER_07]: What exactly?

1523
02:02:15,944 --> 02:02:18,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of pointed this out on the PlayStation 3, too.

1524
02:02:18,685 --> 02:02:21,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We keep hearing bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives, bigger hard drives.

1525
02:02:21,406 --> 02:02:23,988
[SPEAKER_07]: But on both the 360 and the PS3, for what?

1526
02:02:25,128 --> 02:02:26,989
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we need these huge hard drives for?

1527
02:02:29,601 --> 02:02:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least for, you know, with both the systems, they're constantly coming out with arcade games, and, you know, assuming that you buy a lot of the arcade games, you know, for your system, or playing a game like a lot of TV shows, or at least on the

1528
02:02:51,924 --> 02:03:00,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that sounds more like it, room to buy more movies and spend more money on their store.

1529
02:03:00,886 --> 02:03:02,346
[SPEAKER_07]: That I can agree with.

1530
02:03:03,206 --> 02:03:04,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else on your mind tonight, Spazinator?

1531
02:03:05,947 --> 02:03:18,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know if you saw my response to your tweet about informing the club, but yeah, I'd be interested in joining your OLR club,

1532
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be on PSN for the rest of the evening.

1533
02:03:47,563 --> 02:03:49,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good one.

1534
02:03:49,083 --> 02:03:49,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Later!

1535
02:03:49,743 --> 02:03:53,164
[SPEAKER_07]: 1877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1536
02:03:53,884 --> 02:03:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what was the rest of this?

1537
02:03:54,764 --> 02:03:55,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy one, get one half off?

1538
02:03:56,265 --> 02:04:11,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently this week we will have the opportunity to get one game and another game for half off at Best Buy and there's a bunch of different games that they're offering that and so you just purchase one of the qualifying games and get another one for 50% off.

1539
02:04:11,667 --> 02:04:13,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

1540
02:04:13,068 --> 02:04:13,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1541
02:04:13,968 --> 02:04:14,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1542
02:04:16,678 --> 02:04:16,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi!

1543
02:04:16,939 --> 02:04:17,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello!

1544
02:04:17,099 --> 02:04:22,807
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, I don't know exactly how far I have to go, but I'm...

1545
02:04:31,932 --> 02:04:32,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry.

1546
02:04:34,833 --> 02:04:38,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're about 15 hours away.

1547
02:04:40,014 --> 02:04:40,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see.

1548
02:04:40,654 --> 02:04:41,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an hour and a half to Reno.

1549
02:04:41,775 --> 02:04:42,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I think about another 8.

1550
02:04:43,115 --> 02:04:46,736
[SPEAKER_07]: She's probably about, well, considering the bus has to stop everywhere.

1551
02:04:47,076 --> 02:04:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think she's taking the Reno route.

1552
02:04:48,897 --> 02:04:49,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1553
02:04:49,737 --> 02:04:51,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1554
02:04:51,437 --> 02:04:53,498
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to go through Nevada, which is going to be very boring.

1555
02:04:53,738 --> 02:04:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how's the trip been so far?

1556
02:04:57,479 --> 02:05:00,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly boring, especially once I got out to the mountains.

1557
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:00,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

1558
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:08,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you occupying your time with any video games?

1559
02:05:08,114 --> 02:05:09,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you bring a DS or a PSP?

1560
02:05:09,735 --> 02:05:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to play?

1561
02:05:12,256 --> 02:05:13,717
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your what?

1562
02:05:13,797 --> 02:05:14,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry?

1563
02:05:23,154 --> 02:05:23,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Netbook?

1564
02:05:23,714 --> 02:05:25,335
[SPEAKER_01]: That computer I took to ASIN?

1565
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:30,737
[SPEAKER_07]: At the moment, the main thing is an actual Far Far Apart because it's been so fucking long since I

1566
02:05:48,939 --> 02:05:50,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a Parapara in town?

1567
02:05:51,223 --> 02:05:52,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've got one nearby.

1568
02:05:55,835 --> 02:05:57,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that sunrise thing.

1569
02:05:57,697 --> 02:05:59,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been to in forever.

1570
02:05:59,078 --> 02:06:00,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been there either.

1571
02:06:00,519 --> 02:06:01,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what she's talking about.

1572
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1573
02:06:02,781 --> 02:06:10,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm hoping we can make your trip fun, and you're a real trooper for taking the long way out here.

1574
02:06:10,348 --> 02:06:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1575
02:06:11,269 --> 02:06:15,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I've driven cross-country, and even though some parts are really boring, it's a beautiful experience.

1576
02:06:15,212 --> 02:06:19,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think definitely enjoy the time on the way out here.

1577
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:24,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we will be seeing you soon, Misty.

1578
02:06:24,511 --> 02:06:27,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, be safe, and don't talk to strangers.

1579
02:06:29,772 --> 02:06:30,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try not to.

1580
02:06:30,953 --> 02:06:32,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, take care, Misty.

1581
02:06:32,033 --> 02:06:33,274
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you tomorrow.

1582
02:06:33,634 --> 02:06:35,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, give me a text when you hit Reno.

1583
02:06:37,655 --> 02:06:38,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I was planning on it.

1584
02:06:38,795 --> 02:06:39,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

1585
02:06:40,016 --> 02:06:43,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, it sounds like I'll be seeing you either tomorrow night or Tuesday for sure, so take care.

1586
02:06:45,078 --> 02:06:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.

1587
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:48,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully tomorrow night.

1588
02:06:48,819 --> 02:06:49,579
[SPEAKER_07]: We shall see.

1589
02:06:49,879 --> 02:06:51,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure we can make that happen.

1590
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:51,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1591
02:06:52,523 --> 02:06:52,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1592
02:06:53,804 --> 02:06:54,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1593
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:17,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, but try again next week, guys.

1594
02:07:17,751 --> 02:07:20,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially sorry for the new folks that can't get through.

1595
02:07:22,034 --> 02:07:32,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I used to be able to see who was calling in, and I'd try to rotate it, but Skype changed it so that you can't – like if multiple people are calling in, only the fastest dialer gets through.

1596
02:07:33,081 --> 02:07:34,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just kind of take the calls as they get in.

1597
02:07:35,062 --> 02:07:41,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a new caller, my biggest advice to you is just keep trying or write an email or a Twitter message.

1598
02:07:42,337 --> 02:07:45,300
[SPEAKER_07]: and do it that way if you haven't learned how to get fast on the phones yet.

1599
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:46,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1600
02:07:48,042 --> 02:07:49,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any other last minute stories here tonight?

1601
02:07:52,225 --> 02:07:52,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1602
02:07:53,886 --> 02:07:57,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Adventure DX is getting another remake apparently.

1603
02:07:58,209 --> 02:07:58,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh goody.

1604
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:09,637
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from the Australian Classification Board has a new listing for Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut and suggests that apparently

1605
02:08:11,886 --> 02:08:12,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1606
02:08:30,003 --> 02:08:30,323
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1607
02:08:30,964 --> 02:08:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess if that's it for Last Minute Stories tonight, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought because we're getting pretty close to wrapping up the show tonight.

1608
02:08:38,191 --> 02:08:40,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but it's just been a slower week.

1609
02:08:40,993 --> 02:08:42,114
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1610
02:08:44,236 --> 02:08:47,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I really lived in this house, my sim house.

1611
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:48,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Your sim house.

1612
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:49,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome.

1613
02:08:50,462 --> 02:08:54,706
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is coffee is awesome.

1614
02:08:55,566 --> 02:08:56,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1615
02:08:56,408 --> 02:08:57,891
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had more cream, I'd make you some more.

1616
02:08:57,951 --> 02:08:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1617
02:08:58,532 --> 02:09:00,355
[SPEAKER_07]: The cup I had earlier was delicious.

1618
02:09:00,375 --> 02:09:00,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1619
02:09:01,077 --> 02:09:01,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

1620
02:09:02,279 --> 02:09:06,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish they were still selling Blue Shark DDR pads, but they're not, so that's too bad.

1621
02:09:07,543 --> 02:09:07,843
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1622
02:09:08,264 --> 02:09:11,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, believe it or not, folks, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio.

1623
02:09:11,326 --> 02:09:15,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, as always, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into us and supporting it.

1624
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:17,972
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or two about the show.

1625
02:09:18,292 --> 02:09:19,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us spread the word.

1626
02:09:19,693 --> 02:09:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really how we succeed is through word of mouth.

1627
02:09:23,236 --> 02:09:30,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we really want is just to help us spread the word because we don't have big advertising dollars or a magazine behind us or anything like that.

1628
02:09:30,842 --> 02:09:33,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really is up to you guys to help spread the word.

1629
02:09:33,945 --> 02:09:43,570
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll be here to do it all again next week on a, I guess you could say, Penny Arcade edition of Orange Lounge Radio, where we're hoping we'll at least hear from some of our listeners making the trek out to Penny Arcade.

1630
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:49,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, we will not be there this year, but you guys will, and so we want to hear your voices next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1631
02:09:49,413 --> 02:09:52,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on All Games Radio.

1632
02:09:52,955 --> 02:09:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.

1633
02:09:57,927 --> 02:10:00,709
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1634
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:04,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1635
02:10:04,912 --> 02:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_00]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

1636
02:10:14,059 --> 02:10:25,668
[SPEAKER_00]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

1637
02:10:26,228 --> 02:10:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!
