0	19560	Today, August 23, 2009, a new pay-as-you-go business model is announced for a popular
19560	21000	360 game.
21000	25320	One gaming device will soon allow you to read comic books, and was a recently closed studio
25320	29760	working on the next Final Fantasy game?
29760	35960	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35960	36960	Radio.
36960	42560	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
42560	43560	lifestyle.
43560	47720	We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice, because we
47720	51940	let you call in, we let you chat with us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
51940	53500	We let you tweet us, too.
53500	57160	We try to keep up with the times and the new technologies, and it all happens live at six
57160	61640	o'clock Pacific Standard Time, nine o'clock Eastern Time, at our friends at All Games
61640	62640	Radio.
62640	63640	www.allgames.com.
63640	66620	A big shout-out to them for letting us steal their bandwidth on Sunday nights.
66620	67620	We appreciate it.
67620	68620	My name is Rob Roberts.
68620	70360	I'll be with you here over the next three hours.
70360	74120	With me as always, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Sommers, Dark Sakura.
74120	75120	Crunchy.
75120	76120	How are you?
76120	77120	Crunchy.
77120	80780	Tell the listeners about what you are eating right now, because I find it very interesting.
80780	85800	I really wanted cereal, but I really wanted peanut butter, and then I was like, I've got
85800	88280	some really tasty bread from Trader Joe's.
88280	92360	So what I did is I took my sprouted wheat bread from Trader Joe's, and put a bunch of
92360	97240	creamy Jif, and have put- Why not Skippy?
97240	99760	Annette Funicello is crying somewhere.
99760	103720	Um, oh well.
103720	108120	But I have a layer in between layers of peanut butter of all-brand flakes, so I can get my
108120	110140	crunchy cereal on.
110140	114040	It's actually pretty delicious, but not quite as epic as I thought it was gonna be, and
114040	117800	it hasn't really abated my desire for tacos.
117800	121720	So, to summarize, you are eating a peanut butter and cereal sandwich.
121720	122720	I am.
122720	124320	It's delicious.
124320	127200	Orange Lounge Foodio, live Sunday nights.
127200	128400	I swear we ought to have a spin-off.
128400	131080	This is full of fiber and protein, okay?
131080	133560	And it's low glycemic, so the world can bite me.
133560	137360	I swear we ought to have a spin-off show about like food or something.
137360	140120	It just seems like a natural progression for our show.
140120	141120	Call it Food Chef.
141120	142120	All right.
142120	145400	So as always, I don't want to ignore him any longer, because he's an important part of
145400	146400	our show.
146400	147400	What the hell would we do without him?
147400	148400	Tech master, Loki.
148400	150400	Yeah, those are all lies.
150400	151400	Yeah, mostly.
151400	152400	No, I'm kidding.
152400	153400	How are you, Loki?
153400	154400	I'm fine.
154400	155400	I feel somber, though.
155400	156400	Yeah?
156400	159400	I was working out front planting plants.
159400	163000	How is it being a homeowner now, a couple months in, having to do all this housework?
163000	164000	Tiring.
164000	167080	Actually, it's funny, though, because there was this plant that was growing out front
167080	170920	next to our neighbor's fence, and we weren't really sure if it was our neighbor's plant
170920	175180	or ours, but technically, it's not our side of the property, so it's ours.
175180	179000	But apparently, you can pull it apart the way that it kind of grows.
179000	180320	You can actually pull it apart.
180320	185400	So we took this one giant plant and made like 16 smaller plants out of it, and they're all
185400	188840	going to grow and expand bigger and take over the entire yard.
188840	189840	But yeah.
189840	191680	It's like Animal Crossing for real.
191680	192680	Something like that.
192680	193680	I don't know.
193680	194960	So yeah, that's what I did there.
194960	196840	I'm surprised you, Loki, with your handiwork.
196840	200900	You don't get one of those things I've seen on late night television, which is those rolls
200900	206120	of flowers that you see that you can get at Home Depot, where you just unravel.
206120	207160	It's like a carpet or something.
207160	212120	You throw it down, and it's all seeds, so you water it, and then you just get the hometown
212120	214080	buffet of flowers in your front yard.
214080	215080	Yeah.
215080	216080	You can do that with just seeds.
216080	218920	I mean, you don't need to spend money on it.
218920	223100	And I don't know if you've ever tried rolling anything down.
223100	224800	I can't roll it straight.
224800	225800	It would just be awful.
225800	229200	Like, last night, we got... We were actually doing stuff at the house.
229200	233400	We bought a rug last night, which Kat decided to start tearing up, because it's the only
233400	236320	carpet in the house, and now she can scratch it.
236320	241200	And then we bought curtains for the front room to shield the outside world from our
241200	245560	porn watching, and it's really sunny.
245560	252200	So we put those up and everything, and... But yeah, I mean, we don't need all the flowers
252200	253200	up there.
253200	254900	When are you inviting me over to see all these changes at the house?
254900	255900	Once we're done.
255900	256900	I don't know.
256900	257900	I'm just giving you a hard time.
257900	258900	Come over any time you want.
258900	259900	I don't know.
259900	263840	Once I get the cabinet in and stuff, but... You need a housewarming party.
263840	264840	I know.
264840	265840	That's what you need to do.
265840	266840	It's never clean.
266840	267840	No, I understand.
267840	271720	You've had a lot of busy stuff going on lately, but at some point, you should have a housewarming
271720	272720	party.
272720	278320	It's almost like... I don't know when the statute of limitations on that stuff is, because
278320	281320	we moved in, what, two months ago?
281320	287480	I don't know when you can... You've gone beyond the point of homewarming parties.
287480	290280	I think there's a point where you're just like, okay, you forego.
290280	293600	You mean you would give up housewarming presents and not have a housewarming party?
293600	297400	Hey, I would not be foregoing housewarming presents.
297400	301080	It's just... I don't know.
301080	305240	It'll be cooler once I get the cabinet in, because it'll be something to showcase, you
305240	306240	know?
306240	307240	Right.
307240	310320	Right now, all I can showcase is like... I don't know.
310320	311320	The cat-eating rug?
311320	313320	No, it's not eaten yet.
313320	317800	I mean, she just started pulling out pieces of it and was eating it.
317800	318800	I don't know.
318800	319800	All right.
319800	321480	Well, let's introduce our chat room as well.
321480	323960	As always, where would we be without the listeners?
323960	324960	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
324960	327240	Let's give the chat room a name tonight.
327240	329120	Let's call it Rufus.
329120	330120	Why are we calling the chat room?
330120	331240	Chat room, your name is Rufus.
331240	332560	Why are we calling... Barnaby.
332560	335600	Why are we calling the chat room Rufus or Barnaby or Barnabas?
335600	336600	I don't know.
336600	340640	Which, by the way, I am all about this Tim Burton Dark Shadows movie with Johnny Depp
340640	341640	as Barnabas.
341640	342640	I know, right?
342640	343640	I can't get here any faster.
343640	344640	Please.
344640	346080	But Johnny Depp is in every Tim Burton movie now.
346080	347080	I love Meesa.
347080	348080	Who cares?
348080	349080	He's a great actor.
349080	350080	I love Tim Burton.
350080	351080	I love Johnny Depp.
351080	352080	This is great.
352080	355800	The chat room's name is officially Penelope.
355800	357360	Why are we calling the chat room by any name?
357360	361160	We're not calling it... We're not going to get in this weird tangent of stuff.
361160	362160	Remember last week?
362160	363160	It got weird.
363160	365160	Chat room, your name is Penelope.
365160	366160	See.
366160	368420	And then people are going to tune in at eight o'clock.
368420	370880	People that tune in late who weren't here when the show started on time, they're going
370880	371880	to be like, who the fuck's Penelope?
371880	375240	That's why they should have been here, huh?
375240	377000	It's just going to get strange.
377000	380480	I have a feeling we're just going to go.
380480	381480	That's right.
381480	382480	I need to take more Vicodin.
382480	383480	Excuse me.
383480	384480	All right.
384480	385480	Let's go to Penelope and read some of the comments that we have tonight.
385480	390860	Alpha Cananagram says about Loki's house, Skye just wants to watch the porn on the big
390860	394080	screen TV, possibly.
394080	396320	It's not that impressive, really.
396320	399280	I mean, I don't know.
399280	400880	There are weird things though.
400880	408520	The last time we had Jim and Annie and Christopher over, we actually watched the parody to Friends.
408520	416320	When you watch those parody porns, there's nothing sexy about that at all.
416320	419380	They're trying to make the characters look like the characters in the show and they do
419380	422760	a horrible job at it.
422760	424760	I don't know.
424760	425760	It's more weird.
425760	431600	It's like watching a very slow-mo car wreck or something.
431600	435200	Have you thought about just watching just a straight up porn that doesn't try to be
435200	437080	any type of funny thing?
437080	438720	Good luck finding one, okay?
438720	441840	They're all kind of funny and weird.
441840	446480	I like old people, one of my favorite chat room nicknames, by the way, in Penelope right
446480	447480	now wants to know...
447480	454120	Ew, I just said that that person's in Penelope, wants to know, are there naked pics of Penelope?
454120	456640	Well, look, you're... never mind.
456640	457640	I don't want to...
457640	461520	I like the alpha cananagram referred to Penelope Pitstop because that's old school yo.
461520	462560	I didn't get that.
462560	463560	What is that?
463560	466200	It wasn't... it was from old cartoon.
466200	467200	Is it?
467200	468200	Yeah.
468200	469200	Okay.
469200	470200	I got school people.
470200	471200	If it wasn't on Nickelodeon, I probably never saw it.
471200	473080	Would that be from Wacky Races?
473080	474080	I don't know.
474080	475080	I think it was Wacky Races.
475080	476080	That sounds like a character from Wacky Races.
476080	479560	Any moment somebody's going to yell it out in chat anyway, so we'll get there.
479560	480560	Okay.
480560	484400	Suma asks, so we went from Rufus to a girl's name, did Chad have a sex change?
484400	485400	Apparently Dark Soccer thinks so.
485400	486400	It was indeed Wacky Races.
486400	487400	All right.
487400	490680	And that was just a guess because I wouldn't remember such a horrible cartoon.
490680	491680	You watch a lot of cartoons.
491680	497040	No, I don't watch horrible cartoons like that, but I mean, come on, Penelope Pitstop.
497040	498680	It sounds like a racing character.
498680	501740	Her car was called the Compact Pussycat.
501740	503440	It's a compact pussy, okay.
503440	504440	There we go.
504440	507880	We have three people all just piping up, starting with X-Link, who beat everybody else to it,
507880	510720	Wacky Racers, or Wacky Races.
510720	514000	Let's go back to video games.
514000	516800	We have this odd delay too.
516800	520560	We are live and it's not like we're on a delay because people are afraid we're going to say
520560	524980	fuck or something, but just the nature of the encoding and the fact that it takes a
524980	529720	minute to go to all game server, then you download it because you're buffering everything.
529720	531960	There's just by nature this 20 second delay.
531960	533600	So sometimes the last question's in the chat.
533600	536460	We don't see the answers for 20 seconds.
536460	539320	That's why when you call in, by the way, it's really important that you lower your volume
539320	541120	because there's nothing you can do about that buffer.
541120	542120	It will always be there.
542120	543120	All right, anyhow.
543120	544120	Look at that, Tiger Claw.
544120	547680	But if you turn the volume up, there's less of a buffer.
547680	552400	Tiger Claw going straight to Wikipedia for the answer on Penelope Pitstop.
552400	555860	Okay, look, let's try to get into video games here tonight, talking a little bit about our
555860	557720	gaming week.
557720	561380	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
561380	566520	I was actually playing some Blue Dragon and some Ragnarok online, which I got back into
566520	574040	and stuff on Gaia, but, uh, I'm not playing anything now.
574040	579280	I have to, when you're playing MMOs, somebody on this show has to keep the added tradition
579280	580280	going.
580280	585040	I had to stop because I had the rest of that suture removed from my hand on Friday.
585040	586040	Haha.
586040	587880	You can't bitch slap me.
587880	595240	I got a left hand, Rob, and I got two feet, and you are not protected.
595240	602960	Oh, I'm actually reading up on Janet Waldo, who did Penelope Pitstop's voice.
602960	604520	She was Judy Jetson.
604520	605520	Fascinating.
605520	606520	Yep.
606520	608040	Loki, how was your gaming week?
608040	610960	I'm assuming she's done if she's talking about the Jetsons.
610960	616200	Apparently not as exciting as Wacky Races, but, uh, no, I actually tried to play a few
616200	617200	different things this week.
617200	623160	I, I went and actually played some indie games, and of course people were recommending that
623160	628520	I play, um, you know, I made a game with zombies in it, and yeah, it was funny, and it was
628520	637040	actually pretty fun, um, so I enjoyed that, um, also, for whatever reason, because, you
637040	641880	know, now that they have the rankings in there, where people can actually rate different games
641880	647920	and stuff, um, you can actually, you know, see what the top rated, you know, um, indie
647920	649180	games and stuff are.
649180	655680	So I decided to play the top rated indie game, which is, um, Miner Dig Deep, and I don't
655680	658760	know why, but I'm addicted to that game.
658760	661320	It's almost pointless.
661320	667960	The game, you basically, you're a miner, and you go into a hole, and you actually dig into
667960	671120	the walls, almost like Dig Dug, but there's no, like, you know, dinosaurs around.
671120	674400	Just to point out, though, not the kind of 17 year old miner, right, you're talking about
674400	675400	a pickaxe.
675400	680120	Yeah, it's like a pickaxe, you know, miner, I don't know, maybe under 17.
680120	683040	Miner 2049er, if you're old school like me.
683040	688840	Um, but anyways, so you're in, you know, going into the ground digging, and you can buy different
688840	692360	things, um, of course you have lamp oil that runs out after a certain amount of time, so
692360	696800	you collect ore and stuff, and you go back up to a little shop, sell it, buy more lamp
696800	702720	oil and supplies, and you go back down and dig some more, and you do this forever.
702720	707640	This seriously sounds like a game I used to play, like, 15 years ago on old school PC.
707640	709480	256 color shareware.
709480	713480	Yeah, pretty much, and you do this forever, and I don't know why, but I can't stop playing
713480	714480	this game.
714480	719320	I actually, you know, I don't know, I could have been playing, like, Earth Defense Force,
719320	724240	you know, which I did play a little bit of this week, but I kept going back to play this
724240	725240	game, and I don't know why.
725240	729440	So it sounds like its crown as the top-rated game right now is rightfully deserved, it
729440	730440	sounds like.
730440	734200	Yeah, it's fun, it's just, I don't really know what the point is, but I don't really
734200	735200	care.
735200	738320	Azure Edge in chat wants to know what game you're talking about one more time.
738320	739520	Miner Dig Deep.
739520	743240	And it's an indie game, top-rated indie game, at least when you downloaded it, who knows,
743240	745880	because those lists can change on a daily basis, right?
745880	746880	Yeah.
746880	749080	So, you know, what's funny is that, you know, we heard about the new Xbox, and I think it
749080	750080	was like a dollar.
750080	752360	I mean, seriously, it's worth the dollar.
752360	755960	I think we've heard a lot of chat when this new firmware rolled out about how there was
755960	759880	going to be ratings and so forth, but I don't think we've really heard a lot about how that's
759880	764660	really played out, you know, because I think there was some concern that, just like people
764660	769480	spam Dig, some of these indie developers might try to spam Xbox to try and get their titles
769480	770480	to the top.
770480	772200	Does it seem like it's working?
772200	779040	If they are, it's hard to notice because there's so many people voting on stuff that, really,
779040	783400	I don't see how that can be, and actually, it's not a matter of, like, you can place
783400	784400	a vote for a title.
784400	787880	I mean, you can vote, like, a five, but, like, say later on, something really pissed you
787880	790720	off about it, you can change it to a zero, or one, or whatever.
790720	794760	You can change it whenever you want, so it's basically just, you know, tallies, whatever
794760	797480	people are thinking of it at that time.
797480	801020	When I went in there, you know, because, unfortunately, you know, if you listened to last week's show,
801020	805920	you know I'm Xbox-less right now, but when I was playing with that new patch last week,
805920	809840	one of the first things I did is I went in there and I rated Snake 360, you know, to
809840	813560	support our buddy who was on the show a couple months ago when that game first rolled out,
813560	816760	and I was like, oh, I'm going to rate this a five and see kind of how it takes place.
816760	819200	But it didn't seem like my vote, because, you know, you can see the number of people
819200	822160	that have voted, it didn't seem like my vote took at first.
822160	825080	Like, it almost seems like there's a waiting period before the vote actually registers.
825080	827120	I don't know if they update overnight, or what it is.
827120	828120	It might take a while.
828120	829120	It's kind of weird.
829120	832880	I mean, because I don't think they could do it in real time, it would just be bogging
832880	835680	everything down.
835680	840720	I did find it very interesting that the game rating worked very similar to the Netflix
840720	845720	rating, how since you don't really have a mouse and pointer to click how many stars,
845720	849980	you have to kind of cycle through all the way to five or back to one, you know, to rate
849980	852360	it by hitting the A button so many times.
852360	856480	And I don't know, it's pretty cool, like, I played Earth Defense Force earlier this
856480	861600	week as well, and that's rated a solid four now, which it rightly deserves because it's
861600	862600	awesome.
862600	868000	It just broke 80 hours this week in the game, and I don't know why because it's just really
868000	873720	hard and frustrating, but I'm actually working my way through it some more.
873720	878560	I finally got one of the higher up weapons and I'm missing, I'm still missing some of
878560	883120	the other weapons though, but in order to farm them, the one level you have to play,
883120	887880	it only drops like one or two weapons a level, and you know, since it's random at what weapons
887880	893120	it picks to me, it could be one of any 200 weapons that are in that game, and I'm missing
893120	897960	like two, and you can see how it could take forever to get what you need.
897960	905560	But I've been playing that and I'm about 80% done with the game, getting almost to the
905560	912200	point where, you know, I need to really get some good people to help out with it, but
912200	917040	I have a friend who's actually playing that at work as well, and so he's been helping
917040	921040	me on breaks and stuff like that when we're not playing Grand Theft Auto, then of course
921040	925520	I played Grand Theft Auto this week and didn't really change anything, although I went over
925520	930920	to my sister's house because she has a modded 360 as well, I got her that for her birthday,
930920	935660	and so I've been giving her every now and then copies of, you know...
935660	938720	Did you really give the gift of piracy for someone's birthday?
938720	943760	She's poor, she can't, okay before that she had a modded PS2 with games dumped to the
943760	947860	hard drive, so yes, I've been giving the gift of piracy to her because she can't afford
947860	949000	actual games.
949000	954000	She does rent though, so you know, she rents legitimate games, but I shouldn't be supporting
954000	958240	such blatant piracy, but you know, it's out there I guess.
958240	962760	Well she has, to be fair, she does have a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto IV, so she
962760	967640	does have it, legitimately, so the fact that I'm burning off a new copy of it that happens
967640	973280	to be modified, it's still kind of in that gray area, but I mean, it's not like she doesn't
973280	975000	own a legit copy of it.
975000	976000	Okay, fair enough.
976000	977000	Okay.
977000	981080	But anyways, so she, I was showing her because she didn't actually try any of the weapons
981080	984840	that I modified or anything because she doesn't have the phone yet, she's been too busy trying
984840	992060	to punch people with the super punch, although for whatever reason, the nuke shotgun that
992060	997360	I built in there, because normally I play Lost and Damned and so some things don't work
997360	1003600	quite right how they're supposed to, but since she only has Grand Theft Auto IV, that nuke
1003600	1008400	shotgun works like a nuke, and it, like, no matter where I shot it, somehow the shockwave
1008400	1010000	hit me, killed me every time.
1010000	1012480	You really do need to YouTube some of this stuff, I know you're working on it.
1012480	1016880	I have two hours of footage, okay, I have to go through it, but yeah, it's going to
1016880	1017880	be awesome.
1017880	1019320	Alright, looking forward to seeing it.
1019320	1022880	One more question I want to ask you about the whole, because as I mentioned before,
1022880	1026880	my Xbox 360 is broke right now, so I can't really look at this myself, I don't know if
1026880	1031760	you've bothered to check it out, maybe a chatter knows, what is the top rated Xbox 360 game
1031760	1032760	right now?
1032760	1033760	I don't know.
1033760	1034760	Hmm.
1034760	1037920	I wonder if that's something that you can look up on Xbox.com, can you see ratings on
1037920	1038920	Xbox.com now?
1038920	1039920	I think you can.
1039920	1043600	I'm sure, maybe a chatter will look that up for us, because if I try to go on Xbox.com
1043600	1049520	while we're recording the show, it won't like that, so it uses up a lot of memory, so.
1049520	1053120	I'm kind of curious, if it's like Mass Effect or, you know, I'm trying to think of the games
1053120	1057240	that were high rated when I took a peek, but you know, everything was so new at that point.
1057240	1062400	I know Grand Theft Auto is pretty high up there, it's like a four and a half, I don't
1062400	1063400	know.
1063400	1066600	I don't think there's anything else to solve five, so it's going to be really hard to distinguish
1066600	1072880	since, you know, it's sections of a star being shaded there, it's like, is that a half, third,
1072880	1074960	I don't know, you know.
1074960	1081680	Halo 3 says, sex with the elderly is their chat name.
1081680	1082680	Is that the game tonight?
1082680	1086040	Everybody's going to name themselves something really foul that I have to read?
1086040	1087040	Whatever.
1087040	1088760	I think it's a good idea.
1088760	1092800	No, it's a terrible idea, I won't read your chats, alright, whatever.
1092800	1095800	Have fun with it, whatever you like, as long as it's consensual.
1095800	1102800	Alright, um, I wonder if that's just a lie, I wonder if they just shouted out an Xbox
1102800	1106880	360 game because they knew I'd read it and just believe them, because I'm a sucker.
1106880	1112560	Alright, hey, my gaming week, obviously I've been QQing about my broken Xbox 360.
1112560	1117000	You know, and I'm calmed down a lot this week than I was last week, because it was still
1117000	1121160	fresh in my mind last week, I'm a little more mellow this week, I think I have my plan of
1121160	1123080	action for what I plan to do about it.
1123080	1127400	I will not be buying a new Elite, I'll tell you that much, that is one thing I did decide.
1127400	1131320	Maybe I'll talk a little more about this later on because we're going to get into a story
1131320	1134400	in a little bit that's kind of related.
1134400	1138020	But that means obviously I still have a Playstation 3, I still have a Wii, I have plenty of places
1138020	1139020	I can be gaming.
1139020	1143800	I think PS3 kind of wins this week, I've been playing Wipeout HD, I went back and visited.
1143800	1148120	Oddly enough, the whole controversy about the ads in the game kind of made me think,
1148120	1152280	oh yeah, I never really played enough Wipeout HD, so I went back and played some, and I
1152280	1156200	did actually see an ad once while I was playing, I didn't play the new expansion, I was just
1156200	1160840	playing like old school Wipeout HD, like the, I guess, well how old school is Wipeout HD,
1160840	1164680	but you know what I mean, the original version of it.
1164680	1169280	Because damn, I love me some F-Zero, and Wipeout HD really is kind of the closest thing we
1169280	1175560	have to that on another console, and I really like that mode that's called I think zone
1175560	1182000	mode when you're racing, it makes the track like all this solid color as you're racing,
1182000	1186080	it has this very techno look to it obviously as Wipeout HD does, and then as you race,
1186080	1191760	like the track changes colors as you accumulate so many points, and yeah, pretty cool.
1191760	1197880	I'm having fun with Wipeout HD, haven't really played a lot of it online, but it has been
1197880	1202680	satiating my thirst for gameplay this week with a lack of an Xbox 360.
1202680	1206400	Obviously the Playstation 3 is a perfectly fine gaming system, and there's some certain
1206400	1210440	things on it I can't play on 360 that I'm kind of catching up on right now, so Wipeout
1210440	1211440	HD is one of them.
1211440	1216160	I'm still looking for a cheap copy of Valkyria Chronicles, but from what I understand, because
1216160	1220960	I remember we reported on the show a while back that Valkyria Chronicles dipped to 1999,
1220960	1225440	apparently it went back up, because it has been, I don't know if the price dip made it
1225440	1229560	more successful or it's a cult thing now or what the deal is, but I know that's on my
1229560	1235800	hit list of games I want to play until I get my 360 situation resolved, and then of course,
1235800	1238860	whenever Final Fantasy 13 comes out I will be buying them on PS3, and I was watching
1238860	1239860	Blu-rays too.
1239860	1241720	I finally caught up on a few of those.
1241720	1245280	I think that you should hang out with me and play Dreamcast.
1245280	1246280	Dreamcast?
1246280	1247280	On September 9th I will.
1247280	1248280	Okay.
1248280	1249280	It'll be fun.
1249280	1254400	I forgot to mention that I also have a System 573 board coming my way tomorrow.
1254400	1257600	Now for those that don't know what a System 573 board is, what is that?
1257600	1258960	It's Bomani hardware.
1258960	1266680	It's actually, well this one in particular is a Dance Maniacs second mix J append, and
1266680	1271680	so literally if I were to hook it up to a monitor and build controls and stuff like
1271680	1276080	that, I could play Dance Maniacs as an actual arcade game.
1276080	1279800	And you can convert the machine into a DDR machine if I really wanted to, but it costs
1279800	1281980	like an extra $100 to do that.
1281980	1288480	But I have the actual cartridges and security stuff to do it if I wanted to.
1288480	1292200	I don't know if I will though, because I can just run Step Mania.
1292200	1297280	I'm reading some comments from Penelope at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1297280	1301280	Tiger Claw says, Zone was a mode first introduced in Wipeout Pure on the PSP.
1301280	1302280	I did not know that.
1302280	1303280	I missed the PSP version.
1303280	1309040	SG100Matt says, the top indie rated game is, I made a game with zombies, with 4.5 stars
1309040	1310040	and 5081 votes.
1310040	1311040	So it sounds like it's changed.
1311040	1313280	Yeah, it's been getting, well that was like number 3.
1313280	1316280	It's been getting bigger because, you know, everyone loves it.
1316280	1317280	Everyone loves zombies.
1317280	1318280	It's a dollar.
1318280	1319280	It's a dollar.
1319280	1320280	It's a good dollar spent, you know.
1320280	1321880	Definitely recommend you try it.
1321880	1328600	Has a really, people are calling it this year's, you know, Still Alive basically, has a really
1328600	1331640	weird catchy song about the game.
1331640	1332640	Interesting.
1332640	1335440	It's probably sung, but it just talks about the game.
1335440	1340640	Does it seem like this whole rebranding of the, what was it, I don't even remember what
1340640	1344840	was called before, the independent, to indie games, what was it, what the hell was it called?
1344840	1345840	Community games.
1345840	1346840	Thank you.
1346840	1349240	Do you think the rebranding of community games to indie games has been successful?
1349240	1352520	Because it sure sounds like more people are following what's going on now.
1352520	1357880	I think though what's making it better is that they've dropped the price, the minimum
1357880	1358880	price.
1358880	1362000	Because before the minimum price used to be 200 Microsoft points, which is, you know,
1362000	1363000	80 points.
1363000	1368720	Now your lowest amount that you can charge for a game is 80 points or a dollar.
1368720	1373120	So, you know, surprisingly enough, that's still, a lot of people are just like, hey,
1373120	1374120	dollar, whatever.
1374120	1375120	You know, throw it in there.
1375120	1378320	You know, a lot of people may have 80 points left over after buying something.
1378320	1380160	So it's kind of cool in that way too.
1380160	1383920	But yeah, I mean, it's a lot easier just to buy stuff for 80 points.
1383920	1386240	I mean, it goes really fast.
1386240	1388120	It is unfortunate that the games don't have achievements.
1388120	1390480	I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand why.
1390480	1394360	Because obviously someone would make that game, you know, press A, get 200 gamer score.
1394360	1399680	But even if they would do achievements with a zero gamer score, or just, you know, because
1399680	1403120	there are plenty of achievements out there in the retail games that are just zero gamer
1403120	1404120	score.
1404120	1405440	It's just unlocking it.
1405440	1412240	Or maybe like a separate type of, not even achievements, but maybe like community badges.
1412240	1414840	I don't know what the hell they want to call it, but something maybe separate that, yeah,
1414840	1417280	that'd be kind of cool because no one let me compete against friends.
1417280	1419600	Because, you know, on those games, you can't really do the...
1419600	1424080	We would never do points because someone could just, you know, go, okay, you started the
1424080	1425080	game, 1000 points.
1425080	1426080	Right, right.
1426080	1427080	I get that.
1427080	1428080	Don't get me wrong.
1428080	1432200	But just something that, you know, kind of encourages a little bit of competition, you
1432200	1433200	know.
1433200	1434200	I don't know.
1434200	1435200	I'm just kind of brainstorming here.
1435200	1436200	I think ways they can make it even bigger.
1436200	1437200	I think they will later.
1437200	1438200	But just not right now.
1438200	1439200	All right.
1439200	1440200	Let's see.
1440200	1444920	As far as other games I've been playing this week, not really a whole lot.
1444920	1446620	I was playing Guild Wars for a little bit.
1446620	1447620	Not a lot.
1447620	1452080	But, you know, it's one of those MMOs I have that I'm not really paying for because I already
1452080	1453360	bought the game.
1453360	1458520	And Guild Wars' model is that once you buy the game, you can play online for free pretty
1458520	1459520	much forever.
1459520	1462280	So it's kind of cool that you can just go back and revisit it whenever you want.
1462280	1463280	I did.
1463280	1465520	Speaking of Guild Wars, and I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, I also watched
1465520	1467560	that trailer for Guild Wars 2.
1467560	1469580	Looks pretty sweet, I got to say.
1469580	1471440	So definitely keeping an eye on Guild Wars.
1471440	1472440	All right.
1472440	1475520	Let's get into some more gaming news tonight.
1475520	1479040	After some housekeeping, we do of course always want to plug some of the ways you can follow
1479040	1482520	us and join the community that we sometimes call the O.L. Army.
1482520	1489040	If you want to join our Twitter, www.Twitter.com slash O.L.R., also you can join us on Facebook.
1489040	1490040	Just search for the O.L. Army.
1490040	1493160	We're on LiveJournal as well in Orange Lounge.
1493160	1494160	Follow us.
1494160	1495160	Get involved with the community.
1495160	1500280	We try to read your comments and so forth on every show all the time.
1500280	1502160	Also some other comments from chat.
1502160	1507760	INGN0, INGO, I know how to spell this, or he's told me how to pronounce it before and
1507760	1511440	I always forget, asks, no Wolfenstein question mark.
1511440	1517000	No, not this week, especially, it's not really the type of game that I've been really eagerly
1517000	1518000	anticipating.
1518000	1521240	I played the old Wolfenstein 3D and that was about it for me.
1521240	1522240	I don't know.
1522240	1524560	Wolfenstein, any interest, Loki?
1524560	1525560	Nope.
1525560	1530680	I will tell you, this has got to be probably the first podcast or gaming blog anywhere
1530680	1533360	that did not talk about Shadow Complex this week.
1533360	1535760	I would have played it if my Xbox worked.
1535760	1541040	I looked at it and I was like, how much did I play Castlevania Symphony Night when I bought
1541040	1542040	that on 360?
1542040	1544640	Oh wait, no, I didn't buy it.
1544640	1546580	But still, all the more reason.
1546580	1547880	I'm probably not going to buy it.
1547880	1548880	I don't know.
1548880	1549880	I'll think about it.
1549880	1559040	But I haven't finished, you know, Bionic Commando and more than half a dozen, a few dozen games
1559040	1561280	that I've bought already.
1561280	1568120	I'm just kind of taking a break from buying full price Xbox Live Arcade games.
1568120	1572240	Now, don't get me wrong, if they ever came out with a Bionic Commando sequel that would
1572240	1578200	be on Xbox Live Arcade done the same fashion as, say, Re-Armed, then yes, I would probably
1578200	1579640	buy that in a heartbeat.
1579640	1584360	I have not seen a single person on the interwebs say that Shadow Complex sucks.
1584360	1586480	I have yet to see a tweet about it.
1586480	1587480	I don't know.
1587480	1588480	Chat, does it suck?
1588480	1589480	Just say it just to say it.
1589480	1591680	Like, if it really sucks, tell me why.
1591680	1595160	It seems like the reception of this game has been very, very positive.
1595160	1596800	And I do love the Metroidvania games.
1596800	1601200	I was looking at screenshots kind of going, doesn't look like the type of thing I normally
1601200	1602840	play, but I'll check it out.
1602840	1603840	It's fun, it's fun.
1603840	1605640	Doesn't matter what the theme is or what have you.
1605640	1609960	By the way, our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's always on before us on all games radio,
1609960	1612800	he starts at five o'clock Pacific on Sunday nights.
1612800	1616620	He is in chat saying, we are the second podcast to not mention Shadow Complex, even though
1616620	1620100	we did, because he was the first.
1620100	1621560	My bad.
1621560	1622640	Give credit where credit is due.
1622640	1624800	Beaten by one hour, curses!
1624800	1625800	Alright.
1625800	1630600	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, Shadow Complex or whatever the game is that we're
1630600	1631600	talking about.
1631600	1633720	And please, don't hear me wrong, I'm not bashing Shadow Complex.
1633720	1638920	Again, if my Xbox 360 hadn't fried last week, I would have gladly checked it out this week,
1638920	1641160	but you know, shit happens.
1641160	1644680	Alright, so Loki, get us started with some gaming news tonight.
1644680	1652240	Alright, so Microsoft had a little bit of a keynote during Gamescom this week, however
1652240	1653860	they didn't really discuss a whole lot.
1653860	1657640	Really the only thing they discussed was Fable.
1657640	1664120	So of course, I'm totally shocked that they announced a new Fable game, but Fable 3 will
1664120	1669840	be coming out next year, and they didn't really go into great detail what exactly you're going
1669840	1675160	to be doing, but apparently you will be, I guess, assuming that they're going to be playing
1675160	1680020	as the son or daughter of your Fable 2 hero, and you're going to be starting like a revolution
1680020	1686380	to become the new ruler of Albion, and of course, based on, you know, what you do as
1686380	1693580	a ruler, you know, that have obviously positive or negative effects on the world around you.
1693580	1698720	Just like Fable 2, and I'm sorry, but if it's just like Fable 2, then it's going to be all
1698720	1700600	hype, no content.
1700600	1704000	Well, not no content, but not as much content as promised.
1704000	1706120	I kind of liked Fable 2, but...
1706120	1710800	It was alright, but it just wasn't like, oh my god, the best game ever, as he was like,
1710800	1711800	you know, pitching it.
1711800	1717080	Well, Peter Molyneux kind of has a reputation for really, really hyping things beyond what
1717080	1722740	they really end up being, and you know why we all approach this project, Milo, with a
1722740	1725000	hint of skepticism, at least I do.
1725000	1730400	But I did like Fable 2 quite a bit, actually, it's one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of
1730400	1731400	last year.
1731400	1733620	But here's my question about Fable 3.
1733620	1736480	If you're going to be playing the child of a character in Fable 2, does that mean all
1736480	1741660	these decisions you made in Fable 2 ultimately are going to impact in Fable 3?
1741660	1743920	That didn't really happen in Fable 2 with Fable 1.
1743920	1748680	Yeah, I'm not really sure if that's the case, and they're just saying that the storyline's
1748680	1754280	basically that your, you know, hero is going to be, you know, it's their children, since
1754280	1760600	the game starts off in Fable 2 where you pick, you know, a sex, and that's basically it.
1760600	1767000	But I guess they said the game's going to take place 50 years after the first one, and
1767000	1774560	you play the child of the hero, Bowerstone has continued moving on, become quite industrial,
1774560	1777680	and the game's not just about Albion this time.
1777680	1782000	And they also said that half the game will be spent trying to ascend the power, and the
1782000	1785480	game will not turn into, like, a micromanagement RTS.
1785480	1790840	And then they're also going to have the judgment and touch systems, which will be used to influence
1790840	1791840	the world.
1791840	1796160	Basically, a judgment system was people will come to you and say, okay, this poor child,
1796160	1799240	you know, stole bread from this person.
1799240	1801860	Do you want to let them go or kill them, you know?
1801860	1807400	You can just, you know, obviously pick the right or wrong, whatever you feel is right
1807400	1808400	or wrong.
1808400	1809400	But you can't come up with creative punishments.
1809400	1814480	You can't say, you know, make them bake bread for the entire town or anything like that.
1814480	1821280	Yeah, it's like you can, you know, judge her immediately, like the person that stole food,
1821280	1823280	or you can investigate the situation.
1823280	1828560	Or you can set her on fire.
1828560	1830360	I vote for fire.
1830360	1833040	Clearly, your character was evil and fabled too.
1833040	1834920	No, mine was actually really good.
1834920	1837640	No, and you set people on fire, and you were good?
1837640	1839480	No, I just said I vote for fire.
1839480	1840840	I do like this feature.
1840840	1844620	Touch apparently will allow players to grab NPCs.
1844620	1850080	So for example, if, you know, somebody, if a child was in a burning building, you can
1850080	1854020	actually grab the child and pull them to safety instead of waiting for the child to figure
1854020	1858320	out how to get out of the burning building and probably dying in the process because
1858320	1862100	some of the AI wasn't that, I don't know.
1862100	1865400	That means if you're evil, you could grab them and throw them into the burning building.
1865400	1869240	That saying, like, you can also shake someone's hand or refuse to.
1869240	1874200	You can also embrace somebody, snog them.
1874200	1875200	I don't know.
1875200	1876200	Baby shake?
1876200	1880280	I hope you can throw them off cliffs.
1880280	1886640	Or even better, jump off a cliff while holding onto them and then drag them with you.
1886640	1887640	Throw your dog at them.
1887640	1891080	That would be kind of funny.
1891080	1893560	So yeah, that's basically the game.
1893560	1900320	It's, you know, becoming the king and it will be the best game ever, I'm sure, and somehow
1900320	1902720	they'll probably work in Milo in there or some crap.
1902720	1903720	I don't know.
1903720	1907240	Fable 3, my life as a king.
1907240	1911640	But yeah, that is, you know, basically Fable 3.
1911640	1915720	So it's, I don't know, it's neat.
1915720	1920900	Now the other thing that they talked about, because goddamn if Fable 3 wasn't enough,
1920900	1926040	they talked about Fable 2 Episodic, and people were thinking, oh my god, there's more content
1926040	1927040	coming.
1927040	1928040	Wrong.
1928040	1933400	Actually, Fable 2 Episodic is a pay-to-play version of Fable 2.
1933400	1937820	And basically Fable 2 had different, like, chapter points, I guess, in it.
1937820	1943520	And so the first chapter is free, and then of course, you know, once you're done with
1943520	1948320	that, you can choose to buy the next chapter or buy the rest of the game.
1948320	1953120	And I guess there's five episodes in total, and it's supposed to be released on September
1953120	1954840	29th.
1954840	1958040	And they didn't say how expensive the game will be.
1958040	1960920	I'm guessing around the same price as Fable 2.
1960920	1965680	Yeah, probably when you buy all five parts, or the last four or whatever it is, it ends
1965680	1968320	up being the same price as Fable 2, I'm sure.
1968320	1970180	Kind of an interesting business model, though.
1970180	1972340	What do you think about this?
1972340	1976720	It's clearly a test to see how well it's received, but what do you think of the business model?
1976720	1979520	I actually...
1979520	1984120	You know, for somebody with gaming ADD like me, who probably only played through a few
1984120	1988040	chapters of Fable 2, I mean, granted, I like the idea that I can go back and check it out
1988040	1989440	at any time.
1989440	1995320	I have to say, I'm actually a little more welcoming of this idea than you might think.
1995320	2000360	I think it's a good idea because Fable 2 didn't have a demo, and this would be a good way
2000360	2002800	to check out, you know, a game.
2002800	2006720	Say for example, you know, it's more of like an extended demo because you get to play through
2006720	2011560	the first part of the game for free, and then if you just, if you like it, then you can
2011560	2013680	go ahead and purchase it later.
2013680	2017900	Or if you're just on the fence about it, you know, you can buy the next chapter and see
2017900	2020000	if you still like it or something like that.
2020000	2023600	So it's not just dumping all the money.
2023600	2027800	But they are getting more money, though, out of you by charging you in an episodic manner
2027800	2030240	as opposed to buying the whole game.
2030240	2034080	Well, granted, we don't know how many points each part is going to cost yet.
2034080	2040040	I would assume so because, I mean, that's typically when you buy, for example, an individual
2040040	2043980	size of something or when you buy the six pack, you know.
2043980	2044980	That's a fair comparison.
2044980	2047960	Like, I was kind of thinking of it as a pizza, is that when you buy Fable 2, you get the
2047960	2049520	pizza, but now you can get a slice of pizza.
2049520	2051160	Oh, pizza sounds good.
2051160	2052160	Pizza does sound very good, actually.
2052160	2053160	Let's get pizza.
2053160	2054960	We might have to during break or something.
2054960	2056680	Wait a minute, you didn't bring food tonight, Loki.
2056680	2057680	You didn't.
2057680	2058680	I went sushi.
2058680	2059680	Oh, okay.
2059680	2065120	And then I had a TNT roll, which is, what is it, and it all comes back to food.
2065120	2066120	Hey, you asked.
2066120	2067120	My fault.
2067120	2068120	My fault.
2068120	2079720	So it was like McGrew, I want to say there's spicy yahi and yellowfin and some other stuff
2079720	2080720	in there.
2080720	2081720	But it was good and hot.
2081720	2082720	Spicy mayonnaise.
2082720	2086440	Comments from chat, because of course this seems to be lighting up our chat room a little
2086440	2087440	bit.
2087440	2088640	I think Bobby's on the same page we are.
2088640	2092720	Black Wolf in chat says, I like the episodic model because that way if I don't continue
2092720	2094240	the game, I'm not paying for the whole game.
2094240	2096560	I'm only paying for the part of the game that I finished.
2096560	2100240	Unfolded Raptor follows up with, but that's like watching 15 minutes of a movie then paying
2100240	2102000	for another 15 minutes.
2102000	2105680	Black Wolf says, well, you know, if I want to walk out of the movie after the first 15
2105680	2108240	minutes, I didn't pay for the entire two hour movie.
2108240	2113580	You know what's interesting is that you do see actually a lot of movie companies putting
2113580	2117400	out like the first eight minutes of a movie on the internet for you to watch.
2117400	2120920	Amazon does that with TV episodes that you can download.
2120920	2121920	And books.
2121920	2122920	Yeah.
2122920	2123920	We'll give you samples of the books.
2123920	2128280	I mean, it's a good idea, but I'm thinking that they should offer an incentive that if
2128280	2132800	you decide after the first episode that you want to buy the whole game, that they give
2132800	2136520	you an option to pay the difference.
2136520	2138220	Well that's the thing.
2138220	2139520	They're going to do that I think.
2139520	2142920	They're just basically, the first episode's free.
2142920	2147280	So after the first episode, you can, after each chapter I guess, you have the option
2147280	2153320	to purchase the rest of the game or just purchase the next chapter.
2153320	2155720	You know, this really could be.
2155720	2161420	We could be looking at the future of how we're going to pay for a lot of our games.
2161420	2164520	Especially if this is successful, I don't know how successful it will be because it's
2164520	2165800	not a new game.
2165800	2169280	I think a lot of people that were interested in this game already got it, but it's certainly
2169280	2174120	by tempting folks with a free chapter a way to entice folks to check it out maybe and
2174120	2175640	get a few more extra sales.
2175640	2178440	I can't see how that's going to be bad news for Microsoft or Lionhead.
2178440	2181920	It's the pot of the video game world.
2181920	2183160	Just one hit, man.
2183160	2188720	But the interesting thing is, I mean think about it, PSP Go, despite the crap we've given
2188720	2196000	it on this show for not being that much better than the PSP and especially price wise, is
2196000	2199080	going to be completely free of media.
2199080	2202160	It's going to be digital downloads only.
2202160	2207840	Nintendo DS, or the DSi I should say specifically is a large part, is going to be digital download
2207840	2208840	only.
2208840	2214200	Some of the biggest components and biggest games you see now on 360, PlayStation Network,
2214200	2217500	Nintendo WiiWare, are all download games.
2217500	2224600	I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the major players, Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft,
2224600	2233920	in the next console, and I think if anybody it's going to be Sony, says no media, no discs,
2233920	2238080	no Blu-ray, or you know this will play Blu-rays but the games do not come out on Blu-rays.
2238080	2241100	It will be 100% digital distribution.
2241100	2242400	And it will fail.
2242400	2243400	You think?
2243400	2244400	It will fail.
2244400	2245640	What if it's like this though?
2245640	2246640	It will still fail.
2246640	2248320	And you know why it's going to fail?
2248320	2250880	Because people like owning stuff and people like the option.
2250880	2255960	I don't have a problem with adding other ways you can purchase content if you decide that
2255960	2256960	you know what?
2256960	2259360	I don't feel like buying the game.
2259360	2264880	I can buy either the episode, I can buy the full digital download which is available on
2264880	2272680	their service as well, or I can go purchase the retail game out there and do that.
2272680	2277720	If I'm not given that option then that's kind of crappy and then you know what happens later
2277720	2282640	on with, say, your console dies.
2282640	2288040	I know a lot of times with the Playstation 3 and stuff I'm sure you can go re-download
2288040	2294200	all that stuff later because it's just tied to your account, but still though it's not,
2294200	2299720	you can't loan out your games, you can't sell used, I mean it's really, there's a lot more
2299720	2303600	factors in there, and people like the, I mean people like the collector crap.
2303600	2308120	I mean, hello, Modern Warfare 2 with some fucking night vision goggles.
2308120	2310920	Can't digitally download night vision goggles.
2310920	2312780	Look at my vault.
2312780	2316940	Maybe I'm apples to oranges here a little bit, but then tell me why iTunes and iPods
2316940	2318400	are so successful.
2318400	2323240	Because people that purchase Apple products are suckers for that kind of crap.
2323240	2326600	But you cannot deny iTunes is successful.
2326600	2332780	But seriously, what phone out there, okay, what phone has cartridges or discs that plug
2332780	2333780	into it?
2333780	2334920	No phone does.
2334920	2341200	So that kind of content is expected on there, and that's why it's not a big deal.
2341200	2347320	Now if Apple were to come out with, say, a console and decides that, okay, it's only
2347320	2351820	gonna be through like their app store, then people might not be so apt to it.
2351820	2355440	They might go, eh, you know what, I'm just gonna stick with a console that I can actually
2355440	2358060	purchase physical stuff for.
2358060	2359060	Very interesting.
2359060	2362320	A lot of negativity in the chat room on this idea.
2362320	2363320	Penelope.
2363320	2364320	Sorry.
2364320	2368720	In Penelope, there's a lot of, and not necessarily the Fable 2 thing, I'm talking about the what
2368720	2371800	if the next generation of gaming was all digital.
2371800	2376880	Let's see, we have Act Def says, it will fail.
2376880	2378720	Code Man says, I hate downloading games.
2378720	2380760	My internet connection is so slow.
2380760	2384260	Frisbee says, I like having a disc to hold or cart.
2384260	2388600	And I like this comment from Sex with the Elderly says, I can't wait till people start
2388600	2392060	stealing PSPs and all their content with it.
2392060	2396160	Then having no media will suck ass.
2396160	2404240	And I'm sorry, I don't know, we'll get into this later why the PSP goes sucks, because
2404240	2409600	we have to bring it up on every show, but they're really dumb.
2409600	2411080	I'm sorry.
2411080	2414400	Sony is so retarded, it is just mind boggling.
2414400	2418720	And if they decided that, you know what, we're not gonna have any media and it's gonna be
2418720	2423800	a purely digital download system, it's gonna fail.
2423800	2426280	It's gonna fail.
2426280	2431760	To be fair, I'm only picking on Sony because if the PSP goes any indication, this is what
2431760	2432760	they're thinking.
2432760	2435000	I don't think it's a good idea anyways with Microsoft either.
2435000	2439240	I probably wouldn't buy a console from Microsoft if it didn't have physical media.
2439240	2444120	And I think that they're gonna be more apt to having physical media because there's a
2444120	2447080	lot more exposure out there, whereas it's just their service.
2447080	2449360	What if someone doesn't have broadband internet?
2449360	2453740	Oops, can't buy your download content.
2453740	2454740	That's a problem.
2454740	2457940	But there are people out there that don't have internet, or maybe they're playing their
2457940	2461680	console in a spot that doesn't have internet and they just don't care.
2461680	2465480	But still, you know what, they can go out there and buy discs and they can plug them
2465480	2466480	into their system.
2466480	2469000	There's still consumers in that sense.
2469000	2475040	But if you get rid of that and just say, well, everybody by now should have internet, well
2475040	2476840	you're gonna still lose some sales.
2476840	2478880	And that's not a smart thing.
2478880	2485360	Now what you should do is open up as many different avenues for people to purchase content.
2485360	2489260	Like this with Fable 2 I think is a good idea because now you have three different options.
2489260	2492760	You can purchase the full game, you can purchase it by episode, or you can purchase the retail
2492760	2493760	copy.
2493760	2496200	Or hell, you can purchase the used retail copy out there.
2496200	2500840	So there's a lot of options for you, and options are never a bad thing.
2500840	2502960	I guess not.
2502960	2508160	Alright, well let's move on and talk about the Xbox.
2508160	2511800	And obviously one big topic that dominated last week's show was me bitching about my
2511800	2514280	Xbox having crashed.
2514280	2518140	And apparently that wasn't the only story that came up on Xbox failures last week.
2518140	2522720	Game Informer actually ran a report, and in the latest issue of Game Informer, they actually
2522720	2526820	did a survey where they surveyed 5,000 console owners.
2526820	2531960	And according to these 5,000 console owners, the Xbox 360's current failure rate because
2531960	2536920	of the E74 error, 54.2%.
2536920	2542160	Now to be fair, they also surveyed for the Playstation 3's, and their yellow light issues,
2542160	2548240	10.3% on those, and the Wii's, 6.8%.
2548240	2554920	Granted, despite the anger I was feeling last week, I think this number's a little skewed.
2554920	2558720	And I think we're all approaching this with a little bit of skepticism because who are
2558720	2560460	you surveying in this poll?
2560460	2562880	You're surveying gamers.
2562880	2571720	And I think, I can admit that I think those that go so far as to subscribe to a magazine
2571720	2576880	or so forth probably use their Xbox 360's on a pretty regular basis, maybe a little
2576880	2580860	bit heavier than some people who don't subscribe to magazines do.
2580860	2584640	And so I think, just by nature, the more you use your console, the more you're going to
2584640	2586080	open it up to failure.
2586080	2587520	That's just true of any piece of hardware.
2587520	2589680	The more you use it, the more it's likely to fail someday.
2589680	2590680	That's not true.
2590680	2594200	I mean, I guess it's true in general statement, but it shouldn't be failing at the rates that
2594200	2595200	they're talking about.
2595200	2596200	Well, I'll get to that.
2596200	2600320	But I'm talking about, it's inevitable that the more you use something, the more likely
2600320	2601320	it is to break.
2601320	2604240	That's just a fact.
2604240	2607340	But do I think this number is that far off?
2607340	2608340	Probably not.
2608340	2612160	I would say the real number is probably somewhere around a third.
2612160	2617760	But I still look at this and go, most companies that would have that type of failure rate
2617760	2624840	on some type of thing they put out, like a television, a CD player, a car, would recall
2624840	2625840	it.
2625840	2627120	They would be forced to recall it.
2627120	2628120	They can't.
2628120	2630240	It'd be bad PR.
2630240	2631240	And they've kind of-
2631240	2632240	And this is good PR?
2632240	2634960	Yes, it's good PR for them.
2634960	2641800	Because notice, even though it may have a 54% failure rate, people, they're still the
2641800	2647320	second largest console share in the United States.
2647320	2651760	People don't care because people will go out and buy a new console once their console breaks.
2651760	2653720	If it's out of warranty, they'll go buy a new one.
2653720	2654720	Because you know why?
2654720	2656240	Because the games are good.
2656240	2658840	They have a good library of games and people don't give a crap.
2658840	2664640	Well, see, it goes back to the system is only good as the games that are on it.
2664640	2668180	And you know what's, and actually that's probably the point as to, because I know there's been
2668180	2670480	people that have been asking, well, if you're so mad about it, why are you going to buy
2670480	2671480	another one?
2671480	2675240	And it's kind of like, well, dude, because I've invested all this money in the games,
2675240	2680920	not just the physical games and the, um, online games that selling them back.
2680920	2681920	I'm sorry.
2681920	2684920	That's, that's a waste of my money to just to buy them.
2684920	2690580	If I sold back all of my games to rebuy them on PS3, I would be able to buy like one fifth.
2690580	2693400	If that of the games on PS3, you know what I mean?
2693400	2698040	And plus fact of the matter is some games I want to play are only on Xbox.
2698040	2699200	You know what I mean?
2699200	2704280	So yeah, I do feel a little bit pigeonholed where if I'm not able to repair this, then
2704280	2705680	I'm going to have to just buy a new one.
2705680	2710640	I would think though that the failure rate is probably around that 54%.
2710640	2714880	I've had what I have had maybe a total of eight consoles and I think five of them died
2714880	2715880	at one point.
2715880	2717280	Well, it's interesting.
2717280	2721920	Everybody has their own ideas and everybody has their own interpretations of these results.
2721920	2725360	You know, I think we can all agree it ain't 54.2%.
2725360	2728360	That's obviously a skewed statistic, which way it's skewed.
2728360	2730560	That's open to interpretation.
2730560	2734440	Microsoft responded to it this week, by the way, and here was their response.
2734440	2736240	And this was in a statement to T-
2736240	2738040	I know what I said.
2738040	2739040	What's that?
2739040	2741960	Well, you tell me if this sounds like to you.
2741960	2742960	Okay.
2742960	2748080	In a statement to TG Daily, Microsoft stands behind the Xbox 360 as a superior entertainment
2748080	2750800	console with one of the best warranties in the industry.
2750800	2754720	We are constantly improving the design, manufacture, and performance of the console through extensive
2754720	2757160	testing of potential sources of any problems.
2757160	2761360	Xbox 360 is pleased to maintain the title of most played console and the vast majority
2761360	2766440	of the Xbox 360 customers have enjoyed a terrific gaming and entertainment experience since
2766440	2771040	their first day and continue to day in and day out.
2771040	2773480	That entire statement is true.
2773480	2776400	But the thing is, they're not addressing the real problem.
2776400	2778680	That isn't the most smoke up my ass I've ever heard.
2778680	2779680	No, it's that-
2779680	2780680	It is.
2780680	2782000	That entire statement is true.
2782000	2783000	But here's the thing though.
2783000	2784920	They're dancing around the real issue.
2784920	2785920	That's the problem.
2785920	2791160	Yes, they are continually upgrading their systems and making them better and stuff like
2791160	2792160	that.
2792160	2793160	Yes, their warranty is pretty awesome.
2793160	2796000	Three years warranty is really cool.
2796000	2798160	And yes, that people do enjoy their console.
2798160	2803000	However, they failed to address that their first line of systems that came out the first
2803000	2807440	few revisions suck so bad that more than half of them have failed.
2807440	2814320	And in fact, I would be surprised if not all of them failing at some point.
2814320	2818960	The newer systems though, the newer revisions, the newer motherboards and stuff that they're
2818960	2821040	putting out, less likely to fail.
2821040	2822040	Yes.
2822040	2829040	And probably up to par with, I'd say, the other consoles around that 10% range.
2829040	2834340	But a lot of people did buy to launch or at least relatively close to launch and all their
2834340	2837960	consoles are going to fail at some point or another and it's just a matter of time.
2837960	2839560	It's like a ticking time bomb.
2839560	2840560	That is the problem.
2840560	2845360	Yes, you're continually making them better, but you fucked up in the beginning and that's
2845360	2850080	a big problem and you needed to recall all of them and get them all back and give them
2850080	2851940	the new revisions.
2851940	2853460	That would be the proper thing to do.
2853460	2863000	I wasn't going to quite say that much, but I don't know.
2863000	2864720	It's a tricky issue.
2864720	2868200	In the age of the internet, in gaming, we haven't really seen something like this before,
2868200	2869900	but I'm sorry.
2869900	2876240	You can't tell me that the PS3 and the Wii failure rates are anything close to this.
2876240	2877240	Close to this.
2877240	2880560	Because they rushed to get it to market and yes, it benefited them in the fact that their
2880560	2886860	install base is a lot bigger, however, their hardware is kind of shoddy.
2886860	2891000	I do find it fascinating they dance around the statistic in their response.
2891000	2892500	They never deny it.
2892500	2893500	Notice that.
2893500	2896320	In the response, they don't deny it at all.
2896320	2899100	I think they expected it.
2899100	2902520	But here's the thing, what they say at the end of their statement, as much as that's
2902520	2906040	blowing smoke up my ass, it's true.
2906040	2910860	The fact that they do have a choke hold on a lot of the big games out there on the market
2910860	2915600	right now that can only be played on Xbox 360 and that they are doing a lot of things
2915600	2923280	right in that regard outside of just the system itself is kind of hard to deny.
2923280	2929340	That's why I'm essentially, I guess some of you might say, taking it a little bit.
2929340	2936840	But at the same time, I think if you're a consumer out there and you haven't bought
2936840	2941200	a 360 yet and you're worried that, okay, if I buy a 360 it's going to fail, I think that
2941200	2946280	worry right now, it shouldn't be a worry because now the systems have gotten to the point though
2946280	2949200	where they aren't failing like they were doing before.
2949200	2953600	And I think it is safe to buy it now because of all the hardware revisions they've done.
2953600	2957440	What they really should have done is all those revisions before the console was released,
2957440	2962440	but hey, they made a huge mistake and now they're in the process of trying to pick up
2962440	2964240	the pieces and fixing the problem.
2964240	2966200	But yeah, will people forget about this?
2966200	2968280	Will people remember this for the next console launch?
2968280	2973060	Yeah, you better damn believe it and there will be a lot of people probably waiting and
2973060	2978300	seeing if there's going to be issues with their next console.
2978300	2981920	By the way, if you're curious what I decided to do with my Xbox 360, I am-
2981920	2984160	He's going to set it on fire and throw it off a cliff.
2984160	2985160	I might.
2985160	2991160	No, I decided I'm going to, although that would be kind of fun actually, but I'm going
2991160	2992160	to give it a try.
2992160	2996080	I'm going to let Loki try to fix it because he knows how to fix them apparently, so I
2996080	2997080	will let him try.
2997080	2998960	I have a 50% success rate here.
2998960	3003400	Well, I'll take my chance.
3003400	3007280	This way I don't have to ship it off and pay those costs or anything and Loki will do it
3007280	3008280	for free.
3008280	3009280	Yep.
3009280	3010640	And I'll pay for parts or whatever.
3010640	3015080	Also, if it doesn't work, then I know Bobby has a friend that will buy for parts, so I
3015080	3019840	will send it to the junkyard to be scrapped at the pick and pull basically of Xbox 360s.
3019840	3025080	I will do that unless they don't want it because Loki ruins it, then I will set it on fire
3025080	3026080	and throw it off the cliff.
3026080	3027080	I'll try not to ruin it too much.
3027080	3030840	All right, try it please because I do want to send it off to the virtual pick and pull
3030840	3032880	if that happens.
3032880	3037440	And I will, if I have to because Loki can't fix it, not that I don't have faith in Loki,
3037440	3040440	but if Loki can't fix it, then I am not going to buy an Xbox 360 Elite.
3040440	3043920	I'm not going to wait for the price drop because I decided that was a stupid idea.
3043920	3048800	Why would I in turn give Microsoft more money for their high-end console?
3048800	3050400	Because the first one failed.
3050400	3051400	That was dumb.
3051400	3052960	That was an e-jerk reaction of mine.
3052960	3054120	I take it back.
3054120	3061440	I would instead buy the lowest, cheapest end Xbox 360 I can buy that's not used.
3061440	3065280	Because if I go for the $199 Xbox Arcade, I don't need a hard drive.
3065280	3066280	I have one.
3066280	3068800	I don't need the fancy black color or whatever.
3068800	3071320	The HDMI is on the arcades now.
3071320	3073360	I'm fine.
3073360	3076560	And then at least I'll have HDMI moving forward.
3076560	3078880	That's my plan.
3078880	3081680	And Bobby is saying that his friend will want it even ruined.
3081680	3082680	Great.
3082680	3083780	So Loki, have fun.
3083780	3084780	If you fix it, great.
3084780	3086640	If you don't, off to the pick and pull.
3086640	3089360	I'm hoping that we're on the positive end of my 50%.
3089360	3090360	Let's see.
3090360	3091360	We'll see.
3091360	3092360	Hey, I've got to tell you the one-
3092360	3094580	We'll update your win-loss ratio here on our Twitter.
3094580	3099120	And the one that did work, that was successful, still works today.
3099120	3100120	It still works.
3100120	3101120	It's awesome.
3101120	3102880	I keep waiting for it to fail again, but-
3102880	3105440	I will donate my 360 to science.
3105440	3107440	That is what I'm doing.
3107440	3108440	Alright.
3108440	3111000	Well, hey, question.
3111000	3116600	When you did your repairs, was your failure rate closer to the beginning or closer to
3116600	3117600	the end?
3117600	3118600	It was the end.
3118600	3119600	Uh-huh.
3119600	3121200	The first one worked flawlessly.
3121200	3123400	Second one, not so much.
3123400	3125240	Well, that's okay, because you know what?
3125240	3128560	You can still be in business, because your failure rate is close to Microsoft's failure
3128560	3129560	rate, and they're still kicking.
3129560	3130560	Exactly.
3130560	3131560	So you know what?
3131560	3132560	Off to Loki's repair shop.
3132560	3135080	And I blame their console for my failure anyways.
3135080	3136080	Alright.
3136080	3141920	Let's move on, because I'm just going to get more angsty comments if I continue on this
3141920	3144000	whole tirade with the 360 and so forth.
3144000	3146560	It is a tricky line here.
3146560	3153840	I do feel a sense of, damn it, shit, fuck, with the whole Xbox 360 red ringing.
3153840	3156320	But at the same time, I do understand shit happens.
3156320	3159120	But it just makes me- I don't know if angry is the right word.
3159120	3160120	It makes me irritated.
3160120	3161120	Did you try doing it without the-
3161120	3162120	Shut up.
3162120	3167520	It makes me irritated that so many people are having the same problem, and yet Microsoft
3167520	3169360	just says, well, but we're still cool.
3169360	3170360	We're still the best.
3170360	3172280	Did you try it without the hard drive?
3172280	3173280	You know what?
3173280	3174280	I didn't.
3174280	3177920	I just decided I've been having, in my personal life, I've been having the most shitty week
3177920	3178920	you could possibly imagine.
3178920	3181000	I'm faking it really well on the show tonight.
3181000	3185240	Here's the thing, is that I just decided I'm not going to make my week worse by even trying
3185240	3186240	that 360 this week.
3186240	3187240	Alright.
3187240	3188240	No problem.
3188240	3189240	I'll take care of it.
3189240	3190240	I promise.
3190240	3191240	I will.
3191240	3192240	Well, how about other stuff, huh?
3192240	3193240	Yes.
3193240	3199920	How about some stuff about something that I particularly am sick of hearing about, but
3199920	3202320	it is newsworthy.
3202320	3204320	How about some World of Warcraft stuff?
3204320	3205320	Alright.
3205320	3208040	For all of you addicts, pop the vein.
3208040	3210040	It's time to go.
3210040	3215480	Well, you know, they had the whole cataclysm, whatever the fuck thing that they're doing,
3215480	3221680	and they have the new races, the goblin and wargun, which actually look kind of cool.
3221680	3223040	I thought, like werewolves-
3223040	3224040	Shocking.
3224040	3225560	That's totally unexpected.
3225560	3231240	And they've raised the cap to 85 for levels, but now they're going back and revamping old
3231240	3234420	zones and changing them completely.
3234420	3241440	Like since the big cataclysm thing, some areas are destroyed, and then some of the places
3241440	3249240	like Desolace and the Barrens are becoming green.
3249240	3253260	They're redesigning cities so that you can fly.
3253260	3261040	And actually in Undercity 2, they are actually having more interaction with the terrain.
3261040	3263800	You can have flooding happen.
3263800	3268440	So also seven new zones.
3268440	3275720	Like Uldum, Mount Hyjal, and the Sunken City, which is an undersea zone, so you get underwater
3275720	3277800	mounts and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
3277800	3281680	Twilight Highlands, and Deepholm.
3281680	3286060	Sounds very dwarfy in name.
3286060	3288640	So all the rumors we heard about last week were essentially true.
3288640	3289640	Yeah.
3289640	3292040	It's a new profession, archaeology.
3292040	3295080	Oh, so you can be your Indiana Jones, but a goblin.
3295080	3298000	You know what, that actually would be enough to have me try it out.
3298000	3299000	The archaeology edition.
3299000	3300000	Really?
3300000	3304000	Yeah, because I'd really like to see how something like that would enhance your character.
3304000	3309840	It's been a while since I've played, but honestly though, I'm sticking with RO.
3309840	3312400	I don't know if this is enough to get me back to WoW.
3312400	3314520	I guess I have to see it when the expansion comes out.
3314520	3315520	Never say never.
3315520	3318760	I said I would never go back to Final Fantasy XI, and I did for a month, so whatever.
3318760	3322720	But you know, I do think it's interesting because they've been talking about revamping
3322720	3329400	old Azeroth for a long time, and now they're going to do it and make you pay for it.
3329400	3333120	But I mean, to be fair, it does sound like they're doing a lot to it, and from what I
3333120	3337440	understand, even the free players, or I shouldn't say free players, but even those without the
3337440	3343060	expansion will still get some of those benefits because Azeroth is going to change basically
3343060	3344680	to accommodate this new expansion.
3344680	3347640	So it's interesting.
3347640	3351720	I do think some of the other things that they've talked about briefly, like the guild leveling
3351720	3356880	and the guild charts and so forth, it will probably lead to more guild drama, but I do
3356880	3357880	find it interesting.
3357880	3359920	Well, there is some other stuff.
3359920	3366320	There's a little bit more as far as the racial abilities for the new races.
3366320	3371520	For Worgen, you can switch between human and Worgen form instantaneously at will.
3371520	3376320	You have Dark Flight, which increases movement speed by 70% for 10 seconds with a 3 minute
3376320	3377840	cooldown.
3377840	3385200	Viciousness, you have Flare, and then Goblins are basically like the Ferengi of the Horde.
3385200	3386200	They're the businessmen.
3386200	3387200	Makes sense.
3387200	3388200	Yeah, that's a good comparison.
3388200	3390160	So you can...
3390160	3391160	There's actually a...
3391160	3392160	You kind of look like Qwark too.
3392160	3393960	A skill called...
3393960	3396480	I wonder if you can give them Umax.
3396480	3397480	You know where...
3397480	3398480	Anyway.
3398480	3400320	I wonder if they can make me a warp core breach.
3400320	3402040	Do they have the lobes for business?
3402040	3404480	God, it's so nerdy.
3404480	3407280	But Best Deals Anywhere is one of their skills.
3407280	3412700	Better Living Through Chemistry, which increases Alchemy skill by 15 points.
3412700	3414800	And I like Time is Money.
3414800	3419280	So it increases attack and casting speed by 1%.
3419280	3426240	The Archeology skill gives you the ability to excavate hidden items in ruins.
3426240	3433320	You can do research notes that let you unlock new abilities for the Path of the Titans character
3433320	3434640	progression.
3434640	3438980	So go flip that whip.
3438980	3442120	I think personally as a WoW player, I think Goblins are annoying.
3442120	3443880	I would never want to play as one.
3443880	3448440	I was disappointed to hear that.
3448440	3449760	Well the...
3449760	3454640	For other stuff going on with that, with the new dungeons, I actually have the level list
3454640	3456840	up for the 5-man dungeons.
3456840	3460800	You know, I don't want to say 5-man, I'm going to say 5-character dungeons.
3460800	3462040	That works for me.
3462040	3463320	Or a party of 5.
3463320	3464320	Or Sentai.
3464320	3465320	Ahhhh.
3465320	3466320	Anyway.
3466320	3470680	Grim Battle is 85.
3470680	3473920	Skywall is 80-82.
3473920	3479160	Abyssal Maw is 80-83 and an 82-84.
3479160	3481040	Deep Home is 80-83.
3481040	3484320	Uldum is 83-84 and an 85.
3484320	3487080	Blackrock Caverns for level 85.
3487080	3494560	And then they do 5-person versions of 2 of the older dungeons.
3494560	3500960	The Deadmines has a level 85 version and Shadowfang Keep.
3500960	3501960	Also new...
3501960	3506040	And for those that don't know, those are some beloved old school instances from original
3506040	3507400	WoW.
3507400	3514920	And then for new raids, 2 of them have been revealed.
3514920	3522540	One is the Firelands, and one of them is called Nefarian's Throne Room, which features Blackwing
3522540	3527440	Lairs and Boss Nefarian, hence the name Har Har.
3527440	3533320	I do think it's interesting, this whole heroic Deadmines thing, because if you play original
3533320	3538240	Deadmines at the level you're supposed to be playing Deadmines at, it takes forever.
3538240	3541680	So it's going to be interesting to see if they scale it back so Deadmines does not take
3541680	3547040	as long to get through, or if it's still going to be like an epic 4 hour run.
3547040	3552520	Well they're also putting in, with the 3.3 patch, there's a panel that's cross-server
3552520	3559160	LFG for 5-man dungeons, so you can get more people together to do.
3559160	3560160	They're also...
3560160	3561160	That's needed, actually.
3561160	3563960	There's also new race combinations available now.
3563960	3570120	You have Human Hunter, Orc Mage, Night Elf Mage, Blood Elf Warrior, Dwarf Shaman, Dwarf
3570120	3576560	Mage, Undead Hunter, Tauren Paladin, Tauren Priest, Gnome Priest, and Troll Druid.
3576560	3583720	There's a stat overhaul, the stats are being simplified.
3583720	3592520	So you have your spell power, MP5 armor penetration, all of that's gone.
3592520	3595880	It's really just a whole bunch of them, it's actually all up on the WoW page.
3595880	3604160	For other class changes, just look on the panel on your thing, it's all there.
3604160	3612320	Flying mounts are available in Azeroth, so you can fly around all you want to.
3612320	3614440	And thank heavens.
3614440	3619800	You have your guild progression, they actually have a numerical method now.
3619800	3626760	You have rated Battlegrounds, new PvP changes, a bunch of other crap.
3626760	3630280	And a bunch of other stuff that I personally don't care about.
3630280	3633280	It sounds like it's going to be a pretty good expansion, a good swift kick in the pants
3633280	3634360	to the game.
3634360	3638280	That's one thing Blizzard likes to do, they really like to change that game up.
3638280	3640720	That game is nothing like it used to be, you know what I mean?
3640720	3647840	I think that that's, honestly, the whole point that I see with that is, this is how, going
3647840	3651680	through their head, well, people get tired of the same old, same old, same old, same
3651680	3652680	old.
3652680	3655080	You know, people are going to leave when they get bored with it.
3655080	3660200	Well, why not give them no excuse to get bored, why not make something new?
3660200	3666400	However, the thing that bored me was the way the game plays in general, and the fact that
3666400	3672120	there's a bunch of idiots playing it, so that's still not enough to- I mean, I would like
3672120	3673120	to-
3673120	3674360	You probably have to find the right click to play with.
3674360	3676160	I would like to check it out.
3676160	3680320	You know, I think I might consider looking at it.
3680320	3684200	You know, I certainly haven't installed World of Warcraft on this computer, and I still
3684200	3688200	have my account, you know.
3688200	3694480	It might be worth it for me to check out, but certainly not until I'm, you know, healed
3694480	3700160	up enough to be able to play a game that requires a keyboard.
3700160	3701160	And we'll see.
3701160	3702680	I have other MMOs I want to check out for now.
3702680	3703680	Please play R.O. with me.
3703680	3707000	I want to look at Aion, Aion's out next month, I'm definitely going to pick that up.
3707000	3708000	I want to play that.
3708000	3709000	It's out next month, you should.
3709000	3710000	Check it out.
3710000	3711000	Aion-
3711000	3712000	Star Trek!
3712000	3714000	And then Star Trek next year, and Final Fantasy XIV.
3714000	3715000	Yeah.
3715000	3719840	No, some of the gameplay video came out for that from Gamescom, ho ho ho ho ho.
3719840	3720840	That looks sweet.
3720840	3721840	Did you see it?
3721840	3722840	Doesn't it look sweet?
3722840	3723840	Uh huh.
3723840	3725840	I am sorry, but I am all over Final Fantasy XIV.
3725840	3726840	Star Trek!
3726840	3727840	Because I have to-
3727840	3728840	That looks great.
3728840	3734840	I have to make the O.L.A.rian, and I've already started picking races that I want to make
3734840	3737240	the O.L.A.rians from.
3737240	3739880	Well you go on with your bad self.
3739880	3740880	They're going to be orange.
3740880	3743400	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
3743400	3749480	Well speaking of something that leaked out way early anyways, the PS3 Slim has finally
3749480	3750480	been announced.
3750480	3753400	Oh my god, didn't know that was coming.
3753400	3759320	But yes, it is coming out and oddly enough, or I guess it's not really odd at all, but
3759320	3763120	you remember all those box shots and stuff that were being leaked out and that kind of
3763120	3764120	stuff?
3764120	3765120	Yeah, those were all authentic.
3765120	3773800	So, the new Slim system is 30% smaller, or actually 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and uses
3773800	3776200	34% less power.
3776200	3785680	It comes with a 120GB hard drive, and of course, at the new price of $299, and that is actually
3785680	3793600	going to be released supposedly in the first week of September, but you know, according
3793600	3798520	to Gamestop, it's actually supposed to be coming out next week, or as early as next
3798520	3807960	week, but basically we'll be replacing the 80GB system and the 160GB system that they
3807960	3809680	had out already.
3809680	3813920	Which just goes to prove that whenever you try to put out a cease and desist, you're
3813920	3816200	only validating the material.
3816200	3824040	Yep, and on top of all this, they dropped the 80GB system to $299 as well, and they
3824040	3829800	also dropped the 160GB system to $399, which begs the question, why the hell did you do
3829800	3830800	that?
3830800	3831800	At least in that order.
3831800	3834960	I mean, they totally don't get it.
3834960	3836760	Why would you drop the price of those two systems?
3836760	3838400	I understand to clear them out.
3838400	3839400	That's fine.
3839400	3840720	That makes perfect sense.
3840720	3843720	But then you announce the new system at the same time.
3843720	3849880	Okay, great, so now I have these new Slim 120GB systems in my store with 80GB systems that
3849880	3850880	are the same price.
3850880	3851880	Duh!
3851880	3853920	Am I going to buy the new system?
3853920	3856280	Does it have a larger hard drive for the same price?
3856280	3858080	Yeah, I think I will.
3858080	3862280	And at the same time, would you really spend an extra $100 for an extra 40GB on your hard
3862280	3863560	drive?
3863560	3864560	Probably not.
3864560	3866760	So you've just rendered those two other systems completely useless.
3866760	3869560	Maybe they'll bundle in a game or a movie?
3869560	3870560	They bundle in a game.
3870560	3875360	They bundle in the first Uncharted with the first one, with the 160GB system.
3875360	3877720	But really, is that still worth the extra?
3877720	3881000	You're basically paying for the game and then a little bit extra for the hard drive, so
3881000	3882360	that's not really a good deal anyways.
3882360	3885200	And you can probably buy Uncharted for cheap anyways.
3885200	3888240	Yeah, I don't know all that.
3888240	3895080	There's also been a discovery, apparently when they were registering the Slim, I guess,
3895080	3901040	with the FCC and all this, you know, trademarks and that kind of stuff, they were using false
3901040	3902040	business names.
3902040	3906480	I guess Sand Dollar Enterprise, some fictitious businesses.
3906480	3910880	Thank you Sony, now you have been found out and people are going to be looking for that
3910880	3911880	crap now.
3911880	3917840	So, and they did, and they now found that there's also been an FCC, I guess, filing
3917840	3925480	for another SKU that's going to be with a 250GB hard drive, so that's probably coming
3925480	3926480	later on.
3926480	3927760	So, great!
3927760	3930720	Now we know that there's a larger hard drive system coming out later on, why the hell are
3930720	3933480	we going to, you know, if you're really not in a hurry to buy a system, you'll probably
3933480	3934480	want to wait.
3934480	3937200	Well, this other one might be more money too.
3937200	3938200	It probably will be.
3938200	3943280	Plus, I still don't really know, what do I put on this hard drive?
3943280	3948080	All those games installs, because, you know, most of the games that are released now on
3948080	3953200	BluRay do require an install because their drive is slow.
3953200	3960880	And the other thing too, in case you're wondering, the system did get rid of the alternative
3960880	3965680	operating system install as well, so if you're thinking about installing Linux on this Slim
3965680	3969800	system, you are dead wrong, that will be happening.
3969800	3970800	So uh...
3970800	3971800	They'll find a way.
3971800	3975400	So way to go, Sony, removing features from your system as well now.
3975400	3979960	We know they're going to find a way, the Linux community is stubborn.
3979960	3985480	Plus, how many people really, honestly, are getting the Playstation 3 to install Linux
3985480	3986480	on it?
3986480	3988600	And it's not like the fat ones are hard to find.
3988600	3991120	It's only offering them a challenge now.
3991120	3997080	I mean, seriously, I mean, people may have been okay with not doing it because, you know,
3997080	4003000	it's readily available now, but the thing is, why would you remove that?
4003000	4008080	I understand that you don't need to necessarily do that, but really, did that cost anything
4008080	4009080	to them?
4009080	4010080	No?
4010080	4011080	Not really?
4011080	4015560	Oh, the other funny thing too is it takes two seconds longer to boot up each time, for
4015560	4016560	whatever reason.
4016560	4017560	Strange.
4017560	4018560	Yeah.
4018560	4019560	Hmm.
4019560	4022280	Maybe it must be some of the new chips they're using or something.
4022280	4023280	It's the new firmware.
4023280	4024280	Ah.
4024280	4028000	Well, speaking of the new firmware, that is coming out soon, 3.0 Firmware is going to
4028000	4032240	be doing a total revamp at the cross-media bar, and adding a new What's New section.
4032240	4036160	It's replacing the information board, and I guess now, whenever you start your PS3,
4036160	4039960	you're going to get this interactive Playstation news, whatever that means.
4039960	4044120	It'll actually be under the Playstation Network icon, and you can see the latest game, video,
4044120	4047400	Playstation Network news release in some type of animated format.
4047400	4050960	I'm assuming that's like that whole, when you hover your mouse over, or not the mouse,
4050960	4054360	but you know what I mean, when you have the thing in place, you can kind of see in the
4054360	4057520	background, some of the stuff, except now you can interact with that background, if
4057520	4059640	that makes sense at all.
4059640	4062160	Also, a status indicator is coming.
4062160	4065640	This will be located in the top right corner of your Playstation 3.
4065640	4072280	It'll show your user icon that you have, however many friends that you have that are online,
4072280	4075200	and also, most importantly, a little mail indicator if you have any new messages.
4075200	4076200	So, that's pretty cool.
4076200	4080760	Also, we'll have a little scrolling tick bar with the latest news from PSN, which I think
4080760	4082160	they already kind of have.
4082160	4085720	So, that'll just be adapted into this new status indicator.
4085720	4091520	Also, apparently, now when you hit the PS button, no longer will the battery life indicator
4091520	4093000	sit right on top of the clock.
4093000	4096760	You know what's kind of cool, though, is those new dynamic themes that they have.
4096760	4099280	Have you seen those?
4099280	4102120	They're animated themes now, that you can have in the background, so like they have
4102120	4106600	a little big planet one where the Sackboy's running on, you know, a planet.
4106600	4111240	And I guess you also now have premium avatars, they're saying.
4111240	4112640	Animated avatars.
4112640	4114600	Like your little icons that you have?
4114600	4116240	Yeah, we'll be animated now.
4116240	4117240	Interesting.
4117240	4119680	The friends list is getting also reformatted.
4119680	4123080	Shortcuts to the Playstation store, because naturally they want to make it easier for
4123080	4127720	you to buy stuff, and apparently a big change coming to trophies.
4127720	4132880	With 3.0 firmware, game developers will now be able to modify how trophies are displayed
4132880	4135160	for add-on content.
4135160	4140600	So apparently you still have the list combined when you're looking at the Playstation network
4140600	4145800	or what have you, but I guess the developers have the freedom to use subcategories and
4145800	4146800	all this stuff.
4146800	4147800	Could be interesting.
4147800	4148800	Well, that's cool.
4148800	4151240	Did it add a trophy room that they promised us years ago for this thing?
4151240	4153160	Yeah, but that was a home update, wasn't it?
4153160	4154160	Well, yeah.
4154160	4155160	But still.
4155160	4156160	Where's my trophy room?
4156160	4158360	I'm just kind of curious what ever happened to that.
4158360	4160800	I guess they had some big problems, I don't know.
4160800	4161800	Oh, I know what it is.
4161800	4163840	Let's promise and then wait to deliver.
4163840	4169920	Sg100Matt in our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com asks an interesting question about Playstation.
4169920	4173800	Why is it that with each new incuration of the PS3, it keeps losing features?
4173800	4178640	It's lost backwards compatibility, flash card reader, fewer USB slots, and now the inability
4178640	4180000	to install an OS onto it.
4180000	4183240	Is it just me, or shouldn't a console evolve with each new SKU?
4183240	4186920	From the looks of it, it's devolving so much that we will lose controller support in two
4186920	4187920	years.
4187920	4189520	Obviously, that part was sarcastic.
4189520	4193800	They're dropping stuff out of the system to cut the cost of the system because that's
4193800	4198520	the only way they can drop it to $299 without losing $500 or whatever on each system.
4198520	4202480	But I thought backwards compatibility was all software based now.
4202480	4206080	And it's not the whole PS2 in your PS3 like it was at the beginning.
4206080	4209280	I thought so too, but for whatever reason, maybe licensing.
4209280	4213080	I can't imagine it would be licensing though because Linux is free.
4213080	4217000	I mean it's not even really, I mean you don't even have to...
4217000	4220920	You're buying, or you're not really buying, you're downloading Linux anyways off the internet
4220920	4222160	and installing it to it.
4222160	4225280	It's not like it's already there or something like that.
4225280	4229400	Alright, we got one more story from Jamie, then we're gonna get into some release dates.
4229400	4231600	Um, I got a pony.
4231600	4232600	There's my story.
4232600	4233600	No, I'm kidding.
4233600	4234600	Congrats.
4234600	4237200	Um, well you know me, a big comic book nerd.
4237200	4242200	Well this is news that makes me particularly happy as long as they get good comics.
4242200	4249160	There's a digital comic reader that's gonna be on the PSP in December.
4249160	4256960	They actually are working with Marvel to have hundreds of comics available, which is actually,
4256960	4261040	it really goes in along with what Marvel's been doing lately with their digital comics
4261040	4264880	and their motion comic that they've been doing lately.
4264880	4267200	So um, but this is pretty cool.
4267200	4277440	You get also Archie and Image comics and um, but they're not saying though if it's gonna
4277440	4281440	be a free upgrade or if it's something that you have to buy or if you have to buy the
4281440	4282440	comics or whatever.
4282440	4284080	I'm sure you have to buy the comics themselves.
4284080	4287120	Well I mean, you know what I mean, if you get a subscription service or something.
4287120	4288120	Oh okay.
4288120	4294640	So they haven't listed the specifics, but we should be hearing something before too
4294640	4298600	long.
4298600	4299600	What do you guys think?
4299600	4303320	Is this something as a comic book fan you uh, are really excited about, Dark Saga?
4303320	4306480	Um, well I like actually buying comics.
4306480	4314520	I mean I love going to the store and I mean I, I read a bunch of digital comics anyway,
4314520	4321800	but you know what, actually now that I think about it, I will, I don't really use our PSP
4321800	4326080	that much, but if I did, I would be interested in it because I actually have downloaded a
4326080	4329200	number of comics um, on my iPhone.
4329200	4337240	I was, I read like the first uh, three graphic novels of Bone on my uh, on my uh, iPhone
4337240	4343120	and I downloaded the uh, Star Trek uh, movie countdown, the tie-in that was supposed to
4343120	4349360	be the prequel to the events in the movie and I, I thought that was very convenient.
4349360	4353160	It was definitely cheaper than going and you know, paying three bucks for the issue.
4353160	4359960	Um, but then again, I've gone right out and I've bought the, I'm reading the, the Nero
4359960	4364600	comics about you know, the deleted scenes pretty much for what happened in the movie.
4364600	4366080	Um, it's, it's a good idea.
4366080	4367080	I think it's a good idea.
4367080	4372120	I think that a lot of people use their PSPs as a multimedia tool and I think it's going
4372120	4375760	to be a really good thing and Marvel I know would have to be behind it because they have
4375760	4380280	been pushing the whole digital comic thing, you know, pretty hardcore, so.
4380280	4383640	Um, Akdeft in our chat room says, I hope it's subscription based.
4383640	4387720	SH-2100 Matt says, what does DC Comics have to say about this?
4387720	4392640	They did make the DC Universe game PS3 exclusive and now they're supporting its competition.
4392640	4395560	But this doesn't strike me as the type of thing that DC Comics like, couldn't get in
4395560	4397040	on as well if they wanted to.
4397040	4398040	Yeah.
4398040	4401360	I, I think that, well and on top of that, you know, DC and Marvel have teamed up before,
4401360	4407720	I mean, for a number of, of things, I think that, you know, DC would have to hop in on
4407720	4412560	this and it's, it would be good for all the, the businesses and you know what I would actually
4412560	4418120	like to see, is see, um, some of the indie comic companies be included in this.
4418120	4421120	You know, um, maybe even a web comic reader.
4421120	4426120	Well, they are going to have, um, it's not just, um, Marvel though.
4426120	4430920	Well, so I said Archie and Image are involved as well, but I didn't mention anything on
4430920	4431920	DC.
4431920	4434200	I wouldn't see why DC couldn't jump in on that.
4434200	4436800	I don't know.
4436800	4438840	They're more than welcome, I guess.
4438840	4441320	Just haven't done it yet.
4441320	4442320	Hmm.
4442320	4447680	Alright, well, let's move on to some release dates before the, uh, comics get here and
4447680	4449880	we lose Dark Soccer because she'll be too busy reading them.
4449880	4455000	Alright, well, this week, um, we've got a few things coming out, um, actually some good
4455000	4456000	stuff.
4456000	4459560	The Metroid Prime Trilogy on the Wii is, uh, making its way out and of course you get three
4459560	4463840	games to the price of one there, uh, even though they've all been released before.
4463840	4470000	Uh, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box making its way out on DS this week.
4470000	4476760	Uh, Raven Squad Hidden Dagger on Xbox 360, um, also on PC.
4476760	4485120	Cursed Mountain on the Nintendo Wii, uh, Sudoku Ball Detective on DS, also Harvest Moon Frantic
4485120	4489720	Farming on DS, kind of the sequel to Puzzle Day Harvest Moon.
4489720	4498560	Um, also this week, um, Batman Arkham Asylum making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox
4498560	4508240	360, uh, Fallout 3 Broken Seal and Point Lookout available on PC and on Xbox 360, Dissidia
4508240	4514680	Final Fantasy making its way out on the PSP, which will be really awesome, Real Fishing
4514680	4520760	Angler's Dream on the Nintendo Wii, uh, this is going to be an excellent title for the
4520760	4521760	DS.
4521760	4526400	Uh, The Click, Diss, and Make Up, and of course I'm being sarcastic there, it's probably going
4526400	4527400	to really suck.
4527400	4535000	Um, same with this one, Wizards of Waverly Place, uh, based on the Disney, I don't know,
4535000	4544320	teen comedy, um, Emergency Room Real Life Rescues on the DS, um, Harvest Moon Magical
4544320	4552960	Melee being ported to the Wii, Mana Kimia 2 Fall of Alchemy getting its limited edition
4552960	4557640	on PlayStation 2, and that would be it.
4557640	4561960	Alright, let's move into some Japanese release dates, and after a couple of slow weeks, we
4561960	4566520	finally have a pretty busy week over in Japan, uh, look at the Xbox 360 Dream Club comes
4566520	4570260	out on the Xbox 360, and I'm sorry, I have to read the description of this game, uh,
4570260	4572840	it certainly does not sound like something we will be getting over here, but it looks
4572840	4574600	uh, all kinds of awesome.
4574600	4576040	Do you have a pure heart?
4576040	4577040	Welcome in.
4577040	4581400	Beautiful women are bowing at you as you sweep across the luxurious lounge, pick your favorite
4581400	4583820	hostess and drink with them to get to know them more.
4583820	4585560	You have an annual ticket to the Dream Club.
4585560	4588840	In this 365 days, enjoy the company of these ladies fully.
4588840	4592160	Earn money, plan your schedule, and improve your alcohol capacity.
4592160	4594280	Chat with the ladies to persuade them to drink with you.
4594280	4597800	They may divulge secrets about themselves if you prove to be a good conversationist
4597800	4598920	and drinker.
4598920	4601960	The ladies are not just companions, they are performers as well.
4601960	4603320	Watch them sing and dance.
4603320	4605800	The better you know them, the more songs they will perform.
4605800	4610120	Be sure to get to the club during the special event nights instead of the usual maid outfits.
4610120	4613800	The ladies will welcome you in get-ups such as yukatas and bikinis.
4613800	4615320	Have a lovely clubbing experience.
4615320	4617060	Get your VIP card today.
4617060	4621880	That game again is Dream Club from D3, and it sounds pretty fucking amazing and I want
4621880	4622880	to play it.
4622880	4628600	You know if it's D3, we may get that over here, because D3, they're, um, likely to put
4628600	4632920	out crazy shit like that over here, especially since the women in this game from the screen,
4632920	4635760	based on the screenshots, have giant boobies.
4635760	4636760	Of course.
4636760	4640440	Another game with chicks with giant boobies, also on the Xbox 360 this week, Memories Off
4640440	4642440	6 Next Relation.
4642440	4644640	Yeah, Next Relation.
4644640	4649840	Well, hopefully, she's not related if, uh, if it's Memories Are Off.
4649840	4654640	Uh, moving on to other consoles on the PlayStation 3.
4654640	4657680	Grand Theft Auto 4 gets a price reduction in Japan this week.
4657680	4660360	By the way, Fear 2 also making its way out to Japan this week.
4660360	4662880	That was also on the Xbox 360, just so you know.
4662880	4667300	Uh, also Kane & Lynch Dead Men gets a price reduction in Japan this week, but those other
4667300	4670760	two games I mentioned look to be exclusive to the Xbox 360.
4670760	4675360	However, on the Nintendo Wii, you have a game called Tamaran coming out this week from Ignition
4675360	4680880	Entertainment, and if we move on back to the PlayStation 2, there's a couple of games coming
4680880	4681880	out.
4681880	4688720	Uh, Gendai Daisenryaku Ishoku Soku Hatsu comes out this week.
4688720	4692080	I have no idea what the hell that is, but it has something to do with balance, is in
4692080	4693080	the title?
4693080	4695640	No, it looks like a war game.
4695640	4700960	Looks like, uh, looks like actually kind of like a, oh, looks like kind of like an RTS
4700960	4703840	type of strategy, it looks like a strategy command and conquer-ish type of game on the
4703840	4704840	PlayStation 2.
4704840	4708080	Uh, Memories Off 6 is getting a PlayStation 2 port.
4708080	4709080	Go figure.
4709080	4713000	Uh, Tomb Raider Anniversary and Legend to get price reductions if you never caught those
4713000	4715160	on the PlayStation 2.
4715160	4721440	On the Nintendo DS, Supa Robo Gakuen comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.
4721440	4723800	Gakuen is high school.
4723800	4726680	That Supa, so it's Robot High School, is that what this is?
4726680	4728680	Yeah, is it G-A-K-U-E-N?
4728680	4729680	Yes it is.
4729680	4731060	Yeah, that would be high school.
4731060	4734760	So yeah, looks like Robot High School is the game here, and I'm trying to look at screenshots
4734760	4738340	but can't, but it looks like a little type of a strategy type game coming out this week
4738340	4739680	on the DS.
4739680	4748660	And uh, lastly, looking at the PSP real quick, um, well you can import in Japan the English
4748660	4754120	language version of Final Fantasy Dissida if you, if you want, because obviously that's
4754120	4756160	a big game we're getting out here this week.
4756160	4759440	I do want to point out though, Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is out in Japan this week.
4759440	4764120	That is the new Soul Calibur game on PSP, so I bet we do have some hardcore Soul Calibur
4764120	4766280	fans that will want to import that.
4766280	4767280	Probably not.
4767280	4768880	We can then get that actually.
4768880	4769880	Fine.
4769880	4774040	That's going to do it for PSP releases and Japanese releases.
4774040	4780680	Well for our UK releases, on the 26th we have Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao, and
4780680	4785000	Watchmen, The End is Nigh Part 2 on Xbox 360, both of those.
4785000	4790040	On the 27th, um, for PS3 is Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Han Tao.
4790040	4797080	On the 28th we have Allied Ace Pilots on DS, Batman Arkham Asylum, Xbox 360 and PS3,
4797080	4805920	King of Fighters XII, meh, um, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes on DS, Soul Calibur Broken,
4805920	4813320	uh, Destiny on PSP, um, Supercar Challenge, and World Cup of Pool.
4813320	4816240	What is it?
4816240	4817240	World Cup of Pool?
4817240	4818240	Pool.
4818240	4819240	Oh.
4819240	4820240	Let me, let me make sure.
4820240	4824040	It makes it sound like it's a cup full of pool, but I'm, it's like chlorine flavored
4824040	4825040	water, but I'm assuming it's...
4825040	4826040	I'm a sinking cup of poo.
4826040	4829160	I'm assuming it's like a swimming game or something.
4829160	4830160	Cup of poo.
4830160	4831160	I hope.
4831160	4832160	Ew.
4832160	4833160	If it's a cup of poo.
4833160	4835160	Two girls, World Cup.
4835160	4837680	La la la la la.
4837680	4842360	Um, anyways, I don't know how to follow that.
4842360	4846240	But um, we'll talk about the PlayStation Network.
4846240	4851320	Sony, one of the things they announced while they were talking about, you know, secret
4851320	4855280	console revisions and stuff like that.
4855280	4857320	Is that they're...
4857320	4861880	This was also something that was totally not rumored to be announced at, you know, Gamescom.
4861880	4868520	But Sony introduced minis, which are byte-sized downloads, I guess, that are on the PlayStation
4868520	4869520	Network.
4869520	4873000	They're gonna be available for the PSP and the PSP Go.
4873000	4877000	And basically these titles will have 100 megabyte size limits.
4877000	4879560	They'll be exclusive to the PlayStation Network.
4879560	4885240	And basically they will start on October 1st, which is the same day that the PSP Go is really
4885240	4886480	released.
4886480	4891400	And they will apparently be less costly to develop for.
4891400	4893420	And cost less to gamers, of course.
4893420	4895920	No real prices have been announced yet.
4895920	4901200	They plan on having 15 at launch and 50 by the end of the year.
4901200	4905600	And some of the titles that they did mention were coming out include Tetris, Field Runners,
4905600	4908960	Heroes of Sparta, and Minigore.
4908960	4916760	And once again, goes back to the question, why exactly would I need a PSP Go?
4916760	4923320	Because, you know, if they had made this exclusive for the PSP Go, that might make it a little
4923320	4924560	bit worth it because then...
4924560	4926440	But if they hadn't, you would have bitched about it.
4926440	4927440	And I would have bitched about it.
4927440	4928800	We all would have bitched about it.
4928800	4930680	Because, you know, it doesn't sound like...
4930680	4936200	It's like there's no hardware feature that, you know, there's no reason these games can't
4936200	4937560	be on the original PSP.
4937560	4938560	So why not?
4938560	4939560	Exactly.
4939560	4943280	Which, you know, begs the question, why would I buy the PSP Go?
4943280	4948800	Why would anybody buy the PSP Go other than the fact that it has a sliding screen?
4948800	4951040	Is that really worth more money?
4951040	4954740	I will buy a PSP Go when the price drops.
4954740	4956380	And it won't take long.
4956380	4958080	I bet you anything it will not take long.
4958080	4959920	It may be 2010, but it won't take long.
4959920	4960920	No.
4960920	4961920	And I'll get...
4961920	4965520	When the price of the PSP Go matches the price of the PSP, which has to happen eventually,
4965520	4966520	I will buy one.
4966520	4969080	You know what they're going to do?
4969080	4971480	They're going to get rid of the original PSP.
4971480	4972480	And then they're going to make you buy that.
4972480	4975880	Of course, it's not going to happen anytime soon, because you've got, like, bundles now
4975880	4978200	for this idea.
4978200	4981160	You've got a bundle for Gran Turismo coming out in September.
4981160	4986920	You've got a bundle with Assassin's Creed coming out, you know, in November.
4986920	4989780	There's no reason that you can't find a PSP 3000.
4989780	4993920	Alpha Catanagram in chat says, I would buy a PSP Go when the price drop occurs and use
4993920	4995620	it as a belt buckle.
4995620	4996620	Actually sounds kind of awesome.
4996620	4999520	Have you ever seen those belt buckles with, like, the scrolling text on them?
4999520	5001440	And like, it gets everybody to look at your crotch?
5001440	5002920	You can order those at ThinkGeek.
5002920	5003920	I've seen those before.
5003920	5005240	The LED belt buckles.
5005240	5006240	Yeah.
5006240	5007240	Kind of cool.
5007240	5010560	Imagine having a PSP Go, like, showing a little movie on your crotch.
5010560	5011760	It'd be fun.
5011760	5016720	Which is actually footage of your crotch.
5016720	5017720	You nasty.
5017720	5018720	Which would be fun.
5018720	5021120	Well, did they ever say what's going to happen with my UMDs?
5021120	5023120	How I'm going to put my UMDs on my Go?
5023120	5029200	No, but I read a funny article by GameStop, you know, they were saying that they expect
5029200	5031560	them to be traded in.
5031560	5035320	Not that there's going to be an official program, it's just that people are going to be so,
5035320	5040560	you know, I don't know, enamored with PSP Go that they're just going to, you know, throw
5040560	5045800	all their UMDs out and re-buy the content again because they love Sony so much.
5045800	5046800	Right.
5046800	5047800	Yeah.
5047800	5053240	Well, I'm sure there are some fanboys that will, but I just don't see it being an epidemic.
5053240	5057480	No, it's, I'm sure that people would do that because, you know, obviously Sony's not giving
5057480	5064560	them a way to, and you know, my thing is that at the same time, if you do own an original
5064560	5068560	PSP system, and they may just say, you know, fuck you, you own an original PSP system,
5068560	5073480	why the hell do we need a method for you to, you know, dump your UMDs on there, just buy
5073480	5079920	new games, or, I don't know, just don't buy a new system because you have a PSP system
5079920	5080920	already.
5080920	5084320	Why would you buy another system, you idiot?
5084320	5086320	That's just my opinion there.
5086320	5091240	I don't know, yeah, I'm just still not seeing the reasons to jump ship.
5091240	5097000	The Go, though, I think is, would be good for people who don't already own.
5097000	5100160	Even then, it's not the right price.
5100160	5103060	I would say if you don't own a PSP, buy a PSP.
5103060	5107480	You don't need the PSP Go yet, there's nothing that super that it gets you unless you really
5107480	5111560	need a quiet system or something, I don't know.
5111560	5114440	And there are ways you can run stuff off your memory card even now.
5114440	5119580	I mean, no, legit ways, actually, I mean, you can still purchase all those games online
5119580	5124160	if you do want to do digital downloads, just buy your own memory card.
5124160	5132440	What do you want to bet that half of the games in this mini thing are virtual console rehashes,
5132440	5138320	you know, old games sold yet again, Galaga on my PSP?
5138320	5143200	They already have PlayStation Network games that are, you know, independent titles.
5143200	5148440	They're like PlayStation Network games, like Super Stardust and stuff like that.
5148440	5149440	How's that any different?
5149440	5153100	Okay, the file sizes are smaller, they're gonna be cheaper, whoop the shit, okay?
5153100	5156180	Just make them cheaper and make the file sizes smaller.
5156180	5160360	You don't need to necessarily make it a whole new category of games, I guess if you want
5160360	5165640	to draw more attention to the PSP or something, you can do that, which is what they did, but
5165640	5167060	I don't know.
5167060	5171600	Making something cheaper and, you know, cheaper to develop for doesn't really, I don't know,
5171600	5176320	doesn't really warrant them putting another bullet point in their system, I guess.
5176320	5179920	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week, and I
5179920	5183600	want to talk about a classic band, of course, the Beatles.
5183600	5187120	Rumor was this week that a SingStar version of the Beatles was going to be coming out
5187120	5190960	around the time that the Beatles rock band was coming out, and it turns out, I guess
5190960	5194880	that was a British gaming outlet that reported the whole SingStar Beatles coming out, but
5194880	5196360	it is not true.
5196360	5201140	MTV Games and Harmonics came out this week and said, nope, we have the exclusive rights
5201140	5203580	to create music games based on the Beatles.
5203580	5207880	They have an exclusive partnership with Apple Core Limited, so there will be no SingStar
5207880	5208880	Beatles.
5208880	5210520	So why this rumor then?
5210520	5216460	Apparently they are thinking about a version of the Beatles rock band that would be the
5216460	5218640	game, and only microphones.
5218640	5222800	So basically it would be a singing version of the game, no instruments.
5222800	5224400	Beatles karaoke revolution.
5224400	5229980	Well, it's still rock band, it's just a singing version of it, so you don't have the instruments,
5229980	5231960	you just have the singing parts.
5231960	5236380	To be fair, you know, again, it's about options, it goes back to what we were talking about
5236380	5239760	earlier in the show, it's just another way to buy the game, and you know what, there
5239760	5242520	are some people that don't really want all those plastic instruments.
5242520	5250440	And I could see this really being aimed at the Beatles fans who are wanting to have the
5250440	5253640	game, but they don't want all this plastic instrument crap in their house.
5253640	5256480	Those people are communists.
5256480	5257480	But I understand.
5257480	5258480	I'm kidding.
5258480	5260920	It might be a small audience, but it's an audience, and certainly they want to sell
5260920	5263160	this game to as many people as possible.
5263160	5264160	That's true.
5264160	5267440	Or perhaps you already own all the instruments and everything and you just want some extra
5267440	5270880	microphones so you can do your three part harmonies.
5270880	5274160	This is actually a certainly plausible outcome as well.
5274160	5278740	So no singing star Beatles, but you know, hey, rock band Beatles, it's not like it looks
5278740	5279740	that bad or anything.
5279740	5281040	It looks pretty awesome, actually.
5281040	5282080	I'm really looking forward to it.
5282080	5286240	And if they are planning on releasing this, they sure as hell haven't told anyone yet.
5286240	5288560	Well, this might also only be in Britain.
5288560	5291040	Keep in mind, all this news is coming out of Europe, so it may not be something that's
5291040	5295720	actually planned here, but it might be just planned over there, so who knows?
5295720	5296720	Yeah.
5296720	5301600	So it's that time of the show where we're going to take a trip down History Lane and
5301600	5306520	take a look at gaming's past and take a trip into the vault and find a game that Dark Soccer
5306520	5310680	thinks you kids ought to be playing right the hell now.
5310680	5313680	So Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5313680	5320480	The Classic Game of the Week is Silfied for Sega CD.
5320480	5327760	It actually originally came out in Japan on the PC-8801 in 1986, and then the Mega CD
5327760	5334960	version came out, which of course was the Sega CD over here.
5334960	5340480	They've actually made a ton of improvements over the PC-88 version.
5340480	5347760	Instead of just having the static background, the background for each level is full motion
5347760	5360120	video with a polygon overlay for all the ships and asteroids and everything coming at you.
5360120	5362400	And it's a really, really good game.
5362400	5375540	There was an FM7 version that was also released, and it came out in the US for PC, but that
5375540	5378320	was put up by Sierra Online.
5378320	5386920	At any rate, it was actually a competitor with Star Fox for the day, except Star Fox
5386920	5398000	was all fully rendered on the cartridge, and like I said, this had a full motion video
5398000	5407760	background, and it still is a traditional kind of shooter.
5407760	5413720	Honestly though, graphically it was better, but it didn't have that innovative feel to
5413720	5415680	it that Star Fox did.
5415680	5422400	So yeah, terrorists take over the earth, and we get these cool ships, we get to shoot people
5422400	5424800	in the end.
5424800	5432760	I did have a sequel, which was Silphed The Lost Planet, which was a PS2 game.
5432760	5441440	And then Project Silphed was actually a spiritual successor, not really a game in the series.
5441440	5453560	A little bit of trivia about Silphed 2 is that there was a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh that's
5453560	5462080	called Silphed, and in Mahoro-Matic there's actually a jetpack that Mahoro used that's
5462080	5463800	called the Silphed.
5463800	5471520	And then in BlazBlue, Silphed is the name of Rachel Alucard's drive.
5471520	5477320	This game also has one of the best intros ever.
5477320	5480440	It's really one that you have to watch and listen to, and the other thing that I really
5480440	5487520	dig about this one, as opposed to the original version of it, is as you're flying through
5487520	5495760	the level, you get radio feedback, you know, from the rest of the fleet.
5495760	5496760	Like in Star Fox.
5496760	5501600	No, it's not quite the same.
5501600	5506480	In Star Fox, it's your, like, if you go back earlier in that file, we'll play a little
5506480	5509480	bit of it, it's a little different.
5509480	5510480	There we go.
5510480	5511480	It does have really good music, too.
5511480	5512480	I heard it yelling.
5512480	5513480	There you go.
5513480	5538480	Yeah, and see, as in Star Fox, the way it's going, the way it's going, the way it's going,
5538480	5547720	the way it was, is that it was your squadron, your formation of ships, you know, you had
5547720	5555920	your partners, and this is, you're getting, like, have you ever, alright, I know this
5555920	5560680	is kind of old school, but have you ever listened to just CB channels?
5560680	5561680	Back in the day, yeah.
5561680	5567040	When you can hear the other conversations going on, you're hearing the communications
5567040	5572080	going up from the fleet, because, like, you know, look at it in a realistic sense.
5572080	5578800	If you were part of the squadron, and orders went out, or feedback went out, or some sort
5578800	5583360	of announcement, it may not be necessarily directed to you, but you're still gonna hear
5583360	5584360	it.
5584360	5585360	Do people still use CB?
5585360	5586360	Yes, actually.
5586360	5587360	Wow.
5587360	5594440	Um, well, trackers do, um, but if you see, though, in that sense, then it actually adds
5594440	5596480	a sense of realism to the game.
5596480	5600560	And for the record, in, in terms of, if you're traveling with people, like, and you're in
5600560	5604680	separate vehicles, having a CB is actually very good for areas that you're in that you'll
5604680	5608160	lose, uh, cell reception.
5608160	5611000	Plus cell cost minutes, anyway.
5611000	5612440	Not always.
5612440	5618720	But, um, but at any rate, you know, I think it's a fantastic game.
5618720	5621720	Alright, so there it is, Silpheed.
5621720	5622720	Silpheed.
5622720	5625720	At least I didn't say Slipheed.
5625720	5626720	Alright.
5626720	5628440	I got people used to do that all the time, too.
5628440	5633040	Your classic game of the week, not the newer one that came out on 360.
5633040	5635560	This is the, uh, old school one on Saturn.
5635560	5637720	Well, the sequel, though, is PS2.
5637720	5638720	Huh.
5638720	5639720	I think I played that one.
5639720	5640720	I think I played that one.
5640720	5642720	I think I have it somewhere.
5642720	5648680	And, and for the record, they were talking about Policenauts earlier.
5648680	5653760	I came very close to using Policenauts as, uh, the classic game.
5653760	5656640	You know, we're gonna get into a story about Policenauts later, but I'll, uh, I'll leave
5656640	5657640	that for later.
5657640	5658640	Oh, I didn't mean to.
5658640	5659640	No, that's alright.
5659640	5660640	It's a Twitter thing, so it's gonna come up later.
5660640	5661640	Yeah.
5661640	5662640	Alright.
5662640	5664720	Alright, speaking of Twitter, we'll get into Twitter topics right after a little bit of
5664720	5665720	a break.
5665720	5668720	We are gonna take a break, though, here in studio to do, uh, cover more.
5668720	5672120	Um, actually, we take the break, though, to, uh, you know, get energized.
5672120	5673120	To pee.
5673120	5674120	To pee.
5674120	5675120	To, uh, maybe order pizza.
5675120	5676120	We'll see.
5676120	5677120	Mmm, Becky's bringing me tacos.
5677120	5678120	We can do all that.
5678120	5679120	Oh, lucky.
5679120	5683960	But, I was going to offer to you on the air, guys, do you want me to make you guys pizza?
5683960	5685440	Oh, that's actually okay.
5685440	5687480	I probably shouldn't, cause I had, I had a big ol' crepe earlier today.
5687480	5690760	I have organic mushroom and black olive pizzas.
5690760	5692560	That does sound kinda good.
5692560	5695800	I also have, um, plain cheese pizzas.
5695800	5696800	Maybe.
5696800	5699440	No, I don't want any unless you're gonna have some.
5699440	5702640	Dude, if I make pizza, I can just have it for lunch tomorrow.
5702640	5703640	Hi.
5703640	5704640	We'll see.
5704640	5705640	Alright.
5705640	5708600	My man, by the way, is not here, so I am gonna be going stir crazy.
5708600	5710640	So people will be seeing me at IRC.
5710640	5711640	Whee!
5711640	5712640	Alright.
5712640	5713640	We're gonna take a break.
5713640	5715840	We'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5715840	5719680	We have plenty more to talk about in Part B tonight, including our rapid fire news and,
5719680	5725560	uh, talk about, um, a new interesting achievement on Xbox 360 for killing 1,000 children in
5725560	5731280	a game and, uh, a possible revamp of DSiWare and, uh, a Final Fantasy game you will probably
5731280	5733560	never ever see.
5733560	5737680	We will talk about all of that in Part B after a quick break, so stay tuned here on Orange
5737680	5745280	Launch Radio.
5745280	5751280	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, episode number 335 for this Sunday,

5764280	5767520	tapes with us, and there's, of course, programming on All Games Radio throughout the week.
5767520	5770720	And, um, you can take All Games in your pocket with you everywhere you go if you're an iPhone
5770720	5771720	owner.
5771720	5775760	There's an All Games Radio app available on the store, which is actually pretty cool.
5775760	5780080	I gotta give kudos to whoever wrote it, because what I like about it is that it actually shows
5780080	5785960	a little picture of, uh, like the video game that song, that song is playing, uh, not always
5785960	5789560	during our show, because our tags during the break aren't standardized, but, uh, like,
5789560	5793560	and when we're on the air, it actually shows a little picture, our little Orange Launch
5793560	5797120	Radio album art while we're actually live, which I think is kinda cool.
5797120	5801960	So, uh, kudos to whoever wrote that application, I know somebody at the All Games staff did
5801960	5803960	that, so, good job.
5803960	5807400	Hopefully we see something like it for other phones and other platforms soon, who knows,
5807400	5811400	I don't know how, uh, how easy other things are to develop for.
5811400	5813640	But I do know we have a PSP website.
5813640	5814640	I don't think there's a lot of-
5814640	5815640	That never gets updated!
5815640	5819760	Not, we should work on that, I just paid to have our domain names extended a couple, uh,
5819760	5821080	actually this past week.
5821080	5827640	I paid something like 60 bucks to extend OrangeLaunchRadio.com and OLRPSP.com for two years, because I use
5827640	5832280	the, um, anonymous things, I don't want my address out there on the internet, but, uh,
5832280	5836160	yeah, so, uh, it costs me a little more money since I do that, but, you know, whatever.
5836160	5839760	I still have a OLR-We, but I haven't done anything with that.
5839760	5840760	Do you?
5840760	5841760	Yeah.
5841760	5844760	And we need, like, an OLRPS3.com or something like that.
5844760	5845760	Yeah, maybe.
5845760	5846760	We'll see one these days.
5846760	5847760	I'll work on it someday.
5847760	5852040	You know, if you're interested in helping us build websites and develop, you wanna,
5852040	5855000	for that, we pay great, nothing.
5855000	5856920	But pat on the back and job well done.
5856920	5857920	Eventually.
5857920	5859920	It just, I don't know.
5859920	5862680	Well, we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in a little bit, but I do wanna
5862680	5866480	mention, actually we're gonna get into Twitter topics in a minute, but I do wanna mention
5866480	5870200	before we get to Twitter topics tonight, um, I wanna mention, I went to Dave & Buster's
5870200	5873880	yesterday, which is a place I have not been for a while, and, uh, you know, if you haven't
5873880	5876960	been to Dave & Buster's, it's like, I guess there's another chain on the East Coast called
5876960	5877960	Jillian's.
5877960	5878960	It's very similar to it as well.
5878960	5882800	Um, it's kind of like Chuck E. Cheese, but for adults, because there's an open bar.
5882800	5884200	But oh my God, the bar's a ripoff.
5884200	5886520	Do you know how much a drink cost me at Dave & Buster's?
5886520	5888600	I ordered a Malibu and pineapple.
5888600	5889600	You know how much that cost me?
5889600	5890600	Uh, seven bucks.
5890600	5891600	Seven fifty.
5891600	5892600	Damn close.
5892600	5893600	Six fifty.
5893600	5894600	That's what it got.
5894600	5896160	And after I left a tip, really, it's seven fifty.
5896160	5897160	Because I always tip.
5897160	5900400	Well, you know, though, I used to go for my birthday every year, and...
5900400	5901720	I miss that.
5901720	5907280	And between everyone who bought me drinks and buying drinks for myself, I would probably
5907280	5911560	easily go through about seventy dollars worth of liquor.
5911560	5912560	You've seen me do it.
5912560	5913560	Yep.
5913560	5914560	Good times, though.
5914560	5915560	It's basically gambling for tickets.
5915560	5920060	But I have on my card eight thousand five hundred tickets, which is almost enough for
5920060	5922200	me to get a free Xbox 360 game.
5922200	5924360	It's nine thousand tickets for an Xbox 360 game.
5924360	5926480	I have eighty five hundred tickets.
5926480	5929880	Now, what's interesting also about Dave & Buster's, the reason why I want to bring it up.
5929880	5936200	They were actually, um, had for sale a little like, I hadn't seen this, like a little table
5936200	5938220	top arcade cabinet.
5938220	5941040	Not a full size arcade cabinet, but a table top arcade cabinet.
5941040	5944240	It was some type of Namco twenty fifth anniversary thing.
5944240	5945240	Yeah.
5945240	5949000	So it was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Galaga were all on it.
5949000	5953040	They wanted a hundred and ninety five thousand tickets for that thing.
5953040	5955600	That's like three thousand dollars in real money.
5955600	5958000	They're, trust me, they're not really that expensive.
5958000	5960000	I was going to say.
5960000	5961000	Dang.
5961000	5963800	Probably a few hundred bucks, that's it.
5963800	5965440	You could build one cheaper.
5965440	5966440	Probably.
5966440	5967440	But it did look pretty cool.
5967440	5970940	I was kind of curious to get one, but whatever.
5970940	5971940	It was fun.
5971940	5973960	Um, we have some questions in chat room.
5973960	5979760	Um, I can't pronounce this name, but T-O-A-G-A-C. Toagak wants to know, where is this PSP radio
5979760	5981000	app?
5981000	5983960	We haven't talked about the radio app in a while, but we do have a radio app that will
5983960	5986240	work on your PSP, right, Logie?
5986240	5987240	Yeah.
5987240	5991800	It works on, um, the actual PSP, O-O-L-R PSP site, you can download it.
5991800	5998480	It's basically, um, something that you replace your, or it's a radio player, you just install
5998480	6002640	it to your memory stick, where you would put your radio players, I think there's a guide
6002640	6007400	on there somewhere, um, to do that, and once you do that, it will connect to a website,
6007400	6012240	and you can literally listen to the all-game stream, um, straight from your PSP, just like
6012240	6016400	you would, you know, the stations, and there's some RSS feeds and stuff, and I hope it still
6016400	6020880	works correctly, because I know they've changed their website since then, I used to pull stuff
6020880	6026240	off the all-game site, so God knows, because I haven't used my PSP in a long time, but,
6026240	6027240	um...
6027240	6028240	I think it still works.
6028240	6029240	The stream's still in the same place, that's the important part, right?
6029240	6032240	The stream's still in the same place, yes, but like, some of the stuff that I've made
6032240	6034680	for it, because it was all fancy-looking.
6034680	6037520	So it may be a little broken, but it'll still get you the stream, so you can listen to us
6037520	6040720	on the iPhone on the all-games app, you can listen to us on the PSP on the O-L-R app,
6040720	6041720	you're covered.
6041720	6042720	One way or another.
6042720	6046720	Alright, uh, Twitter topics tonight, every night we invite you guys, we need a theme
6046720	6050500	song for Twitter topics, I don't have anything, I'll have to think about that for next week.
6050500	6053440	Like, Conan O'Brien has a little theme song for his Twitter segment.
6053440	6058040	You know what, you should do, um...
6058040	6059040	I don't know, yeah, it's...
6059040	6060040	Rislem.
6060040	6061040	I don't know.
6061040	6062040	Yeah, I don't know.
6062040	6063040	I was picking something up.
6063040	6064040	I'm not picking something up next time.
6064040	6066560	Alright, in the meantime, don't call me during the show, why are my parents calling me during
6066560	6067560	the show?
6067560	6069520	You should use the beep, you should use that beep.
6069520	6070600	What beep?
6070600	6072640	That beep-beep should be the theme for Twitter topics?
6072640	6074440	Alright, yeah
6074440	6078180	We have I'm not reading the name in chat cuz they're all naming themselves immature names
6078180	6084800	But I see Twitter tracker Twitter tracker Twitter tracker. That's what the from the Tonight Show by the way change your names to something more mature
6084800	6087080	I'm not reading black cock all right
6088520	6092720	Let's see you haven't had that in a while Twitter topics tonight. We'll start with them
6093960	6095440	ray
6095440	6102960	Ayanami wants us to talk about raystorm HD and not just because his name is in it, but apparently there is a new game coming out called
6103640	6108660	Raystorm HD. This is a remake possibly of an old-school title game
6109320	6111320	apparently they
6111480	6117720	It appeared on partner net that's where they saw it partner net is Xbox's little testing grounds for us
6117720	6125760	Let's talk about partner net somebody did ooh, so there it is raystorm HD. I don't remember the first one very well is this
6125760	6129880	I I almost feel like I should bring it up on YouTube and look at a clip of this does anyone know the game Jamie
6129880	6133660	Do you know raystorm if it has to do with what was a ray crisis?
6134480	6136480	Then I think so
6137080	6140600	Hold on I'm bringing up some of the gameplay here in studio, so I can check this out
6140600	6149600	Oh, this is like a punch. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it okay fun series
6150520	6153760	So if you shmup fans all right well the graphics of nice
6154760	6158040	Major targeting and this is an arcade game originally wasn't it I?
6158880	6163960	Don't remember, but I've got I've got all kinds of versions of that series
6163960	6169160	Is that a vertical game that looks like a vertical the graphics are kind of rad for something this old school
6169160	6171160	I imagine it has to be an arcade game
6173440	6177680	I might have to check that game out that looks kind of cool. I don't know much about it, but I like a little clip
6177680	6179680	I'm seeing you could probably borrow ours
6179720	6182700	Cool, all right. Uh let's see moving on
6183520	6187760	Take array wants to know to KO ray. Sorry wants to know
6188320	6191480	Would the ol army be interested in raising money for extra life?
6191480	6196060	I hope you can discuss this tonight, and then gave me a link and this is kind of interesting. It's a
6196060	6199220	A fundraiser that's going on called extra life
6199220	6204340	And they're calling it a 24-hour gaming marathon to fund pediatric cancer research and treatment
6204340	6207500	And I guess this is taking place on October 17th of this year
6207500	6212980	And they're trying to get all these sites to come together to raise money for this
6213700	6219780	Extra life charity, and it's to raise money for pediatric cancer which sounds like a great cause honestly
6220260	6224660	It's going to be 8 a.m.. On October 17th, and they have all these groups participating
6224660	6226660	I guess our tech sarcastic gamer
6227420	6230620	I've not listened to that show, but I've seen their thing on iTunes
6231260	6233260	This part of this
6233260	6238940	Destructoid is apparently on board as well limit break radio. I guess they'll probably be doing a Final Fantasy 11 marathon
6239420	6241540	Wants to know if we could come on board as well um
6243140	6246700	Maybe I don't want to commit to something if I can't give it a hundred percent
6247020	6250220	But I think it's a great cause and I think if we don't do it ourselves
6250220	6254120	We'll have to support somebody else doing it, but I don't know what do you guys think gaming marathon?
6254120	6257740	October 17th could we do it probably 24 hours worth of games?
6258220	6262780	Obscure fucking vault games would be the theme of our marathon. I don't think anybody else could do that I
6263740	6268300	Think that would be good and to keep the the continuation going
6268300	6270740	We'll have a different systems hooked up to that
6270900	6275580	While one systems going we can switch games to a new one and just pass a controller over so that we don't have a lull
6275580	6278140	I'm playing maybe like a new game every hour or something works for me
6278140	6282460	So I figured out because I don't know if we could do that here because it might be just adventure marathon
6282460	6284660	It might be too small of a space here. We might have to do it at the
6285220	6288460	Room, but maybe I don't know if we could get all this stuff
6288460	6290740	I think because there's also that the weather should be better
6290740	6291780	We could always go back to the garage
6291780	6297820	But we'll see if we do it on the big TV though we can actually put up a cam footage without it
6300020	6301500	Without a
6301500	6303420	refresh hmm
6303420	6307460	Because you've seen me take pictures off of my TV. I Loki would you be willing to do it too?
6307460	6313980	Could we do this for 24 hours you do it? I have HD capture stuff now mm-hmm, so I could capture
6316660	6321700	Once I figure something out we let's you I don't want to commit to we're 100% sure we can give it our all
6321700	6322700	But we are interested
6322700	6327140	I think we've been talking about doing a gaming marathon for a long time so it'd be fun to get in on something like this
6327140	6330220	with some other podcasts and things like that and certainly the causes is
6330780	6335260	Great, so we want to help I still I still though wanted
6335260	6337940	you know along the same lines want to do a
6339260	6340860	a
6340860	6347580	Classic game segment every week too. You know I think we should do nothing, but classic games like we should just do obscure
6347580	6349580	Fuck I'm not talking about for that. I'm talking about
6350300	6355260	You know us having a classic gaming. No like on YouTube or something. Yeah, might be fun
6355260	6359340	I don't know if you guys have some ideas I get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch ready calm
6359340	6365580	I'd be curious what you guys think would be fun for the marathon, so we'll see um so
6366300	6367540	Thanks for the heads up on that
6367540	6371540	I'm not sure I'll have to read a little more in that website about who we contact for more information
6371540	6377100	But if you're out there listening, please get in touch with us mailbag at orange launch rated calm because I think
6377860	6379860	That could be fun
6381260	6388340	Tweet from act deft to our Twitter, or wants us to mention the police knots English localization apparently there is a fan
6388340	6393900	Translation of police knots that was finished now this game of course was out on the PlayStation 1
6394260	6400020	It was also on the Sega Saturn and get this the 3do and what makes this game notable is that it was a Hideo?
6400020	6403780	Kojima game that was the the thing that made this game notable
6403780	6408380	I don't know a whole lot about this game, but it looks like kind of a very cutscene heavy game
6408420	6413380	Which is no surprise at all because it was a Hideo Kojima game, but it also looked like a point
6413460	6417260	Yeah, it's like a point-and-click game like it's like a shadow gate or deja vu kind of game, right?
6417260	6424620	What's point-and-click game so it has but it never came out in English, but the fans got together and translated it
6424620	6427980	And it's a patch that you can apply to your
6428900	6432220	Rom, I'm supposing of police knots. I don't know what version it is
6433540	6436380	That they patched I'm assuming it's got to be the ps1
6436380	6442180	That's probably the easiest one, but there you go, so if you want to check out police knots you can do that now
6442180	6446060	In a completely non-legit way well
6446060	6448780	I mean if you actually own the import game
6448780	6453940	And you make a copy of it dump your own copy of it with whatever programs out there, and you patch it with this yeah
6454780	6459860	You probably know that most people aren't going to do this all right that are downloading this or probably getting it illegally
6459860	6465220	But I know what it's the game is 13 years old, and I say if they if they cared that much about it
6465220	6467220	They would have translated to English 13 years ago
6467220	6471420	Obviously they don't care at this point. Nope. They don't care so
6472060	6477740	There you go all right all right the dark soccer. I think is like digging it out of the vault right now
6478420	6479740	so
6479740	6484460	And act F2 says in chat right now that I think it's the ps1 version so there you go
6484700	6491500	Um a couple more quick Twitter topics technicolor with the three wants to know what are our thoughts on the halo 3 o DST
6491500	6495860	Tour truck thing going around the country right now. I wonder if they have one of those at the state fair
6495860	6499940	They had Rock Band 2 there last year. It's only going game stops. Oh is it yeah?
6499940	6502700	I guess if you want to check out the game is certainly a good way to do it
6502860	6506540	No publicity is gonna be bad publicity in that regard. It's like a little slice e3 in your backyard
6507100	6512800	It's only a few more weeks away. I was like a month away. I mean is that close. Yeah, it's coming on 22nd
6514060	6517500	September interesting I don't know any okay
6518580	6524140	Play halo 3 there. There's a good impression on what halo DST is gonna be like I mean really they haven't changed too much
6524140	6527980	I mean yeah, you're playing you know the shock trooper
6527980	6533700	But and it's not the scales been kind of dropped down a little bit, but I don't know
6533700	6536500	It's not like it's like night and day gameplay. I think
6538220	6545940	Hmm all right well last more Twitter topics tiger claw 305 says Blizzard is planning a pseudo land support for Starcraft 2 and possibly
6545940	6547940	Diablo 3 and links us to a story
6548580	6551500	Talking about I there was a quote in here. I wanted to read
6551500	6553500	where
6553540	6560180	The interviewer and this is from Shaq news.com asked the developer if they were possibly working on a solution
6560180	6564420	That would be like a pseudo land connection where the game will check in with battle net to authenticate
6564420	6568300	And then it'll go back to acting like a LAN and they replied something like that
6568820	6570660	Maintaining a connection with battle.net
6570660	6572300	I don't know if it's once or periodically
6572300	6577980	But then also having a peer-to-peer connection between players to facilitate a very low ping high bandwidth connection
6577980	6583520	So those are the things that they're working on so a bit of an olive branch to the community. Maybe I don't know
6584180	6586540	Hopefully I would think this type of thing was probably always planned
6586540	6590580	But they they're gonna want the regular pings to battle.net to make sure the game is legit
6591240	6595940	You know because if they only pinged at once somebody would figure out a way to patch that they're gonna figure out a way to patch
6595940	6597660	It anyways it doesn't matter
6597660	6602740	I think I think the planners are gonna have to give the concession that they're gonna have to attach to battle net to give this
6602740	6609380	Game, but they'll at least not have to play through battle net because that would suck if battle net goes down your whole game is fucked
6609580	6615460	Right so yeah, hopefully there'll be some type of a concession there SB. Hale tweets us and says
6616100	6620380	$300 ps3 definitely not an under-the-radar story, but for those of us Xbox 360
6620380	6626860	And we owners do you feel there's a need to own all three consoles besides the fact that the ps3 is a blu-ray player of course
6626860	6629860	I've yet to find a good reason why I shouldn't pick one up at that price
6629860	6634260	Hmm well you know the golden rule of gaming here at orange lounge radio
6634260	6638860	Is that a system is only as good as the games that are on it the interesting thing about the PlayStation though?
6638860	6643960	As a console is that you also have that added blu-ray in so you do I mean whether?
6644300	6648540	You know you say besides that or not you have to factor that in a little bit to your decision
6648540	6650540	But I think the question is really going to be
6651140	6653360	It does what the PlayStation 3 offer
6654460	6659220	As far as exclusive games and things you can't get on your Xbox 360 is that what you want?
6659220	6661140	Do you want games like little big planet?
6661140	6665460	Do you want mag do you want you know some of the Final Fantasy 14?
6665460	6670660	And some of these games that are PlayStation 3 exclusive is that worth the $300 to you if so then yeah?
6670660	6672620	You got to get one if not right now
6672620	6674300	Then you can stand away a little bit
6674300	6679240	But also don't discount the other features of the PlayStation 3 the fact that it is a pretty good media device as well
6679340	6685420	You know that it does have home if that's something that interests you and the whole fact that you can have that the online movie
6685420	6691620	Store which has some different offerings than the Xbox 360 does if that you know the HD movies and all that are important to you
6691620	6693240	I think you have to consider all of that
6693240	6699220	But in the end if you're getting everything that you possibly need out of gaming on your 360 then no you don't need a ps3
6699540	6704460	but if there's something that the ps3 offers you that you need and
6704900	6706900	It I will say it's a hell of a lot quieter
6707700	6709700	Then go for it
6709700	6715740	But if you oh by the way if you don't have an HDTV though, there's no point in getting blu-ray it really isn't but
6715740	6718180	I'm assuming you probably are an HDTV owner and
6718740	6722980	Zebun Chow wants to point out Final Fantasy 14 is gonna be on the PC too. That's a good point
6723100	6729140	So you know and that may be where most people want to play it and there we go Dark Sakura found her copy of police
6729140	6730900	Nauts on the PlayStation 1
6730900	6734660	There it is. I wish we had webcam in this studio, but we don't know well
6734660	6740920	But it's definitely all in Japanese. You won't put down the website the pics orange lounge radio. All right, there we go
6742020	6746100	One more and sorry if we didn't get to all the tweets tonight, but Matt OS
6746100	6750480	I can't say his last name. It says this j100 Matt Matt
6751180	6757060	Ostrowski, I think says interesting story about a company that is close to making the first ps3 mod chip
6758020	6761440	Who could a mod chip be coming soon to the PlayStation 3? Have you heard about this?
6761440	6765860	Loki, no, but that would be a pain in the ass to burn stuff on to
6766380	6770940	You know blu-ray and stuff blu-ray discs are really expensive and that's like, you know
6771580	6773580	almost 50 gigs of data
6774100	6779340	But I know for a fact that every every single PlayStation 3 game that comes out is being dumped
6779340	6784940	So, you know just in case for whatever happened, you know, whatever they do come up with a mod chip
6784940	6793220	Well, apparently it's a mod chip that's gonna happen and it's called the bells are chip and it works on all models all regions
6793660	6799940	Direct boot of ps3 original import and backup games direct boot of ps2 original important backup games
6799940	6805460	I'm assuming that means only if your console plays ps2 games does multi region blu-rays multi region DVDs
6805540	6811640	No configuration disk needed. It's a transparent stealth operation. They call it no USB interface
6811640	6814920	It's up-to-date only 12 wires to solder
6815640	6817640	solder yeah, sorry solder
6818640	6820280	tempting
6820280	6826000	Yeah, but still you have to solder and what if what if they fix it with a patch that's gonna you're gonna be screwed because
6826000	6828440	That thing's hardwired to your system. My Wii is
6829240	6835200	Soldered and it has a soldered in mod chip. I'm not worried about it because you get that that thing has an on-off switch, huh?
6836200	6841000	Yeah, but I don't use it. Hmm. It's always on I mean they have it just in case
6841000	6846000	And it's only really have them been updated once and really I don't need the on-off switch on there
6846000	6848200	that's just an optional thing you can install in there and
6848960	6850800	I
6850800	6857380	mean worst case scenario if for whatever reason this decided, you know, they broke it or something or they
6858400	6864920	You know disable the chip. You can always clip those wires that you solder. Hmm. Yes, that's true. I am interested
6865120	6870000	Well, there's a whole thing on Twitter. Look at the you the tweets to olr ask as I share 100 Mac
6870000	6872280	Cuz he opposed so much. All right
6873840	6878480	Huh, I don't know I didn't see on that site. So check it out. All right
6879040	6884720	If you want to tweet us a story that's we like stuff that's under the radar because obviously you knew this week
6884720	6887840	We were gonna talk about Wow cataclysm. You knew we were gonna talk about the ps3 slim
6887840	6889840	But usually the stuff that might fall off the radar
6889940	6893360	We definitely want you to bring to our attention on Twitter or any topics you want us to discuss
6893640	6897600	Keep an eye out Sundays a couple hours before we go live. I usually put a shout out on there
6897600	6903640	All right. Let's get into some rapid-fire news Loki. You're gonna need just you need to stop reading tweets
6903640	6904840	By the way, the first picture is up
6904840	6910680	Oh the police knots game and that's what an orange lounge radio.com in our picture gallery, right? Cool. I've been waiting
6910680	6916360	I'm ready to go. All right, Loki rapid-fire news. All right, Robin. You may remember that Sega had a
6917160	6924040	You know a survey asking what should be the next game that they published on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and we were well
6924920	6926920	Earthworm Jim won that however
6926920	6929760	they had to pull Earthworm Jim because
6930320	6936120	Unfortunately interplay at the same time also announced that they're making a new Earthworm Jim game for PlayStation Network
6936120	6939600	We were an Xbox Live Arcade as well as mobile platforms. So
6940860	6946560	New Earthworm Jim coming, but there's still another Xbox Live Arcade Genesis poll. So
6947380	6949620	You'll have to see who wins that I think currently right now
6951320	6953320	Toe jam and Earl was winning that one
6953320	6955320	Um
6955840	6957840	There is a rumor that
6957960	6961760	Looks like Canada will be getting a new elite bundle
6961760	6965640	It's gonna be coming with halo 3 and on top of that
6965640	6972360	They're also going to be throwing in a wireless network adapter, which is kind of cool and all that can be had for
6973320	6976940	349.99. I think that's Canadian dollars and
6976940	6982840	And um apparently it is available it's actually gonna be
6984300	6986780	It's available at right now at the source
6986980	6993520	Which is I guess is a circuit circuit city affiliate out of Canada and they have the online offer. It's actually for
6994300	6996300	329.99 and
6996940	6998940	That's pretty interesting
6999180	7000660	Wow
7000660	7002100	huh
7002100	7004100	anyways, um
7004100	7007700	And then finally in Guitar Hero 5
7008500	7011580	Their download content will be incompatible with world tour
7011580	7012300	So that's right
7012300	7013220	if there's new
7013220	7019780	download songs that come out now for Guitar Hero 5 you will not be able to download them for world tour because apparently they're adding new
7019780	7021780	features to them and
7021820	7023660	I
7023660	7025660	guess only
7026060	7028380	Also the download content for
7029460	7031460	world tour I guess of the
7031460	7034060	158 songs are on world tour and
7035460	7038860	Smash hits you'll only be able to download 152 of those
7040260	7043060	Back to your console, I guess when you're importing songs
7043060	7047740	but I mean that makes sense because rock band there was like five tracks you couldn't download because or three or
7048460	7052660	Three or five tracks that you couldn't download because of licensing stuff. So hmm
7053700	7058540	All right. Well, by the way, the chat wants us to mention that toe jam and Earl was the new winner of the poll
7058540	7062020	Yeah, that's what I thought. It was earthworm Jim remake was mentioned
7062860	7066800	Getting into some rapid-fire news over in my corner Diablo 3
7067480	7072400	Had its fourth character class revealed and it was spoiled a little bit early by a Korean website
7072540	7078820	But it was barbarian witch doctor wizard and monk monk is the fourth class there
7078820	7082500	I don't know if that's gonna be the last one or if there'll be more after that
7082500	7084340	I imagine it's got to be at least one or two more
7084340	7088780	But monk by the way was originally in the Hellfire expansion in the original Diablo
7089140	7092260	Where barbarian bard rogue sorcerer and warrior showed up?
7092260	7095060	So I assume there's gonna be at least a couple more classes that show up in Diablo 3
7095500	7099180	Although not too many because you know, they got to do the expansions later on, right?
7100420	7107080	Mm-hmm. Hey the Wii and the DS are getting new Tetris games next year. That's right
7107080	7110060	It's a partnership between Majesco and Tetris online
7110060	7114380	They'll be coming out on the Wii and the DS in the spring of 2010
7115100	7120060	No idea what the Tetris game is going to be like, but you know what Tetris DS is pretty badass
7120060	7122060	I don't know if we necessarily need another one. Oh
7123980	7130420	Well, I have judgment is making its way to the PSP that was announced at gamescom this way
7131220	7134900	You will get a basically a version of the Eye of Judgment, but of course there is no eye
7134900	7141860	Okay, that's why there's no bet there's still a lot of questions as to whether this will use the same cards or what-have-you
7141860	7145780	We just know the game is coming out and Loki says it will not count towards the bet
7145780	7149860	Why not look the reason why I won't count towards the bet because it's not as ridiculous as the Eye of Judgment
7149860	7156420	The Eye of Judgment is an actual physical card game that you had to play, you know using the PlayStation eye camera
7156420	7161020	Basically, it was you know, the camera in the game portion of it was completely
7161020	7165580	You didn't need it. I mean, it's like playing Magic the Gathering with someone filming you on camera and you know, something like that
7165580	7169140	This is actually a card game that's in digital form
7170140	7174500	That's an actual game that counts that that's that's you know, fine that makes sense
7174500	7177420	you know, that's how they should have done it in the first place, but
7178220	7183780	However, if it did come out with like, you know, if they decided to release a version that was a camera
7184100	7187260	You know and played the same way as the normal Eye of Judgment
7187260	7191260	Then yes, I would probably count towards the bet but it's not so sorry
7191260	7194260	And you're getting booed from the chat room, but you know what they can do
7194260	7195260	Not too bad
7195260	7197260	I completely understand why you're doing that
7197260	7198260	You know, even
7198260	7199260	You're right
7199260	7203260	The whole reason we made fun of the game in the first place was the fact because it had the camera to look at the cards
7203260	7204260	That was a little silly
7204260	7210260	I mean, it doesn't matter even if I did add the Eye of Judgment to the bet or whatever
7210260	7214260	It's still wouldn't meet a million units and it it but it's not so bad
7214260	7219260	It doesn't meet a million units and it but I'm not gonna do that because it's just stupid
7219260	7220260	Okay, the whole
7220260	7221260	You need to move on
7221260	7222260	Yes, we need to move on
7222260	7225260	Yes, we need to find a new cause and a new outfit
7225260	7226260	Exactly
7226260	7229260	Alright dark soccer
7229260	7230260	Do you have some rapid-fire news for us tonight?
7230260	7231260	I do indeed
7231260	7238260	Actually Midway Europe is now Trade West games
7238260	7241260	They were purchased
7241260	7247260	So, that's actually gone through. It's being fully rebranded.
7247260	7255260	Also, LittleBigPlanet is getting a re-release with 18 new levels and 7 download content packs.
7255260	7257260	Pretty cool, huh?
7257260	7260260	Yeah. I remember when Tradewest, by the way, did Double Dragon back in the day.
7260260	7266260	They were a big 8-bit developer. I don't know if it's the same company, but I just remember that name.
7266260	7276260	Well, the LittleBigPlanet packs are going to be the Metal Gear Solid level pack featuring the Paintinator.
7276260	7282260	Metal Gear Solid costumes, monster costumes, monster packs, history costumes, history pack, and animal costumes.
7282260	7290260	Did you see the new announcement that they're going to be adding a new expansion pretty much as epic as the Paintinator and all that stuff?
7290260	7295260	Where you actually have real water in the game now. That's going to be pretty awesome.
7295260	7297260	Hopefully we'll get some new levels.
7297260	7302260	I love that they're still adding big stuff to the game even though it's been out a while. Props to a media molecule.
7302260	7312260	Since we've had some discussion about Hideo Kojima, he actually has said that he finds the Metal Gear Solid series very puzzling too.
7312260	7319260	Which is why he keeps detailed timelines for all of the characters in the game.
7319260	7327260	He says, and I quote, this is especially tricky when you create the future first and then go back in time to create something new.
7327260	7332260	There are a lot of small aspects where sometimes it doesn't match completely. Sounds like Marvel Comics.
7332260	7333260	Or Star Trek.
7333260	7338260	Seriously. Well, yeah, but they fixed all that with the movie.
7338260	7341260	Not the newer canon. Just saying.
7341260	7349260	By the way, one other thing I wanted to mention though was the whole little big planet stuff.
7349260	7353260	I forgot what I was going to say. Forget it.
7353260	7356260	The water levels coming out soon. There's something I wanted to say about that.
7356260	7362260	The water, it's real water now so you can actually make real water levels and that kind of stuff.
7362260	7373260	One more comment from chat. Amazatsuma on the whole tingle bet says, we will move on once we see Loki dress as Tingle. Am I right, Penelope?
7373260	7380260	I renamed them back to OL Army. However, they were balls for a little while.
7380260	7385260	You had your opportunity. I can't help it if you can't come through with your end of the bargain.
7385260	7390260	You know what? It's just like, I don't know. I make bets that I know I'm going to win.
7390260	7395260	For example, there was somebody, one of my customers was betting me on the top grossing game this year.
7395260	7401260	And he said that, you know, he bet that Wii Sports Resort was going to be the top grossing game.
7401260	7409260	Not only was he cocky about it, but he said that they would beat out anything, the number two one by two million units.
7409260	7417260	And he also said, you know, so my guess, of course, was Modern Warfare 2 because you're a fucking idiot if you think Wii Sports Resort is going to sell that many units.
7417260	7424260	And he's like, fine, I'll give you Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. I'm like, you are so stupid.
7424260	7428260	But OK, I'll take that bet.
7428260	7431260	I will win that bet as well.
7431260	7432260	What is the bet?
7432260	7438260	We haven't figured it out yet what the actual prize of the bet will be, but he's so confident he's going to win that he'll probably do something stupid.
7438260	7442260	So I just have to wait for him to act on it.
7442260	7445260	Fair enough. Let's get back to some more gaming stories.
7445260	7449260	We have the mailbag coming up before too long, whether Dark Soccer likes it or not.
7449260	7454260	And the Skype line tonight, which will probably be kind of short tonight because we've been doing a lot of talking.
7454260	7458260	We've taken a lot of calls in the past couple weeks, but we'll at least get a couple of you on the line.
7458260	7462260	1877 game OLR, but that won't be for a little while now. So, Loki.
7462260	7474260	OK. Well, there's apparently an achievement that was discovered for the new game, Fairy Tale Fights, where you get some points for killing 1,000 children.
7474260	7478260	Yes, lots of child homicide.
7478260	7486260	Of course, the game is actually a beat-em-up that's extremely bloody. Think of like a Castle Crashers type of thing.
7486260	7498260	And of course, Yu-Gi-Oh! is reporting though that while this achievement is currently in the works, it's most likely going to be removed from the final game.
7498260	7501260	I don't know. I think they should keep it because that'd be funny.
7501260	7507260	So it's kind of one of those things that's lolsy for now, you know, in their little development, but probably won't actually get out there?
7507260	7508260	Yeah.
7508260	7512260	Boy, oh boy. Can you imagine if it really did-
7512260	7515260	Your pizza's burnt!
7515260	7517260	Dark Soccer burnt my pizza.
7517260	7519260	I'm smelling it. It's smelling nice and toasty.
7519260	7524260	I know. It does smell- Oh, no. Is it really, like, crispy? I kind of want to see it, but we're trying to do a radio show.
7524260	7526260	Can you do a monologue, Loki, while I go look at the burnt pizza?
7526260	7532260	Can I do a monologue? I don't know what to talk about. We just talked about fairy tale fights.
7532260	7535260	The game looks okay. I don't know.
7535260	7542260	But they're investigating a burnt pizza as if you haven't seen a burnt pizza before. It's just black and crispier!
7542260	7545260	I don't know.
7545260	7554260	So yes, going back to the bet, there is no way that I'm going to add Eye Judgment PSP to it, even though I am confident if I did that it wouldn't matter.
7554260	7559260	But see, that's the problem, though, is once we add Eye Judgment PSP, then where does it stop?
7559260	7562260	I'm just going to have to keep adding games until you eventually win.
7562260	7568260	And who really wants to play that way? That's not a bet. You should have won the first bet in the first place.
7568260	7574260	Why is everybody so curious about the burnt pizza?
7574260	7577260	Oh, they're weird.
7577260	7579260	Anyways, um-
7579260	7581260	Come back, come back, come back. Sorry.
7581260	7583260	Alright, alright.
7583260	7590260	No, I'm making her upload a picture of it to the pictures blog at orangehonestrader.com so you can see the fail.
7590260	7592260	Because it's pretty amazing.
7592260	7598260	And Becky is here and just brought Dark Sakura tacos. You, ma'am, are possibly the nicest friend ever.
7598260	7603260	Because she's been complaining about winning a taco all night long, and look at this.
7603260	7609260	She doesn't just bring her a taco. She brought the taco on a fucking silver platter. Look at that.
7609260	7613260	It's a dish covered in tin foil. It's a silver platter.
7613260	7619260	It's aluminum platter.
7619260	7623260	I'm getting yelled at from the kitchen. Technically, it's aluminum alloy.
7623260	7626260	I thought it was aluminium.
7626260	7630260	Because you're so British.
7630260	7632260	God, I wish our microphone would pick up the yelling from the kitchen.
7632260	7635260	I just literally heard screaming, I'm not British!
7635260	7640260	And deathwishing says in chatroom, there's an achievement on Dirt 2 called two girls, one cup.
7640260	7647260	It's actually two cups, one girl. It's about winning two cups in the game with one female driver.
7647260	7650260	Alright. Let me move on. I'm sorry.
7650260	7655260	I'm getting into another story that doesn't involve burnt food or what have you now that the whole house smells like crispy.
7655260	7660260	And I'm eyeing the taco on a silver platter that I want to devour.
7660260	7664260	Independent Xbox Live game has been banned. Why?
7664260	7668260	Because of visual sexual assault reminders.
7668260	7672260	It's a game called And Yet I Love You.
7672260	7674260	I can't even hear what she's saying.
7674260	7677260	Well, she's not on the radio, so we're just ignoring her.
7677260	7680260	If you don't have a mic, I can't hear you!
7680260	7682260	That's bad radio etiquette.
7682260	7684260	Terrible radio etiquette.
7684260	7689260	Alright. It was on the Japanese marketplace. It was pulled because it was too erotic.
7689260	7692260	It was an independent developer, Naoki Sagawa.
7692260	7694260	Is this related to the DDR Naoki?
7694260	7695260	No, probably not.
7695260	7699260	There is no sex in it. It is not an adult game.
7699260	7704260	However, apparently there were visual reminders of sexual assault.
7704260	7708260	Because in one scene, the girl's hands are restrained.
7708260	7713260	In one scene, a girl is being pushed down and her panties are visible.
7713260	7717260	That doesn't mean she's being assaulted. They could be having a fight or wrestling.
7717260	7720260	I mean, that's perfectly harmless.
7720260	7724260	What's interesting about this is that this was just Microsoft Europe that had a problem with the game.
7724260	7727260	So Sagawa basically wanted this to be limited to Japan.
7727260	7732260	However, Microsoft just basically said you need to stop distribution of this game altogether.
7732260	7735260	And there it was. It was kicked away.
7735260	7740260	Now, what's interesting is that I'm reading this story on Kotaku here, and they make a very good point.
7740260	7747260	And they say, by the way, while this is acceptable, you have Dead or Alive where you punch and kick females.
7747260	7750260	And you can see their panties pretty well.
7750260	7754260	You need to take a picture of the taco on a silver platter and put that on the blog, too,
7754260	7757260	because that's pretty amazing what Becky did there.
7757260	7759260	The taco is in the platter.
7759260	7761260	All right.
7761260	7766260	Oh, I thought that was the taco on the platter. Sorry, hi. Bad radio. Bad host.
7766260	7768260	Mmm, they're real tacos, too.
7768260	7771260	I know you're dying for food, but we've got to get your story, Dark Sakura.
7771260	7772260	My story? Oh, yeah.
7772260	7773260	Yes.
7773260	7774260	Give me a sec.
7774260	7776260	All right. Dark Sakura needs a moment.
7776260	7780260	Dark Sakura needs freaking food real bad.
7780260	7782260	I feel bad about the pizza, although, you know.
7782260	7784260	Your pizza's bacon.
7784260	7785260	Yay.
7785260	7790260	So, Sony has to make some explanations.
7790260	7794260	They got some explaining to do.
7794260	7801260	When they removed the backwards compatibility from the slim,
7801260	7806260	they needed to say what exactly was going on.
7806260	7815260	So, they say, and this is a quote from John Kohler, who's SCEA's director of marketing.
7815260	7821260	Now that we're at a point where we're three years into the life cycle of the PS3,
7821260	7825260	there are so many PS3 disc-based games that are available that we think,
7825260	7829260	and notice this from our research, that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3
7829260	7832260	cite PS3 games as a primary reason.
7832260	7836260	So, basically, they're saying, oh, people don't care about PS2 anymore.
7836260	7837260	What do you think?
7837260	7840260	Chat? People in the studio?
7840260	7841260	Are they right?
7841260	7843260	Do people not care about PS2 anymore?
7843260	7846260	Or as Ray Iyanami in chat says, and I love this,
7846260	7850260	backwards compatibility is so last gen.
7850260	7852260	I remember seeing an old OLR reference.
7852260	7853260	I don't know.
7853260	7854260	What do you think, Loki?
7854260	7855260	Are they right?
7855260	7856260	No, they're not right.
7856260	7859260	It's just they're basically saying, why the hell would we give you a feature for free
7859260	7864260	when you can buy our PlayStation 2 system for $100?
7864260	7867260	Or soon to be PlayStation 2 downloadable titles.
7867260	7870260	I bet you that is what you're going to see in the next year.
7870260	7872260	Then they're going to start releasing the PlayStation 2 as downloadable titles,
7872260	7874260	just to fuck us all.
7874260	7876260	But we can't add backwards compatibility, Butch.
7876260	7879260	We can sure as hell emulate these titles perfectly.
7879260	7881260	We know software emulation is out there.
7881260	7882260	We know it's possible.
7882260	7884260	They just don't want to give it to us.
7884260	7887260	Yep. Lame.
7887260	7889260	And yes, I do kind of want backwards compatibility.
7889260	7892260	I mean, yes, I realize the games are old, but I still have them.
7892260	7894260	And who doesn't sit there once in a while and go,
7894260	7897260	you know, I kind of want to play Magic Pen Gel and draw a giant penis.
7897260	7901260	You know, it's sometimes we get these desires to play the old PS2 games
7901260	7902260	or Final Fantasy 12.
7902260	7903260	I never did beat.
7903260	7908260	Yes, I have a PlayStation 2 that I could go back and hook up if I really wanted to.
7908260	7910260	But that's valuable shelf space.
7910260	7913260	I have enough crap in my living room as it is.
7913260	7917260	I realize Sony likes to live in a world where I don't own a 360 or a Wii,
7917260	7920260	but reality check, I do.
7920260	7925260	And in order to not have a tangled cobweb of wires behind my television,
7925260	7928260	some things had to go.
7928260	7931260	That's what twist ties are made for.
7931260	7933260	Just still.
7933260	7937260	I am sending updated pictures of my tacos, by the way.
7937260	7940260	I love how we have the food blog going on.
7940260	7943260	I posted a link in chat, but it's on orangelunchrody.com.
7943260	7946260	And you'll be able to see all these pictures if you're listening on the podcast,
7946260	7949260	but you probably don't care.
7949260	7951260	All right, anyhow, I don't know.
7951260	7955260	I think it's a little silly of them to rid us of the backwards compatibility,
7955260	7959260	especially when software emulation, at least of some titles, has been done.
7959260	7963260	It's a little bit frustrating, but whatever.
7963260	7967260	I mean, yeah, true, I can hook up the PS2 if I really want to play them that bad.
7967260	7972260	I'm just saying I would be more apt to still buying PlayStation 2 games if they would play...
7972260	7974260	I haven't bought a PS2 game since Final Fantasy XII.
7974260	7976260	That was the last one I ever bought.
7976260	7982260	Yeah. Well, they'll be happy to sell them to you as a digital download later on.
7982260	7988260	Well, with the announcement of the PlayStation Network minis,
7988260	7995260	of course, Nintendo is looking to revamp its DSiWare service to kind of combat it.
7995260	8000260	And what they're planning on doing, although the pricing won't change on the actual downloads,
8000260	8004260	they'll basically stick to the $2, $5, $9 price models,
8004260	8009260	they will have a lower barrier to entry for publishers,
8009260	8014260	and also they're going to have some size limits as well,
8014260	8018260	including, for example, a $5 game must be under 200 megabytes.
8018260	8023260	Otherwise, Nintendo will charge a higher royalty.
8023260	8029260	Which, that doesn't seem like much of an advantage, but okay.
8029260	8036260	And, I don't know. I just think they need some better games on there.
8036260	8040260	I know from seeing a lot of reviews I've been reading for different things,
8040260	8042260	I always see reviews for clocks and calculators.
8042260	8046260	And honestly, I don't need more fucking clocks and calculators.
8046260	8049260	I don't need a clock or calculator on my DSi.
8049260	8053260	The DSi has a clock, at least I know the regular DS, I don't have a DSi,
8053260	8057260	but at least the regular DS has a clock.
8057260	8060260	So, I don't get it.
8060260	8061260	It's themed clocks.
8061260	8064260	Silly.
8064260	8069260	We don't need more clocks or calculators.
8069260	8073260	What does Nintendo need on DSiWare in order for people to pay attention?
8073260	8076260	Virtual console.
8076260	8078260	Really?
8078260	8083260	That would- people would be eating that crap up, okay? Seriously.
8083260	8085260	I guess, but I would just be frustrated,
8085260	8088260	because you know they're not gonna let me just carry over the virtual console games I already have.
8088260	8089260	Oh, of course not!
8089260	8090260	I'd have to re-buy them.
8090260	8092260	And I don't think I'd be- homie don't play that.
8092260	8094260	I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be-
8094260	8095260	Your chair broke.
8095260	8097260	Did the chair just break live on air?
8097260	8098260	Oops.
8098260	8099260	Uh oh.
8099260	8101260	That can't be good.
8101260	8102260	Oh, it just popped off.
8102260	8103260	Oh, popped off.
8103260	8104260	No, it broke.
8104260	8106260	Ah, shoddy chair.
8106260	8112260	Oh dear, tonight's show is-
8112260	8114260	I just can't lean back.
8114260	8115260	Poor Loki.
8115260	8118260	It's alright, at least it's not a-
8118260	8119260	Footstool?
8119260	8122260	Yes, it's not the footstool.
8122260	8123260	Poor Loki, we need to get-
8123260	8127260	I almost bought an inflatable chair with my Dave and Buster's tickets.
8127260	8128260	No!
8128260	8131260	It's a hot pink inflatable chair with a pair of legs on it.
8131260	8135260	And now I'm thinking we need one for the studio for Loki.
8135260	8137260	I'm gonna pick up a folding chair next week.
8137260	8139260	Did you know, in the old studio at my house-
8139260	8141260	So they want a picture of Bork chair?
8141260	8142260	No.
8142260	8144260	The couch is now gone.
8144260	8147260	The ex came and took your couch away.
8147260	8150260	I'm glad our studio's here.
8150260	8151260	Alright, anyhow.
8151260	8153260	Sorry.
8153260	8154260	Random show is very random.
8154260	8155260	Hey!
8155260	8156260	Grin!
8156260	8157260	Remember them?
8157260	8159260	Well, Grin turned into Frown because they had to close last week.
8159260	8160260	And that was because-
8160260	8161260	Ah, Frown.
8161260	8162260	Yes.
8162260	8163260	Grin frowned because they got closed.
8163260	8165260	And we shouldn't laugh though, that's not nice.
8165260	8168260	But apparently they were the ones behind the Bionic Commando game.
8168260	8170260	And we didn't end up reporting this on our show last week.
8170260	8171260	I mean, it was just kind of a busy show, I guess.
8171260	8172260	But they actually closed.
8172260	8175260	They were the ones that were behind Bionic Commando.
8175260	8180260	Which was received a little bit lukewarmly, I guess you could say.
8180260	8181260	I mean, some people-
8181260	8183260	I have some friends that are really into it, but not-
8183260	8184260	It was alright.
8184260	8185260	It had the sales figure.
8185260	8188260	It didn't reinvigorate the series like a lot of people thought it would.
8188260	8194260	And, unfortunately, the studio just had to go bye-bye because of it, I guess.
8194260	8201260	But, apparently, one of the former employees posted to their LinkedIn profile that Grin
8201260	8203260	was working on an unreleased masterpiece.
8203260	8209260	And that masterpiece was a Final Fantasy game that they were working on for Squeenix.
8209260	8215260	I guess this guy on his personal site, Tomislav Spajek, actually posted to his personal site
8215260	8221260	some concept art, and Fortress, apparently, is the game that was like a Final Fantasy game
8221260	8222260	that was being worked on.
8222260	8228260	Probably not like Final Fantasy XV or anything like that, but some type of spin-off Final Fantasy game.
8228260	8230260	Do I have to close? Does that make them frown?
8230260	8233260	That's what I already asked. I made that joke a minute ago.
8233260	8234260	I didn't hear you. I was-
8234260	8235260	You were too busy stuffing your face full of taco.
8235260	8237260	No, I was busy kicking someone out of the chat room.
8237260	8238260	No.
8238260	8240260	Regulate!
8240260	8242260	Do not anger, Doc Sockers.
8242260	8246260	No, you act like a fucking child in the chat room. I'm gonna treat you like a freaking child.
8246260	8248260	Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.
8248260	8250260	This is not a democracy.
8250260	8252260	This is a cheerocracy.
8252260	8257260	No, this is a freaking fashion-
8257260	8259260	Becky got the reference. Did you hear the wall in the background?
8259260	8260260	Yes.
8260260	8261260	Thank you.
8261260	8262260	Alright.
8262260	8264260	It's a dark socorosity.
8264260	8269260	Alright, speaking of dark socorosity,
8269260	8272260	it's her chance to take over the show for a little bit.
8272260	8277260	She's gonna have to swallow the taco and get to the mailbag.
8277260	8281260	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you send your emails.
8281260	8282260	This is not a fish taco.
8282260	8283260	Every week.
8283260	8286260	Chew that taco, dark socor.
8286260	8289260	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. Let's read some emails.
8289260	8295260	Dear Rob, fuck you. Love, Jamie.
8295260	8297260	Dear Jamie, fuck you back. Love, Rob.
8297260	8299260	Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
8299260	8301260	Anyway, first thing I know.
8301260	8303260	I'm only on me.
8303260	8304260	Hey, guys.
8304260	8306260	Hi.
8306260	8308260	This summer has exhausted me.
8308260	8310260	Are you spent?
8310260	8316260	Between the summer of Arcade PSN and the two Monkey Island games that have been released, I am worn out.
8316260	8318260	Need a cigarette?
8318260	8319260	Just kidding. No smoke.
8319260	8324260	I just got into the Champions Online beta, and let me tell you, they're doing it all wrong.
8324260	8330260	There's some real good qualities in that game, but it will take a lot to fix things if they want to attract people to the game.
8330260	8335260	Then again, with an offer that includes a spot in the Star Trek beta, I don't think they need to.
8335260	8338260	Okay, I feel I need to ask a question now.
8338260	8341260	What three games are you looking forward to next month, if any?
8341260	8345260	I'm waiting on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Scribblenauts, and Beatles Rock Band.
8345260	8347260	Uh, keep what you're doing, guys. Peace.
8347260	8349260	And that's from Dan Chateau.
8349260	8351260	Um.
8351260	8352260	Excuse me.
8352260	8353260	I held the microphone away.
8353260	8354260	Hi, Dan Chateau.
8354260	8358260	Dude, I'm totally waiting. I totally, totally want Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
8358260	8362260	Except it's some freaking stupid Civil War crap, and I hate the Civil War crap.
8362260	8365260	Um, Scribblenauts, I'm also looking forward to, um...
8365260	8367260	You make Abraham Lincoln cry.
8367260	8369260	What?
8369260	8374260	Oh, shut up. It's the Marvel Civil War crap that they did that I got so sick of.
8374260	8377260	They could at least do, like, the Skrull War or something.
8377260	8379260	The Secret Invasion.
8379260	8383260	Uh, to answer the question for me, Ion, I'm looking forward to.
8383260	8386260	Uh, Beatles Rock Band is a good example of something else I'm looking forward to.
8386260	8388260	Um, that'll be very cool.
8388260	8392260	And, um, I don't know. Everything's kind of a blur for Christmas,
8392260	8395260	and a lot of the stuff I was interested in got pushed back to 2010.
8395260	8399260	So, um, I'm not sure. Those are definitely the two at the top of my list.
8399260	8402260	It depends on if I get my 360 fix soon or not.
8402260	8405260	Loki? Games you're looking forward to? Any planned purchases?
8405260	8407260	Um, TJ Hero.
8407260	8410260	Oh, that would be number three for me. I definitely have to check that out. Good call.
8410260	8412260	I thought that was October for some reason, not September.
8412260	8414260	It is October. Oh. Sorry.
8414260	8416260	But it's almost September, so we can have it.
8416260	8417260	Eh, good enough. Close enough.
8417260	8418260	September, I don't really have any...
8418260	8419260	He'll take that answer and he'll like it.
8419260	8422260	September, I don't really have anything I'm looking forward to.
8422260	8425260	Scribblenauts, I guess, would be kind of cool, but...
8425260	8427260	I probably won't be buying that.
8427260	8429260	I don't know. I may be buying that.
8429260	8433260	Omkara222 in chat says Final Fantasy XIV. I don't think that'll be out next month.
8433260	8435260	Keep talking. I'm still eating.
8435260	8438260	We'd be lucky if the beta would come out next month, but I somehow sadly doubt it.
8438260	8440260	So...
8440260	8441260	There you go.
8441260	8444260	Alright, we're gonna get to the next email as soon as StarSakura finishes chewing.
8444260	8448260	But a mailbag at Orange L'Anchor, I am so stealing a chip.
8448260	8451260	And I just want you... I'm gonna dare you to stop me.
8451260	8453260	Oh, uh, is the pizza still cooking?
8453260	8454260	Um...
8454260	8457260	Hey, OLR crew, what do you think of Bethesda's Wet?
8457260	8459260	It actually looks kind of pretty.
8459260	8464260	This game looks really interesting. I like the fact that it infuses a sort of kung fu game, a shooter, and a 3D fighter.
8464260	8469260	What did you guys see of it at E3? Thanks in advance, I like old people.
8469260	8473260	Oh, and PS, it puts the lotion in the basket.
8473260	8475260	Or else he gets the hose again.
8475260	8477260	Um...
8477260	8479260	Let's see, um...
8479260	8482260	I saw a little bit of it, and it looked cool.
8482260	8488260	I think Bethesda has a very good way of putting style on a lot of their games, unless it was the Star Trek game.
8488260	8494260	Um, but every time I hear Bethesda, I'm always like, where's Oblivion V? Where's Oblivion V? Or, I should say, sorry, Elder Scrolls V.
8494260	8496260	Where's Elder Scrolls V?
8496260	8497260	But...
8497260	8498260	They're working on it!
8498260	8501260	I still need to go back and play the Call of Cthulhu game.
8501260	8502260	What now?
8502260	8504260	Because I still want to play the Call of Cthulhu game.
8504260	8513260	Wet looked cool, but it didn't seem like the type of game I would probably drop $60 on, just because, you know, I like roleplaying and different styles of games.
8513260	8519260	Is there a demo out there? Oh, Henderson Man says the demo for Wet is on the European PlayStation Network store, and I thought the demo was awesome.
8519260	8521260	So go check it out.
8521260	8522260	I will.
8522260	8523260	Write us a review of it.
8523260	8525260	Yes, please. I'm curious to know more about it.
8525260	8528260	I have a profile for every region, so I can do that.
8528260	8529260	Woohoo!
8529260	8530260	Next email.
8530260	8532260	Next email, these ships are tasty.
8532260	8534260	Okay, from J-Rod.
8534260	8537260	Ow, it bit my lip.
8537260	8545260	Hey guys, I had something to speak up about. I had two Xbox 360s, and both of them ended up dying multiple times.
8545260	8546260	Okay.
8546260	8551260	After I sent them back to be repaired, they eventually died again, and I ended up getting a PS3 in the end.
8551260	8554260	Rob said that his 360 just died as well.
8554260	8556260	Now here's what I don't understand.
8556260	8564260	Why did Rob complain about customers giving Microsoft a free pass for faulty hardware, and then in the same breath say, well, I'm probably just going to pick up an Elite?
8564260	8571260	The product was rushed to market to beat Sony to the punch, and it couldn't be more obvious that they took shortcuts and screwed the customer to do so.
8571260	8575260	So this type of behavior is now somewhat rewarded.
8575260	8582260	Just because all my friends have one doesn't mean I need to give Microsoft my time and money for absolute shit hardware quality.
8582260	8592260	The problem is that people use Xbox Live as a MySpace page rather than a game console half the time, so they just keep buying new ones over and over.
8592260	8596260	The only time a company will learn is if you tell them with your wallet.
8596260	8601260	Send it back, and if they don't repair it, then scrap it, sell the games, and move on.
8601260	8606260	I hate to say it, but if Rob buys another Xbox 360, he's basically just part of their problem he's complaining about.
8606260	8612260	My current 360 is on its last leg with lockups, and if it dies, out the door it goes to eBay along with my games.
8612260	8614260	Excuse me.
8614260	8616260	Don't be a part of the problem, Rob. Be a part of the solution.
8616260	8620260	I absolutely disagree with you.
8620260	8623260	I think it's just the viewpoint's a little too extreme for me.
8623260	8627260	I get what he's saying, and I said earlier in the show, it was wrong of me.
8627260	8630260	You're right. If I buy an elite system, I'll meet you at that point.
8630260	8635260	If I buy an elite system, I'm rewarding Microsoft for borking my old system.
8635260	8639260	So I came to my realization about that earlier this week.
8639260	8644260	If I get another Xbox 360, which assuming Loki can't fix mine, I'm going to have to go for the low-end system.
8644260	8651260	So I see you there, but when you talk about this whole sell your games back and the whole thing, that's where you lose me.
8651260	8662260	Because you're smoking crack if you think that I'm going to sell all of my games back that I've invested hundreds of dollars in for a fraction of the cost.
8662260	8666260	And therein lies the problem, and therein lies where I'm screwed.
8666260	8674260	Because I have invested all this money not just in that, but on downloadable content, and some of which does not exist on the PlayStation 3,
8674260	8677260	that yes, I do like to revisit on a regular basis.
8677260	8680260	I have to have the hardware to make it work.
8680260	8685260	But I do agree that I should not reward Microsoft by buying the highest, most expensive version of it.
8685260	8689260	That I should buy a bare-bones system because I already have the hard drive and all the other crap I've bought.
8689260	8691260	I don't need all the other crap.
8691260	8697260	Hey, if you want the right to actually complain, you know, go buy 3% of the stock and then go to shareholder meetings.
8697260	8705260	I still do think, and I think most people agree with me, no matter if you think I was being a baby last week or what, no matter where,
8705260	8709260	I think everybody kind of agrees with me, that Microsoft does need to be held accountable for this.
8709260	8710260	No, they do.
8710260	8713260	And history needs to show this negatively on Microsoft.
8713260	8717260	When the next console comes out, the question needs to be asked.
8717260	8720260	Have you tested this so that half of them do not fail?
8720260	8727260	And somebody at Microsoft needs to go on record and assure the public that when and if the consoles fail,
8727260	8730260	there will be a program in place to do something about it.
8730260	8737260	And I'll tell you, though, what I'm going to do if this Xbox Red rings, because I think I'm on my third.
8737260	8743260	But also keep in mind, we can just, you know, go to the store and Dan can get a new one.
8743260	8753260	But I really think that, well, I don't know, I'd still be in warranty, so technically I'd get a new one for free.
8753260	8762260	But regardless, I would still take the time to write a letter and say, you know, hey, I still enjoy my games.
8762260	8770260	I own more in games than I own in the cost of the three systems.
8770260	8773260	So to me, it's a justified expense.
8773260	8777260	You know, it'd be like my computer, okay?
8777260	8780260	My last computer went kaput. What did I do?
8780260	8784260	I bought a computer and installed all the old same shit that I had on my last computer on my new computer.
8784260	8788260	You know, I've got all my Photoshop, my whole CS suite and everything.
8788260	8792260	I'm using my same tablet, you know, a peripheral.
8792260	8795260	I'm using my portable hard drive, the same thing.
8795260	8804260	So if you know a computer's going to be obsolete, you know, in a year, then what's the point of buying a new computer?
8804260	8806260	Same difference.
8806260	8816260	I just, at the end of the day, though, I do think it's bull that clearly the Xbox 60 fails more than any other piece of hardware we've ever seen.
8816260	8819260	Atari 7800.
8819260	8821260	In the last 15 years.
8821260	8828260	The Atari 7800 had issues with the power supply and they failed almost as much as the Xbox 360.
8828260	8832260	All right. Any more in the mailbag?
8832260	8836260	Oh, yeah.
8836260	8840260	Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real.
8840260	8843260	Oh, we already covered this.
8843260	8847260	But this is actually kind of funny. It's from one, is all I'll say.
8847260	8855260	Hey, O.L.R., I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real and will be coming out the first of next month and the original PS3 will drop $100.
8855260	8861260	I already saw the box at GameStop. My friend works there and showed me inside where the consoles are.
8861260	8867260	Also, the Xbox 360 price will be going down after Project Natal is released.
8867260	8871260	P.S., what is with these women having no bras anymore?
8871260	8880260	Don't get me wrong. I love tits. But when someone 50 years older than you does not have a bra on, I barf.
8880260	8884260	I think we should just let the e-mailers report on the news from now on.
8884260	8885260	Who did this? Juan?
8885260	8886260	Juan.
8886260	8890260	Juan needs a segment. Oh, my God. This is the same Juan that e-mailed us before, I bet, huh?
8890260	8891260	I think.
8891260	8894260	He needs a segment on this program one way or another.
8894260	8896260	What is up with that?
8896260	8900260	He's like our new extra fur.
8900260	8902260	You want a slice of your pizza, DarkSucker?
8902260	8903260	Yes, I do.
8903260	8904260	Okay, hold on.
8904260	8905260	Give me a cheesy piece.
8905260	8907260	I will let you pick whatever piece you want.
8907260	8908260	All right.
8908260	8910260	How many more e-mails do we have tonight?
8910260	8911260	This one, a few.
8911260	8912260	A few, all right.
8912260	8913260	I put this one in the name of science.
8913260	8915260	Make it snappy.
8915260	8919260	Shook here. Or is it Shookay? I never was told.
8919260	8927260	Last week, I sent an e-mail about my Final Fantasy X dilemma and your advice worked.
8927260	8935260	Oh, yeah, you had the bigot dad. Sorry, no offense.
8935260	8939260	Oh, yeah, your dad was the asshole. Oh, sorry, no offense.
8939260	8940260	But you're cool. You're cool.
8940260	8948260	I'm not in the habit of talking ill of other people's parents, but really, the way that you portrayed your dad made him look to be a major bigot.
8948260	8954260	But if I were to start with one, you are the winner.
8954260	8959260	Anyway, I just sold Madden 04, 05, and 06 for about $40 to a privately-owned game store.
8959260	8962260	I bought Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger and I'm loving both.
8962260	8964260	I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever.
8964260	8965260	Yes.
8965260	8974260	And when you beat it, go back and actually hop on the teleport device right at the beginning of the game and you can beat Lavas from the beginning and get the artist ending.
8974260	8977260	I'm sitting here in awe that he got that much for those old-ass Madden games.
8977260	8978260	Props to you.
8978260	8987260	Well, my dad walked in on me during the opening scene with Blitzball when he asked what it was. I made up something and said it was Super Soccer Extreme 2000 and he bought it.
8987260	8994260	Again, my huge thanks for the advice.
8994260	8998260	P.S. Dark Soccer, my username is pronounced as if the K was silent. Oh, sorry.
8998260	9001260	So, it's shoe.
9001260	9003260	K.
9003260	9004260	K.
9004260	9005260	K.
9005260	9007260	Well, I'm glad it worked.
9007260	9011260	Now move out.
9011260	9014260	Okay. This is from Rob with Two B's.
9014260	9015260	Ra-ba-ba.
9015260	9017260	I'm gonna say Ra-ba-ba.
9017260	9018260	Hi Ra-ba-ba.
9018260	9025260	I ran across this crap accidentally coming to a PS3 near you, LittleBigPlanet Water.
9025260	9038260	There's a trail of, there's a link and it looks like Sackboy will swim materials that float will float and Sackboy will have a hold your breath limit of air and I'm hoping they will give him scuba gear, the water equivalent of the untethered backpack.
9038260	9040260	So, yeah, we talked about that.
9040260	9044260	It has a, there's a video of creation mode on here.
9044260	9046260	So, that's kinda cool.
9046260	9052260	I can't wait to see how this gives a swift kick in the pants to all the user-generated levels and I agree with Ra-ba-ba.
9052260	9055260	Sorry, I have a mouth full of pizza.
9055260	9060260	I agree with Ra-ba-ba that it would be awesome if there was like a scuba gear or something like that.
9060260	9063260	Cause that means you can make these levels that were nothing but floating.
9063260	9067260	And do you know how much that's gonna increase the amount of clone games we see?
9067260	9069260	Like space shooters and stuff?
9069260	9071260	Amazing.
9071260	9073260	They're gonna reduce space shooters but the thing...
9073260	9075260	It may be, it'll be easier with the water thing.
9075260	9079260	Well, I think with the water though you are gonna get limited air supply and that type of stuff that's gonna work into it.
9079260	9083260	Well, what if there's a scuba gear like Ra-ba-ba suggests? I think that's a great idea.
9083260	9085260	Yeah, there will be that.
9085260	9090260	Well, there's also another email from him.
9090260	9096260	I just noticed a recent post on NeoFM.com about that old project.
9096260	9100260	It's not really an update but some smart cookie converted it to Pump It Up.
9100260	9103260	Both are five panel games in the arcade.
9103260	9109260	It's at the game zone at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in the Great...
9109260	9114260	Is it pronounced Olathe or Lathy? Kansas?
9114260	9116260	Anyway, somewhere in Kansas.
9116260	9118260	That's great.
9118260	9122260	But there's details in the article at NeoFM.com.
9122260	9128260	And then the other...
9128260	9134260	And yes, I do remember this dancing game. This is the one that was gonna look like a BeatMania controller but it was with feet.
9134260	9136260	Yeah. So, there you go.
9136260	9138260	It was lol-worthy.
9138260	9140260	And they have video of it.
9140260	9142260	Interesting. And in Kansas?
9142260	9143260	Yeah, it's a...
9143260	9145260	How random.
9145260	9151260	It's from... It's a tooth... Well, NeoFM and a Pump It Up machine and...
9151260	9153260	Well, because the whole thing runs off StepMania.
9153260	9158260	I'm saying we should send Shane to go look but he won't care.
9158260	9159260	I know he won't.
9159260	9161260	Oh, I got something for him. Thanks to Becky.
9161260	9163260	What's that?
9163260	9165260	Let me get it.
9165260	9170260	He'll love it. We should send it to him and autograph it and everything.
9170260	9172260	He wouldn't care about our autographs.
9172260	9175260	He probably already has that but you never know.
9175260	9179260	Okay, well then, I'll do something with it.
9179260	9183260	Okay, O.O.R. listeners, who wants a copy of High School Musical 3?
9183260	9185260	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
9185260	9188260	Let us know and you'll get it.
9188260	9190260	Because nobody in this room wants it.
9190260	9195260	Or nobody in the hall either, else it would not be in my house.
9195260	9198260	No, I'm sure... Ask him. He may not have it.
9198260	9200260	He may not have bought it for whatever reason.
9200260	9205260	Yeah, actually it says there's apparently the code leaked out for NeoFM.
9205260	9210260	So it says, meanwhile some cool cats managed to get their hands on two separate leaks of our code
9210260	9217260	and put them in a centrifuge with some fairy dust and in the groove pumping up Linux code.
9217260	9223260	They're pumping up machines to a local arcade neon FM 2009 machine.
9223260	9228260	By the way, there's stuff leaked out to the internet a while ago in StepMania format.
9228260	9230260	I have it, but eh.
9230260	9233260	Oh, this is good pizza.
9233260	9237260	Look how much of it I've eaten. It's good stuff. I like it.
9237260	9239260	Except it's making me fat.
9239260	9242260	Alright, any other emails tonight?
9242260	9245260	Um, no.
9245260	9247260	Alright, mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.
9247260	9251260	It's time to get angsty and I don't really have a good story to lead us into this tonight,
9251260	9270260	but what would the show be without the FUs of the week?
9270260	9273260	You know, I actually didn't have a story to lead us into that.
9273260	9275260	You want to tell us real fast?
9275260	9283260	Yeah, well I mentioned it earlier, GameStop saying GameStop expects a UMD dump by new PSP Go owners.
9283260	9290260	Since, obviously, Sony's not supporting them, Tony Bartell, the GameStop EVP of Merchandising and Marketing,
9290260	9295260	said we have a very clear roadmap on how we can drive profitability on the sales of games.
9295260	9303260	It will also be a strong contribution in their trade-in process when you have people that will have UMD games
9303260	9308260	and they will no longer work on the platform and they'll fuel additional currency for GameStop.
9308260	9311260	Hail, GameStop.
9311260	9313260	That's it.
9313260	9315260	DarkSaga, you're angst then.
9315260	9318260	My FU goes to how much my hand hurts.
9318260	9325260	I had surgery again on Friday for him to pull out the rest of the suture, and what happened is that the suture was in a knot,
9325260	9327260	which is why it wouldn't come out.
9327260	9330260	It had been knotted up inside my hand.
9330260	9333260	So when it got tugged on, of course, ow!
9333260	9336260	So, yeah, suture stuck in hand.
9336260	9342260	But it's gone now, which means I get two more additional weeks off of work.
9342260	9344260	That means you'll have the time off when Misty's here, huh?
9344260	9346260	Sure will, except for my anniversary.
9346260	9347260	Right, no, I know.
9347260	9348260	Thank you.
9348260	9352260	I have to work that day. I hope she has something planned for the day.
9352260	9354260	We'll figure something out.
9354260	9359260	And also announcing to the universe, September 1st is my four year anniversary.
9359260	9362260	But you've known Dan for like nine on top of that, right?
9362260	9365260	We've been together for eleven and a half years.
9365260	9366260	Nice.
9366260	9368260	Loki, any angst for you tonight?
9368260	9374260	Not really. I guess I have to wait for my arcade cabinet to come in.
9374260	9378260	I have to wait another four weeks, basically.
9378260	9382260	And, yeah, that just sucks.
9382260	9385260	But, no, that's all I got.
9385260	9389260	My F.U. of the week, I've had a really, really shitty week.
9389260	9393260	I just want to say F.U. to people that want to play political games
9393260	9398260	and all that crap when I'm just not down with it.
9398260	9401260	You know what? I am a professional individual.
9401260	9405260	I go to places to get a job done and I'm not interested in playing games.
9405260	9407260	So I will get my job done.
9407260	9412260	Also an F.U. to the fact that when I'm having these bad days,
9412260	9417260	the person I want to turn to to talk about these things about
9417260	9421260	is absent with better things to do, I suppose.
9421260	9423260	I've not had a good week.
9423260	9425260	I'm going to go home and cry into my pillow.
9425260	9427260	We're going to get ice cream after the show again.
9427260	9430260	We've got to finish in the next hour because Baskin Ramen closes at ten.
9430260	9431260	So step on it!
9431260	9433260	We'll get you pie later.
9433260	9435260	Alright, we've got some news from Loki.
9435260	9437260	Actually, we're getting to the Skyplane pretty soon.
9437260	9439260	We're almost to the end of the show, believe it or not.
9439260	9440260	Yes, we are.
9440260	9446260	Lots of Rock Band information, including the details on the first download content
9446260	9448260	that's going to be available for Rock Band Beatles.
9448260	9452260	The first two albums that they're going to have available will be
9452260	9457260	Abbey Road and also Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
9457260	9464260	Abbey Road will be arriving first on October 20th at the price of $16.98
9464260	9475260	or 1360 Microsoft Points with each individual track running you $2 or 160 Microsoft Points.
9475260	9480260	Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band will come out in November.
9480260	9486260	I guess also the next album after that will be Rubber Soul and that will arrive in December.
9486260	9490260	Lots of tracks coming out, man.
9490260	9493260	They've got Uber tracks.
9493260	9496260	And what's going to be kind of cool about that though, I'm assuming,
9496260	9500260	is that each one's going to have the different animations in the background.
9500260	9504260	So some of those songs actually would be kind of cool to see.
9504260	9507260	I'm really kind of considering maybe buying this.
9507260	9508260	I don't know.
9508260	9511260	I don't really play a lot of Rock Band lately.
9511260	9513260	But it might be fun. I don't know.
9513260	9515260	I like some of these songs.
9515260	9518260	I think I'm totally going to have it.
9518260	9522260	I'm so mad my Xbox crapped out right before a song I really wanted to play had come out
9522260	9523260	and I didn't get to play it.
9523260	9524260	Here's the problem.
9524260	9527260	Here's the thing I have a little problem about.
9527260	9530260	And I'm kind of confused in this sense.
9530260	9533260	Because some of these songs I thought were already in the game.
9533260	9536260	Remember how they were showing us different songs like
9536260	9539260	Octopus's Garden and stuff like that?
9539260	9544260	I thought that was already in the game.
9544260	9549260	But for some reason it's listed on the Abbey Road download content here.
9549260	9553260	Well it might also be that when you download the album you're kind of getting the rest of the album.
9553260	9556260	Because I think every album has some representation in the game.
9556260	9558260	So I don't know.
9558260	9562260	Maybe. I guess maybe they're just listing what's on the album and not actual download content.
9562260	9565260	That could be because if these people said to the website,
9565260	9567260	like, hey we're releasing these albums,
9567260	9570260	the website probably just went to Amazon.com and just wrote out the track list
9570260	9573260	without thinking, oh this song is probably in the game already.
9573260	9574260	You know what I mean?
9574260	9575260	Yeah.
9575260	9576260	That makes sense.
9576260	9579260	And apparently I guess the All You Need Is Love download content,
9579260	9581260	which is going to be a single,
9581260	9584260	will be available as a timed exclusive on Xbox 360
9584260	9586260	and the game's launch is September 9th.
9586260	9589260	And then also if you purchase a full Abbey Road album,
9589260	9592260	you'll have the option to play the B-Side Melody,
9592260	9595260	or B-Side Medley I'm sorry, from
9595260	9599260	You'll Never Get Me Your Money Through The End
9599260	9601260	as one continuous track.
9601260	9603260	I may not be the biggest Beatles fan in the world.
9603260	9608260	I'm like, cool, Beatles are cool. I respect that people are in love with them.
9608260	9610260	I understand why they have such a place in history and so forth.
9610260	9613260	But I'm actually really excited about this game.
9613260	9615260	It just looks so cool.
9615260	9617260	It's fun to watch and play.
9617260	9618260	Yeah.
9618260	9619260	Other stuff.
9619260	9622260	This week on the Rock Band Store,
9622260	9627260	they're going to have Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and Jet.
9627260	9630260	The individual songs, of course, from Billy Idol.
9630260	9632260	Please say it's Cradle of Love.
9632260	9633260	No.
9633260	9634260	White Wedding.
9634260	9635260	That's already in there.
9635260	9636260	No.
9636260	9639260	It's Mony Mony and Rebel Yell.
9639260	9641260	Oh, Rebel Yell's cool. Okay.
9641260	9644260	And each of those are available for 160 Microsoft points or $2.
9644260	9649260	Fleetwood Mac, you have Don't Stop and World Turning.
9649260	9653260	Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow, Baby.
9653260	9655260	I should sing the Rock Band songs every week.
9655260	9658260	And Jet, you have She's A Genius.
9658260	9664260	And then finally, Tom Petty, you have I Won't Back Down and Running Down a Dream.
9664260	9669260	And those are all available August 25th through the 27th,
9669260	9671260	depending on which store you're getting in from.
9671260	9673260	Tom Petty's kind of awesome.
9673260	9675260	And then, of course, the Wii.
9675260	9677260	You've got lots of stuff coming there.
9677260	9680260	A lot of it just previously released stuff on other things.
9680260	9682260	You have a lot of tracks from Grateful Dead,
9682260	9687260	Foo Fighters, Dropkick Murphy, White Zombie, that kind of stuff.
9687260	9690260	And those will all be available for 200 Wii points each.
9690260	9692260	And those will be available on the 25th.
9692260	9696260	And then finally on the PSP, you're getting two things of download content on the 27th,
9696260	9701260	including the Zombies She's Not There and White Zombie Black Sunshine,
9701260	9703260	each available for $2.
9703260	9711260	And finally, Rock Band's download content is expected to hit 1,000 tracks by the holiday.
9711260	9718260	And there's going to be some new tracks, of course, coming from Queen, Nirvana, Tom Petty,
9718260	9726260	which we got some this week, Elton John, Iggy Pop, The White Stripes, Pantera, Talking Heads,
9726260	9729260	Korn, and The Raccoon Tears.
9729260	9731260	What do you have from Iggy Pop?
9731260	9734260	I don't think they've given any songs yet, just bands.
9734260	9738260	No, they're just listing stuff, as well as many more from other artists.
9738260	9740260	But hey, that's kind of cool.
9740260	9742260	It's kind of like Elton John, Queen.
9742260	9743260	Need I say more?
9743260	9744260	I need to get Sing Star Queen, by the way.
9744260	9745260	That is out and about.
9745260	9746260	Oh, need.
9746260	9749260	I'm waiting for the price drop, because you know, once the game's out a month,
9749260	9751260	it'll be in the clearance bin for 1999.
9751260	9754260	That's what I'm waiting for.
9754260	9755260	And that's it.
9755260	9756260	Sweet.
9756260	9758260	That was a lot of Rock Band news.
9758260	9761260	They are busy bees over there, considering there was no Rock Band 3 this year.
9761260	9762260	500 tracks a year?
9762260	9763260	That's not bad.
9763260	9764260	Good lord.
9764260	9766260	A lot more than certain other music franchises.
9766260	9767260	Apparently.
9767260	9768260	La la la la la.
9768260	9771260	Alright, hey, Gran Turismo 5 is the last story we have tonight,
9771260	9775260	before we get to the phone lines a little later on.
9775260	9778260	Apparently, this was being shown off at Gamescom.
9778260	9781260	Not just Gran Turismo 5, but Gran Turismo PSP.
9781260	9784260	There's some images of the game that have leaked out to the internet,
9784260	9787260	and of course, they are pretty.
9787260	9788260	The main menu looks like what you see in-
9788260	9789260	I like how you said that.
9789260	9790260	What?
9790260	9791260	Pretty.
9791260	9792260	It is pretty.
9792260	9793260	Look, it's pretty.
9793260	9795260	I always want to say Grand Theft Auto 5.
9795260	9798260	It's Gran Turismo 5, because GT-
9798260	9799260	I just want to put the A in there.
9799260	9804260	GT5 Prolog uses that same kind of menu.
9804260	9805260	So there you go.
9805260	9807260	There's going to be 80 tracks in the game.
9807260	9809260	1,000 cars.
9809260	9813260	830 regular ones, and 170 with a little more modeling.
9813260	9818260	Damage will be in the game, and GTTV is back.
9818260	9820260	And it can also be run on your PSP.
9820260	9823260	No release date yet, which you know what that means.
9823260	9825260	2010.
9825260	9826260	It's been a long-
9826260	9827260	It is 2010.
9827260	9829260	Considering we got that prologue quite some time ago,
9829260	9831260	that's a long wait.
9831260	9833260	That's a very long wait.
9833260	9835260	Very cool if you're a fan of Gran Turismo.
9835260	9837260	I am not as big on the Gran Turismo series,
9837260	9840260	because I like my arcade racers.
9840260	9842260	Gran Turismo is a little too realistic for me.
9842260	9844260	It's more like Project Gotham and stuff.
9844260	9845260	It's not that I hate them.
9845260	9848260	I think they're pretty to watch other people play that are good at it.
9848260	9850260	I'm just really bad at them.
9850260	9852260	So there you go.
9852260	9854260	Hey, it's your turn to give us a call.
9854260	9856260	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9856260	9858260	Our username on Skype is OrangeLaundrio.
9858260	9860260	The Skype line is open right now.
9860260	9862260	We're only going to take a couple calls tonight.
9862260	9866260	But we want to also get any last minute stories that might be out there
9866260	9868260	while we wait for folks to call.
9868260	9870260	Yes. Why not?
9870260	9871260	Go ahead.
9871260	9872260	Darcy, do you have something?
9872260	9873260	I like pie.
9873260	9878260	And you know, and think that I was going to let you go ahead and go first.
9878260	9880260	That teaches me.
9880260	9886260	Anyways, UK is getting a pretty cool deal with Guitar Hero 5 purchases.
9886260	9890260	Much like how we're getting the free Van Halen over here.
9890260	9897260	Folks that purchase Guitar Hero 5 in the UK will be eligible to get a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour.
9897260	9899260	That's more songs.
9899260	9901260	And you know, probably a better selection.
9901260	9902260	It's something.
9902260	9903260	Hey, we've got a call.
9903260	9905260	Hi, you're on OrangeLaundrio. Who's this?
9905260	9907260	It's Deathwishing.
9907260	9909260	Hey, Deathwishing. What's up?
9909260	9913260	Nothing. I just had a really cool week and it's ending really well.
9913260	9922260	But I wanted to talk about the Halo ODSD tour and how in a way it's kind of crap.
9922260	9924260	Why is it crap? Someone asked about this on Twitter tonight.
9924260	9926260	It has an age requirement on it.
9926260	9927260	Oh really?
9927260	9930260	Yeah, you have to be 17 and older. I don't know if they check ID or anything.
9930260	9934260	I mean, I don't have ID. I don't have a driver's license yet.
9934260	9938260	You know, in California they make you pay up the ass to get one.
9938260	9941260	Well, it is a mature rated game.
9941260	9948260	Yeah, but I just find it really lame because it's just like...
9948260	9952260	It's a mature rated game and yet we're all going to get our hands on it.
9952260	9953260	There's going to be like 8-year-old kids going,
9953260	9956260	Oh my god, I pwn you, noob.
9956260	9958260	T-bag.
9958260	9960260	That's because parents suck.
9960260	9963260	Hey, my parents were cool. I was playing Grand Theft Auto back then.
9963260	9967260	And look at me, I grew up to be perfectly fine.
9967260	9972260	Are there individuals out there that might debate that comment, Death Wishing?
9972260	9979260	That one Californian politician who got banned.
9979260	9981260	If you know who he is.
9981260	9982260	No idea.
9982260	9985260	But did you go to the tour? Are you planning on going to the tour?
9985260	9989260	I'm planning on going to it. I'm going to try to talk my friend into taking me down to Pasadena.
9989260	9994260	But I don't see any coming near you guys, sadly.
9994260	9996260	I'm not sad.
9996260	10000260	Hey, it's pretty cool. You get free stuff. I think you get t-shirts and stuff for doing it.
10000260	10004260	Whoopee. I'm not that big on Halo.
10004260	10006260	I understand why people love their Halo.
10006260	10011260	I used to play Halo 2 all the time with my college friends, but I'm kind of over it.
10011260	10016260	Rob, about your 360, I don't see why yours is broken down so much.
10016260	10021260	I'm on my second, but my first one still works.
10021260	10023260	I just have to close the tray in.
10023260	10026260	I just open and close it to get games to work, and I'm letting my friend use it because his blew up.
10026260	10028260	Like, literally exploded.
10028260	10031260	Wow. That's impressive.
10031260	10033260	The amazing exploding 360s.
10033260	10037260	I call mine the Jesus box because it won't die.
10037260	10038260	It just keeps resurrecting.
10038260	10040260	Alright, well, Death Wishing-
10040260	10042260	The red ring then came back.
10042260	10045260	We're going to let you go so we can get as many calls as we can tonight and still have time for ice cream.
10045260	10047260	But thanks so much for the call, okay?
10047260	10048260	Boy.
10048260	10049260	Boy.
10049260	10052260	I should ask him if he's going to the Silent Hill house.
10052260	10054260	Because I still want to go.
10054260	10056260	I still do. I think we're just going to have to go.
10056260	10058260	We're just going to have to get in the car and go.
10058260	10060260	But I'm poor.
10060260	10062260	So?
10062260	10064260	Sell your soul.
10064260	10066260	No, I already did.
10066260	10068260	That's why I've-
10068260	10069260	Never mind.
10069260	10072260	Alright. Hi, you're on the wrong side. Who's this?
10072260	10074260	This is DS Master 26.
10074260	10076260	Hi, what's on your mind, DS Master 26?
10076260	10080260	I'm hearing Echo. Try to get the microphone away from the speaker.
10080260	10084260	Oh, sorry. I'm going off the PSP 3000 here.
10084260	10086260	It's fine.
10086260	10090260	Here, I'm going to get my headset in here.
10090260	10094260	Ironic. DS Master on a PSP.
10094260	10096260	Ah, whatever.
10096260	10100260	Basically, I'm here to do a review of a new game.
10100260	10102260	Yes.
10102260	10104260	Poppin' Music for Wii.
10104260	10110260	Oh, you played Poppin' Music for Wii, and you don't sound happy about it. Please tell us all about this game.
10110260	10113260	It's complete crap.
10113260	10120260	I've been a long time Beemani fan, and this has done great disgrace to the series.
10120260	10126260	Okay, I need to know the reason why it's crap, and I need to know how it's different from the Poppin' Music us Beemani fans know.
10126260	10128260	Basically, all-
10128260	10132260	You know what they did with the DDR games and thrown those in the crapper?
10132260	10141260	Well, it's all licensed stuff like Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus stuff into Poppin'.
10141260	10148260	And there's no controller with it. You just use the Wii Remote nunchuck like you would on...
10148260	10153260	Oh, let me see here. Rayman Raving Rabbids in the dancing section.
10153260	10157260	That's pretty much how it's played. It's complete crap.
10157260	10160260	Hmm.
10160260	10164260	Well, that's too bad.
10164260	10170260	Ray Ayanami in chat is asking, no Konami originals?
10170260	10177260	Very few, if any. They tried to put in a revamped B4U song in there somehow.
10177260	10183260	And then something out of, like it sounds like I've, I don't know if you've heard of this cartoon.
10183260	10188260	Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. They came out a few years ago.
10188260	10192260	Puffy's an actual pop band in Japan.
10192260	10197260	Yeah, and I think one of their songs ended up somewhere in the game.
10197260	10204260	I don't remember which one it was, but it was complete crud. It was one of the DLC tracks.
10204260	10209260	I mean, that's one thing this one has that all the others didn't have was DLC.
10209260	10214260	I mean, yeah, I'm glad they're finally getting to the next gen and DLC to their music games.
10214260	10221260	But at the same time, Konami's just disappointing the B-Monic fans left and right.
10221260	10223260	Hmm.
10223260	10231260	And, by the way, just to let you know, that line you coded, it's straight off one of my favorite series.
10231260	10234260	Bring It On.
10234260	10238260	Only the best movie of all time.
10238260	10244260	Yes, and they just got a fifth one, and I have a review on that. It is awesome.
10244260	10248260	They have a fifth Bring It On movie now? I've only ever seen the first one.
10248260	10250260	Yeah, way too many Bring It On movies.
10250260	10253260	I said, brrr, it's cold in here. Alright, forget it.
10253260	10256260	Anyhow, alright, we're letting you go, DS Masters, we're gonna get some more calls.
10256260	10259260	Go watch Bring It On on your PSP.
10259260	10274260	Um, no, no, no, but basically I heard rumors of possibly that the choreographer from that is doing a second All Star Cheer Camp game, or whatever, for Wii.
10274260	10275260	Yes, they are.
10275260	10280260	Which I actually pointed, it does give you a workout twice as much as Wii Fit will ever give you.
10280260	10286260	Okay, great, bye. I guess he didn't hear the part where he said I was letting him go, he just kept talking.
10286260	10290260	It's important that we know about All Star Cheer Camp, though.
10290260	10293260	Poor guy, I was so rude to him. I hope he hears this.
10293260	10296260	You're horrible, Rob. Horrible human being.
10296260	10300260	Well, did I not say, okay, we gotta wrap up to get some more calls?
10300260	10303260	He wasn't done yet, okay? That's just wrong.
10303260	10305260	He was talking about choreography.
10305260	10308260	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
10308260	10311260	What?
10311260	10314260	Ah, crap!
10314260	10320260	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10320260	10323260	Give us a call if you want to talk.
10323260	10329260	Our number is 555-4444.
10329260	10332260	No, it's not really, it's 1877 Game OLR.
10332260	10334260	Since it's not ringing, I'm gonna give it some more.
10334260	10336260	If you don't call, we'll get off the cleanse.
10336260	10338260	Oh, here we go, last call.
10338260	10340260	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10340260	10341260	Hi, this is AgDef.
10341260	10343260	Hi, AgDef, what's on your mind?
10343260	10348260	First of all, sorry about your 360. I'm definitely sorry it happened.
10348260	10350260	Dude, I don't know why you're blaming yourself.
10350260	10353260	The damn thing was obviously gonna break eventually.
10353260	10357260	At least I went down in a blaze of glory.
10357260	10359260	Yeah, that's true.
10359260	10361260	I'm just joking, man.
10361260	10365260	Though I am sorry about the thing breaking.
10365260	10367260	I blame Microsoft, not you.
10367260	10369260	What's on your mind?
10369260	10373260	I wanted to talk about the digital download thing.
10373260	10375260	You were talking at the beginning of the show?
10375260	10378260	Yes.
10378260	10382260	I think I made a comment in chat, or in Penelope,
10382260	10391260	that most people have a really good connection to internet.
10391260	10395260	Like me, I don't have a really good connection.
10395260	10400260	I have only one megabyte per second connection,
10400260	10404260	so it would take me an eternity to download a four,
10404260	10408260	or maybe six, or bigger game.
10408260	10410260	That is a damn good point.
10410260	10413260	That is a damn good point I think a lot of people forget to consider,
10413260	10415260	is that you know what? In some parts of the world,
10415260	10417260	they're still on dial-up.
10417260	10419260	In fact, I bet there are some places where they're still using
10419260	10422260	two Dixie cups and a string to connect to the internet.
10422260	10425260	Basically.
10425260	10430260	It is not all super fast cable connections everywhere in the world.
10430260	10434260	Granted, I guess not every game company technically does business
10434260	10436260	in every part of the world if you want to get technical,
10436260	10441260	but still, it is a little bit sad that if they go this digital distribution route,
10441260	10443260	I mean, how easy would it be?
10443260	10445260	I know you've called in the show.
10445260	10447260	You live in Mexico, and I know you've talked about sometimes
10447260	10449260	coming up to the U.S. to get games,
10449260	10451260	or having them shipped down to you or what have you.
10451260	10453260	Imagine if with this digital distribution stuff,
10453260	10455260	they could just say,
10455260	10457260	oh, block Mexico, it's not their time yet.
10457260	10459260	We have to wait until we get the localized version for them,
10459260	10461260	so we're just going to block their IP,
10461260	10463260	so that they can't get the game.
10463260	10465260	That would suck.
10465260	10467260	Yeah, like it happened with Palapon 2.
10467260	10471260	It's only a digital download in the United States.
10471260	10474260	Though, Sony made a good decision,
10474260	10478260	and they brought the UMD over here.
10478260	10481260	So maybe if they do that in the future,
10481260	10483260	if you can have the digital download,
10483260	10485260	or you can have the disk,
10485260	10489260	you have the option that maybe it could work better.
10489260	10491260	But if you only have one option,
10491260	10494260	and it's the digital download, it won't work.
10494260	10495260	It definitely won't work.
10495260	10498260	I think, Akdeft, you definitely bring up a good point
10498260	10500260	about something that I bet a lot of people don't think about
10500260	10503260	because a lot of us are spoiled with our cable connections
10503260	10505260	here in the States.
10505260	10508260	Akdeft, anything else real quick before I let you go?
10508260	10510260	No, nothing else.
10510260	10512260	Okay. See ya.
10512260	10513260	See ya.
10513260	10515260	Thank you for calling.
10515260	10517260	Yes, thanks as always for calling.
10517260	10520260	I like it when our callers get us to think about things
10520260	10522260	that we didn't think about before.
10522260	10524260	I don't like thinking. It's horrible.
10524260	10526260	Well, too bad. Think about some other last-minute stories
10526260	10527260	while I close up Skype.
10527260	10529260	If you didn't get through, hey, you can always tweet us,
10529260	10531260	email us, chat with us.
10531260	10533260	Or buy me a pony.
10533260	10535260	Or buy Jamie. Guess what I saw yesterday, Jamie?
10535260	10536260	A pony?
10536260	10537260	Derby Owners Club.
10537260	10539260	Where? Where's the doc?
10539260	10542260	Dave & Buster's. Milpitas. Still.
10542260	10545260	Ooh, I love the horsey racing games.
10545260	10546260	I'm kind of over it.
10546260	10549260	They needed a sequel about five years ago.
10549260	10552260	Hey, there's a new game coming to the PS3
10552260	10555260	called 3D Dot Game Heroes.
10555260	10559260	It's basically kind of a 3D version of pixel art.
10559260	10561260	If you were to take, like, an old-school Final Fantasy game
10561260	10564260	and make it all 3D and high-res,
10564260	10566260	that's what the game would look like.
10566260	10567260	It's kind of cool.
10567260	10570260	And that should be coming out in Japan this November.
10570260	10572260	No word on it coming over to the US,
10572260	10576260	but I only hope it does, because that would be awesome.
10576260	10578260	Castle Crashers is getting new download content
10578260	10581260	in the Necromatic pack,
10581260	10584260	and that will feature some really cool things,
10584260	10589260	including a chainsaw, a golden mace,
10589260	10592260	a dragon head animal orb,
10592260	10595260	and also two new characters,
10595260	10599260	the necromancer and the cult minion you'll get to play as.
10599260	10601260	So all that available.
10601260	10604260	No word on what the cost or when it's coming,
10604260	10607260	but hopefully soon.
10607260	10611260	Ubisoft has officially revealed a new game
10611260	10613260	that they're putting out called Just Dance
10613260	10617260	for people who, I guess, want to dance.
10617260	10622260	And the game itself actually focuses more on arm and leg movements,
10622260	10625260	mainly arm movements, it looks like.
10625260	10628260	But, yeah, the people in there,
10628260	10632260	they call them, I think, the lifestyle shots or whatever,
10632260	10635260	look absolutely ridiculous.
10635260	10638260	But it is going to be coming out,
10638260	10642260	and they have 30 licensed tracks,
10642260	10644260	including Groove is in the Heart,
10644260	10646260	Pump Up the Jam, and You Can't Touch This,
10646260	10652260	who are, you know, I don't know.
10652260	10657260	And also, I guess people are slightly interested in this title
10657260	10661260	because they think that maybe it's being developed by Q Entertainment.
10661260	10665260	This might be the secret title that they're developing.
10665260	10667260	Hope not!
10667260	10669260	It looks like crap.
10669260	10672260	I hope it's not.
10672260	10676260	Konami is apparently location testing Pop'n Music 18.
10676260	10678260	That's right.
10678260	10682260	The new mix, I believe, was...
10682260	10685260	God, I just had it, too.
10691260	10694260	I forgot the name, and I can't find it.
10694260	10696260	Anyways, Pop'n Music 18. We don't even know the subtitle.
10696260	10699260	It's not important.
10699260	10701260	But apparently they're going to be conducting that
10701260	10703260	starting, actually it was last week,
10703260	10707260	starting August 20th at AMPIA,
10707260	10710260	at Kungawa Prefecture,
10710260	10712260	and that's going to run from the 20th through the 30th,
10712260	10718260	and then at Rundown at the Fukuoka Prefecture.
10718260	10720260	Fukuoka.
10720260	10724260	Fukuoka Prefecture from the 21st through the 30th.
10724260	10726260	So you can check that out.
10726260	10729260	They have more information on the location test site,
10729260	10734260	that's konami.jp slash AMP slash location test slash Pop'n 18.
10734260	10736260	So check that out.
10736260	10739260	If you live in Japan.
10739260	10741260	And then, let's see here.
10741260	10744260	Modern Warfare 2. Of course, I have talked about in the past
10744260	10746260	about how Activision is trying to rip people off
10746260	10748260	with the price of Guitar Hero 5 on the Wii.
10748260	10750260	No one seems to give a shit.
10750260	10753260	But now that it's available on PC,
10753260	10758260	apparently they are trying to raise the price of the PC version as well.
10758260	10762260	Ubisoft Amazon Best Buy are now showing the PC version with a $60 price tag.
10762260	10766260	Now that might not be a big deal for people that normally buy console games,
10766260	10773260	but for PC owners, most games only retail at $50 retail.
10773260	10778260	But see, I told you they were evil, and no one believed me.
10778260	10783260	But now that it's a more important game, people might listen.
10783260	10789260	And then finally, Namco Bandai is releasing a new game
10789260	10792260	on the Playstation Portable in December.
10792260	10794260	I believe this is coming out in Japan.
10794260	10798260	It's called Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos.
10798260	10801260	And Queen's Blade apparently is a...
10801260	10805260	They call it a Lost World style combat picture book game.
10805260	10811260	And features characters with large...
10811260	10814260	Boobies.
10814260	10816260	Sweet.
10816260	10819260	To the point that it's absolutely ridiculous.
10819260	10823260	I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous.
10823260	10827260	That's how I try to make my character an ion with boobies that big.
10827260	10833260	So that should be coming out this fall on PSP in Japan.
10833260	10835260	Alright.
10835260	10838260	That's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
10838260	10841260	but first we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10841260	10843260	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
10843260	10845260	Boobies.
10845260	10848260	My final thought is ice cream, then boobies.
10848260	10853260	Loki, I get my arcade hardware tomorrow, but it's no good right now
10853260	10856260	because I don't have an arcade machine to play it on.
10856260	10860260	But I get to stare at it, and caress it, and...
10860260	10862260	And boobies?
10862260	10864260	Boobies.
10864260	10868260	Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our show tonight.
10868260	10870260	We really appreciate it, and...
10870260	10872260	Oh, TigerClaus reminded me.
10872260	10876260	I forgot to mention the Starcraft 2 thing I was going to mention about
10876260	10879260	the chick from Battlestar Galactica is voicing Kerrigan.
10879260	10880260	Trisha Helfer.
10880260	10882260	Six.
10882260	10884260	Hot.
10884260	10887260	Totally random, but just thought I'd mention it.
10887260	10891260	Because Jamie would, like, know probably.
10891260	10894260	I heard that the new, is it Caprica or whatever like that?
10894260	10897260	That Patton Oswalt's going to have a recurring character on there.
10897260	10899260	Ooh.
10899260	10901260	That means I actually have an excuse to watch it.
10901260	10903260	Alright.
10903260	10906260	And so enjoy your Battlestar Galactica, kids, until next week,
10906260	10908260	because we'll be back next week to do it all over again.
10908260	10912260	Hey, if you enjoyed the show, be sure to tell two friends about the show.
10912260	10915260	Leave us a nice review on iTunes, you know,
10915260	10917260	or just tell people about the show.
10917260	10920260	Word of mouth is what sells the show and helps us spread around,
10920260	10925260	because remember, we don't have a big magazine behind us or anything like that.
10925260	10927260	So that's going to do it.
10927260	10928260	We'll see you next week.
10928260	10932260	We'll be back to do it all over again on another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
