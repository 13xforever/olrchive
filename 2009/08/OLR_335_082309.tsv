14019	27320	Tonight, August 23, 2009, a new pay-as-you-go business model is announced for a popular 360 game, one gaming device will soon allow you to read comic books, and was a recently closed studio working on the next Final Fantasy game?
31874	36455	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36535	43116	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43156	51457	We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice because we let you call in, we let you chat with us at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
51858	52978	We let you tweet us too.
53418	59679	We try to keep up with the times and the new technologies and it all happens live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.
60359	63480	and our friends at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
63520	66501	A big shout out to them for letting us steal their bandwidth on Sunday nights.
66541	67081	We appreciate it.
67442	68322	My name is Rob Roberts.
68342	70102	I'll be with you here over the next three hours.
70223	73944	With me as always, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
74084	74524	Crunchy.
74864	75184	How are you?
75424	75825	Crunchy.
76145	79766	Tell the listeners about what you are eating right now because I find it very interesting.
80831	83233	I really wanted cereal, but I really wanted peanut butter.
84395	87719	And then I was like, I've got some really tasty bread from Trader Joe's.
88219	97009	So what I did is I took my sprouted wheat bread from Trader Joe's and put a bunch of creamy Jif and have put... Why not Skippy?
97210	98831	Annette Funicello is crying somewhere.
99893	99953	Um...
101271	102592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
124324	126325	Orange Lounge Foodio, live, Sunday nights.
127366	128426	I swear we ought to have a spin-off.
128446	130628	This is full of fiber and protein, okay?
131008	133469	And it's low-glycemic, so the world can bite me.
133729	136771	I swear we ought to have a spin-off show about, like, food or something.
136831	140233	I don't, it just seems like a natural progression for a show.
140593	140853	All right.
141253	142734	Well, say hello, as always.
142974	145876	I don't want to ignore him any longer, because he's an important part of our show.
145916	147237	What the hell would we do without him?
147277	148397	Tech Master Loki!
148637	149598	Yeah, those are all lies.
151059	151679	Yeah, mostly.
151759	152199	No, I'm kidding.
152239	153080	How are you, Loki?
153425	154166	I'm fine.
154226	155187	I feel somber, though.
155647	155867	Yeah?
156267	159110	I was working out front planting plants.
159390	162693	How is it being a homeowner now, a couple months in, having to do all this housework?
162773	163293	Tiring.
163814	173782	Actually, it's funny, though, because there was this plant that was growing out front next to our neighbor's fence, and we weren't really sure if it was our neighbor's plant or ours, but technically it's on our side of the property, so it's ours.
175084	179053	But apparently you can pull it apart the way that it kind of grows.
179274	180256	You can actually pull it apart.
180296	184345	So we took this one giant plant and made like 16 smaller plants out of it.
185023	188464	and they're all going to grow and expand bigger and take over the entire yard.
188824	190865	It's like Animal Crossing for real.
191405	192065	Something like that.
192085	192425	I don't know.
193245	194926	So yeah, that's what I did there.
194986	196766	I'm surprised you, Loki, with your handiwork.
196786	205829	You don't get one of those things I've seen on late night television which is those rolls of flowers that you see that you can get at Home Depot where you just unravel.
206089	207149	It's like a carpet or something.
207169	213871	You throw it down and it's all seeds so you water it and then you just get the hometown buffet of flowers in your front yard.
213971	215932	Yeah, you can do that with just seeds.
216032	222054	I mean, you don't need to spend money on... And I don't know if you've ever tried rolling anything down.
223215	224675	I can't roll it straight.
224816	225776	It would just be awful.
225836	229217	Like, last night we got... We were actually doing stuff to the house.
229237	235500	We bought a rug last night, which Kat decided to start tearing up because it's the only carpet in the house and now she can scratch it.
236201	242168	And then we bought curtains for the front room to shield the outside world from our porn watching.
242768	244250	That, and it's really sunny.
245471	247814	So, we put those up and everything.
249837	250537	But yeah, I mean...
251579	252440	We don't need all the flowers up there.
252460	254581	When are you inviting me over to see all these changes at the house?
254841	256362	Once we're done, I don't know.
256382	257142	I'm just giving you a hard time.
257162	258003	Come over anytime you want.
258023	263706	It'd be better, though, once I get the cabinet in and stuff, but... You need a housewarming party.
264107	264587	I know.
264667	265287	That's what you need to do.
265307	266308	It's just, it's never clean.
266588	267269	No, I understand.
267309	272192	You've had a lot of busy stuff going on lately, but at some point, you should have a housewarming party.
272352	276514	It's almost like... I don't know when the statute of limitations on that stuff is, because...
278295	280576	We moved in, what, two months ago?
281376	287457	I don't know when you've gone beyond the point of homewarming parties.
287497	289778	I think there's a point where it's like, okay, you forego.
290238	293539	You mean you would give up housewarming presents and not have a housewarming party?
293619	297259	Hey, I would not be foregoing housewarming presents.
297339	299820	It's just, I don't know.
301024	301824	Thanks for watching!
319557	321299	All right, well, let's introduce our chat room as well.
321479	323641	As always, where would we be without the listeners?
323741	327104	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Let's give the chat room a name tonight.
327224	327965	Let's call it Rufus.
329106	331628	Why are we calling the chat room... Chat room, your name is Rufus.
331649	332309	Barnaby.
332569	335672	Why are we calling the chat room Rufus or Barnaby or Barnabas?
335712	336113	I don't know.
336313	341238	Which, by the way, I am all about this Tim Burton Dark Shadows movie with Johnny Depp as Barnabas.
341278	341758	I know, right?
341838	343580	Hello, can I get here any faster?
343820	344300	Penelope Penelope
365878	368219	And then people are going to tune in at 8 o'clock.
368259	371940	People that tune in late who weren't here when the show started on time, they're going to be like, who the fuck's Penelope?
372040	373580	That's why they should have been here, huh?
375140	376881	It's just going to get strange.
377081	380222	I have a feeling we're just going to go.
380322	380682	That's right.
380722	381602	I need to take more Vicodin.
381622	381942	Excuse me.
381962	382142	All right.
382162	385263	Let's go to Penelope and read some of the comments that we have tonight.
385523	388944	Alpha Cananogram says about Loki's house, Sky just wants to watch the porn.
390347	393131	on the big screen TV, possibly.
394053	395835	It's not that impressive, really.
395895	398199	I mean, I don't know.
399192	400553	There are weird things, though.
400873	406375	The last time we had Jim and Annie and Christopher over, we actually watched the parody to Friends.
406435	414438	When you watch those parody porns, there's nothing sexy about that at all.
416239	420640	They're trying to make the characters look like the characters in the show, and they do a horrible job at it.
421581	421761	And...
422870	423250	I don't know.
423510	425552	It's just, it's more weird.
425612	430095	It's like watching a very slow-mo car wreck or something.
431555	436439	Have you thought about just watching just a straight-up porn that doesn't try to be any type of funny thing?
437059	438400	Good luck finding one, okay?
438480	440321	I mean, they're all kind of funny and weird.
442254	443195	I like old people.
443595	445097	One of my favorite chatroom nicknames, by the way.
445877	449520	In Penelope right now wants to know... Ew, I just said that that person's in Penelope.
450101	453884	Wants to know, are there naked pics of Penelope?
454744	456386	Well, look, you're... Never mind.
456406	460989	I don't want to... I like that Alpha Cananogram referred to Penelope Pitstop because that's old school, yo.
461790	462390	I didn't get that.
462450	462891	What is that?
464606	465867	It was from an old cartoon.
466147	466487	Is it?
466888	467568	Yeah.
467648	467948	Okay.
468128	468929	I got to school people.
469109	471050	If it wasn't on Nickelodeon, I probably never saw it.
471070	472890	Would that be from Wacky Races?
473151	473591	I don't know.
473611	474511	I think it was Wacky Races.
474531	475892	That sounds like a character from Wacky Races.
475992	479113	Any moment, somebody's going to yell it out in chat anyway, so we'll get there.
480054	483155	Amaze Satsuma asks, We went from Rufus to a girl's name.
483175	484236	Did Chad have a sex change?
484556	485356	Apparently, DarkSakura thinks so.
485376	486557	It was indeed Wacky Races.
487219	487519	All right.
487919	490860	And that was just a guess because I wouldn't remember such a horrible cartoon.
490880	491701	You watch a lot of cartoons.
491901	494201	No, I don't watch horrible cartoons like that.
494221	495202	But, I mean, come on.
495502	496822	Penelope Pitstop.
497022	498623	It sounds like a racing character.
498663	500604	Her car was called the Compact Pussycat.
501664	502744	It's a compact pussy.
502884	503284	Okay.
503364	503725	There we go.
503765	507806	We have three people all just piping up, starting with X-Link, who beat everybody else to it.
507846	508546	Wacky Racers.
509326	510027	Or Wacky Races.
511920	513782	Which goes back to video games!
513962	516744	We have this odd delay, too.
516784	529594	We are live, and it's not like we're on a delay because people are afraid we're going to say fuck or something, but just the nature of the encoding and the fact that it takes a minute to go to all-game server, then you download it because you're buffering everything.
529634	531556	There's just, by nature, this 20-second delay.
531936	533577	So sometimes the last question is in the chat.
533597	535359	We don't see the answers for 20 seconds, so...
535879	537299	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
560104	569930	Um, I was actually playing some Blue Dragon and some Ragnarok Online, which I got back into, and stuff on Gaia, but, uh... Addict.
572892	574013	I'm not playing anything now.
574113	574653	I have to.
575253	576394	When you're playing MMOs.
576834	579316	Somebody on this show has to keep the Addict tradition going.
579336	584879	I had to stop because I had the rest of that suture removed from my hand on Friday.
585419	586820	Ha ha, you can't bitch slap me.
587941	589402	I got a left hand, Robb.
590492	591633	And I got two feet.
592613	596935	And you are not protected.
598276	602858	I'm actually reading up on Janet Waldo who did Penelope Pitstop's voice.
602898	603759	She was Judy Jetson.
604859	605460	Fascinating.
606580	608001	Loki, how was your gaming week?
608061	610802	I'm assuming she's done if she's talking about the Jetsons.
611202	613824	Apparently not as exciting as Wacky Races.
615124	617145	I actually tried to play a few different things this week.
617466	617486	I...
619148	634149	I went and actually played some indie games and of course people were recommending that I play I made a game with zombies in it and yeah, it was funny and it was actually pretty fun so I enjoyed that also
635325	648813	For whatever reason, because now that they have the rankings in there, where people can actually rate different games and stuff, you can actually see what the top-rated indie games and stuff are.
649134	653616	So I decided to play the top-rated indie game, which is Minor Dig Deep.
654417	658279	And I don't know why, but I'm addicted to that game.
658680	658780	It's...
660057	660897	Almost pointless.
661278	671142	The game, you basically, you're a miner, and you go into a hole, and you actually dig into the walls, almost like Dig Dug, but there's no, like, you know, dinosaurs right now.
671162	673844	Just to point out, though, not the kind of 17-year-old miner, right?
673864	675384	You're talking about a pickaxe.
675404	678466	Yes, like a pickaxe, you know, miner.
678486	679867	I don't know, maybe under 17.
679907	682308	Miner 2049er, if you're old school like me.
683237	685499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
701155	702436	And you do this forever.
702616	707458	This seriously sounds like a game I used to play like 15 years ago on old school PC.
707998	709639	The 256 color shareware.
709679	710279	Yeah, pretty much.
710519	713980	And you do this forever, and I don't know why, but I can't stop playing this game.
714121	717382	I actually, you know... I don't know.
717522	721884	I could have been playing like Earth Defense Force, which I did play a little bit of this week, but...
723345	725207	I kept going back to play this game, and I don't know why.
725227	729110	So it sounds like it's crowned as the top-rated game right now, as rightfully deserved.
729130	730351	Yeah, it's fun.
730451	734714	It's just, I don't really know what the point is, but I don't really care.
735075	738077	As your Ed's in chat wants to know what game you're talking about one more time.
738257	739058	Minor Dig Deep.
739458	740359	And it's an indie game.
740379	742781	It's a top-rated indie game, at least when you downloaded it.
742801	745483	Who knows, because those lists can change on a daily basis, right?
745703	746644	Thanks for watching!
761617	770026	You know, because I think there was some concern that just like people spam Dig, some of these indie developers might try to spam Xbox to try and get their titles to the top.
770346	772008	Does it seem like it's working?
772148	776352	If they are, it's hard to notice because there's so many people voting on stuff that...
778647	780028	Really, I don't see how that can be.
780368	784371	And actually, it's not a matter of like you can place a vote for a title.
784391	790434	I mean, you can vote like a five, but like say later on something really pissed you off about it, you can change it to a zero or one or whatever.
790634	791715	You can change it whenever you want.
791815	796578	So it's basically just, you know, tallies whatever people are thinking of it at that time.
797378	802202	When I went in there, because unfortunately, if you listened to last week's show, you know I'm Xbox-less right now.
802562	813529	But when I was playing with that new patch last week, one of the first things I did is I went in there and I rated Snake 360 to support our buddy who was on the show a couple months ago when that game first rolled out.
813549	816371	And I went and I was like, oh, I'm going to rate this a 5 and see kind of how it takes place.
816711	819773	But it didn't seem like my vote, because you can see the number of people that have voted.
820033	820934	It didn't seem like my vote
821334	822556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
835983	840847	I did find it very interesting that the game rating worked very similar to the Netflix rating.
841187	851876	How since you don't really have a mouse and pointer to click how many stars, you have to kind of cycle through all the way to five or back to one to rate it by hitting the A button so many times.
852296	853816	And I don't know, it's pretty cool.
853856	859758	I played Earth Defense Force earlier this week as well, and that's rated a solid 4 now.
859898	862238	Which it rightly deserves, because it's awesome.
862799	869160	It just broke 80 hours this week in the game, and I don't know why, because it's just really hard and frustrating.
869220	871061	But I'm actually...
872521	898435	working my way through it some more i finally got uh one of the higher up weapons and i'm missing i'm still missing some of the other weapons though but in order to farm them the one level you have to play it only drops like one or two weapons a level and you know since it's random at what you know weapons it picks to me it could be one of the any 200 weapons that are in that game and i'm missing like two i mean you can see how it could take forever to get what you need but um
900029	903633	And I'm about 80% done with the game.
904274	906137	I'm getting almost to the point where...
907834	911576	I need to really get some good people to help out with it.
911716	915078	But I have a friend who's actually playing that at work as well.
915678	919800	And so he's been helping me on breaks and stuff like that when we're not playing Grand Theft Auto.
920760	924882	Then, of course, I played Grand Theft Auto this week and didn't really change anything.
925102	928344	Although I went over to my sister's house because she has a modded 360 as well.
928364	930405	I got her that for her birthday.
930905	933606	And so I've been giving her every now and then copies of...
935627	938928	Did you really give the gift of piracy for someone's birthday?
940169	940829	She's poor.
940849	944330	Before that, she had a modded PS2 with games dumped to the hard drive.
944370	948612	So yes, I've been giving the gift of piracy to her because she can't afford actual games.
948972	949752	She does rent, though.
949872	952593	She rents legitimate games.
952913	957635	I shouldn't be supporting such blatant piracy, but it's out there, I guess.
959393	962297	To be fair, she does have a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto 4.
962557	964340	So she does have it, legitimately.
964680	971290	So the fact that I'm burning off a new copy of it that happens to be modified, it's still kind of in that gray area.
971370	974615	But it's not like she doesn't own a legit copy of it.
975140	978362	Okay, fair enough.
978822	983304	I was showing her because she didn't actually try any of the weapons that I modified or anything because she doesn't have the phone yet.
983885	987227	She's been too busy trying to punch people with the super punch.
988907	1001994	Although, for whatever reason, the nuke shotgun that I built in there, because normally I play Lost and Damned, and so some things don't work quite right how they're supposed to, but since she only has Grand Theft Auto 4...
1003348	1006329	That nuke shotgun works like a nuke.
1006369	1009891	No matter where I shot it, somehow the shockwave hit me and killed me every time.
1010031	1011591	You really do need to YouTube some of this stuff.
1011631	1014032	I have two hours of footage.
1014413	1016333	I have to go through it.
1016653	1018234	It's going to be awesome.
1018334	1019034	Looking forward to seeing it.
1019335	1022016	One more question I want to ask you.
1022216	1026237	As I mentioned before, my Xbox 360 is broke right now so I can't really look at this myself.
1026658	1028038	I don't know if you've bothered to check it out.
1028338	1029119	Maybe a chatter knows.
1029439	1032140	What is the top rated Xbox 360 game right now?
1033345	1033745	I don't know.
1034505	1037287	I wonder if that's something you can look up on Xbox.com.
1037307	1038907	Can you see ratings on Xbox.com now?
1039968	1042349	I'm sure maybe a chatter will look that up for us.
1042469	1045770	If I try to go on Xbox.com while we're recording the show, it won't like that.
1045970	1048371	It uses up a lot of memory.
1048391	1050832	I'm kind of curious.
1050872	1052193	If it's like Mass Effect.
1052453	1055894	I'm trying to think of the games that were high rated when I took a peek.
1055914	1057255	Everything was so new at that point.
1057575	1059075	I know Grand Theft Auto is pretty high up there.
1059095	1059335	It's like a 4.5.
1062284	1062584	I don't know.
1063304	1070886	I don't think there's anything that's a solid five, so it's going to be really hard to distinguish since, you know, it's sections of a star being shaded there.
1070906	1072767	It's like, is that a half, third?
1072987	1073467	I don't know.
1074967	1080168	Halo 3 says, sex with the elderly is their chat nickname.
1081529	1082609	Is that the game tonight?
1082649	1085850	Everybody's going to name themselves something really foul that I have to read?
1086570	1086930	Whatever.
1087524	1088045	Thank you for watching!
1099656	1100656	I wonder if that's just a lie.
1100696	1105198	I wonder if they just shouted out an Xbox 360 game because they knew I'd read it and just believe them.
1105798	1107119	Because I'm a sucker.
1107679	1108420	My gaming week.
1108520	1111361	Obviously I've been QQing about my broken Xbox 360.
1113922	1118283	I'm calmed down a lot this week than I was last week because it was still fresh in my mind last week.
1118824	1120104	I'm a little more mellow this week.
1120164	1122885	I think I have my plan of action for what I plan to do about it.
1123486	1124826	I will not be buying a new Elite.
1125006	1125686	I'll tell you that much.
1125746	1126947	That is one thing I did decide.
1127267	1129108	Maybe I'll talk a little more about this later on because...
1130289	1130929	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1154432	1155833	I didn't play the new expansion.
1155853	1157834	I was just playing old school Wipeout HD.
1157974	1160916	I guess, well, how old school is Wipeout HD?
1160936	1161516	But you know what I mean.
1161837	1162917	The original version of it.
1164478	1166399	Because, damn, I love me some F-Zero.
1166639	1171162	And Wipeout HD really is kind of the closest thing we have to that on another console.
1171622	1176645	And I really like that mode that's called, I think, Zone Mode when you're racing.
1176966	1179667	It makes the track all this solid color...
1181409	1181930	as you're racing.
1181950	1184533	It has this very techno look to it, obviously, as Wipeout HD does.
1184773	1189059	And then as you race, the track changes colors as you accumulate so many points.
1190541	1191182	Yeah, pretty cool.
1192264	1193666	I'm having fun with Wipeout HD.
1194266	1196870	I haven't really played a lot of it online, but it has been...
1197811	1201912	Satiating my thirst for gameplay this week with a lack of an Xbox 360.
1202392	1204693	Obviously the PlayStation 3 is a perfectly fine gaming system.
1205773	1209654	And there's some certain things on it I can't play on 360 that I'm kind of catching up on right now.
1210034	1211235	So Wipeout HD is one of them.
1211355	1213716	I'm still looking for a cheap copy of Valkyria Chronicles.
1214036	1220698	But from what I understand, because I remember we reported on the show a while back that Valkyria Chronicles dipped to 1999.
1220978	1221818	Apparently it went back up.
1222478	1245811	because it has been I don't know if the price dip made it more successful or it's a cult thing now or what the deal is but I know that's on my hit list of games I want to play until I get my 360 situation resolved and then of course whenever Final Fantasy 13 comes out I will be buying that on PS3 and I was watching Blu-rays too I finally caught up on a few of those I think you should hang out with me and play Dreamcast Dreamcast?
1246071	1248372	On September 9th I will It'll be fun
1249778	1254722	I forgot to mention that I also have a System 573 board coming my way tomorrow.
1254982	1257644	Now for those that don't know what a System 573 board is, what is that?
1257744	1258745	It's Bomani hardware.
1258905	1265130	It's actually, well this one in particular is a Dance Maniacs second mix J-Append.
1266031	1274678	And so literally if I were to hook it up to a monitor and build controls and stuff like that, I could play Dance Maniacs as an actual arcade game.
1276005	1279068	And you can convert the machine into a DDR machine if I really wanted to.
1279468	1281170	But it costs like an extra $100 to do that.
1281951	1287095	But I have the actual cartridges and security stuff to do it if I wanted to.
1288557	1289298	I don't know if I will though.
1289638	1290599	Because I can just run StepMe.
1292519	1317431	I'm reading some comments from Penelope at chat.orangeloungeradio.com TigerClaw says, Zone was a mode first introduced in Wipeout Pure on the PSP I did not know that, I missed the PSP version SG100Matt says, the top indie rated game is I Made a Game with Zombies with 4.5 stars and 5,081 votes Yeah, it's been getting, well that was like number 3 It's been getting bigger because, you know, everyone loves it Everyone loves Zombies It's a dollar
1318571	1319472	It's a good dollar spent.
1320412	1321532	Definitely recommend you try it.
1323153	1328095	People are calling it this year's Still Alive, basically.
1328115	1334797	It has a really weird, catchy song about the game that's horribly sung, but it just talks about the game.
1335360	1341302	Does it seem like this whole rebranding of the... I don't even remember what it was called before.
1341402	1343643	To indie games.
1343683	1344543	What the hell was it called?
1344563	1345103	Community games.
1345123	1345483	Thank you.
1345784	1349085	Do you think the rebranding of community games to indie games has been successful?
1349105	1352426	Because it sure sounds like more people are following what's going on now.
1352446	1358328	I think, though, what's making it better is that they've dropped the minimum price.
1358388	1361149	Because before, the minimum price used to be 200 Microsoft points, which is $250 now.
1362549	1364511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1380768	1383811	But yeah, I mean, it's a lot easier just to buy stuff for 80 points.
1383891	1386093	I mean, it goes really fast.
1386173	1388375	It is unfortunate that the games don't have achievements.
1388475	1389235	I mean, don't get me wrong.
1389315	1393879	I understand why, because obviously someone would make that game, you know, press A, get 200 gamerscore.
1394260	1403187	But even if they would do achievements with a zero gamerscore, or just, you know, because there are plenty of achievements out there in the retail games that are just zero gamerscore.
1403267	1404769	It's just unlocking it.
1405369	1407291	Or maybe like a separate...
1408379	1414481	I don't know what the hell they want to call it, but something maybe separate.
1414501	1417101	That would be kind of cool, because no one would let me compete against friends.
1417301	1420122	Because on those games, you can't really do the leaderboards and stuff.
1420182	1425024	It would never do points, because someone could just go, okay, you started the game, 1,000 points.
1425184	1425644	Right, right.
1426004	1426524	I get that.
1426584	1427144	Don't get me wrong.
1427184	1431985	But just something that kind of encourages a little bit of competition.
1432125	1433046	I don't know.
1433366	1434326	I'm just kind of brainstorming here.
1434346	1435486	Ways they could make it even bigger.
1435506	1437427	I think they will later, but just not right now.
1437947	1439268	All right.
1440890	1441150	Let's see.
1441230	1444613	As far as other games I've been playing this week, not really a whole lot.
1444633	1446395	I was playing Guild Wars for a little bit.
1446535	1452681	Not a lot, but it's one of those MMOs I have that I'm not really paying for because I already bought the game.
1453222	1459047	And Guild Wars' model is that once you buy the game, you can play online for free pretty much forever.
1459367	1461770	So it's kind of cool that you can just go back and revisit whenever you want.
1462570	1462851	I did.
1462911	1466615	Speaking of Guild Wars, and I don't think it's in tonight's show role, I also watched that trailer for Guild Wars 2.
1467456	1469038	Looks pretty sweet, I gotta say.
1469519	1471221	So definitely keeping an eye on Guild Wars.
1471874	1474875	All right, let's get into some more gaming news tonight.
1475416	1482038	After some housekeeping, we do, of course, always want to plug some of the ways you can follow us and join the community that we sometimes call the OL Army.

1493403	1494324	Get involved with the community.
1494364	1497985	We try to read your comments and so forth on every show all the time.
1500157	1507441	Also, some other comments from chat.
1507701	1511223	INGN0 asks, No Wolfenstein?
1511704	1512544	No, not this week.
1514225	1517707	It's not really the type of game that I've been eagerly anticipating.
1518447	1521209	I played the old Wolfenstein 3D and that was about it for me.
1521309	1521609	I don't know.
1521649	1522229	Wolfenstein?
1522269	1522990	Any interest, Loki?
1524571	1524711	Nope.
1525700	1526140	I don't know.
1526180	1526961	I'll think about it.
1527021	1527181	But I...
1550862	1568109	I haven't finished, you know, uh, Bionic Commando, um, and a half a dozen, more than half a dozen, a few dozen games that I've bought already, so, you know, I'm just kind of taking a break from buying full price, you know, Xbox Live Arcade games.
1568809	1579473	Now, don't get me wrong, if they ever came out with a Bionic Commando sequel that would be on Xbox Live Arcade done the same fashion as, say, you know, Rearmed, then yes, I would probably buy that in a heartbeat, but...
1579753	1580353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1602807	1603167	DarkSakura.com
1626129	1628151	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
1628251	1631053	Shadow Complex, or whatever the game is that we're talking about.
1631153	1632274	Please, don't hear me wrong.
1632294	1633615	I'm not bashing Shadow Complex.
1633855	1638799	Again, if my Xbox 360 hadn't have fried last week, I would have gladly checked it out this week.
1638859	1641001	But, you know, shit happens.
1641381	1644543	Alright, so Loki, get us started with some gaming news tonight.
1644603	1650948	Alright, so Microsoft had a little bit of a keynote during Gamescom this week.
1651910	1653616	However, they didn't really discuss a whole lot.
1653656	1655482	Really, the only thing they discussed was...
1657560	1684012	So, of course, I'm totally shocked that they announced a new Fable game, but Fable 3 will be coming out next year, and they didn't really go into great detail what exactly you're going to be doing, but apparently you will be, I guess, assuming that they're going to be playing as the son or daughter of your Fable 2 hero, and you're going to be starting a revolution to become the new ruler of Albion, and of course, based on, you know,
1685307	1691957	What you do as a ruler can have obviously positive or negative effects on the world around you.
1693299	1694420	Just like Fable 2.
1694801	1698947	And I'm sorry, but if it's just like Fable 2, then it's going to be all hype.
1699759	1700440	No content.
1700560	1704223	Well, not no content, but not as much content as promised.
1704383	1711470	I kind of liked Fable 2, but... It was alright, but it just wasn't like, oh my god, the best game ever, as he was pitching it.
1711490	1718396	Peter Molyneux kind of has a reputation for really, really hyping things beyond what they really end up being.
1718416	1719857	Hence, you know, why...
1720578	1724321	We all approach this project Milo with a hint of skepticism, at least I do.
1724841	1728083	But I did like Fable 2 quite a bit, actually.
1728143	1730905	It's one of my favorite Xbox 360 games of last year.
1731866	1732927	But here's my question about Fable 3.
1733567	1740352	If you're going to be playing the child of a character in Fable 2, does that mean all these decisions you made in Fable 2 ultimately are going to impact in Fable 3?
1740392	1743694	That didn't really happen in Fable 2 with Fable 1.
1744075	1745435	Yeah, I'm not really sure if that's the case.
1746156	1746836	They're just saying that...
1747877	1759401	The storylines, basically, that your hero is going to be... It's their children, since the game starts off in Fable 2, where you pick a sex, and that's basically it.
1760442	1765264	But I guess they said the game's going to take place 50 years after the first one, and...
1767051	1767811	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1788898	1816572	um which will be used to influence the world basically a judgment system was people will come to you and say okay this uh this poor child you know stole bread from this person do you want to let them go or kill them you know and you can just you know obviously pick the right or wrong whatever you you know feel is right or wrong but you can't come up with creative punishments you can't say you know make them bake bread for the entire town or anything like that yeah it's like you can um you know
1816912	1823341	Judge her immediately, like the person that stole food, or you can investigate the situation.
1823882	1825925	Or you can set her on fire.
1828648	1829510	I vote for fire.
1830999	1832120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1858497	1861899	Some of the AI wasn't that... I don't know.
1862039	1864800	That means if you're evil, you could grab them and throw them into the burning building.
1865301	1868562	But it's saying you can also shake someone's hand or refuse to.
1869263	1872044	You can also embrace somebody, snog them.
1874325	1874666	I don't know.
1875246	1875786	Baby shake?
1875986	1877827	I hope you can throw them off cliffs.
1880289	1884831	Or even better, jump off a cliff while holding on to them and then drag them with you.
1886539	1887619	Throw your dog at them.
1887940	1888740	That would be kind of funny.
1891041	1892121	So, yeah.
1892501	1893442	That's basically the game.
1893502	1899784	It's, you know, becoming the king and... It will be the best game ever, I'm sure.
1899924	1902745	And somehow they'll probably work in Milo in there or some crap.
1902905	1903225	I don't know.
1903245	1904826	Fable 3, My Life as a King.
1907187	1911228	But yeah, that is, you know, basically Fable 3.
1911628	1912269	So, it's...
1914286	1915427	I don't know, it's neat.
1915707	1922910	Now, the other thing that they talked about, because goddamn if Fable 3 wasn't enough, they talked about Fable 2 Episodic.
1923430	1926272	And people were thinking, oh my god, there's more content coming.
1927192	1927572	Wrong.
1927953	1932975	Actually, Fable 2 Episodic is a pay-to-play version of Fable 2.
1933355	1936437	And basically, Fable 2 had different chapter points, I guess, in it.
1937692	1959890	and so the first chapter is free and then of course once you're done with that you can choose to buy the next chapter or buy the rest of the game and I guess there's five episodes in total and it's supposed to be released on September 29th and they didn't say how expensive the game will be I'm guessing around the same price as Fable 2
1961556	1961816	It's a test.
1961856	1962076	It's a test.
1978553	1981815	I'm actually a little more welcoming of this idea than you might think.
1995430	2022019	I think it's a good idea because Fable 2 didn't have a demo and this would be a good way to check out a game say for example it's more of an extended demo because you get to play through the first part of the game for free and then if you like it then you can go ahead and purchase it later or if you're just on the fence about it you can buy the next chapter and see if you still like it or something like that so it's not just dumping all the money
2023445	2030087	But they are getting more money, though, out of you by charging in an episodic manner as opposed to buying the whole game.
2030687	2034048	Well, granted, we don't know how many points each part is going to cost yet.
2034168	2043290	I would assume so because, I mean, that's typically when you buy, for example, an individual size of something or when you buy the six pack, you know.
2043820	2044720	That's a fair comparison.
2044920	2046381	I was kind of thinking of it as a pizza.
2046661	2049382	When you buy Fable 2, you get the pizza, but now you can get a slice of pizza.
2050142	2050882	Pizza sounds good.
2050983	2052143	Pizza does sound very good, actually.
2052483	2053083	Let's get pizza.
2053703	2054684	We might have to during break.
2055024	2056685	Wait a minute, you didn't bring food tonight, Loki.
2056845	2058105	I went sushi.
2059045	2065308	I had a TNT roll, which is... And it all comes back to food.
2066248	2067108	Not my fault.
2067288	2069689	So it was like... Maguro...
2072290	2080013	I want to say there's Spicy Yahi and Yellowfin and some other stuff in there.
2080233	2081533	But it was good and hot.
2082674	2083294	And Spicy Mayonnaise.
2083614	2086615	Comments from chat, because of course this seems to be lighting up our chat room a little bit.
2086635	2088556	I think Bobby's on the same page we are.
2088636	2094017	Blackwolf in chat says, I like the episodic model because that way if I don't continue the game, I'm not paying for the whole game.
2094357	2096058	I'm only paying for the part of the game that I finished.
2096578	2100980	Unfolded Raptor follows up with, but that's like watching 15 minutes of a movie then paying for another 15 minutes.
2101980	2107907	BlackWolf says, well, you know, if I want to walk out of the movie after the first 15 minutes, I didn't pay for the entire two-hour movie.
2108187	2116978	You know what's interesting is that you do see actually a lot of movie companies putting out like the first eight minutes of a movie on the internet for you to watch.
2117495	2120737	Amazon does that with TV episodes that you can download.
2120857	2121258	And books!
2121778	2123199	Yeah, we'll give you samples of the books.
2123339	2135088	I mean, it's a good idea, but I'm thinking that they should offer an incentive that if you decide after the first episode that you want to buy the whole game, that they give you an option to pay the difference.
2136469	2137229	Well, that's the thing.
2137830	2139371	They're going to do that, I think.
2139431	2140451	They're just basically...
2141485	2142607	The first episode is free.
2142868	2152065	So after the first episode, after each chapter, you have the option to purchase the rest of the game or just purchase the next chapter.
2154243	2155624	This really could be.
2155704	2159927	We could be looking at the future of how we're going to pay for a lot of our games.
2161088	2162489	Especially if this is successful.
2162889	2165371	I don't know how successful it will be because it's not a new game.
2165891	2168433	I think a lot of people that were interested in this game already got it.
2168733	2175478	But it's certainly by tempting folks with a free chapter, a way to entice folks to check it out maybe and get a few more extra sales.
2175738	2178500	I can't see how that's going to be bad news for Microsoft or Lionhead.
2178560	2180441	It's the pot of the video game world.
2180661	2180782	But...
2181762	2182683	Just one hit, man.
2183063	2185446	But the interesting thing is, I mean, think about it.
2185866	2198578	PSP Go, despite the crap we've given it on this show for not being that much better than the PSP, and especially price-wise, is going to be completely free of media.
2199018	2200920	It's going to be digital downloads only.
2202188	2208270	Nintendo DS, or the DSi I should say specifically is a large part is going to be digital download only.
2208690	2216672	Some of the biggest components and biggest games you see now on 360, PlayStation Network, Nintendo WiiWare are all download games.
2217712	2230215	I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the major players Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft in the next console and I think if anybody it's going to be Sony says
2231610	2237740	No media, no discs, no Blu-ray, or this will play Blu-rays, but the games do not come out on Blu-rays.
2238140	2240865	It will be 100% digital distribution.
2241105	2241666	And it will fail.
2242427	2242828	You think?
2243048	2243589	It will fail.
2243930	2245051	What if it's like this, though?
2245672	2246493	It will still fail.
2246933	2248033	And you know why it's going to fail?
2248053	2250655	It's because people like owning stuff, and people like the option.
2250995	2254797	I don't have a problem with adding other ways you can purchase content.
2255137	2270446	If you decide that, you know what, I don't feel like buying the game, I can buy either the episode, I can buy the full digital download, which is available on their service as well, or I can go purchase the retail game out there and do that.
2272608	2275889	If I'm not given that option, then that's kind of crappy.
2275929	2281150	And then what happens later on with, say, your console dies.
2282770	2290072	I know a lot of times with the PlayStation 3 and stuff, I'm sure you can go re-download all that stuff later because it's just tied to your account.
2290212	2293413	But still, though, it's not...
2294215	2295536	You can't loan out your games.
2295796	2297056	You can't sell used.
2297557	2300578	I mean, it's really... There's a lot more factors in there.
2300738	2303659	And people like the collector crap.
2303699	2307581	I mean, hello, Modern Warfare 2 with some fucking night vision goggles.
2307861	2310122	Can't digitally download night vision goggles.
2310803	2311543	Look at my vault.
2312515	2317778	Maybe I'm apples to oranges here a little bit, but then tell me why iTunes and iPods are so successful.
2318058	2323160	Because people that purchase Apple products are suckers for that kind of crap.
2323180	2326262	But you cannot deny iTunes is successful.
2326462	2330364	But seriously, what phone out there, okay, what phone...
2331184	2333246	has cartridges or disks that plug into it.
2333686	2334747	No phone does.
2334847	2338589	So that kind of content is expected on there.
2338990	2340971	And that's why it's not a big deal.
2341151	2351699	Now, if Apple were to come out with, say, a console and decides that, okay, it's only going to be through their app store, then people might not be so apt to it.
2351759	2357303	They may go, eh, you know what, I'm just going to stick with a console that I can actually purchase physical stuff for.
2357843	2358543	Very interesting.
2358683	2362164	A lot of negativity in the chat room on this idea.
2362184	2362725	Penelope.
2363385	2363685	Sorry.
2363725	2371027	In Penelope, there's a lot of – and not necessarily the Fable 2 thing I'm talking about, the what if the next generation of gaming was all digital.
2371687	2371988	Let's see.
2372048	2375269	We have – Actdeft says it will fail.
2376829	2378670	Codeman says, I hate downloading games.
2378731	2380332	My internet connection is so slow.
2380732	2383434	Frisbee says, I like having a disc to hold or cart.
2384215	2391680	And I like this comment from Sex with the Elderly says, I can't wait till people start stealing PSPs and all their content with it.
2391961	2393922	Then having no media will suck ass.
2396124	2397025	And I'm sorry.
2400988	2401328	I don't know.
2401348	2402409	We'll get into this later.
2402429	2405591	Why the PSP goes sucks because we have to bring it up on every show.
2405651	2406592	But, um,
2408152	2409013	They're really dumb.
2409693	2410214	I'm sorry.
2426258	2432183	To be fair, I'm only picking on Sony because if the PSP Go is any indication, this is what they're thinking.
2432343	2434945	Well, I don't think it's a good idea anyways with Microsoft either.
2435065	2438828	I probably wouldn't buy a console from Microsoft if it didn't have physical media.
2439209	2446695	And I think that they're going to be more apt to having physical media because there's a lot more exposure out there, whereas it's just their service.
2447015	2448857	What if someone doesn't have broadband or internet?
2449417	2450318	Thanks for watching!
2474972	2478194	Well, you're going to still lose some sales, and that's not a smart thing.
2478854	2484857	Now, what you should do is open up as many different avenues for people to purchase content.
2485277	2489199	Like this, with Fable 2, I think is a good idea because now you have three different options.
2489239	2493181	You can purchase the full game, you can purchase it by episode, or you can purchase the retail copy.
2493482	2495723	Or, hell, you can purchase the used retail copy out there.
2496163	2500105	So, there's a lot of options for you, and options are never a bad thing.
2501781	2502221	Game Informer
2519626	2534477	ran a report, and in the latest issue of Game Informer, they actually did a survey where they surveyed 5,000 console owners, and according to these 5,000 console owners, the Xbox 360's current failure rate because of the E74 error, 54.2%.
2536859	2542723	Now, to be fair, they also surveyed for the PlayStation 3's and their yellow light issues, 10.3% on those, and the Wii's, 6.8%.
2548337	2549879	and DarkSakura.com
2563331	2580142	I can admit that I think those that go so far as to subscribe to a magazine or so forth probably use their Xbox 360s on a pretty regular basis, maybe a little bit heavier than some people who don't subscribe to magazines do.
2580802	2585645	And so I think just by nature, the more you use your console, the more you're going to open it up to failure.
2585905	2587446	That's just true of any piece of hardware.
2587486	2589667	The more you use it, the more it's likely to fail someday.
2589767	2590208	That's not true.
2591068	2595191	I guess it's true in general statement, but it shouldn't be failing at the rates that they're talking about.
2595531	2596872	I'll get to that.
2598393	2600815	It's inevitable that the more you use something, the more likely it is to break.
2600955	2602556	That's just a fact.
2603957	2606438	But do I think this number is that far off?
2606939	2607679	Probably not.
2607939	2611061	I would say the real number is probably somewhere around a third.
2612002	2613363	But I still look at this and go...
2614815	2624839	Most companies that would have that type of failure rate on some type of thing they put out, like a television, a CD player, a car, would recall it.
2624939	2626740	They would be forced to recall it.
2627040	2627400	They can't.
2627440	2628221	It'd be bad PR.
2630121	2631782	And this is good PR?
2633343	2637504	Yes, it's good PR for them because notice, even though it may have a 54% failure rate...
2639414	2645338	People, they're still the second largest console share in the United States.
2647100	2652504	People don't care, because people will go out and buy a new console once their console breaks, if it's out of warranty.
2652784	2654125	They'll go buy a new one, because you know why?
2654145	2656106	Because the games are good.
2656186	2658568	They have a good library of games, and people don't give a crap.
2659149	2663372	Well, see, it goes back to the system is only good as the games that are on it.
2664528	2670991	And actually, that's probably the point as to because I know there's been people that have been asking, well, if you're so mad about it, why are you going to buy another one?
2671011	2683377	And it's kind of like, well, dude, because I've invested all this money in the games, not just the physical games and the online games, that selling them back, I'm sorry, that's a waste of my money.
2683657	2683777	Yeah.
2683857	2685739	I would think though that the failure rate is probably around that 54%.
2685779	2685959	Really?
2685979	2686179	Yeah.
2710723	2715388	I've had, what, I have had maybe a total of eight consoles, and I think five of them died at one point.
2716028	2716889	Well, it's interesting.
2716969	2721434	Everybody has their own ideas, and everybody has their own interpretations of these results.
2721834	2723456	You know, I think we can all agree, it ain't 54.2%.
2724217	2726799	That's obviously a skewed statistic.
2727120	2729182	Which way it's skewed, that's open to interpretation.
2730535	2750171	Microsoft responded to it this week by the way and here was their response and this was in a statement to TG Daily Microsoft stands behind the Xbox 360 as a superior entertainment console with one of the best warranties in the industry
2750731	2751292	Thanks for watching!
2770074	2770754	Translation?
2795926	2797767	and yes, that people do enjoy their console.
2798067	2807471	However, they failed to address that their first line of systems that came out in the first few revisions sucks so bad that more than half of them have failed.
2807851	2813674	And in fact, I would be surprised if not all of them failing at some point.
2814294	2821117	The newer systems though, the newer revisions, the newer motherboards and stuff that they're putting out, less likely to fail, yes.
2821377	2822638	And probably, you know,
2823718	2827459	Up to par with, I'd say, the other consoles, you know, around that 10% range.
2828759	2837881	But, a lot of people did buy it at launch, or at least relatively close to launch, and all their consoles are going to fail at some point or another, and it's just a matter of time.
2837921	2838921	It's like a ticking time bomb.
2839361	2840322	That is the problem.
2840562	2851064	Yes, you're continually making them better, but you fucked up in the beginning, and that's a big problem, and you needed to recall all of them and get them all back and give them the new revisions.
2851764	2853285	That would be the proper thing to do.
2853725	2861471	I wasn't going to quite say that much, but... You know, I... I don't know.
2862916	2863737	It's a tricky issue.
2864217	2867939	You know, in the age of the internet, in gaming, we haven't really seen something like this before.
2868059	2869220	But I'm sorry.
2869840	2875123	You can't tell me that the PS3 and the Wii failure rates are anything close to this.
2875804	2876484	Close to this.
2876504	2878245	Because they rushed to get it to market.
2878385	2881887	And yes, it benefited them in the fact that their install base is a lot bigger.
2882307	2885349	However, their hardware is kind of shoddy.
2886946	2897604	I do find it fascinating they dance around the statistic in their response they never deny it notice that in the response they don't deny it at all I think they expected it
2898939	2928375	but that being but here's the thing what they say at the end of their statement as much as that's blowing smoke up my ass it's true I mean with the fact that they do have a choke hold on a lot of the big games out there on the market right now that can only be played on Xbox 360 and that they do have they are doing a lot of things right in that regard outside of just the system itself is kind of hard to deny yeah well here's my thing and that's why you know I'm essentially I guess some of you might say taking it a little bit
2929130	2948903	But at the same time, I think if you're a consumer out there, and you're now worried about, you haven't bought a 360 yet, and you're worried that, okay, if I buy a 360 it's going to fail, I think that worry right now, it shouldn't be a worry, because now the systems have gotten to the point, though, where they aren't failing like they were doing before.
2949104	2952986	And I think it is safe to buy it now, because of all the hard revisions they've done.
2953487	2957890	What they really should have done is all those revisions before the console was released, but, you know, hey...
2958650	2963837	They made a huge mistake, and now they're in the process of trying to pick up the pieces and fixing the problem.
2964137	2965839	But yeah, will people forget about this?
2966100	2968102	Will people remember this for the next console launch?
2968422	2975852	Yeah, you better damn believe it, and there will be a lot of people probably waiting and seeing if there's going to be issues with their next console.
2978240	2983541	By the way, if you're curious what I decided to do with my Xbox 360, I am... He's going to set it on fire and throw it off a cliff.
2984322	2984682	I might.
2985422	2988823	No, I decided I'm going to... Although that would be kind of fun, actually.
2989023	2991843	But I'm going to give it a try.
2991923	2993404	I'm going to let Loki try to fix it.
2994124	2995644	Because he knows how to fix them, apparently.
2995664	2996945	So I'm going to let him try.
2996965	2998745	I have a 50% success rate.
2998905	3000165	Well, I'll take my chance.
3000866	3001626	This way, if...
3003317	3006000	This way I don't have to ship it off and pay those costs or anything.
3006041	3007142	And Loki will do it for free.
3007843	3008163	Right, Loki?
3008844	3009905	I'll pay for parts or whatever.
3010666	3014851	Also, if it doesn't work, then I know Bobby has a friend that will buy for parts.
3014892	3019557	So I will send it to the junkyard to be scrapped at the pick and pull, basically, of Xbox 360s.
3019958	3020599	I will do that.
3021279	3025563	Unless they don't want it because Loki ruins it, then I will set it on fire and throw it off.
3025583	3026624	I'll try not to ruin it too much.
3026644	3032108	All right, try it, please, because I do want to send it off to the virtual pick and pull if that happens.
3032809	3040475	And I will, if I have to, because Loki can't fix it, not that I don't have faith in Loki, but if Loki can't fix it, then I am not going to buy an Xbox 360 Elite.
3040495	3043318	I'm not going to wait for the price drop because I decided that was a stupid idea.
3043898	3047581	Why would I, in turn, give Microsoft more money for their high-end console
3048522	3049963	because the first one failed.
3050343	3050963	That was dumb.
3051264	3052704	That was an e-jerk reaction of mine.
3053065	3053665	I take it back.
3054265	3060589	I would instead buy the lowest, cheapest end Xbox 360 I can buy that's not used.
3061269	3065311	Because if I go for the $199 Xbox arcade, I don't need a hard drive.
3065391	3065872	I have one.
3066212	3068273	I don't need the fancy black color or whatever.
3068773	3070714	The HDMI is on the arcades now.
3071375	3071675	I'm fine.
3073316	3075137	And then at least I'll have HDMI moving forward.
3076397	3076998	That's my plan.
3078824	3081345	And Bobby is saying that his friend will want it even ruined.
3081425	3081665	Great.
3082206	3083547	So, Loki, have fun.
3083747	3084507	If you fix it, great.
3084567	3086108	If you don't, off to the pick and pull.
3086669	3088690	I'm hoping that we're on the positive end of my 50%.
3090431	3090812	We'll see.
3091672	3094474	We'll update your win-loss ratio here on our Twitter.
3094574	3098697	The one that did work, that was successful, still works today.
3099057	3099758	It still works.
3099838	3100558	It's awesome.
3100678	3102099	I keep waiting for it to fail again.
3102980	3105141	I will donate my 360 to science.
3105301	3106202	That is what I'm doing.
3108385	3108646	Alright.
3108666	3109467	Well, hey, question.
3110870	3112673	When you did your repairs, was your film...
3113746	3117008	Was your failure rate closer to the beginning or closer to the end?
3117388	3118008	It was the end.
3119309	3120710	The first one worked flawlessly.
3121150	3123151	Second one, not so much.
3123671	3125192	Well, that's okay, because you know what?
3125212	3129775	You can still be in business, because your failure rate is close to Microsoft's failure rate, and they're still kicking.
3129815	3130535	So you know what?
3130955	3131856	Off to Loki's repair shop.
3131876	3134997	And I blame their console for my failure anyways.
3135237	3136558	All right, Luke, let's move on.
3137719	3139100	I'm just going to get more...
3140385	3148083	angsty comments if I continue on this whole tirade with the 360 and so forth it is a tricky line here I do feel a sense of
3149420	3150461	Damn it, shit, fuck.
3150621	3153384	You know, with the whole Xbox 360 red ringing.
3153785	3155887	But at the same time, I do understand shit happens.
3156247	3159050	But it just makes me... I don't know if angry is the right word.
3159071	3159851	It makes me irritated.
3159891	3161493	Did you try doing it without the... Shut up.
3161673	3169161	It makes me irritated that so many people are having the same problem and yet Microsoft just says, well, but we're still cool.
3169302	3169942	We're still the best.
3170283	3171244	Did you try it without the hard drive?
3172233	3172573	You know what?
3172613	3172953	I didn't.
3173513	3178875	This week I decided I've been having, in my personal life, I've been having the most shitty week you could possibly imagine.
3178915	3180415	I'm faking it really well on the show tonight.
3180895	3186216	Here's the thing, is that I just decided I'm not going to make my week worse by even trying that 360 this week.
3186337	3187177	Alright, no problem.
3187197	3187777	I'll take care of it.
3187857	3188237	I promise.
3189497	3191458	Well, how about other stuff, huh?
3191758	3191918	Yes.
3192731	3194773	How about some World of Warcraft stuff?
3194833	3195073	Alright.
3205455	3207317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3225593	3233856	They've raised the cap to 85 for levels, but now they're going back and revamping old zones and changing them completely.
3234616	3246861	Since the big cataclysm thing, some areas are destroyed, and then some of the places like Desolace and the Barrens are becoming green.
3249162	3251363	They're redesigning cities so that you can fly.
3253063	3277322	and, um, actually in Undercity too, um, they are actually, uh, having more interaction with the terrain, you can have flooding happen, so, also seven new zones, um, uh, like, um, Oldham, Mount, I guess that's Hyjal, and the Sunken City, which is an undersea zone, so you get underwater mounts and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,
3277782	3281084	Twilight Highlands, and Deep Home.
3281524	3283925	Sounds very dwarfy in name.
3286026	3288448	So all the rumors we heard about last week were essentially true.
3288728	3288908	Yeah.
3289148	3292510	Oh, and new profession, archaeology.
3293325	3294966	Oh, so you can be Indiana Jones, but a goblin.
3295006	3295946	You know what?
3296126	3297807	That actually would be enough to have me try it out.
3297987	3299588	The Archaeology edition.
3299948	3304090	Yeah, because I'd really like to see how something like that would enhance your character.
3304530	3309273	It's been a while since I've played, but honestly, though, I'm sticking with RO.
3310754	3312415	I don't know if this is enough to get me back to WoW.
3312435	3314157	I guess I have to see it when the expansion comes out.
3314197	3314997	You know, never say never.
3315177	3318000	I said I would never go back to Final Fantasy XI, and I did for a month, so whatever.
3318640	3324765	But, you know, I do think it's interesting because they've been talking about revamping old Azeroth for a long time.
3325466	3327027	And now they're going to do it and make you pay for it.
3329398	3330279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3358291	3359612	Well, there is some other stuff.
3359672	3365974	There's a little bit more as far as the racial abilities for the new races.
3366295	3371037	For Worgen, you can switch between human and Worgen form instantaneously at will.
3371437	3376919	You have Dark Flight, which increases movement speed by 70% for 10 seconds with a 3-minute cooldown.
3377600	3384543	Viciousness, you have Flayer, and then Goblins are basically like the Ferengi of the Horde.
3385123	3386123	They're the businessmen.
3386303	3386744	Makes sense.
3386884	3387604	That's a good comparison.
3388150	3391811	So you can... There's actually a... You kind of look like Quark, too.
3391972	3395753	A skill called... I wonder if you can give them Umox.
3396433	3397554	You know, we're... Anyway.
3398434	3400035	I wonder if they can make me a Warp Core Breach.
3400315	3401775	Do they have the lobes for business?
3402716	3403496	God, so nerdy.
3404376	3407137	But Best Deals Anywhere is one of their skills.
3407257	3411999	Better Living Through Chemistry, which increases alchemy skill by 15 points.
3412659	3413820	And I like Time is Money.
3414740	3418123	So it increases attack and casting speed by 1%.
3419264	3426170	The Archaeology skill gives you the ability to excavate hidden items in ruins.
3426210	3433876	You can do research notes that let you unlock new abilities for the Path of the Titans character progression.
3434597	3437499	So... Go flip that whip.
3437979	3438060	Um...
3439085	3442107	I think, personally, as a WoW player, I think goblins are annoying.
3442208	3443348	I would never want to play as one.
3444389	3445470	I was disappointed to hear that.
3448372	3455998	Well, for other stuff going on with that, with the new dungeons, they actually have the level lists up for the five-man dungeons.
3456819	3458100	You know, I don't want to say five-man.
3458120	3460382	I'm going to say five-character dungeons.
3460742	3461403	That works for me.
3462063	3463164	Or a party of five.
3463324	3464445	Or sentai ones.
3464605	3471392	Grim Battle is $85 Skywall is $80-$82 Abyssal Maw is $80-$83 Deep Home is $80-$83 Uldum is $83-$84 and an $85
3484364	3493632	Blackrock Caverns for level 85, and then they do five-person versions of two of the older dungeons.
3494573	3499798	The Deadmines has a level 85 version, and Shadowfang Keep.
3500759	3506224	And for those that don't know, those are some beloved old-school instances from original WoW.
3507327	3514534	And then for four new raids, two of them have been revealed.
3514914	3524142	One is the Firelands and one of them is called Nefarian's Throne Room, which features Blackwing Lairs and Boss Nefarian.
3524403	3525364	Hence the name!
3525804	3526625	Har har!
3529984	3537568	I do think it's interesting, this whole heroic Deadmines thing, because if you play original Deadmines at the level you're supposed to be playing Deadmines at, it takes forever.
3538229	3545653	So it's going to be interesting to see if they scale it back so Deadmines does not take as long to get through, or if it's still going to be like an epic four-hour run.
3546994	3557600	Well, they're also putting in, with the 3.3 patch, there's a panel that's cross-server LFG for five-man dungeons, so you can get more people together to do.
3557620	3560622	That's needed, actually.
3560882	3563904	There's also new race combinations available now.
3563944	3575591	You have Human Hunter, Orc Mage, Night Elf Mage, Blood Elf Warrior, Dwarf Shaman, Dwarf Mage, Undead Hunter, Tarn Paladin, Tarn Priest, Gnome Priest, and Troll Druid.
3576411	3578692	There's a stat overhaul.
3580292	3581993	The stats are being simplified.
3583653	3589255	So you have your spell power, MP5, armor penetration, all that's gone.
3592416	3593716	It's really just a whole bunch of them.
3593756	3594897	It's actually all up on the WoW page.
3595817	3602439	For other class changes, just look on the panel on your thing.
3602519	3602959	It's all there.
3604059	3605240	Flying mounts are available.
3607623	3608584	and Azeroth.
3609644	3611945	So you can fly around all you want to.
3612465	3613766	Thank heavens.
3614346	3615967	You have your guild progression.
3616347	3618088	They actually have a numerical method now.
3618108	3625591	You have raided battlegrounds, new PvP changes, a bunch of other crap.
3626672	3628453	And a bunch of other stuff that I personally don't care about.
3630011	3633814	You know, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty good expansion, a good swift kick in the pants to the game.
3634015	3635496	You know, that's one thing Blizzard likes to do.
3635556	3637077	They really like to change that game up.
3637818	3639759	You know, that game is nothing like it used to be.
3639779	3640380	You know what I mean?
3640400	3652049	Well, see, I think that that's, honestly, the whole point that I see with that is this is how, you know, going through their head, well, people get tired of the same old, same old, same old, same old.
3652549	3654791	You know, people are going to leave when they get bored with it.
3655491	3658332	Why not give them no excuse to get bored?
3658372	3659633	Why not make something new?
3660213	3668037	However, the thing that bored me was the way the game plays in general, and the fact that there's a bunch of idiots playing it, so...
3669862	3671302	That's still not enough to read.
3671782	3674343	You probably have to find the right click to play with.
3674463	3676363	I would like to check it out.
3676703	3680544	I think I might consider looking at it.
3680984	3686585	I certainly haven't installed World of Warcraft on this computer, and I still have my account.
3688325	3698267	It might be worth it for me to check out, but certainly not until I'm healed up enough to be able to play a game that requires a keyboard.
3699980	3701341	Star Trek Star Trek Star Trek
3728234	3729977	I have to make the Olarian.
3732160	3735865	And I've already started picking races that I want to make the Olarians from.
3737127	3738388	Well, you go on with your bad self.
3739750	3740651	They're going to be orange.
3740672	3740892	Okay.
3741547	3742848	All right, let's move on to more gaming news.
3765686	3775411	The new Slim system is 30% smaller, or actually 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and uses 34% less power.
3776132	3781755	It comes with a 120GB hard drive, and of course at the new price of $299.
3783596	3789539	And that is actually going to be released supposedly in the first week of September.
3790860	3791120	But...
3792495	3808758	You know, according to GameStop, it's actually supposed to be coming out next week, or as early as next week, but, you know, basically we'll be replacing the new, well, the 80 gig system and the 160 gig system that they had out already.
3809539	3815500	Which just goes to prove that whenever you try to put out a cease and desist, you're only validating the material.
3816060	3816200	Yep.
3817089	3829906	And on top of all this, they dropped the 80GB system to $299 as well, and they also dropped the $160 to $399, which begs the question, why the hell did you do that?
3830807	3831809	At least in that order.
3832009	3833831	I mean, they totally don't get it.
3834898	3836738	Why would you drop the price of those two systems?
3836798	3838119	I understand to clear them out.
3838179	3838839	That's fine.
3838859	3839939	That makes perfect sense.
3840639	3843339	But then you announce the new system at the same time.
3843920	3844780	Okay, great.
3844860	3850861	So now I have these new slim 120GB systems in my store with 80GB systems that are the same price.
3851481	3852181	Duh!
3852341	3856242	Am I going to buy the new system that has a larger hard drive for the same price?
3856542	3857482	Yeah, I think I will.
3857982	3862543	And at the same time, would you really spend an extra $100 for an extra 40GB on your hard drive?
3863362	3864263	Thanks for watching!
3886359	3886920	and all that.
3887942	3891189	There's also been a discovery.
3891289	3896140	Apparently when they were registering the Slim, I guess with the FCC and all this...
3898174	3898935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3917222	3924105	I guess filing for another SKU that's going to be with a 250GB hard drive.
3924625	3925986	So that's probably coming later on.
3926126	3927467	So, great!
3927707	3930188	Now we know that there's a larger hard drive system coming out later on.
3930268	3933930	Why the hell are we going to, you know, if you're really not in a hurry to buy a system, you'll probably want to wait.
3935270	3936791	Well, this other one might be more money too.
3937151	3937731	It probably will be.
3938332	3941393	Plus, I still don't really know, what do I put on this hard drive?
3943266	3952452	All those games installs because most of the games that are released now on Blu-ray do require an install because their drive is slow.
3953092	3963259	And the other thing too, in case you're wondering, the system did get rid of the alternative operating system install as well.
3963299	3967582	So if you're thinking about installing Linux on this slim system, you are dead wrong.
3967942	3968943	That won't be happening.
3969743	3970864	They'll find a way.
3971673	3974834	So way to go, Sony, removing features from your system as well now.
3976815	3978055	We know they're going to find a way.
3978095	3979716	The Linux community is stubborn.
3979856	3985778	Plus, how many people really honestly are getting the PlayStation 3 to install Linux on it?
3986558	3988279	And it's not like the fat ones are hard to find.
3988499	3990899	It's only offering them a challenge now.
3991640	3998702	Seriously, people may have been okay with not doing it because it's readily available now, but
4001162	4002944	The thing is, why would you remove that?
4003104	4008470	I understand that you don't need to necessarily do that, but really, did that cost anything to them?
4009451	4009652	No?
4010092	4010492	Not really?
4011093	4016019	Oh, the other funny thing, too, is it takes two seconds longer to boot up each time, for whatever reason.
4017220	4017641	Strange.
4018221	4018401	Yeah.
4018682	4018802	Hmm.
4020120	4020740	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4050109	4058202	or not the mouse but you know what I mean when you have the thing in place you can kind of see in the background some of the stuff except now you can interact with that background if that makes sense at all.
4060367	4061948	Also, a status indicator is coming.
4062449	4064751	This will be located in the top right corner of your PlayStation 3.
4064791	4075240	It'll show your user icon that you have, however many friends that you have that are online, and also, most importantly, a little mail indicator if you have any new messages.
4075480	4076120	So that's pretty cool.
4076441	4081985	Also, we'll have a little scrolling tick bar with the latest news from PSN, which I think they already kind of have.
4082346	4084928	So that'll just be adapted into this new status indicator.
4086369	4092673	Also, apparently, now when you hit the PS button, no longer will the battery life indicator sit right on top of the clock.
4093913	4096575	You know what's kind of cool, though, is those new dynamic themes that they have.
4096735	4097335	Have you seen those?
4099176	4101718	They're animated themes now that you can have in the background.
4101738	4105800	So, like, they have a little big planet one where the Sackboy's running on, you know, a planet.
4106561	4108722	And I guess you also now have premium avatars, they're saying.
4110860	4111541	I don't know what that means
4117248	4119450	The Friends list is getting also reformatted.
4119830	4123833	Shortcuts to the PlayStation Store, because naturally they want to make it easier for you to buy stuff.
4124393	4126635	And apparently a big change coming to trophies.
4127596	4134100	With 3.0 firmware, game developers will now be able to modify how trophies are displayed for add-on content.
4135161	4141266	So apparently you still have the list combined when you're looking at the PlayStation Network or what have you.
4141606	4143567	But I guess the developers have the freedom to...
4144568	4145529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4165163	4169286	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange-radio.com asks an interesting question about PlayStation.
4169847	4173290	Why is it that with each new in-creation of the PS3, it keeps losing features?
4173710	4179855	It's lost backwards compatibility, flash card reader, fewer USB slots, and now the inability to install an OS onto it.
4180155	4182797	Is it just me, or shouldn't a console evolve with each new SKU?
4183157	4187321	From the looks of it, it's devolving so much that we will lose controller support in two years.
4187561	4188662	Obviously, that part was sarcastic.
4189402	4198585	They're dropping stuff out of the system to cut the cost of the system because that's the only way they can drop it to $2.99 without losing $500 or whatever on each system.
4198625	4201205	But I thought backwards compatibility was all software-based now.
4202386	4202766	I thought so too.
4202786	4206207	And it's not the whole PS2 in your PS3 like it was at the beginning.
4206227	4209227	I thought so too, but for whatever reason, maybe licensing.
4209367	4212308	I can't imagine it would be licensing though because Linux is free.
4213108	4214049	I mean, you don't even have to...
4216877	4221806	You're buying, or you're not really buying, you're downloading Linux anyways off the internet and installing it to it.
4221906	4224932	It's not like it's already there or something like that.
4225833	4229099	Alright, we got one more story from Jamie, then we're gonna get into some release dates.
4230417	4231138	I got a pony.
4231438	4232118	There's my story.
4232378	4232838	No, I'm kidding.
4232898	4234039	Congrats.
4234419	4235980	Well, you and me are big comic book nerds.
4237061	4241663	Well, this is news that makes me particularly happy as long as they get good comics.
4242984	4247826	There's a digital comic reader that's going to be on the PSP in December.
4249147	4252548	They actually are working with Marvel to have...
4253949	4254550	and so on.
4274478	4275758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4303838	4305880	Well, I like actually buying comics.
4306581	4307922	I mean, I love going to the store.
4308823	4314570	I mean, I read a bunch of digital comics anyway, but...
4316562	4328727	You know what, actually, now that I think about it, I don't really use our PSP that much, but if I did, I would be interested in it, because I actually have downloaded a number of comics on my iPhone.
4329307	4335630	I read the first three graphic novels of Bone on my iPhone.
4336190	4345752	on my iPhone and I downloaded the Star Trek movie countdown, the tie-in that was supposed to be the prequel to the events in the movie.
4346673	4349553	And I thought that was very convenient.
4349573	4352614	It was definitely cheaper than going and paying three bucks for the issue.
4354595	4357555	But then again, I've gone right out and I'm reading the Nero book
4360137	4365763	And Marvel, I know, would have to be behind it because they have been pushing the whole digital comic thing pretty hardcore.
4381022	4387467	Actdeft in our chatroom says I hope it's subscription based SSJ100Matt says What does DC Comics have to say about this?
4387667	4391630	They did make the DC Universe game PS3 exclusive and now they're supporting its competition
4392831	4420964	DC and Marvel have teamed up before for a number of things I think that DC would have to hop in on this and it would be good for all the businesses and you know what I would actually like to see is see some of the indie comic companies be included in this you know maybe even a web comic reader
4421209	4425931	Well, they are going to have... It's not just Marvel, though.
4426511	4431113	Well, that's why I said Archie and Image are involved as well, but I didn't mention anything on DC.
4431153	4433354	I wouldn't see why DC couldn't jump in on that.
4435695	4435995	I don't know.
4436675	4437775	They're more than welcome, I guess.
4438656	4439536	Just haven't done it yet.
4442617	4449560	Alright, well, let's move on to some release dates before the comics get here and we lose DarkSakura because she'll be too busy reading them.

4519108	4521149	This is going to be an excellent title for the DS.
4522009	4523749	The Click, Diss and Make Up.
4524290	4525810	Of course, I'm being sarcastic there.
4525970	4527050	It's probably going to really suck.
4528291	4528851	Same with this one.
4528911	4536473	Wizards of Waverly Place, based on the Disney, I don't know, teen comedy.

4625078	4630263	Because D3, they're likely to put out crazy shit like that over here.
4630724	4635269	Especially since the women in this game, based on the screenshots, have giant boobies.
4635729	4637690	Of course, another game with chicks with giant boobies.
4638250	4643471	Also on the Xbox 360 this week, Memories Off 6, Next Relation.
4644292	4645592	Yeah, Next Relation.
4646112	4649393	Well, hopefully she's not related if Memories are off.
4650273	4652794	Moving on to other consoles.
4652874	4657095	On the PlayStation 3, Grand Theft Auto 4 gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

4685319	4687061	Ishoku Sokuhatsu
4699640	4701501	Oh, it looks kind of like an RTS type of strategy.
4701541	4704583	It looks like a strategy, command and conquer-ish type of game on the PlayStation 2.
4705484	4707905	Memories Off 6 is getting a PlayStation 2 port.
4708005	4708465	Go figure.
4709166	4714309	Tomb Raider Anniversary and Legend to get price reductions if you never caught those on the PlayStation 2.
4715129	4721353	On the Nintendo DS, Super Robo Gakuen comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.
4721453	4722894	Gakuen is high school...
4723952	4725633	So it's Robot High School?
4725673	4726333	Is that what this is?
4726573	4728754	Yeah, is it G-A-K-U-E-N?
4728854	4729294	Yes, it is.
4729374	4730415	Yeah, that would be High School.
4730995	4733596	So yeah, it looks like Robot High School is the game here.
4733616	4735237	And I'm trying to look at screenshots, but can't.
4735277	4738878	But it looks like a little type of a strategy type game coming out this week on the DS.
4739538	4743160	And lastly, looking at the PSP real quick.
4745381	4745921	Well, you can...
4746501	4772971	import in Japan the English language version of Final Fantasy Dissida if you want because obviously that's a big game we're getting out here this week I do want to point out though Soul Calibur Broken Destiny is out in Japan this week that is the new Soul Calibur game on PSP so I bet we do have some hardcore Soul Calibur fans that will want to import that probably not you can wait another week and then get that actually fine that's going to do it for PSP releases and Japanese releases
4773894	4784436	Well, for our UK releases, on the 26th, we have Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Hantao, and Watchmen The End is Nigh Part 2 on Xbox 360, both of those.
4784977	4789418	On the 27th, for PS3, is Invincible Tiger, The Legend of Hantao.
4790018	4798020	On the 28th, we have Allied Ace Pilots on DS, Batman Arkham Asylum, Xbox 360 and PS3, King of Fighters 12...
4799860	4812851	Meh, Might and Magic, Clash of Heroes on DS, Soul Calibur Broken, Destiny on PSP, Supercar Challenge, and World Cup of Pool.
4814512	4815093	What is it?
4815962	4817142	World Cup of Pool?
4817423	4817803	Pool.
4818203	4818343	Oh.
4819023	4819503	Let me make sure.
4819543	4828147	It makes it sound like it's a cup full of pool, but chlorine-flavored water, but I'm assuming it's... I'm assuming it's like a swimming game or something.
4829007	4829727	Cup of poo.
4830948	4831448	Pool.
4831968	4832088	Ew.
4833068	4834529	Two Girls World Cup?
4834709	4836630	La la la la la.
4838750	4838851	Um...
4840615	4841876	Anyways, I don't know how to follow that.
4842216	4846380	But we'll talk about the PlayStation Network.
4846921	4855889	Sony, one of the things they announced while they were talking about secret console revisions and stuff like that is that they're
4857230	4857990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4886361	4892906	And they will apparently be less costly to develop for and cost less to gamers.
4892946	4895187	Of course, no real prices have been announced yet.
4895888	4900271	They plan on having 15 at launch and 50 by the end of the year.
4901131	4907836	And some of the titles that they did mention were coming out include Tetris, Field Runners, Heroes of Sparta, and Mini-Gore.
4908816	4910498	And once again...
4911738	4912199	Thanks for watching!
4922412	4923893	That might make it a little bit worth it.
4923913	4926296	But if they hadn't, you would have bitched about it.
4926416	4927296	And I would have bitched about it.
4927336	4928257	We all would have bitched about it.
4928578	4933902	Because it doesn't sound like there's no hardware feature.
4934863	4937526	There's no reason these games can't be on the original PSP.
4937566	4937986	So why not?
4938006	4939427	They're going to sell them to the original PSP owners.
4939768	4943051	Which begs the question, why would I buy the PSP Go?
4943231	4946674	Why would anybody buy the PSP Go other than the fact that it's...
4947334	4948695	It has a sliding screen.
4948775	4950215	Is that really worth more money?
4951215	4953956	I will buy a PSP Go when the price drops.
4954676	4955556	And it won't take long.
4956477	4958017	I bet you anything it will not take long.
4958077	4959798	It may be 2010, but it won't take long.
4961058	4966100	When the price of the PSP Go matches the price of the PSP, which has to happen eventually, I will buy one.
4967180	4968340	You know what they're going to do?
4969000	4970361	They're going to get rid of the original PSP.
4971397	4984865	and then they're going to make you buy that of course it's not going to happen anytime soon because you've got like bundles now for Dissidia, you've got a bundle for Gran Turismo coming out in September you've got a bundle with Assassin's Creed coming out in November
4986823	4988904	There's no reason that you can't find a PSP 3000.
4989344	4995008	Alpha Catanagram in chat says, I would buy a PSP Go when the price drop occurs and use it as a belt buckle.
4995028	4996388	That actually sounds kind of awesome.
4996408	4998770	Have you ever seen those belt buckles with the scrolling text on them?
4999430	5001191	And it gets everybody to look at your crotch?
5001371	5002572	You can order those at ThinkGeek.
5003092	5004032	I've seen those before.
5004073	5005313	The LED belt buckles.
5005693	5006794	Yeah, kind of cool.
5006994	5010576	Imagine having a PSP Go showing a little movie on your crotch.
5010596	5011316	It'd be fun.
5011657	5014278	Which is actually footage of your crotch.
5014378	5015299	Yeah.
5016658	5017219	You nasty.
5017599	5018099	Which would be fine.
5018419	5020881	Well, did they ever say what's going to happen with my UMDs?
5021062	5022863	How I'm going to put my UMDs on my Go?
5023243	5027307	No, but I read a funny article by GameStop.
5027327	5030109	They were saying that they expect them to be traded in.
5031470	5032751	Not that there's going to be an official program.
5032811	5045361	It's just that people are going to be so enamored with PSP Go that they're just going to throw all their UMDs out and rebuy the content again because they love Sony so much.
5045681	5045962	Right.
5046162	5046282	Yeah.
5048570	5052413	I'm sure there are some fanboys that will, but I just don't see it being an epidemic.
5053314	5070306	No, I'm sure that people would do that, because obviously Sony's not giving them a way to... My thing is, at the same time, if you do own an original PSP system, and they may just say, fuck you, you own an original PSP system, why the hell do we need a method for you to
5070936	5073237	You know, dump your UMDs on there.
5073257	5074198	Just buy new games!
5076299	5080281	Or, I don't know, just don't buy a new system because you have a PSP system already.
5080481	5082482	Why would you buy another system, you idiot?
5084182	5086223	That's just my opinion there.
5086243	5087984	I don't know, yeah.
5088184	5090045	I'm just still not seeing the reasons to jump ship.
5091186	5099150	The Go, though, I think would be good for people who don't already own... Even then, it's not the right price.
5100239	5102560	I would say if you don't own a PSP, buy a PSP.
5103000	5103881	You don't need the PSP.
5103941	5104421	Go yet.
5104601	5108903	There's nothing that super that it gets you unless you really need a quiet system or something.
5109164	5109524	I don't know.
5111485	5114366	And there are ways you can run stuff off your memory card even now.
5114526	5117308	I mean, no, legit ways, actually.
5117348	5121810	I mean, you can still purchase all those games online if you do want to do digital downloads.
5122150	5123571	Just buy your own memory card.
5124111	5128674	What do you want to bet that half of the games in this mini thing are...
5129750	5132332	Virtual Console Rehashes.
5132812	5136315	Old games sold out again.
5136335	5138236	Galaga on my PSP.
5138276	5143000	They already have PlayStation Network games that are independent titles.
5143140	5147083	They're like PlayStation Network games like Super Stardust and stuff like that.
5148382	5149283	How's that any different?
5149363	5151544	Okay, the file sizes are smaller and they're going to be cheaper.
5151624	5152445	Whoop-dee-shit.
5152605	5156067	Okay, just make them cheaper and make the file sizes smaller.
5156147	5159710	You don't need to necessarily make it a whole new category of games.
5159730	5164233	I guess if you want to draw more attention to the PSP or something, you can do that, which is what they did.
5164313	5166234	But, I don't know.
5166834	5174900	Making something cheaper and cheaper to develop for doesn't really warrant them putting another bullet point in their system, I guess.
5176818	5177098	M.T.V.
5177118	5177859	Games and Harmonix
5199710	5200250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5222799	5224240	Beatles Karaoke Revolution.
5224800	5226280	Well, it's still rock band.
5226720	5228581	It's just a singing version of it.
5228621	5229841	So you don't have the instruments.
5229921	5231142	You just have the singing parts.
5231942	5235323	To be fair, you know, again, it's about options.
5235383	5237524	It goes back to what we were talking about earlier in the show.
5237584	5238784	It's just another way to buy the game.
5239145	5239665	And you know what?
5239685	5242166	There are some people that don't really want all those plastic instruments.
5242546	5248888	Then I could see this really being aimed at the Beatles fans who are...
5249588	5253510	wanting to have the game, but they don't want all this plastic instrument crap in their house.
5253550	5254870	Those people are communists.
5256391	5257131	But I understand.
5257152	5257532	I'm kidding.
5257652	5259553	It might be a small audience, but it's an audience.
5259893	5262374	And certainly they want to sell this game to as many people as possible.
5262935	5263475	That's true.
5263915	5269337	Or perhaps you already own all the instruments and everything and you just want some extra microphones so you can do your three-part harmonies.
5270637	5273418	That's actually a certainly plausible outcome as well.
5274658	5279519	No SingStar Beatles, but you know, hey, Rock Band Beatles, it's not like it looks that bad or anything.
5279539	5280560	It looks pretty awesome, actually.
5281080	5281980	I'm really looking forward to it.
5282000	5285661	And if they are planning on releasing this, they sure as hell haven't told anyone yet.
5286718	5288180	Well, this might also only be in Britain.
5288400	5293668	Keep in mind, all this news is coming out of Europe, so it may not be something that's actually planned here, but it might be just planned over there.
5293788	5294709	So, who knows?
5296431	5298092	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5320482	5333495	It actually originally came out in Japan on the PC-8801 in 1986, and then the Mega CD version came out, which of course for the Sega CD over here.
5334937	5337960	They actually made a ton of improvements over the PC-88 version.
5340502	5358811	Instead of just having the static background, the background for each level is full motion video with a polygon overlay for all the ships and asteroids and everything coming at you.
5359991	5361892	And it's a really, really good game.
5362312	5365434	There was an FM7 version that was also released.
5367170	5394150	and it came out in the US for PC but that was put up by Sierra Online at any rate it was actually a competitor with Star Fox for the day except Star Fox was all fully rendered on the cartridge and like I said this had a
5397259	5404186	A full motion video background, and it still is a traditional kind of shooter.
5407710	5415178	Honestly though, it had better, graphically it was better, but it didn't have that innovative feel to it that Star Fox did.
5416219	5423264	Um, so, yeah, terrorists take over the Earth, and, uh, we get these, uh, cool little ships that get to, you know, shoot people in the end.
5424044	5432009	Um, it did have a sequel, which was, um, Sylphid the Lost Planet, um, which was a PS2 game.
5432649	5439153	And then Project Sylphid was actually a spiritual successor, um, not really a game in the series.
5439174	5439474	Um.
5440634	5452941	Um, a little bit of trivia about Sylphid too, um, is that, um, there was, uh, a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh!
5453382	5454542	that's called Sylphid.
5456083	5462827	And, um, in, uh, Mahiro-matic, there's actually a jetpack that Mahiro uses called the Sylphid.
5463708	5469131	And then in BlazBlue, um, Sylphid is the name of Rachel Alucard's tribe.
5471434	5475417	This game also has one of the best intros ever.
5477238	5479220	It's really one that you have to watch and listen to.
5479360	5494972	And the other thing that I really dig about this one, as opposed to the original version of it, is as you're flying through the level, you get radio feedback from the rest of the fleet.
5495712	5496333	Like in Star Fox.
5496353	5496433	Yeah.
5499603	5501144	No, it's not quite the same.
5501604	5506927	In Star Fox, if you go back earlier in that file, we'll play a little bit of it.
5507027	5507688	It's a little different.
5509429	5509889	There we go.
5524097	5525418	I think those have really good music, too.
5531208	5535430	I heard it yelling... There you go.
5535470	5546416	Yeah, and see, in Star Fox, the way it was, is that it was your squadron, your formation of ships, you know.
5547476	5548457	You had your partners.
5548917	5559262	In this, it's you're getting... Like, have you ever... Alright, I know this is kind of old school, but have you ever listened to just CB channels?
5560595	5561856	Back in the day, yeah.
5575715	5583642	and orders went out or feedback went out or some sort of announcement it may not be necessarily directed to you but you're still going to hear it.
5583863	5584984	Do people still use CD?
5585244	5587066	Yes, actually.
5587986	5588747	Well, trackers do.
5591169	5595794	But if you see though in that sense then it actually adds a sense of realism to the game.
5596434	5606003	And for the record, in terms of if you're traveling with people, like in your separate vehicles, having a CB is actually very good for areas that you'll lose cell reception.
5608165	5609706	Plus cell cost minutes, anyway.
5610887	5611408	Not always.
5613389	5618474	But at any rate, I think it's a fantastic game.
5619475	5620376	Alright, so there it is.
5620596	5621236	Silphied.
5622157	5622658	Silphied.
5624127	5625348	At least I didn't say Slipeed.
5625908	5628230	Yeah, people used to do that all the time too.
5628370	5630411	Your classic game of the week.
5630531	5632213	Not the newer one that came out on 360.
5632273	5635195	This is the old school one on Saturn.
5635995	5637656	Well, the sequel though is PS2.
5639157	5640759	I think I played that one.
5641279	5642440	I think I have it somewhere.
5643521	5648124	And for the record, they were talking about Policenauts earlier.
5648824	5652507	I came very close to using Policenauts as the classic game.
5653755	5657179	You know, we're going to get into a story about police knots later, but I'll leave that for later.
5657199	5657779	Oh, I didn't mean to.
5657819	5658340	No, that's all right.
5658740	5660362	It's a Twitter thing, so it's going to come up later.
5660562	5661143	Yeah.
5661843	5662084	All right.
5662164	5665127	Speaking of Twitter, we'll get into Twitter topics right after a little bit of a break.
5665467	5668350	We are going to take a break, though, here in studio to cover more.
5669351	5675137	Actually, we take the break, though, to get energized, to pee, to maybe order pizza.
5675417	5675738	We'll see.
5676751	5677752	Becky's bringing me tacos.
5677812	5679132	Oh, lucky.
5679412	5683854	But I was going to offer to you on the air, guys, do you want me to make you guys pizza?
5683874	5685454	That's actually okay.
5685514	5687955	I probably shouldn't because I had a big old crepe earlier today.
5687975	5690756	I have organic mushroom and black olive pizzas.
5691217	5692197	That does sound kind of good.
5692817	5695158	I also have plain cheese pizzas.
5696579	5696939	Maybe.
5696979	5697819	I don't know.
5697859	5699180	I don't want any unless you're going to have some.
5700360	5702381	Dude, if I make pizza, I can just have it for lunch tomorrow.
5702441	5702641	Hi.
5704331	5706372	My man, by the way, is not here.
5706572	5710574	So I am going to be going stir-crazy so people will be seeing me in IRC.
5711034	5712054	Wee!
5712975	5713615	We're going to take a break.
5713635	5715756	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5715796	5732384	We have plenty more to talk about in Part B tonight, including our rapid-fire news and talk about a new interesting achievement on Xbox 360 for killing 1,000 children in a game and a possible revamp of DSiWare and a Final Fantasy game you will probably never, ever see.
5733547	5738171	We will talk about all of that in Part B after a quick break, so stay tuned here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5760990	5762191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5780109	5780989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5803740	5804500	We'll see you next time.
5829085	5829745	Anonymous things.
5829765	5831306	I don't want my address out there on the internet.
5831566	5836068	But yeah, so it cost me a little more money since I do that, but you know, whatever.
5836509	5839170	I still have an OLR Wii, but I haven't done anything with that.
5839270	5839530	Do you?
5841011	5841351	Yeah.
5841471	5844332	And we need like an OLRPS3.com or something.
5844392	5846473	Yeah, maybe.
5846573	5847874	I'll work on it someday.
5848214	5853517	You know, if you're interested in helping us build websites and develop, you want to... We pay great, nothing.
5854897	5856498	But pat on the back and job well done.
5857158	5857719	Eventually.
5857939	5858199	It's just...
5859080	5861188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5864298	5864438	7 bucks, $7.50
5892452	5892953	DarkSakura.com
5911468	5912249	You've seen me do it.
5941429	5944030	It was some type of Namco 25th anniversary thing.
5944430	5946651	So it was Pac-Man, Ms.
5946671	5948312	Pac-Man, and Galaga were all on it.
5948972	5952293	They wanted 195,000 tickets for that thing.
5952833	5955294	That's like $3,000 in real money.
5956135	5958015	Trust me, they're not really that expensive.
5958115	5958916	I was going to say.
5959836	5960156	Dang.
5961317	5962657	Probably a few hundred bucks and that's it.
5963797	5964978	You could build one cheaper.
5965078	5965558	Probably.
5966118	5967319	But it did look pretty cool.
5967339	5970160	I was kind of curious to get one, but whatever.
5970990	5971130	T.O.A.G.A.C.
5986977	5988017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6010402	6011623	And I'll see you next time.
6034591	6036573	So maybe a little broken, but it'll still get you to the stream.
6036813	6038854	So you can listen to us on the iPhone on the All Games app.
6038874	6040596	You can listen to us on the PSP on the OLR app.
6040616	6041056	You're covered.
6041496	6042017	One way or another.
6042877	6043118	All right.
6043678	6044639	Twitter topics tonight.
6044719	6046060	Every night we invite you guys.
6046080	6047641	We need a theme song for Twitter topics.
6048101	6048722	I don't have anything.
6048742	6050143	I'll have to think about that for next week.
6050844	6053205	Like Conan O'Brien has a little theme song for his Twitter segment.
6053225	6053606	You know what?
6053666	6054446	You should do...
6058129	6058830	I don't know.
6058850	6059230	Rizzlem.
6060211	6060611	I don't know.
6060811	6061532	I don't know.
6061592	6062233	I was thinking something.
6062253	6063174	I'll think of something for next time.
6063534	6063754	All right.
6064174	6065456	In the meantime, don't call me during the show.
6065496	6066857	Why are my parents calling me during the show?
6067517	6068298	You should use the beep.
6068478	6069319	You should use that beep.
6069599	6069940	What beep?
6070520	6072402	That beep beep should be the theme for Twitter topics?
6072442	6072602	Yeah.
6073030	6076054	Big Black Cock We haven't had that in a while
6094312	6099776	Ray Ayanami wants us to talk about Raystorm HD and not just because his name is in it.
6100096	6104760	But apparently there is a new game coming out called Raystorm HD.
6104880	6108743	This is a remake, possibly, of an old school Taito game.
6109444	6110124	Apparently they...
6112225	6113266	It appeared on PartnerNet.
6113306	6114006	That's where they saw it.
6114366	6118028	PartnerNet is Xbox's little testing grounds for Xbox Live.
6118048	6120589	Well, somebody did.
6120970	6122991	So there it is, RayStorm HD.
6123151	6125031	I don't remember the first one very well.
6125592	6128873	I almost feel like I should bring it up on YouTube and look at a clip of this.
6128893	6129594	Does anyone know the game?
6129654	6130674	Jamie, do you know RayStorm?
6131635	6133676	If it has to do with, what was it, Ray Crisis?
6134876	6135617	Then I think so.
6137437	6140639	Hold on, I'm bringing up some of the gameplay here in studio so I can check this out.
6143888	6145349	Oh, this is like a fun show.
6145689	6146710	Yeah, that's exactly it.
6147530	6147910	Okay.
6148691	6149651	Fun series.
6150892	6152513	So if you schmuck fans, alright.
6152753	6153974	Ooh, the graphics look nice.
6154214	6155935	It's like major targeting.
6156055	6157856	This was an arcade game originally, wasn't it?
6158857	6163920	I don't remember, but I've got all kinds of versions of that series.
6163940	6164900	Is that a vertical game?
6165000	6166421	Because that looks like a vertical game.
6166461	6169343	The graphics are kind of rad for something this old school.
6169403	6170764	I imagine it has to be an arcade game.
6172182	6173943	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6199778	6226353	and they're calling it a 24 hour gaming marathon to fund pediatric cancer research and treatment and I guess this is taking place on October 17th of this year and they're trying to get all these sites to come together to raise money for this extra life charity and it's to raise money for pediatric cancer which sounds like a great cause honestly it's going to be 8am on October 17th and they have all these groups participating I guess Sarcastic Gamer
6227898	6232442	I've not listened to that show, but I've seen their thing on iTunes as part of this.
6233143	6235726	Destructoid is apparently on board as well.
6235846	6241351	Limit Break Radio, I guess they'll probably be doing a Final Fantasy XI marathon, wants to know if we can come on board as well.
6243454	6244035	Maybe.
6244495	6246296	I don't want to commit to something if I can't give it 100%.
6246396	6248798	But I think it's a great cause.
6249298	6252040	And I think if we don't do it ourselves, we'll have to support somebody else doing it.
6252060	6252380	But I don't know.
6252400	6253021	What do you guys think?
6253401	6255102	Gaming marathon, October 17th.
6255142	6255682	Could we do it?
6256103	6256903	Probably.
6257083	6257844	24 hours worth of games.
6258224	6261406	Obscure fucking vault games would be the theme of our marathon.
6261446	6262607	I don't think anybody else could do that.
6263945	6265086	I think that would be good.
6265246	6275997	And to keep the continuation going, we'll have different systems hooked up so that while one system's going, we can switch games to a new one and just pass the controller over so that we don't have a lull in playing.
6276037	6277559	Maybe like a new game every hour or something?
6277779	6278179	Works for me.
6278600	6280922	I want to figure it out because I don't know if we could do that here.
6281082	6282524	Sonic Adventure Marathon.
6282564	6283845	It might be too small of a space here.
6283885	6285767	We might have to do it at the... Do it in the front room.
6286682	6288583	I don't know if we can get all this stuff.
6289304	6290785	The weather should be better.
6290825	6291965	We could always go back to the garage.
6292746	6293106	We'll see.
6293586	6299050	If we do it on the big TV, though, we can actually put up a cam footage without a refresh.
6303755	6305656	Because you've seen me take pictures off of my TV.
6306176	6307556	Loki, would you be willing to do it too?
6307756	6309797	Could we do this for 24 hours?
6309817	6310217	We could do it.
6310297	6312138	I have HD capture stuff now.
6313278	6315779	So I could capture... I don't know.
6315799	6316879	We could stream it, I guess.
6317059	6317979	We'll have to figure something out.
6318159	6323001	I don't want to commit until we're 100% sure we can give it our all, but we are interested.
6323341	6328703	I think we've been talking about doing a gaming marathon for a long time, so it would be fun to get in on something like this with some other podcasts and things like that.
6329023	6331383	And certainly the cause is great.
6331784	6333244	So we want to help.
6333804	6344266	I still, though, wanted, you know, along those same lines, wanted to do a classic game segment every week, too, you know.
6344807	6346507	I think we should do nothing but classic games.
6346527	6347847	Like, we should just do obscure fucking classic games.
6347867	6348807	Well, I'm not talking about that.
6348827	6352548	I'm talking about, you know, us having a classic gaming.
6352568	6354049	Oh, like on YouTube or something?
6354209	6354849	Yeah, why not?
6354909	6355269	Might be fun.
6355865	6356145	I don't know.
6356205	6358047	If you guys have some ideas, get in touch with us.
6358107	6359468	Mailbag at Orangelandrader.com.
6359628	6362550	I'd be curious what you guys think would be fun for the marathon.
6363110	6363671	So we'll see.
6366453	6367554	So thanks for the heads up on that.
6367614	6368154	I'm not sure.
6368274	6371577	I'll have to read a little more on that website about who we contact for more information.
6371657	6374339	But if you're out there listening, please get in touch with us.
6374379	6378822	Mailbag at Orangelandrader.com because I think that could be fun.
6381537	6386842	Tweet from Actdeft to our Twitter OLR wants us to mention the Policenauts English localization.
6386882	6391446	Apparently there is a fan translation of Policenauts that was finished.
6391506	6393667	Now this game of course was out on the PlayStation 1.
6394768	6397611	It was also on the Sega Saturn and get this, the 3DO.
6398051	6400733	And what makes this game notable is that it was a Hideo Kojima game.
6401154	6401294	Hold on.
6401454	6402755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6418483	6442238	point and click game but it never came out in English but the fans got together and translated it and it's a patch that you can apply to your ROM I'm supposing of Policenauts I don't know what version it is that they patched I'm assuming it's got to be the PS1 that's probably the easiest one but there you go so if you want to check out Policenauts you can do that now
6443686	6445367	in a completely non-legit way.
6445967	6460912	Well, I mean, if you actually own the import game, and you make a copy of it, dump your own copy of it with whatever program's out there, and you patch it with this, you probably know that most people aren't going to do this, or that are downloading this are probably getting it illegally, but you know what?
6461032	6466975	The game is 13 years old, and I say, if they cared that much about it, they would have translated it to English 13 years ago.
6468115	6469336	Obviously, they don't care at this point.
6470016	6470936	Nope, they don't care.
6471336	6472837	So, there you go.
6475466	6477827	DarkSakura is digging it out of the vault right now.
6480249	6483592	And Actdeft says in chat right now that I think it's the PS1 version.
6484052	6484513	So there you go.
6485473	6486975	A couple more quick Twitter topics.
6487375	6493980	Technicolor with the three wants to know what are our thoughts on the Halo 3 ODST tour truck thing going around the country right now.
6494421	6495942	I wonder if they have one of those at the State Fair.
6495982	6497243	They had Rock Band 2 there last year.
6497645	6498185	Thanks for watching!
6518526	6538683	um play Halo 3 there there's a good impression of what Halo ODST is going to be like I mean really they haven't changed too much I mean yeah you're playing you know the Shock Trooper but and it's not the scale's been kind of dropped down a little bit but I don't know it's not like it's like night and day gameplay I think hmm
6539409	6540970	Alright, well, some more Twitter topics.
6541070	6566225	TigerClaw305 says, Blizzard is planning a pseudo-land support for StarCraft 2 and possibly Diablo 3 and links this to a story talking about, there was a quote in here I wanted to read, where the interviewer, and this is from ShackNews.com, asked the developer if they were possibly working on a solution that would be like a pseudo-land connection where the game will check in with Battle.net to authenticate and then it'll go back to acting like a land.
6566565	6568346	And they replied, something like that.
6568866	6578596	Maintaining a connection with Battle.net, I don't know if it's once or periodically, but then also having a peer-to-peer connection between players to facilitate a very low-ping, high-bandwidth connection.
6578816	6580197	Those are the things that they're working on.
6580738	6583080	So a bit of an olive branch to the community, maybe?
6583260	6583621	I don't know.
6584802	6590667	I would think this type of thing was probably always planned, but they're going to want the regular pings to Battle.net to make sure the game is legit.
6591690	6594594	You know, because if they only pinged it once, somebody would figure out a way to patch that.
6594814	6596556	They're going to figure out a way to patch it anyways.
6597197	6597738	It doesn't matter.
6598178	6606529	I think the lanners are going to have to give the concession that they're going to have to attach to Battle.net to give this game, but they'll at least not have to play through Battle.net.
6606789	6607550	Because that would suck.
6607590	6609492	If Battle.net goes down, your whole game is fucked.
6609993	6610193	Right?
6610914	6613297	So hopefully there'll be some type of concession there.
6613817	6623829	SB Hale tweets us and says, $300 PS3, definitely not an under-the-radar story, but for those of us Xbox 360 and Wii owners, do you feel there's a need to own all three consoles?
6624169	6629976	Besides the fact that the PS3 is a Blu-ray player, of course, I've yet to find a good reason why I shouldn't pick one up at that price.
6631515	6636497	Well, you know the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Lounge Radio is that a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
6636938	6642600	The interesting thing about the PlayStation though as a console is that you also have that added Blu-ray in.
6642680	6648543	So you do – I mean whether you say besides that or not, you have to factor that in a little bit to your decision.
6648983	6653145	But I think the question is really going to be does what the PlayStation 3 offer –
6655013	6659298	As far as exclusive games and things you can't get on your Xbox 360, is that what you want?
6659418	6661180	Do you want games like LittleBigPlanet?
6661220	6662101	Do you want MAG?
6662201	6667667	Do you want Final Fantasy XIV and some of these games that are PlayStation 3 exclusive?
6667988	6669409	Is that worth the $300 to you?
6669529	6671311	If so, then yeah, you gotta get one.
6671972	6674333	If not right now, then you can stand to wait a little bit.
6674733	6677034	But also don't discount the other features of the PlayStation 3.
6677274	6680055	The fact that it is a pretty good media device as well.
6680095	6682236	That it does have home, if that's something that interests you.
6682676	6689979	And the whole fact that you can have the online movie store, which has some different offerings than the Xbox 360 does.
6690019	6691660	The HD movies and all that are important to you.
6691900	6693240	I think you have to consider all of that.
6693661	6699223	But in the end, if you're getting everything that you possibly need out of gaming on your 360, then no, you don't need a PS3.
6699963	6708646	But if there's something that the PS3 offers you that you need, and I will say it's a hell of a lot quieter, then go for it.
6710307	6713969	Oh, by the way, if you don't have an HDTV though, there's no point in getting Blu-ray.
6714029	6714629	There really isn't.
6715694	6717996	But I'm assuming you probably are an HDTV owner.
6718897	6722179	And Zbunchat wants to point out Final Fantasy XIV is going to be on the PC too.
6722479	6723120	That's a good point.
6723520	6726262	So, you know, and that may be where most people want to play it.
6726923	6727503	And there we go.
6727603	6730506	DarkSakura found her copy of Policenauts on the PlayStation 1.
6731306	6731767	There it is.
6731827	6734389	I wish we had webcam in this studio but we don't.
6734489	6734749	Oh well.
6735670	6737011	But it's definitely all in Japanese.
6737791	6738712	You want to put that on the website?
6738732	6739893	The Pix Orange Lounge Radio?
6740493	6740994	Alright, there we go.
6742478	6757171	One more, and sorry if we didn't get to all the tweets tonight, but Matt Ostrovsky says, Interesting story about a company that is close to making the first PS3 mod chip.
6758513	6760575	Ooh, could a mod chip be coming soon to the PlayStation 3?
6760815	6761816	Have you heard about this, Loki?
6762418	6768323	No, but that would be a pain in the ass to burn stuff onto Blu-ray and stuff.
6768343	6772987	Blu-ray discs are really expensive and that's like almost 50 gigs of data.
6774468	6776189	Direct Boot of PS3 Original Import and Backup Games
6797245	6800028	Direct boot of PS2, originally imported back of games.
6800068	6802491	I'm assuming that means only if your console plays PS2 games.
6803252	6805574	Does multi-region Blu-rays, multi-region DVDs.
6805955	6807596	No configuration disk needed.
6807656	6810139	It's a transparent stealth operation, they call it.
6810600	6811861	No USB interface.
6812181	6812982	It's up to date.
6813423	6815004	Only 12 wires to solder.
6816005	6816326	Solder?
6816906	6817407	Sorry, solder.
6818909	6819209	Tempting.
6820711	6824674	Yeah, but still you have to solder, and what if they fix it with a patch?
6824694	6827695	You're going to be screwed because that thing's hardwired to your system.
6827876	6831578	My Wii is soldered, and it has a soldered-in mod chip.
6831818	6832578	I'm not worried about it.
6833179	6835300	Because that thing has an on-off switch, huh?
6836601	6837422	Yeah, but I don't use it.
6838202	6838822	It's always on.
6839103	6846067	I mean, they have it just in case, and it's only really had to have been updated once, and really I don't need the on-off switch on there.
6846107	6848088	That's just an optional thing you can install on there.
6849029	6849169	And
6851124	6861772	I mean, worst case scenario, if for whatever reason this decided, you know, they broke it or something, or they, you know, disabled the chip, you can always clip those wires that you soldered.
6862873	6863353	Yes, it's true.
6864154	6864954	I am interested.
6865555	6867396	Well, there's a whole thing on Twitter.
6867436	6870999	Look at the tweets to OLR, Ask SSJ100Mac, because he posted it there.
6871019	6871439	How much is it?
6872080	6872360	All right.
6874301	6874481	Huh?
6874862	6875442	I said how much is it?
6875462	6875822	I don't know.
6875842	6877624	I didn't see on that site, so check it out.
6878291	6886373	Alright, if you want to tweet us a story that's... We like stuff that's under the radar, because obviously you knew this week we were going to talk about WoW Cataclysm.
6886413	6887893	You knew we were going to talk about the PS3 Slim.
6888213	6893614	But usually the stuff that might fall off the radar, we definitely want you to bring to our attention on Twitter or any topics you want us to discuss.
6893994	6896514	Keep an eye out Sundays, a couple hours before we go live.
6896574	6897615	I usually put a shout-out on there.
6897995	6900135	Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news.
6900435	6903716	Loki, you're going to need to stop reading the tweets.
6903856	6904836	By the way, the first picture's up.
6905436	6906397	Oh, the Policenauts game?
6906877	6909219	And that's what, on OrangeLoungeRadio.com in our picture gallery, right?
6909799	6910059	Cool.
6910239	6910880	I've been waiting.
6910960	6911560	I'm ready to go.
6911620	6912901	All right, Loki, rapid fire news.
6913201	6913882	Rapid, rapid.
6914142	6924189	You may remember that Sega had a survey asking what should be the next game that they publish on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and we were, well...
6925054	6926295	Earthworm Jim won that.
6926515	6939100	However, they had to pull Earthworm Jim because, unfortunately, Interplay, at the same time, also announced that they're making a new Earthworm Jim game for PlayStation Network, WiiWare, and Xbox Live Arcade, as well as mobile platforms.
6939500	6949824	So, new Earthworm Jim coming, but there's still another Xbox Live Arcade Genesis pull, so you'll have to see who wins that, I think, currently, right now.
6951705	6953246	ToeJam & Earl is winning that one.
6955054	6961756	Um, there is a rumor that looks like Canada will be getting a new Elite Bundle.
6962156	6970657	It's going to be coming with Halo 3, and on top of that, they're also going to be throwing in a wireless network adapter, which is kind of cool.
6971338	6972718	And all that can be had for $349.99.
6972758	6973678	Um, I think that's Canadian dollars.
6973958	6974118	And, um,
6979537	6981739	Apparently, it is available.
6981919	6991026	It's actually going to be... It's available right now at The Source, which I guess is a Circuit City affiliate out of Canada.
6991527	6992968	And they have the online offer.
6992988	6994389	It's actually for $3.29.99.
6995810	6998393	And that's pretty interesting.
6999554	6999814	Wow.
7001015	7001235	Huh.
7002416	7002616	Anyways.
7003457	7003597	Um...
7006446	7009528	Guitar Hero 5 will be incompatible with World Tour.
7026289	7043115	Also, the download content for World Tour, I guess, of the 158 songs that are on World Tour and Smash Hits, you'll only be able to download 152 of those back to your console, I guess, when you're importing songs.
7043335	7051679	But, I mean, that makes sense, because Rock Band, there was like five tracks you couldn't download, or three or five tracks that you couldn't download because of licensing and stuff.
7052119	7052239	So...
7054159	7054440	Alright.
7055040	7062027	Well, by the way, the chat wants us to mention that ToeJam & Earl was the new winner of the poll once the Earthworm Jim remake was mentioned.
7063143	7064604	Diablo 3, Witch Doctor, Wizard, Monk
7084778	7099283	but Monk by the way was originally in the Hellfire expansion in the original Diablo where Barbarian, Bard, Rogue, Sorcerer and Warrior showed up so I assume there's going to be at least a couple more classes that show up in Diablo 3 although not too many because you know they got to do the expansions later on right?
7102011	7105996	Hey, the Wii and the DS are getting new Tetris games next year.
7106737	7110241	That's right, it's a partnership between Majesco and Tetris Online.
7111062	7113524	They'll be coming out on the Wii and the DS in the spring of 2010.
7115547	7118931	No idea what the Tetris game is going to be like, but you know what?
7118971	7120332	Tetris DS was pretty badass.
7120352	7121714	I don't know if we necessarily need another one.
7124284	7124545	Oh well.
7125586	7128832	Eye of Judgment is making its way to the PSP.
7128953	7131477	That was announced at Gamescom this week.
7131618	7135364	You will get basically a version of Eye of Judgment, but of course there is no eye.
7137930	7139170	And that's why there's no bet.
7139270	7144331	There's still a lot of questions as to whether this will use the same cards or what have you.
7144671	7145932	We just know the game is coming out.
7146252	7148492	And Loki says it will not count towards the bet.
7148532	7149072	Why not, Loki?
7149132	7152533	The reason why it won't count towards the bet is because it's not as ridiculous as the Eye of Judgment.
7152573	7159094	The Eye of Judgment is an actual physical card game that you had to play using the PlayStation 9 camera.
7159134	7162795	Basically, it was the camera in the game portion of it.
7163188	7164829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7193570	7194330	It's not so sorry.
7208601	7209701	I mean, it doesn't matter.
7209861	7216024	Even if I did add the Eye of Judgment to the bed or whatever, it still wouldn't meet a million units.
7217144	7219185	I'm not going to do that because it's just stupid.
7219245	7221485	We need to move on.
7222646	7224926	We need to find a new cause and a new outfit.
7226207	7226687	Exactly.
7227587	7230028	Alright, DarkSakura, do you have some rapid fire news for us tonight?
7230228	7231069	I do indeed.
7233231	7238113	Actually, Midway Europe is now Trade West Games.
7238153	7241514	They were purchased.
7241894	7245215	So that's actually gone through.
7245935	7247336	It's being fully rebranded.
7248216	7255278	Also, LittleBigPlanet is getting a re-release with 18 new levels and 7 download content packs.
7256159	7256699	Pretty cool, huh?
7257339	7257539	Yeah.
7258106	7260567	I remember when Tradewest, by the way, did Double Dragon back in the day.
7260607	7262227	They were a big 8-bit developer.
7262447	7266128	I don't know if it's the same company, but I just remember that name.
7266809	7275671	Well, the LittleBigPlanet packs are going to be the Metal Gear Solid level pack featuring the Paintinator.
7276631	7281793	Metal Gear Solid costumes, monster costumes, monster packs, history costumes, history pack, and animal costumes.
7282284	7283085	Probs to a Media Molecule
7301843	7331054	well and since we've had some discussion about Hideo Kojima he actually has said that he finds Metal Gear Solid series very puzzling too which is why he keeps detailed timelines for all of the characters in the game he says and I quote this is especially tricky when you create the future first and then go back in time to create something new there are a lot of small aspects where sometimes it doesn't match completely sounds like
7331394	7333016	Marvel Comics, or Star Trek.
7333477	7333977	Seriously.
7334298	7335740	Well, yeah, but they fixed all that with the movie.
7337982	7339204	Not the newer canon.
7339504	7340005	Just saying.
7341086	7344050	By the way, one other thing I wanted to mention, though, was the whole...
7346470	7347571	LittleBigPlanet stuff.
7349631	7350492	I forgot what I was going to say.
7351252	7351632	Forget it.
7353173	7354673	The water level is coming out soon.
7355093	7356314	There's something I wanted to say about that.
7356714	7361355	It's real water now, so you can actually make real water levels and that kind of stuff.
7363356	7365757	One more comment from chat.
7366357	7372199	Amazatsuma on the whole Tingle bet says, We will move on once we see Loki dresses Tingle.
7372299	7373199	Am I right, Penelope?
7374471	7376033	I renamed them back to OL Army.
7376414	7376915	Oh, fine.
7377796	7379678	However, they were balls for a little while.
7380580	7381882	You had your opportunity.
7382142	7385026	I can't help it if you can't come through with your end of the bargain.
7385186	7386508	So, you know what?
7386768	7387349	It's just like...
7388188	7417392	I don't know, I make bets that I know I'm going to win for example, there was somebody one of my customers was betting me on the top grossing game this year and he said that he bet that Wii Sports Resort was going to be the top grossing game not only was he cocky about it but he said that it would beat out anything the number 2 one by 2 million units and he also said so my guess of course was Modern Warfare 2 because you're a fucking idiot if you think Wii Sports Resort is going to sell that many units
7418132	7421493	And he's like, fine, I'll give you Modern Warfare 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
7421733	7424213	I'm like, you are so stupid.
7425053	7426154	But okay, I'll take that bet.
7429534	7430675	I will win that bet as well.
7431435	7432035	What is the bet?
7432795	7438916	We haven't figured it out yet what the actual prize of the bet will be, but he's so confident that he's going to win that he'll probably do something stupid.
7439056	7441717	So I just have to wait for him to act on it.
7442639	7443499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7462549	7472641	Okay, well, there's apparently an achievement that was discovered for the new game Fairytale Fights, where you get some points for killing 1,000 children.
7475386	7477168	That's going to go over well.
7477228	7479729	I don't know, I think they should keep it.
7500845	7501446	because that'd be funny.
7501586	7507291	So it's kind of one of those things that's lulzy for now, you know, in their little development, but probably won't actually get out there.
7507731	7507931	Yeah.
7509232	7509773	Boy, oh boy.
7509793	7510574	Oh, shoot, your pizza.
7511134	7512315	Can you imagine if it really did?
7512335	7515638	Your pizza's burnt.
7515658	7516699	DarkSakura burned my pizza.
7517139	7517820	I was smelling it.
7517840	7518881	It smelled nice and toasty.
7518941	7519501	I know, it does smell.
7521063	7521503	Oh, no.
7521583	7522384	Is it really, like, crispy?
7522424	7524466	I kind of want to see it, but we're trying to do a radio show.
7524726	7526688	Can you do a monologue, Loki, while I go look at the burnt pizza?
7526888	7527949	I'm going to do a monologue.
7529837	7534720	I don't know.
7535640	7539582	But they're investigating a burnt pizza as if you haven't seen a burnt pizza before.
7539622	7541043	It's just black and crispier!
7543144	7543444	I don't know.
7545526	7550047	So yes, going back to the bet, there is no way that I'm going to add Eye of Judgment PSP to it.
7550407	7554008	Even though I am confident if I did, that it wouldn't matter.
7554848	7556108	But see, that's the problem though.
7556188	7558869	Once we add Eye of Judgment PSP, then where does it stop?
7559189	7562009	I'm just going to have to keep adding games until you eventually win.
7562329	7563930	And who really wants to play that way?
7563970	7564730	That's not a bet.
7565070	7566890	You should have won the first bet in the first place.
7568891	7571491	Why is everybody so curious about the burnt pizza?
7574852	7575312	They're weird.
7577612	7581840	Anyways, um... Alright, alright.
7583342	7588892	No, I'm making her upload a picture of it to the pictures blog at orangemonstrator.com so you can see the fail.
7590779	7591139	DarkSakura.com
7620202	7621543	I'm getting yelled at from the kitchen.
7621903	7623704	Technically, it's aluminum alloy.
7624265	7625646	I thought it was aluminum.
7626586	7627727	Because you're so British.
7630469	7632751	God, I wish our microphone would pick up the yelling from the kitchen.
7633231	7635632	I just literally heard screaming, I'm not British!
7636133	7640756	And Deathwishing says in chatroom, there's an achievement on Dirt 2 called Two Girls, One Cup.
7640816	7642257	It's actually Two Cups, One Girl.
7642757	7646720	It's about winning two cups in the game with one female driver.
7648891	7649572	Let me move on.
7649592	7649932	I'm sorry.
7649952	7654577	I'm getting into another story that doesn't involve burnt food or what have you now that the whole house smells like crispy.
7655758	7659161	And I'm eyeing the taco on a silver platter that I want to devour.
7661403	7664146	Independent Xbox Live game has been banned.
7664246	7664627	Why?
7664707	7667950	Because of visual sexual assault reminders.
7668471	7670773	It's a game called And Yet I Love You.
7672856	7674396	I can't even hear what she's saying.
7674416	7676717	Well, she's not on the radio, so we're just ignoring her.
7676737	7678777	If you don't have a mic, I can't hear you!
7680598	7681998	That's bad radio etiquette.
7682678	7683699	Terrible radio etiquette.
7684099	7686999	Alright, it was on the Japanese marketplace.
7687019	7688960	It was pulled because it was too erotic.
7689360	7691620	It was an independent developer, Naoki Sagawa.
7691640	7693861	I wonder if that's related to the DDR Naoki.
7693941	7694541	No, probably not.
7695341	7696541	There is no sex in it.
7696922	7698222	It is not an adult game.
7699198	7706989	However, apparently there were visual reminders of sexual assault because in one scene, the girl's hands are restrained.
7708071	7712056	In one scene, a girl is being pushed down and her panties are visible.
7713268	7714550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7733030	7733570	And there it was.
7733730	7735191	It was kicked away.
7735571	7740292	Now what's interesting is that I'm reading this story on Kotaku here and they make a very good point.
7740772	7749214	And they say, by the way, while this is acceptable, you have Dead or Alive where you punch and kick females and you can see their panties pretty well.
7750754	7755795	You need to take a picture of the taco on a silver platter and put that on the blog too because that's pretty amazing what Becky did there.
7757075	7757496	There you go.
7759336	7759556	All right.
7761600	7762462	DarkSakura needs a moment.
7776755	7778935	DarkSakura needs freaking food real bad.
7780296	7782496	I feel bad about the pizza, although, you know.
7782616	7783716	Your pizza's bacon.
7784216	7784676	Yay.
7786117	7790757	So, Sony has to make some explanations.
7790797	7792438	They got some explaining to do.
7794938	7805940	When they removed the backwards compatibility from the Slim, they needed to say what exactly was going on.
7807322	7815188	So they say, and this is a quote from John Kohler, who's SCEA's Director of Marketing.
7816749	7831681	Now that we're at a point where we're three years into the life cycle of the PS3, there are so many PS3 disc-based games that are available that we think, and notice this from our research, that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3 cite PS3 games as a primary reason.
7832241	7834663	So basically they're saying, oh, people don't care about PS2 anymore.
7836564	7837164	What do you think?
7837664	7838004	Chat?
7838584	7839445	People in studio?
7840805	7841385	Are they right?
7841585	7843265	Do people not care about PS2 anymore?
7844085	7850227	Or as Ray Iannami in chat says, and I love this, backwards compatibility is so last gen.
7850667	7852367	Referencing an old OLR reference.
7852927	7853227	I don't know.
7853247	7854047	What do you think, Loki?
7854107	7854607	Are they right?
7855708	7856488	No, they're not right.
7856708	7862889	It's just they're basically saying, why the hell would we give you a feature for free when you can buy our PlayStation 2 system for $100?
7864810	7885909	Or soon to be Playstation 2 downloadable titles I bet you that is what you're going to see in the next year Then they're going to start releasing the Playstation 2 as downloadable titles Just to fuck us all But we can't add backwards compatibility Butch, we can sure as hell emulate these titles perfectly We know software emulation is out there We know it's possible They just don't want to give it to us Yep Lame
7887526	7909801	and yes I do kind of want backwards compatibility I mean yes I realize the games are old but I still have them and who doesn't sit there once in a while and go you know I kind of want to play Magic Pen Gel and draw a giant penis you know it's sometimes we get these desires to play the old PS2 games or Final Fantasy 12 I never did beat yes I have a PlayStation 2 that I could go back and hook up if I really wanted to but that's valuable shelf space
7910831	7911771	Thanks for watching!
7933052	7947074	I am sending updated pictures of my tacos by the way I love how we have the food blog going on I posted a link in chat but it's on orangelaundry.com and you'll be able to see all these pictures if you're listening on the podcast but you probably don't care
7949798	7950418	Alright, anyhow.
7951099	7951439	I don't know.
7951659	7959024	I think it's a little silly of them to rid us of the backwards compatibility, especially when software emulation, at least of some titles, has been done.
7959724	7963746	It's a little bit frustrating, but whatever.
7963887	7967389	I mean, yeah, true, I can hook up the PS2 if I really want to play them that bad.
7967969	7974393	I'm just saying I would be more apt to still buying PlayStation 2 games if they would play... I haven't bought a PS2 game since Final Fantasy XII.
7974413	7975654	That was the last one I ever bought.
7975674	7976474	Yeah.
7977715	7977835	Well...
7978390	7981171	They'll be happy to sell them to you as a digital download later on.
7984993	7995217	Well, with the announcement of the PlayStation Network minis, of course, Nintendo is looking to revamp its DSiWare service to kind of combat it.
7996097	8002580	And what they're planning on doing, although the pricing won't change on the actual downloads, they'll basically stick to the $2, $5, $9 price models.
8004941	8008783	They will have a lower barrier to entry for publishers.
8009643	8013985	And also, they're going to have some size limits as well.
8014485	8018606	Including, for example, a $5 game must be under 200MB.
8019127	8022248	Otherwise, Nintendo will charge a higher royalty.
8024089	8028470	Which, that doesn't seem like much of an advantage, but okay.
8029271	8029411	And...
8032153	8032493	I don't know.
8032913	8035794	I just think they need some better games on there.
8036874	8042376	I know from seeing a lot of reviews I've been reading, you know, for different things, I always see reviews for clocks and calculators.
8042436	8045937	And honestly, I don't need more fucking clocks and calculators.
8046157	8048638	I don't need a clock or calculator on my DSi.
8049378	8050659	The DSi has a clock.
8051059	8052199	At least I know the regular DS.
8052239	8056140	I don't have a DSi, but at least the regular DS has a clock.
8056320	8056560	Yes.
8056900	8057081	Yeah.
8057861	8059661	So, I don't get it.
8060021	8061182	It's themed clocks.
8061622	8061922	Silly.
8064076	8065538	We don't need more clocks or calculators.
8069142	8072726	What does Nintendo need on DSiWare in order for people to pay attention?
8073467	8074088	Virtual console.
8076691	8077112	Really?
8078634	8081057	That would... People would be eating that crap up.
8081197	8081477	Okay?
8081737	8082158	Seriously.
8083604	8089045	I guess, but I would just be frustrated because you know they're not going to let me just carry over the virtual console games I already have.
8089085	8090085	I'd have to re-buy them.
8090485	8092326	And I don't think I'd be... Homie, don't play that.
8092486	8095066	I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be... Your chair broke.
8095146	8096746	Did the chair just break live on air?
8096766	8096846	Oops.
8098107	8098407	Uh-oh.
8099267	8100187	That can't be good.
8102087	8102668	Oh, it just popped off.
8102688	8104948	Oh, popped off.
8104968	8105228	No, it broke.
8105248	8105828	Ah, shoddy chair.
8108309	8108749	Oh, dear.
8109029	8110049	Tonight's show is...
8112435	8112856	Footstool?
8112876	8114699	Yes, it's not the footstool.
8122421	8127284	Poor Loki, we need to get... I almost bought an inflatable chair with my Dave and Buster's tickets.
8127464	8127864	No!
8128024	8131446	It's a hot pink inflatable chair with a pair of lips on it.
8131806	8135108	And now I'm thinking we need one for the studio for Loki.
8135128	8136529	I'm going to pick up a folding chair next week.
8136889	8141391	Did you know, in the old studio at my house... So they want a picture of Bork Chair.
8142132	8142352	No.
8142532	8143693	The couch is now gone.
8144313	8145794	The ex came and took your couch away.
8147215	8148175	I'm glad our studio's here.
8149356	8151717	Anyhow, sorry.
8153277	8154458	Random show is very random.
8154718	8156558	Hey, Grin, remember them?
8156598	8159160	Well, Grin turned into Frown because they had to close last week.
8159620	8163121	And that was because... Yes, Grin frowned because they got closed.
8163601	8164562	And we shouldn't laugh, though.
8164582	8165042	That's not nice.
8165362	8168123	But apparently, they were the ones behind the Bionic Commando game.
8168143	8169944	And we didn't end up reporting this on our show last week.
8169984	8171365	I mean, it was just kind of a busy show, I guess.
8171705	8172745	But they actually closed.
8172765	8176107	They were the ones that were behind Bionic Commando, which was...
8176667	8177768	Thank you for watching.
8177788	8178528	See you next time.
8191954	8192955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8214295	8214615	Regulate!
8214655	8214916	Regulate!
8241308	8242608	Do not anger, DarkSakura.
8242648	8244889	No, you act like a fucking child in the chatroom.
8244969	8246630	I'm gonna treat you like a freaking child.
8246770	8248070	Do not taunt, HappyFunBall.
8248690	8250471	This is not a democracy.
8251271	8252392	This is a cheerocracy.
8255553	8257933	No, this is a freaking fashion... Becky got the reference.
8257973	8259434	Did you hear the lull in the background?
8259474	8259834	Thank you.
8261855	8262115	Alright.
8262835	8265416	It's a DarkSakurosity.
8267116	8269257	Alright, speaking of DarkSakurosity...
8270959	8271539	Dear Rob, fuck you.
8271579	8271899	Love, Jamie.
8295697	8297178	Dear Jamie, fuck you back.
8297398	8297978	Love, Rob.
8298138	8299099	Oh baby, oh baby.
8300039	8300359	Anyway.
8300960	8303981	Hey guys!
8305202	8305582	Hi!
8306982	8308583	This summer has exhausted me.
8308923	8309684	Are you spent?
8310524	8315507	Between the summer of Arcade PSN and the two Monkey Island games that have been released, I am worn out.
8317127	8317808	Need a cigarette?
8318508	8319368	Just kidding, no smoke.
8320209	8324131	I just got into the Champions Online beta and let me tell you, they're doing it all wrong.
8325362	8330345	There's some real good qualities in that game, but it will take a lot to fix things if they want to attract people to the game.
8330485	8335268	Then again, with an offer that includes a spot in the Star Trek beta, I don't think they need to.
8336548	8338429	Okay, I feel I need to ask a question now.
8339010	8341351	What three games are you looking forward to next month, if any?
8341451	8344713	I'm waiting on Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Scribblenauts, and Beatles Rock Band.
8346154	8347074	Keep what you're doing, guys.
8347294	8347655	Peace!
8347895	8348875	And that's from Dan Jetto.
8352372	8353173	I held the microphone away.
8353673	8354374	Hi, Dan Shadow.
8355055	8355855	Dude, I'm totally waiting.
8355875	8358057	I totally, totally want Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
8358717	8362280	Except it's a freaking stupid Civil War crap, and I hate the Civil War crap.
8363481	8367464	Um, Scribbledots, I'm also looking forward to, um... You make Abraham Lincoln cry.
8368645	8368885	What?
8370026	8370807	Oh, shut up.
8370927	8374029	It's the Marvel Civil War crap that they did that I got so sick of.
8375330	8377672	They could at least do, like, the Skrull War or something.
8378072	8378833	The Secret Invasion.
8379550	8382877	To answer the question for me, Ion, I'm looking forward to.
8383758	8386524	Beatles Rock Band is a good example of something else I'm looking forward to.
8387285	8388087	That'll be very cool.
8388648	8388769	And...
8390513	8390893	I don't know.
8390953	8394415	Everything's kind of a blur for Christmas and a lot of the stuff I was interested in got pushed back to 2010.
8395855	8397316	So I'm not sure.
8397356	8398956	Those are definitely the two at the top of my list.
8399917	8401957	It depends on if I get my 360 fix soon or not.
8402518	8402798	Loki?
8403158	8403978	Games you're looking forward to?
8404078	8404838	Any planned purchases?
8405739	8406339	DJ Hero.
8407159	8408320	Oh, that would be number three for me.
8408360	8409220	I definitely have to check that out.
8409660	8410020	Good call.
8410721	8412441	I thought that was October for some reason, not September.
8412721	8413302	It is October.
8413562	8413662	Oh.
8414202	8414402	Sorry.
8414722	8416123	But it's almost September, so we can count it.
8416143	8416403	Good enough.
8416443	8416843	Close enough.
8417223	8418304	September, I don't really have anything.
8418324	8419384	He'll take that answer and he'll like it.
8419785	8422246	September, I don't really have anything I'm looking for.
8422526	8427048	Scribblenauts, I guess, would be kind of cool, but I probably won't be buying that.
8427788	8428069	I don't know.
8428089	8428789	I may be buying that.
8429169	8431690	Amkara222 in chat says Final Fantasy XIV.
8431950	8433071	I don't think that'll be out next month.
8434372	8434832	Keep talking.
8434892	8435452	I'm still eating.
8435512	8438313	We'd be lucky if the beta would come out next month, but I somehow sadly doubt it.
8440936	8441276	There you go.
8441757	8444738	Alright, we're going to get to the next email as soon as DarkSakura finishes chewing.
8445099	8447740	But a mailbag at Orange Entree.
8447800	8448901	I am so stealing a chip.
8449441	8451203	And I just want you, I'm going to dare you to stop me.
8451683	8453024	Oh, is the pizza still cooking?
8455093	8457616	Hey, OLR Crew, what do you think of Bethesda's Wet?
8458317	8459158	It actually looks kind of pretty.
8459878	8460919	This game looks really interesting.
8460940	8464544	I like the fact that it infuses a sort of kung fu game, a shooter, and a 3D fighter.
8465324	8467427	What did you guys see of it at E3?
8467507	8469189	Thanks in advance, I like old people.
8469789	8472032	Oh, and P.S., it puts the lotion in the basket.
8474054	8474955	Or else he gets the hose again.
8477355	8477675	Let's see.
8480097	8482339	I saw a little bit of it, and it looked cool.
8482579	8487763	I think Bethesda has a very good way of putting style on a lot of their games, unless it was the Star Trek game.
8489365	8491666	But every time I hear Bethesda, I'm always like, where's Oblivion 5?
8492067	8492587	Where's Oblivion 5?
8492927	8494409	Or I should say, sorry, Elder Scrolls 5.
8495069	8495670	Where's Elder Scrolls 5?
8497111	8498792	They're working on it.
8498992	8501174	I still need to go back and get the Call of Cthulhu game.
8501294	8501855	What now?
8502875	8504777	Because I still want to play the Call of Cthulhu game.
8505208	8512950	Wet looked cool, but it didn't seem like the type of game I would probably drop $60 on just because, you know, I like roleplaying and different styles of games.
8514591	8515351	Is there a demo out there?
8515371	8519792	Oh, Henderson Man says the demo for Wet is on the European PlayStation Network store and I thought the demo was awesome.
8520173	8520813	So go check it out.
8521573	8521873	I will.
8522113	8523094	Write us a review of it.
8523514	8524014	Yes, please.
8524154	8525554	I'm curious to know more about it.
8525754	8528235	I have a profile for every region, so I can do that.
8528295	8528615	Woohoo!
8529355	8529776	Next email.
8531356	8531836	Next email.
8531856	8532596	These chips are tasty.
8532856	8533077	Okay.
8533657	8534237	From J-Rod.
8538066	8540467	Hey guys, I had something to speak up about.
8540588	8545250	I had two Xbox 360s and both of them ended up dying multiple times.
8545910	8551293	After I sent them back to be repaired, they eventually died again and I ended up getting a PS3 in the end.
8551613	8553854	Rob said that his 360 just died as well.
8554395	8555575	Now here's what I don't understand.
8556536	8563780	Why did Rob complain about customers giving Microsoft a free pass for faulty hardware and then in the same breath say, well, I'm probably just going to pick up an Elite?
8565200	8571121	The product was rushed to market to beat Sony to the punch and it couldn't be more obvious that they took shortcuts and screwed the customer to do so.
8571681	8574402	So this type of behavior is now somewhat rewarded.
8575382	8581623	Just because all my friends have one doesn't mean I need to give Microsoft my time and money for absolute shit hardware quality.
8582323	8589024	The problem is that people use Xbox Live as a MySpace page rather than a game console half the time.
8589625	8591185	So they just keep buying new ones over and over.
8592305	8595366	The only time a company will learn is if you tell them with your wallet.
8596207	8600468	Send it back, and if they don't repair it, then scrap it, sell the games, and move on.
8600869	8605951	I hate to say it, but if Rob buys another Xbox 360, he's basically just part of their problem he's complaining about.
8606331	8611853	My current 360 is on its last leg with lockups, and if it dies, out the door it goes to eBay along with my games.
8612774	8613194	Excuse me.
8614134	8615975	Don't be a part of the problem, Rob, be a part of the solution.
8616635	8618276	I absolutely disagree with you.
8620363	8623165	I think it's just the viewpoint's a little too extreme for me.
8623345	8624186	I get what he's saying.
8624286	8626908	And I said earlier in the show, it was wrong of me.
8627008	8627368	You're right.
8627448	8629950	If I buy an elite system, I'll meet you at that point.
8630170	8634833	If I buy an elite system, I'm rewarding Microsoft for borking my old system.
8635313	8638756	So I came to my realization about that earlier this week.
8639256	8644399	If I get another Xbox 360, which assuming Loki can't fix mine, I'm going to have to go for the low-end system.
8644500	8646021	So I see you there.
8646821	8647563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8654042	8662185	You're smoking crack if you think that I'm going to sell all of my games back that I've invested hundreds of dollars in for a fraction of the cost.
8662665	8677670	And therein lies the problem, and therein lies where I'm screwed, is that because I have invested all this money not just in that but on downloadable content, and some of which does not exist on the PlayStation 3, that yes, I do like to revisit on a regular basis.
8678150	8679811	I have to have the hardware to make it work.
8680931	8681572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8699029	8709676	I still do think, and I think most people agree with me, no matter if you think I was being a baby last week or what, no matter where, I think everybody kind of agrees with me that Microsoft does need to be held accountable for this.
8710157	8714039	And history needs to show this negatively on Microsoft.
8714080	8717202	When the next console comes out, the question needs to be asked.
8717802	8720283	Have you tested this so that half of them do not fail?
8721064	8730729	And somebody at Microsoft needs to go on record and assure the public that when and if the consoles fail, there will be a program in place to do something about it.
8731609	8737592	I'll tell you, though, what I'm going to do if this Xbox Red rings, because I think I'm on my third.
8739733	8743075	But also keep in mind, we can just go to the store and Dan can get a new one.
8743155	8743255	So...
8745976	8774171	but I really think that well I don't know I'd still be in warranty so technically I'd get a new one for free but regardless I would still take the time to write a letter and say you know hey I still enjoy my games I own more in games than I own in the cost of the three systems so to me it's a justified expense you know it'd be like
8775191	8776732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8806474	8814678	I just, at the end of the day though, I do think it's bull that clearly the Xbox 60 fails more than any other piece of hardware we've ever seen.
8816679	8817780	Atari 7800.
8819280	8820341	In the last 15 years.
8821602	8827344	The Atari 7800 had issues with the power supply and they failed almost as much as the Xbox 360.
8828305	8828585	Alright.
8829906	8830726	Any more in the mailbag?
8832207	8832507	Oh yeah.
8834168	8834268	Um
8836192	8840064	Hey OLR, I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real.
8840124	8841067	Oh, we already covered this.
8843960	8854384	Hey OLR, I wanted to tell you that the PS3 Slim is real and will be coming out the first of next month and the original PS3 will drop $100.
8854444	8856985	I already saw the box at GameStop.
8857005	8860206	My friend works there and showed me inside where the consoles are.
8861146	8866788	Also, the Xbox 360 price will be going down after Project Natal is released.
8867228	8867528	P.S.
8867868	8869769	What is with these women having no bras anymore?
8871181	8876725	Don't get me wrong, I love tits, but when someone 50 years older than you does not have a bra on, I barf.
8880088	8883770	I think we should just let the emailers report on the news from now on.
8883790	8884551	Who did this?
8884651	8885011	Juan?
8885031	8886092	Juan.
8886833	8889535	Oh my god, this is the same Juan that emailed us before, I bet, huh?
8889975	8890215	I think.
8890916	8892797	He needs a segment on this program one way or another.
8893818	8894919	What is up with that?
8896680	8897841	He's like our new extrovert.
8900267	8902030	You want a slice of your pizza, DarkSakura?
8902070	8902331	Yes, I do.
8902491	8902872	Okay, hold on.
8902892	8903553	Give me a cheesy piece.
8904955	8906358	I will let you pick whatever piece you want.
8907380	8907620	All right.
8908462	8909563	How many more emails do we have tonight?
8909583	8910165	This one, a few.
8910545	8911146	A few, all right.
8911307	8912809	I put this one in the name of science.
8912969	8913510	Make it snappy.
8915456	8917237	Shook here, or is it Shookay?
8917277	8918678	I never was told.
8919358	8926163	Last week, I sent an email about my Final Fantasy X dilemma, and your advice worked.
8927303	8929144	Ooh, oh yeah, you had the bigot dad.
8929505	8930165	Sorry, no offense.
8935368	8937149	Oh yeah, your dad was the asshole.
8937229	8938030	Oh sorry, no offense.
8940605	8948612	I'm not in the habit of talking ill of other people's parents, but really, the way that you portrayed your dad made him look to be a major bigot.
8948773	8953497	But if I were to start with one, you are the winner.
8954505	8959712	Anyway, I just sold Madden 04, 05, and 06 for about $40 to a privately owned game store.
8960072	8962535	I bought Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger and I'm loving both.
8962575	8964558	I think Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever.
8965058	8965379	Yes!
8965919	8972327	And when you beat it, go back and actually hop on the teleport device right at the beginning of the game and you can beat Lavos from the beginning and get the...
8974509	8977550	I'm sitting here in awe that he got that much for those old-ass Madden games.
8978190	8978770	Props to you.
8979210	8983731	Well, my dad walked in on me during the opening scene with Blitzball when he asked what it was.
8983811	8987231	I made up something and said it was Super Soccer Extreme 2000 and he bought it.
8990912	8994573	Again, my huge thanks for the advice.
8994673	8994893	P.S.
8994913	8997453	DarkSakura, my username is pronounced as if the K was silent.
8997593	8998193	Oh, sorry.
8999053	8999953	So it's shoe.
9001874	9001894	K.
9005391	9012879	I ran across this crap accidentally coming to a PS3 near you, LittleBigPlanetWater
9025875	9032498	There's a link and it looks like Sackboy will swim, materials that float will float, and Sackboy will have a hold-your-breath limit of air.
9033058	9037740	And I'm hoping they will give him scuba gear, the water equivalent of the untethered backpack.
9038760	9041061	So, yeah, we talked about that.
9041101	9042822	There's a video of creation mode on here.
9044762	9045623	So, that's kind of cool.
9046303	9050345	I can't wait to see how this gives a swift kick in the pants to all the user-generated levels.
9050425	9051605	And I agree with Robaba.
9052185	9053326	Sorry, I have a mouthful of pizza.
9053726	9053926	Um...
9055785	9084877	I agree with Rababa that it would be awesome if there was like a scuba gear or something like that because that means you can make these levels that were nothing but floating and do you know how much that's going to increase the amount of clone games we see like space shooters and stuff amazing they're going to reduce space shooters it'll be easier with the water thing I think with the water though you are going to get limited air supply and that type of stuff that's going to work into it but what if there's a scuba gear like Rababa suggests I think that's a great idea yeah there will be that
9086783	9090846	Well, there's also another email from him.
9090906	9096852	I just noticed a recent post on NeoFM.com about that old project.
9097032	9100915	It's not really an update, but some smart cookie converted it to Pump It Up.
9101456	9103597	Both are five-panel games in the arcade.
9104758	9113040	It's at the Game Zone at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in the Great... Is it pronounced Olathe or Lathy?
9113580	9114001	Kansas?
9115141	9115821	Anyway, somewhere in Kansas.
9115841	9116221	That's great.
9118562	9130625	But there's details in the article at NeoFM.com And then the other... And yes, I do remember this dancing game.
9130665	9134106	This is the one that was going to look like a Beatmania controller, but it was with feet.
9134591	9136412	Yeah.
9136432	9137353	It was low-worthy.
9138153	9139234	And they have video of it.
9140274	9140595	Interesting.
9140835	9141395	In Kansas?
9142916	9144097	Yeah, it's... How random.
9146218	9153742	It's from... Well, Neon FM and a pump-it-up machine and... Well, because the whole thing runs off Stepmania.
9153982	9157204	I'm saying we should send Shane to go look, but he won't care.
9158805	9159245	I know he won't.
9159565	9161006	Oh, I got something for him, thanks to Becky.
9161507	9161867	What's that?
9163288	9163888	Let me get it.
9165910	9166510	He'll love it.
9166951	9168851	We should send it to him and autograph it and everything.
9170652	9172393	He wouldn't care about our autographs.
9172853	9175034	He probably already has that, but you never know.
9175394	9178175	Okay, well then, I'll do something with it.
9179396	9183057	Okay, OLR listeners, who wants a copy of High School Musical 3?
9183097	9183718	Do not want.
9183758	9184858	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
9185398	9187339	Let us know and you'll get it.
9188320	9190521	Because nobody in this room wants it.
9191001	9193662	Or nobody in the hall either, else it would not be in my house.
9195572	9195992	No, I'm sure.
9196993	9197293	Ask him.
9197313	9197934	He may not have it.
9198254	9200256	He may not have bought it for whatever reason.
9200276	9205400	Yeah, actually, it says there's apparently the code leaked out for Neon FM.
9206641	9217490	Meanwhile, some cool cats managed to get their hands on two separate leaks of our code and put them in a centrifuge with some fairy dust and in the groove pumping up Linux code.
9217910	9221813	They're pumping up machines to a local arcade Neon FM 2009 machine.
9223803	9228965	By the way, their stuff leaked out to the internet a while ago in Stepmania format.
9229105	9230185	I have it, but eh.
9234527	9235527	Look how much of it I've eaten.
9235568	9236228	It's good stuff.
9236868	9237208	I like it.
9238429	9239369	Except it's making me fat.
9240810	9242550	Alright, any other emails tonight?
9244571	9245051	Um, no.
9247887	9254811	It's time to get angsty, and I don't really have a good story to lead us into this tonight, but what would the show be without the FUs of the week?
9264758	9272443	You know, I actually did have a story to lead us into that.
9273643	9274544	You want to tell us real fast?
9275154	9286012	Yeah, well I mentioned it earlier, GameStop saying GameStop expects a UMD dump by new PSP Go owners since obviously Sony's not supporting them
9286893	9295420	Tony Bartel, the GameStop EVP of Merchandising and Marketing said, we have a very clear roadmap on how we can drive profitability on sales of games.
9295561	9308291	It will also be a strong contribution in our trade-in process when you have people that will have UMD games and they will no longer work on the platform and they'll fuel additional currency for GameStop!
9308932	9309572	Halo GameStop.
9311314	9313576	That's it.
9313596	9314797	DarkSakura, your angst then.
9316835	9326380	I had surgery again on Friday for him to pull out the rest of the suture, and what happened is that the suture was in a knot, which is why it wouldn't come out.
9327220	9327360	Ew.
9327600	9329501	It had been knotted up inside my hand.
9330382	9332943	And so when it got tugged on, of course, ow!
9333423	9334204	So, um, yeah.
9335310	9336371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9361072	9362974	But you've known Dan for like nine on top of that, right?
9363274	9365155	We've been together for 11 and a half years.
9366016	9366256	Nice.
9367037	9368178	Loki, any angst for you tonight?
9369559	9371861	Um, eh, not really.
9371981	9375063	I guess I have to wait for my arcade cabinet to come in.
9375083	9378466	I have to wait another four weeks, basically.
9379406	9382189	And, um, yeah, that just sucks.
9382629	9384891	But, um, no, that's all I got.
9386645	9394396	My FU of the week... I've had a really, really shitty week, so I just want to say FU to people that want to play political games and...
9396348	9398209	All that crap when I'm just not down with it.
9398609	9399009	You know what?
9399489	9401190	I am a professional individual.
9401510	9405611	I go to places to get a job done, and I'm not interested in playing games.
9405971	9407092	So I will get my job done.
9408152	9421016	Also, an F you to the fact that when I'm having these bad days, the person I want to turn to to talk about these things about is absent with better things to do, I suppose.
9422077	9422877	I've not had a good week.
9424045	9425386	I'm going to go home and cry into my pillow.
9425526	9427008	We're going to get ice cream after the show again.
9427788	9430411	We've got to finish in the next hour because Baskin Robbins closes at 10.
9430871	9431912	So step on it.
9432012	9432953	We'll get you pie later.
9434415	9436477	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9458799	9475747	Abbey Road will be arriving first on October 20th at the price of $16.98, or 1,360 Microsoft points, with each individual track running you $2, or 160 Microsoft points.
9476507	9476787	Sgt.
9476807	9486051	Pepper's Lingling Hearts Club Band will come out in November, and I guess also the next album after that will be Rubber Soul, and that will arrive in December.
9487032	9487552	And, um...
9488760	9490241	Lots of tracks coming out, man.
9490261	9493043	They've got uber tracks.
9493464	9499789	And what's going to be kind of cool about that, though, I'm assuming, is that each one's going to have the different animations in the background.
9500129	9502511	So some of those songs actually would be kind of cool to see.
9504493	9507295	I'm really kind of considering maybe buying this.
9507435	9507855	I don't know.
9507975	9509957	Because I don't really play a lot of rock band lately.
9511918	9512579	But it might be fun.
9512779	9513119	I don't know.
9513940	9514801	I like some of these songs.
9515101	9516302	I think I'm totally going to have it.
9518544	9524769	I'm so mad my Xbox crapped out right before a song I really wanted to play had come out and I didn't get a chance to play it.
9524949	9533596	Here's the thing I have a little problem about, and I'm kind of confused in this sense, because some of these songs I thought were already in the game.
9533776	9538540	Remember how they were showing us different songs like Octopus's Garden and stuff like that?
9541562	9544024	I thought that was already in the game.
9545393	9549375	But for some reason, it's listed on the Abbey Road download content here.
9549856	9556280	Well, it might also be that when you download the album, you're kind of getting the rest of the album, because I think every album has some representation in the game.
9556940	9557941	So, I don't know.
9558461	9558741	Maybe.
9558761	9562243	I guess maybe they're just listing what's on the album, not actual download content.
9562283	9573370	That could be, because if these people said to the website, like, hey, we're releasing these albums, the website probably just went to Amazon.com and just wrote out the track list without thinking, oh, this song's probably in the game already.
9573690	9574130	You know what I mean?
9574150	9574311	Yeah.
9575411	9575931	That makes sense.
9576331	9586294	And apparently, I guess, the All You Need Is Love download content, which is going to be a single, will be available as a timed exclusive on Xbox 360 and the game's launch is September 9th.
9586974	9593996	And then also, if you purchase a full Abbey Road album, you'll have the option to play the B-side melody, or B-side medley, I'm sorry, from...
9595932	9617437	you'll never get me your money through the end as one continuous trek I may not be the biggest Beatles fan in the world and you know I'm just I'm a cool Beatles are cool I respect that you know that people are in love with them I understand why they have such a place in history and so forth but I'm actually like really excited about this game like it just it just looks so cool it's fun to watch and play yeah
9618515	9619056	Other stuff.
9619676	9626442	This week on the Rock Band Store, they're going to have Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and Jet.
9627703	9630406	Individual songs, of course, from Billy Idol.
9630426	9631426	Please say it's Cradle of Love.
9632287	9632407	No.
9633408	9633828	White Wedding.
9633848	9635190	That's already in there.
9635870	9637552	It's Money, Money, Money.
9638232	9638973	and Rebel Yell.
9639693	9640594	Oh, Rebel Yell's cool.
9640714	9640994	Okay.
9641174	9644017	And each of those are available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2.
9644757	9648440	Fleetwood Mac, you have Don't Stop and World Turning.
9649761	9653163	Don't stop thinking about tomorrow, baby.
9653704	9655425	I should sing the Rock Band songs every week.
9655605	9657567	And Jet, you have She's a Genius.
9659992	9663717	Tom Petty, I Won't Back Down, and Running Down a Dream
9673936	9674977	And then, of course, the Wii.
9675577	9677138	You've got lots of stuff coming there.
9677158	9680559	A lot of it just previously released stuff on other things.
9680579	9682480	You have a lot of tracks from Grateful Dead.
9682901	9686623	Foo Fighters, Dropkick Murphy, White Zombie, that kind of stuff.
9687503	9689864	Those will all be available for 200 Wii Points each.
9690104	9691185	And those will be available on the 25th.
9691205	9700910	And then, finally, on the PSP, you're getting two things of download content on the 27th, including the Zombies, She's Not There, and White Zombie, Black Sunshine.
9701330	9701970	Each available for $2.00.
9703354	9710560	And finally, Rock Band's download content is expected to hit 1,000 tracks by the holiday.
9711400	9728534	And there's going to be some new tracks, of course, coming from Queen, Nirvana, Tom Petty, which we got some this week, Elton John, Iggy Pop, The White Stripes, Pantera, Talking Heads, Korn, and The Raccoon Tears.
9728834	9729594	What do you have from Iggy Pop?
9730757	9734040	As well as... I don't think they've given any songs yet, just bands.
9734080	9735301	No, they're just listing stuff.
9735801	9738344	As well as many more from other artists.
9738504	9739745	But hey, that's kind of cool.
9740125	9741666	I know, like Elton John, Queen.
9742307	9742947	Need I say more?
9743048	9744369	I need to get SingStar Queen, by the way.
9744469	9745470	That is out and about.
9746010	9746731	Oh, need.
9746831	9747992	I'm waiting for the price drop.
9748012	9751675	Because you know, once the game's out a month, it'll be in the clearance bin for $19.99.
9751715	9752435	That's what I'm waiting for.
9754737	9755218	And that's it.
9756232	9758053	Sweet, that was a lot of rock band news.
9758333	9761555	They are busy bees over there considering there was no Rock Band 3 this year.
9762095	9763476	500 tracks a year, that's not bad.
9763576	9764217	Good lord.
9764237	9767018	A lot more than certain other music franchises.
9767118	9767659	Apparently.
9769163	9775529	Hey, Gran Turismo 5 is the last story we have tonight before we get to the phone lines a little later on.
9776009	9781354	Apparently, this was being shown off at Gamescom, not just Gran Turismo 5, but Gran Turismo PSP.
9781994	9785957	There's some images of the game that have leaked out to the internet, and of course, they're pretty.
9787419	9789781	The main menu looks like what you see in... I like how you said that.
9790081	9790361	What?
9790401	9790901	Pretty.
9791202	9791982	It is pretty.
9792042	9792723	Look, it's pretty.
9793424	9795705	Grand Theft... I always want to say Grand Theft Auto 5.
9795866	9797227	It's Gran Turismo 5.
9797527	9799308	Because GT... I just want to put the A in there.
9799689	9802951	GT5 Prologue uses that same kind of menu.
9804192	9804733	So there you go.
9805213	9813199	There's going to be 80 tracks in the game, 1,000 cars, 830 regular ones, and 170 with a little more modeling.
9813639	9817782	Damage will be in the game, and GTTV is back.
9818603	9820644	And it can also be run on your PSP.
9821065	9823587	No release date yet, which you know what that means, 2010.
9823647	9827029	It's been a long time.
9827049	9830372	Considering we got that prologue quite some time ago, that's a long wait.
9831132	9832013	That's a very long wait.
9834047	9835828	Very cool if you're a fan of Gran Turismo.
9836008	9840390	I am not as big on the Gran Turismo series because I like my arcade racers.
9840830	9842431	Gran Turismo is a little too realistic for me.
9842631	9844192	It's more like Project Gotham and stuff.
9844992	9845713	It's not that I hate them.
9845733	9848094	I think they're pretty to watch other people play that are good at it.
9848755	9849735	I'm just really bad at them.
9850776	9851316	So there you go.
9852745	9854226	Hey, it's your turn to give us a call.
9854246	9856008	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9856088	9857889	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9857909	9860411	The Skype line is open right now.
9860431	9867817	We're only going to take a couple calls tonight, but we want to also get any last-minute stories that might be out there while we wait for folks to call.
9868897	9869158	Yes.
9870038	9870339	Why not?
9870919	9871239	Go ahead.
9871259	9872260	DarkSakura, you have something?
9872280	9872740	I like pie.
9874562	9879846	And to think that I was going to let you go ahead and go first, that teaches me.
9881178	9886722	Anyways, UK is getting a pretty cool deal with Guitar Hero 5 purchases.
9887103	9890465	Much like how we're getting the free Van Halen over here.
9890966	9897030	Folks that purchase Guitar Hero 5 in the UK will be eligible to get a free copy of Guitar Hero World Tour.
9898371	9900853	That's more songs and probably a better selection.
9900953	9901614	It's something.
9901974	9902755	Hey, we've got a call.
9902815	9903756	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9903776	9904116	Who's this?
9905457	9906898	It's Death Wishing.
9907038	9908299	Hey, Death Wishing.
9908359	9908699	What's up?
9909953	9916999	I don't know if they check ID or anything I mean, I don't have ID I don't have a driver's license yet in California to make you pay up the ass to get one
9938743	9940464	Well, it is a mature rated game.
9941846	9951573	Yeah, but, uh, it's, you know, I just find it really lame because it's just like, it's a mature rated game and yet we're all going to get our hands on it.
9951593	9955577	There's going to be like eight year old kids going, oh my god, I pawn you, noob.
9957158	9957879	T-bag.
9958379	9959720	That's because parents suck.
9960781	9961642	Hey, my parents were cool.
9961662	9965685	I was playing Grand Theft Auto back then and look at me, I grew up to be perfectly fine.
9968294	9971215	Are there individuals out there that might debate that comment, Deathwishing?
9973675	9976496	That one Californian politician who got banned.
9979917	9980757	If you know who he is.
9981317	9981677	No idea.
9982137	9984498	But did you go to the tour?
9984538	9985638	Are you planning on going to the tour?
9985678	9986798	I'm planning on going to it.
9986878	9989359	I'm going to try to talk my friend into taking me down to Pasadena.
9989579	9993700	But I don't see any coming near you guys, sadly.
9994880	9995360	I'm not sad.
9996226	9997888	Hey, it's pretty cool.
9997908	9998689	You get free stuff.
9998729	10000472	I think you get T-shirts and stuff for doing it.
10000832	10001233	Whoopee.
10001453	10002554	I'm not that big on Halo.
10002654	10005919	I understand why people love their Halo.
10006399	10010785	I used to play Halo 2 all the time with my college friends, but now I'm kind of over it.
10011298	10016401	And Rob, about your 360, I don't see why yours is broken down so much.
10016841	10019822	I'm on my second, but my first one still works.
10020503	10021163	It still works.
10021263	10024685	I just have to close the tray in, like open and close it to get games to work.
10024705	10027987	And I'm letting my friend use it because his blew up, like literally exploded.
10028227	10028607	Wow.
10029768	10030368	That's impressive.
10031616	10047766	The Amazing Exploding 360s I call mine the Jesus Box Because it won't die It just keeps resurrecting It does We're going to let you go so we can get as many calls as we can tonight And still have time for ice cream But thanks so much for the call, okay?
10048106	10057973	Bye I should ask him if he's going to the Silent Hill house Because I still want to go I think we're just going to have to go We're just going to have to get in the car and go
10058823	10058963	Fun.
10059023	10059343	Um, let me...
10088460	10090001	I'm gonna get my headset.
10090161	10090982	Ironic!
10091482	10093904	DS Master on a PSP.
10094845	10096526	Ah, whatever.
10096906	10100409	Basically, I'm here to do a review of a new game.
10100849	10101049	Yes.
10102350	10104271	Poppin' Music for Wii.
10105292	10108675	Oh, you played Poppin' Music for Wii and you don't sound happy about it.
10108735	10110156	Please tell us all about this game.
10111697	10113498	It's complete crap.
10113914	10120095	I've been a long time B-Money fan and this has done great disgrace to the series.
10120215	10125656	Okay, I need to know the reason why it's crap and I need to know how it's different from the poppin' music as B-Money fans know.
10126736	10131857	Basically, it's all, you know what they did with the DDR games and throwing those in the crapper?
10132457	10140699	Well, it's all licensed stuff like Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus stuff into poppin'.
10141435	10143056	and there's no controller with it.
10143116	10152280	You just use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck like you would on, oh, let me see here, Rayman Raving Rabbids in the dancing section.
10153041	10154341	That's pretty much how it's played.
10154781	10156102	It's complete crap.
10160244	10162485	Well, that's too bad.
10165306	10168708	Ray Ayanami in chat is asking, no Konami originals?
10171119	10172300	Very few, if any.
10172360	10177303	Like, they tried to put in a revamped B4U song in there somehow.
10177963	10183606	And then something out of... Like, it sounds like out of... I don't know if you heard this cartoon.
10183666	10185828	Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi?
10186168	10190930	That came out... Oh, actually, Puffy's an actual pop band in Japan.
10192571	10197274	Yeah, and... I think one of their songs ended up somewhere on the game.
10197314	10200616	I don't remember which one it was, but... Um...
10201656	10202737	Those complete cred.
10202797	10204438	It was one of the DLC tracks.
10204918	10209362	I mean, that's one thing this one has that all the others didn't have was DLC.
10209422	10219529	I mean, yeah, I'm glad they're finally getting to the next gen and DLC to their music games, but at the same time, Konami's just disappointing the Beemani fans left and right.
10223792	10229456	And, by the way, just to let you know, that line you quoted...
10230040	10231601	It's straight off one of my favorite series.
10231981	10232561	Bring It On.
10234822	10236603	Only the best movie of all time.
10238124	10238824	Period.
10238924	10242526	Yes, and they just got a fifth one, and I have a review on that.
10242686	10243827	It is awesome.
10245228	10246968	They have a fifth Bring It On movie now?
10246988	10247989	I've only ever seen the first one.
10248009	10249310	They have way too many Bring It On movies.
10249630	10252191	I said, brr, it's cold in here.
10252231	10252771	All right, forget it.
10253172	10253472	Anyhow.
10254112	10255433	All right, we're letting you go, DS Masters.
10255473	10256513	We need to get some more calls.
10256553	10257834	Go watch Bring It On on your PSP.
10259926	10268525	No, no, no, but basically, I heard rumors of possibly that the choreographer from Thatch,
10269292	10274636	is doing a second All-Star Cheer Camp game or whatever for Wii.
10274716	10275196	Yes, they are.
10275276	10276317	Which I've actually played it.
10276617	10280659	It does give you a workout twice as much as Wii Fit will ever give you.
10280840	10281520	Okay, great, bye.
10281880	10284882	I guess he didn't hear the part where he said I was letting him go.
10284942	10286123	He just kept talking.
10287304	10289865	It's important that we know about All-Star Cheer Camp, though.
10290566	10291086	Poor guy.
10291126	10292027	I was so rude to him.
10292087	10292947	I hope he hears this.
10292967	10293868	You're horrible, Rob.
10294328	10295229	Horrible human being.
10296138	10296698	Well, I didn't.
10296738	10300079	Did I not say, okay, we gotta wrap up to get some more calls?
10300119	10301280	He wasn't done yet, okay?
10301340	10302320	That's just wrong.
10302920	10303080	Rob.
10303120	10304761	He was talking about choreography.
10304821	10305181	Rob.
10305301	10305581	What?
10305661	10305881	Rob.
10306341	10306601	Rob.
10306921	10307161	Rob.
10307421	10307641	Rob.
10308062	10308302	Rob.
10308502	10308802	What?
10309142	10309362	Rob.
10311123	10311863	Ah, crap!
10314284	10316984	Alright.
10317004	10320245	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10320986	10322106	Give us a call if you want to talk.
10323484	10326446	Our number is 555-4444.
10329327	10329807	It's not really.
10329867	10331508	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10332209	10333849	Since it's not ringing, I'm going to give it two more minutes.
10333869	10335490	If you don't call, we'll get over, Clint.
10335770	10336331	Oh, here we go.
10336531	10336931	Last call.
10337711	10338672	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10338692	10339012	Who's this?
10340073	10340973	Hi, this is Actdeft.
10341253	10341814	Hi, Actdeft.
10341854	10342254	What's on your mind?
10342274	10342334	Woo!
10344187	10345528	First of all, sorry about your 360.
10345888	10348149	I'm definitely sorry it happened.
10348169	10350150	Dude, I don't know why you're blaming yourself.
10350290	10353071	The damn thing was obviously going to break eventually.
10353531	10356252	At least I went down in a blaze of glory.
10357493	10358213	Yeah, that's true.
10359393	10360654	I'm just joking, man.
10361114	10363695	Though I am sorry about the thing breaking.
10365256	10366616	I blame Microsoft, not you.
10367397	10367917	What's on your mind?
10369661	10375025	I wanted to talk about the digital download thing you were talking about at the beginning of the show.
10375145	10375445	Yes.
10378447	10391255	I think I made a comment in chat, or in Penelope, that most people have a really good connection to internet.
10391816	10395258	Like me, I don't have a really good connection.
10395318	10398680	I have only one megabyte per second.
10399775	10400495	DarkSakura.com
10426690	10427570	Thank you for watching!
10442677	10444458	I mean, I know you've called in this show.
10444678	10447920	You live in Mexico, and I know you've talked about sometimes coming up to the U.S.
10447960	10451341	to get games or having them shipped down here or down to you or what have you.
10451801	10456083	Imagine if with this digital distribution stuff, they could just say, oh, block Mexico.
10456123	10457024	It's not their time yet.
10457224	10459305	We have to wait until we get the localized version for them.
10459365	10462807	So we're just going to block their IP so that they can't get the game.
10464047	10464527	That would suck.
10464548	10466969	Yeah, like it happened with Patapon 2.
10467569	10469710	It's only a digital download.
10470319	10471119	in the United States.
10471239	10476401	Though, Sony made a good decision and they brought the UMD over here.
10478902	10488725	So maybe if they do that in the future, if you can have the digital download or you can have the disc, you have the option that maybe it could work better.
10489185	10493706	But if you only have one option and it's the digital download, it won't work.
10494267	10495287	It definitely won't work.
10495569	10498811	I like it when our callers get us to think about things that we didn't think about before.
10498831	10499292	I don't like thinking.
10523379	10523739	It's horrible.
10523759	10524179	Well, too bad.
10524259	10526520	Think about some other last minute stories while I close up Skype.
10526540	10530721	If you didn't get through, hey, you can always tweet us, email us, chat with us.
10531401	10532681	Or buy me a pony.
10533742	10534482	Or buy Jamie.
10534522	10535582	Guess what I saw yesterday, Jamie?
10535682	10536062	A pony?
10536162	10536962	Derby Owners Club.
10537682	10537923	Where?
10538083	10538663	Where's the doc?
10540043	10540643	Dave and Buster's.
10540803	10541223	Milpitas.
10541443	10541803	Still.
10542144	10543284	Ooh.
10543564	10545844	I love the horsey racing games.
10545924	10546545	I'm kind of over it.
10546585	10548005	They needed a sequel about five years ago.
10549202	10554724	Hey, there's a new game coming to the PS3 called 3D Dot Game Heroes.
10555224	10558605	It's basically kind of a 3D version of pixel art.
10559706	10565708	If you were to take like an old school Final Fantasy game and make it all 3D and high res, that's what the game would look like.
10565828	10566368	It's kind of cool.
10566928	10569689	And that should be coming out in Japan this November.
10570290	10574211	No word on it coming over to the US, but I only hope it does because that would be awesome.
10576121	10598734	Um, Castle Crashers is getting new download content in the Necromantic, um, pack, and that will feature some really cool, um, things, including a chainsaw, a golden mace, a dragon head animal orb, and also, um, two new characters, the Necromancer and the cult minion you'll get to play as.
10599074	10600335	So, all that available.
10600955	10604397	Uh, no word on what the, uh, cost or when it's coming, but, um,
10605711	10608053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10635936	10639538	Groove is in the heart Groove is in the heart
10661684	10664866	This might be the secret title that they were developing.
10665247	10666027	Hope not!
10666948	10668689	It looks like crap.
10669370	10670951	I hope it's not.
10672472	10674994	Konami is apparently location testing Poppin' Music 18.
10675314	10676855	That's right.
10678596	10683880	The new mix, I believe, was... God, I just had it too.
10683900	10683940	Uh...
10691395	10692296	I forgot the name.
10693097	10693878	And I can't find it.
10694278	10695139	Anyways, Pop Music 18.
10695579	10696540	We don't even know the subtitle.
10696640	10697200	It's not important.
10699382	10708730	But apparently they're going to be conducting that starting, actually it was last week, starting August 20th at AMPIA at Kangawa Prefecture.
10709771	10711512	And that's going to run from the 20th to the 30th.
10712072	10716316	And then at Rundown at the Fukuoka
10717186	10723409	and Fukuoka Prefecture from the 21st to the 30th.
10723869	10724649	So you can check that out.
10724910	10737235	They have more information on the location test site which is konami.jp slash am slash location test slash poppin18 So check that out if you live in Japan.
10739252	10757578	and then let's see here Modern Warfare 2 of course I have talked about in the past about how Activision is trying to rip people off with the price of Guitar Hero 5 on the Wii no one seems to give a shit but now that you know it's available on PC apparently they are trying to raise the price of the PC version as well
10758058	10762462	GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy are now showing the PC version with a $60 price tag.
10762902	10772430	Now, that may not be a big deal for people that normally buy console games, but for PC owners, most games only retail at $50 retail.
10775912	10782077	See, I told you they were evil, and no one believed me, but now that it's a more important game, people might listen.
10782438	10782618	Wow.
10784599	10793363	Namco Bandai is releasing a new game on the PlayStation Portable in December called Queen's Blade Spiral Chaos.
10799653	10805095	Queensblade apparently is a, they call it a Lost World style combat picture book game.
10805915	10812557	And features characters with large boobies.
10814157	10814617	Sweet.
10815538	10818579	Like, to the point that it's absolutely ridiculous.
10819579	10819819	I mean...
10821109	10822550	That's absolutely ridiculous.
10823150	10825531	That's how I try to make my character an ion with boobies that big.
10827511	10831873	So that should be coming out this fall on PSP in Japan.
10833714	10834014	Alright.
10835234	10840536	That's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but first we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10841417	10842517	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10843858	10844258	Boobies.
10845151	10847693	My final thought is ice cream, then boobies.
10848553	10855418	Loki, I get my arcade hardware tomorrow, but it's no good right now because I don't have an arcade machine to play it on.
10856118	10861782	But I get to stare at it and caress it and boobies.
10865510	10868333	Hey, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our show tonight.
10868373	10870055	We really appreciate it.
10871237	10872599	Oh, Tiger Claus reminded me.
10872639	10878667	I forgot to mention the StarCraft II thing I was going to mention about the chick from Battlestar Galactica is voicing Kerrigan.
10879408	10880108	Trisha Helfer.
10880789	10881110	Six.
10882351	10882632	Hot.
10884403	10885665	I have an excuse to watch it.
10902099	10902419	All right.
10903540	10908603	And so enjoy your Battlestar Galactica, kids, until next week because we'll be back next week to do it all over again.
10908663	10912445	Hey, if you enjoyed the show, be sure to tell two friends about the show.
10912765	10917108	Leave us a nice review on iTunes or just tell people about the show.
10917168	10925132	Word of mouth is what sells the show and helps us spread around because, remember, we don't have a big magazine behind us or anything like that.
10926553	10927154	That's gonna do it.
10927294	10928195	We'll see you next week.
10928555	10932199	We'll be back to do it all over again on another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
10932279	10932639	Good night!
10949435	10951940	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
