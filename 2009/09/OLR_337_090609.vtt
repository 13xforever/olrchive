00:00.000 --> 00:19.760
Today, September 6th, 2009, a once-pay-wee channel goes free, a new racing game will

00:19.760 --> 00:29.800
be integrating Twitter, and we recap and talk about the news from PAX 2009.

00:29.800 --> 00:35.160
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week here of

00:35.160 --> 00:39.760
Orange Lounge Radio. We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming,

00:39.760 --> 00:46.600
gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We tape live every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.360
A big thanks to our friends at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.320
I'm here with you for the next three hours. My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always,

00:54.320 --> 00:58.240
for the past seven and a half years, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

00:58.240 --> 01:03.120
Jamie Summers. Nom, nom, nom. Nom, nom, nom. How are you? Nomming. Okay, quickly,

01:03.120 --> 01:07.920
Orange Lounge Fudio, what are you nomming on tonight? Brains. Shut up. Pizza. Pizza.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.000
With extra garlic. It's a cheese pizza, but I added garlic to it because garlic makes

01:12.000 --> 01:16.360
everything better. It will keep the vampires away. Awesome. Also, joining us tonight,

01:16.360 --> 01:19.840
say hello to the one and only Loki. Hello. Loki, you look like you're listening to

01:19.840 --> 01:23.640
something else over there. I'm trying to, but I hate these, like, earbud headphones.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.560
What are you, uh, any hints on what you, is this cage match for later, or what is it? Yeah,

01:27.560 --> 01:31.080
because I didn't pick anything. I see. Per usual. All right, and if you don't know what

01:31.080 --> 01:33.760
I'm talking about, that's because you've never tuned in live before. We do a little,

01:33.760 --> 01:36.960
little special thing after the show. You'll have to tune in live sometime. I'm hoping,

01:36.960 --> 01:40.720
because it's Labor Day, maybe we get some people listening live that haven't listened before. So,

01:40.720 --> 01:47.720
a big hello to all of you, uh, that are new to us broadcasting live. Be sure to join our chat room,

01:47.720 --> 01:53.160
chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and we will read, uh, some comments from chat, and, uh, comment

01:53.160 --> 01:58.000
from the Rob D in chat, uh, early this evening. You know it's PAX weekend when Orange Lounge is

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
talking old DDR, and AllGames.com is discussing condom reviews. I guess the AllGames chat is

02:03.000 --> 02:09.160
talking about, uh, condoms. So, uh, way to be mature. No, I'm... Please, like, I should be

02:09.160 --> 02:13.120
judging on that, uh, part. Um, we're completely immature here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'm

02:13.120 --> 02:18.360
glad the Rob D brought up PAX, because it is Penny Arcade Week, uh, Penny Arcade Expo Weekend.

02:18.360 --> 02:23.880
Sadly, the three of us could not go this year. We all went last year, but we kinda ate the money

02:23.880 --> 02:30.040
in the budget for E3. But, our dear friend, Bobby Blackwolf, is live at the show. We're gonna call

02:30.040 --> 02:36.360
him right now, and talk to him about Penny Arcade Expo. One ringy dingy dingy.

02:36.360 --> 02:40.280
Farid Exterminators.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.360
Hi, Bobby.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.440
Hey, Bob. Hey, Rob. What's up, guys?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.960
Not much. How are you doing?

02:45.960 --> 02:50.840
Doing good. It's, uh, been a long weekend, but I've had a lot of fun here.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.000
Alright, Bobby Blackwolf, of course. I need to give you a proper introduction. He is the man who

02:55.000 --> 03:00.560
takes the Bobby Blackwolf show live at five o'clock right before we are live. He sadly was

03:00.560 --> 03:05.480
not live tonight, but he did have a sneak peek of the rock band Beatles that he got a little early

03:05.480 --> 03:08.640
from Harmonix. So, uh, props to you, Blackwolf.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.120
And, by the way, it's the Beatles rock band. They are very strict on that.

03:13.120 --> 03:18.480
Oh. Oh, well, I am sorry. The Beatles rock band. I'm sorry. Beatles first. How dare I?

03:18.480 --> 03:22.320
Of course, the Beatles always first. Alright, well, Bobby, let's talk about it. If they want to hear

03:22.320 --> 03:28.480
Beatles rock band, they can download that show. Bobby, let's talk about PAX. How was it? Did you have fun?

03:28.480 --> 03:34.240
I had fun. And, I mean, I kind of did kind of what you guys did at E3. We did not do any appointments.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.400
We did not set any interviews. So, we were able to just kind of go around and spend as much or as

03:38.400 --> 03:45.520
little time as we wanted. And, but, for those of us who did go to E3, there's a lot here that was

03:45.520 --> 03:51.360
repeated and regurgitated. A lot of the same E3 builds, the E3 demos were here on the show floor.

03:51.360 --> 03:56.640
But, it was nice to see regular folk get a chance at the same things that we saw a couple months ago.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.920
So, it was a lot of fun to see their reactions, see what they thought about it.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.280
You know, I kind of had a feeling that what happened is that you'd see at Penny Arcade Expo

04:03.280 --> 04:07.680
kind of a lot of the same stuff that you saw at E3. And, let's not forget Blizzcon because, you know,

04:07.680 --> 04:12.320
Blizzard showed up at PAX. They didn't go to E3, but brought mini Blizzcon with them a little bit.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.920
What was, did you see anything interesting to you that you did not see at E3? Some new things?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.320
Well, one of them I saw was Star Trek Online.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.520
Oh snap. You know I want the details on this.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.920
So, you know, I played through one of their episodes, like they did any episode type of thing

04:31.920 --> 04:36.960
where you start off in your ship and you kind of fly around and they say you get a distress call.

04:36.960 --> 04:42.560
So, you go and you fight some Klingon birds of prey in the ship combat, and then you beam down

04:42.560 --> 04:46.960
to the planet, which was kind of like the city on the edge of forever, and the Klingons are trying

04:46.960 --> 04:53.440
to take over the forever. And so, you had to defend it and then talk to it, and that was kind

04:53.440 --> 04:57.360
of the end of the mission. But, it kind of showed, you know, the combat and stuff, and it's another

04:57.360 --> 05:01.200
one of those MMOs where, you know, you press one to do this attack and two to do this attack.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.080
But, they really captured the Star Trek feel, especially in the HUD a lot.

05:06.080 --> 05:11.200
So, I'm looking forward to it. There is a closed beta that you can sign up for on their website.

05:11.200 --> 05:15.120
You didn't have to be just attacked to get it. So, I encourage people to go to their website

05:15.120 --> 05:17.360
and sign up for that closed beta if they're interested in it.

05:17.360 --> 05:17.920
I did.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.040
Yes, and we'll be giving more details on that a little later on in the show. I think that's one

05:21.040 --> 05:25.120
of our stories coming up a little later. But, my question about Star Trek Online, was it fun?

05:27.200 --> 05:31.840
It was fun, the little bit that they showed, but they even said that, you know, this was a very

05:31.840 --> 05:37.760
small episode. What they're basically doing, their missions are scheduled to be kind of like 45

05:37.760 --> 05:41.760
minutes to an hour, and they're calling them episodes. They're hiring Star Trek writers.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.480
Oh, nice.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.000
So, they were basically just showing the combat portion, but they said there's going to be

05:46.000 --> 05:50.880
puzzles and other things to do that aren't, you know, just fight, fight, fight. But, here at PAX,

05:50.880 --> 05:55.280
they were just showing the fighting. But, it was fun. It was kind of a nice little taste.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.320
But, they said it's going to be in 45 minutes to one hour chunks, just like an episode instance

06:00.320 --> 06:03.840
for up to five people. So, it could be a lot of fun.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.680
It's interesting. It sounds like they borrowed some ideas from WoW, which I guess are kind of

06:07.680 --> 06:11.920
general MMO things anyway, but the whole like, you know, one, two, three combat and the instances of

06:11.920 --> 06:16.800
five people. Kind of interesting. Anything else on the show floor that caught your attention that

06:16.800 --> 06:18.160
didn't catch at E3?

06:19.520 --> 06:26.160
Well, I actually got to play Heavy Rain this time around, which I missed at E3. And, it was kind of

06:26.160 --> 06:31.200
interesting watching, like, going through the line of people and basically Heavy Rain. It reminds me

06:31.200 --> 06:35.520
a lot of Shenmue. Like, I really didn't understand or get what Heavy Rain was, but it's basically,

06:35.520 --> 06:40.240
you know, quick time action sequences along with tank driving in terms of moving your character.

06:40.960 --> 06:50.880
But, it's basically, there's a gunpoint heist in a grocery store or a quickie mark. And, basically,

06:50.880 --> 06:56.160
you can actually determine how it ends up. And, the guy before me actually convinced the guy to

06:56.160 --> 07:02.640
leave the store. And, I had to punch him in the face. But, it was a very interesting mechanic and

07:02.640 --> 07:08.240
just interesting the way that it went down. And, it's not a game. I, you know, I haven't seen this

07:08.240 --> 07:12.720
kind of gameplay all that much in terms of a whole game. I've seen it in, like, minigames and, like,

07:12.720 --> 07:18.480
God of War and, you know, and Shenmue and things like that. But, it's going to be kind of interesting

07:18.480 --> 07:22.160
to see how this game really turns out longer than a five-minute demo.

07:22.160 --> 07:27.360
All right. Well, we're monitoring our chat room at chat.orangeontrader.com. We're getting some

07:27.360 --> 07:31.600
questions for you, Bobby. Act Def wants to know about Scribblenauts. Did you go to the Scribblenauts

07:31.600 --> 07:36.800
panel? Was it there on the show floor? I did not go to the panel, but they were once again on the

07:36.800 --> 07:41.600
corner of the show floor where they belong, apparently. But, they brought this kiosk and

07:41.600 --> 07:49.520
the lines were long the entire time. But, I actually did talk to them and even talked to some

07:49.520 --> 07:54.880
of the developers. And, for people who've listened to my show for a long time, know that when I went

07:54.880 --> 08:01.840
to GDC in 2007, one of the student competition IGF winners I interviewed with a group that made

08:01.840 --> 08:06.880
a game called Toblo. And, during that interview, I was apparently, I met up with the guy that I

08:06.880 --> 08:11.520
interviewed then. He said I was one of the three people that wanted to talk to them at GDC.

08:11.520 --> 08:17.120
And, they thought it was really cool. And, apparently, I announced their first game,

08:17.120 --> 08:21.440
Drawn to Life, because he had talked about it on our show, gave us a rundown,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.680
well before they had even done any kind of formal announcements or anything like that.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.040
And, he didn't get in trouble. But, it was kind of neat to hear him talk about it and how he

08:29.040 --> 08:36.960
remembered me. And, it was kind of cool to talk to them. And, I did get to play one level, just

08:36.960 --> 08:40.640
getting one of the stars. But, that was about all I could do because it was near the end of the show

08:40.640 --> 08:44.720
and the lines were just so long the entire show. Right. What a turnaround from E3 because we walked

08:44.720 --> 08:50.240
right up to the kiosk at E3. So, apparently, word of mouth is spreading. Yeah. Well, they've been

08:50.240 --> 08:53.680
very happy with all the coverage and surprised. They didn't think they would get the kind of

08:53.680 --> 08:59.360
coverage that they got. And so, they came a little bit more prepared this time, like WB,

08:59.360 --> 09:04.000
their little booth. They were showing Fear II and Scribblenauts. And, that's it. And, they had

09:04.000 --> 09:09.680
six Scribblenauts kiosks and two K kiosks for Fear II or a Fear thing or something. Fear II or what.

09:09.680 --> 09:15.200
Yeah. Why would they show Fear II? It's been out forever now. I don't know. Well, it was a Fear

09:15.200 --> 09:19.040
something. I didn't look at it because Scribblenauts was next to it. Maybe it was a new platform.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.360
There might be a new expansion or something. Yeah. Bobby, what about others? Oh, go ahead.

09:24.560 --> 09:29.440
No. There were some games that were already out, like Metroid Prime, the trilogy was in Nintendo's

09:29.440 --> 09:33.120
booth. And, it's already out in stores. But, they were bribing people with t-shirts if they came up

09:33.120 --> 09:38.640
and played it. So, there was some stuff that's already out. Bobby, let me ask you about other

09:38.640 --> 09:42.560
live events going on at the show, like panels, concerts. I don't know if you got to do any of

09:42.560 --> 09:46.400
those. I know last year when we all went, we didn't do a whole lot of those because we were

09:46.400 --> 09:50.800
broadcasting, but since you didn't have that this year, did you get to experience a lot outside of

09:50.800 --> 09:56.960
the show for any of the events? No, because I was able to get into a lot of the parties,

09:56.960 --> 10:02.080
a lot of the company parties. So, I didn't really get into any of the panels or anything. But,

10:02.080 --> 10:07.120
I mean, I'm very happy because I've been a fan of Paul and Storm and Jonathan Colton for a long

10:07.120 --> 10:11.280
time. And, you know, they're coming to Rock Band this week. That's the PAX Pack. And, I've actually

10:11.280 --> 10:14.640
referenced Paul and Storm several times on the show. Every time I reference myself as an opening

10:14.640 --> 10:20.160
band, that's the song that's going to be in Rock Band 2. So, once again, we're showcasing

10:20.720 --> 10:24.880
artists that people are going to know very soon. Very cool. And, you know, it's interesting. I

10:24.880 --> 10:29.360
heard at the Rock Band panel, they actually were putting together one of Jonathan Colton's songs

10:29.360 --> 10:33.360
in the new indie development, the Rock Band Network, which I guess is a pretty cool thing

10:33.360 --> 10:37.920
to experience. So, well, okay then, if you went to parties, what can you tell us about some of

10:37.920 --> 10:45.120
the parties that were going on? CPP people are freaky. That was probably the most hilarious one,

10:45.120 --> 10:49.120
just because it's not my scene. CPP bought White Wolf, which is World of Darkness,

10:49.120 --> 10:53.360
and they did, usually at Dragon Con, they do the Succubus Club, which is at like this

10:53.360 --> 10:58.800
golf night club or whatever. And, you know, just a lot of weird things happen from that scene.

10:58.800 --> 11:03.840
I think we got an invite to something like that in E3. Let's have pictures of that.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.760
Yeah, there's probably pictures of it. I mean, we saw, like, when I was there, it was just,

11:09.760 --> 11:14.560
the comedy was great, where they had a guy doing, like, this whole routine with a lightsaber,

11:15.920 --> 11:20.000
techno music, and actually the techno music was actually going with, he was timing the

11:20.000 --> 11:26.960
lightsaber moves with the bass and stuff. And, you know, seeing people use iPhones as glow sticks,

11:26.960 --> 11:33.680
because they didn't have the wrong, you know, I mean, the glow stick app's pretty funny.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.600
Yeah, they weren't even doing that. They just had, like, the screen on, the home screen on,

11:37.600 --> 11:42.320
and they were just waving them around. Nice. Very nice. Well, Bobby, before we let you go,

11:42.320 --> 11:45.920
because I know you want to get a flight and all that fun stuff, I want to know, like,

11:45.920 --> 11:50.080
what was the best thing about PAX, and what was the worst thing about PAX?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.720
The best thing about PAX is that it started, and the worst thing is that it ended.

11:54.720 --> 12:01.600
That's a tricky response. All right, how did it compare to E3 this year?

12:03.440 --> 12:06.960
Well, see, you can't really compare it to E3. I mean, basically, I can actually compare

12:06.960 --> 12:12.720
PAX to last year. There were 70,000 people here. All the badges were sold out. You know,

12:12.720 --> 12:16.160
my girlfriend actually bought a badge. She thought she was coming out, and she didn't,

12:16.160 --> 12:19.680
and she wound up being able to sell it for 170 bucks. So I thought it was going to be very

12:19.680 --> 12:25.440
crowded. I say I thought, but the difference between PAX with 70,000 people and, say, E3

12:25.440 --> 12:33.520
2006 with 68,000 people is that PAX is spread out. Not all 70,000 people are trying to be on

12:33.520 --> 12:39.200
the expo hall at the same time, whereas E3, pretty much you could say 60,000 of the 68,000

12:39.200 --> 12:42.880
were all trying to be in the exhibit hall, so you couldn't move around. Other than when they

12:42.880 --> 12:48.160
were throwing T-shirts and giving away raffles, I could still walk around just fine. Now, the big

12:48.160 --> 12:53.920
games I had to wait in line to play, but it was pretty manageable. You didn't think that there

12:53.920 --> 12:59.280
were 70,000 people here this weekend. Interesting. I guess a lot go for the live gaming events,

12:59.280 --> 13:03.280
too, and I bet those rooms take away quite a few people. And I think when they say 70,000,

13:03.280 --> 13:08.320
they also, you know, that's spread out through the three days. PAX sells a lot of individual day

13:08.320 --> 13:12.560
badges, too, and it's never really, I think, accounted for just how many they're selling

13:12.560 --> 13:17.440
of those Friday, Saturday, Sunday badges. Well, they have the numbers because the convention

13:17.440 --> 13:23.360
center actually let them sell 1,000 of the one-day PAX for Saturday and Sunday at the last minute,

13:23.360 --> 13:28.400
and they were very surprised about that. Oh, wow. So, I mean, so people who did come up here

13:28.400 --> 13:34.480
hoping to get a badge were actually able to get badges at the last minute, so that was really

13:34.480 --> 13:38.880
nice. But basically, the thing is, there's only two or three events at this convention center

13:38.880 --> 13:42.720
that take up the entire center. Usually, they double book. They had a Jewish convention

13:42.720 --> 13:47.520
last year. I don't know if you ever remember that. Yeah, I do remember that. Way up on the sixth floor.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.520
PAX actually had the entire building this time, and they're like one of two events in the entire

13:51.520 --> 13:56.160
year that actually need the entire building, and that's also why they're on Labor Day weekend,

13:56.160 --> 14:00.640
because that's the only time they can schedule just one event. Wow. Yeah, I heard SoccerCon,

14:00.640 --> 14:04.240
I think, is the other event, if I remember right, which is a big anime thing they do up there, so.

14:04.240 --> 14:08.960
I still want to go. Busy, busy, busy. Well, Bobby, before we let you go, anything else you want to

14:08.960 --> 14:12.720
us to share about your experiences at PAX, or any plugs you want to give, or what have you?

14:14.560 --> 14:19.280
Not really. I mean, I walked in, and I wanted to bring up one other game that I saw a demo of that

14:19.280 --> 14:25.840
I didn't see at E3, and that's Red Dead Redemption was Rockstar's big game that they were trying to

14:25.840 --> 14:32.400
show off here, and it's basically GTA meets Wild West. I know, it looks awesome. And if you thought

14:32.400 --> 14:39.520
Liberty City was big, or not Liberty, yeah Liberty City, if you thought GTA 4 was big, this one is

14:39.520 --> 14:45.840
huge, open world, it's basically GTA Wild West, and it actually looked really good from the demo

14:45.840 --> 14:50.880
they showed, so that shows that they can make a good demo, so we'll see, eventually. And the

14:50.880 --> 14:55.680
Flipsecond guys were there, people were playing Flipsecond, and they say that's probably going to

14:55.680 --> 14:59.920
be in spring of 2010 or summer, they say it's kind of been pushed back, which means they have

14:59.920 --> 15:04.080
even more time to work on it from what we saw at E3. Awesome, well that was definitely one of the

15:04.080 --> 15:09.120
all-stars at E3, so I'm hoping they got a lot of air time, I guess you could say, out there on the

15:09.120 --> 15:14.880
show floor, so sounds like a lot of fun stuff. Did you, was DJ Hero playable there? Activision

15:14.880 --> 15:19.840
was not here. Ah, they suck. Blizzard was, though, that's interesting. Blizzard was here.

15:19.840 --> 15:25.680
Interesting. But Activision apparently did like an invite-only event Thursday night, and that's

15:25.680 --> 15:31.200
when they showed off some stuff, but I was not invited to that, so I didn't get to go to that,

15:31.200 --> 15:34.480
but no, Activision themselves were not physically here at the show this year.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.880
I did think of one more question I have for you, Bobby, because it just sprung to mind,

15:38.880 --> 15:42.560
because unfortunately none of us were able to go to PAX West this year, or PAX Prime,

15:42.560 --> 15:46.800
I guess as they're calling it. What about PAX East? Was there any kind of clues or hints or

15:47.600 --> 15:50.400
promos going on for PAX East, an idea what to expect?

15:50.400 --> 15:55.680
No, not really, and even like the enforcers don't know if they're working PAX East,

15:55.680 --> 15:59.680
like I was talking to the media guy, because I want to start doing broadcasting again. They

15:59.680 --> 16:03.200
couldn't fit us in, like the space that we were in last year for All Games Radio

16:04.160 --> 16:09.040
was taken up by other tables, so like there was like tabletop gaming going on in that area,

16:09.040 --> 16:12.000
and that's why we couldn't have that area, and they didn't want to run the network all the way

16:12.000 --> 16:17.360
across, but I asked them, I'm like, are you the new guy that's running the media? He said,

16:17.360 --> 16:20.880
I asked them, are you running the media at Boston? So we can go ahead and kind of start

16:20.880 --> 16:25.920
talking about that, and he's like, I don't know. So basically, here's the thing that he did tell

16:25.920 --> 16:30.800
me, is that PAX East has been outsourced to another company, so it's not the same people

16:30.800 --> 16:36.720
running it. So I don't know if that's going to change how it feels or not, because I mean,

16:37.120 --> 16:43.200
the guys that run PAX are just a little bit too overwhelmed with this show. So they've kind of

16:43.200 --> 16:48.000
had to farm it out and outsource it to another company while still having the reins on it, but

16:48.800 --> 16:53.360
we don't know if it's going to be the same as this. It's going to be kind of interesting.

16:53.360 --> 16:58.400
That is very interesting news. I'm very curious to see how PAX East develops, but I know,

16:58.400 --> 17:01.920
excuse me, I know I'm heading out there one way or another. I've always wanted to go to Boston.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.280
I have some friends out there. I want to go to the con. We have a lot of OR listeners on the East

17:05.280 --> 17:10.560
Coast. I definitely want to go, and hopefully Dark Soccer or Loki can swing it, but if they can't,

17:10.560 --> 17:14.160
then that's fine. We'll have Orange Lawns Radio one way or another coming from PAX East.

17:15.920 --> 17:21.520
Yep, and I'll be up there too. So this Friday, we're actually going to be running a show on my TV

17:21.520 --> 17:25.120
show Friday Night Gaming. We're actually going to be running one of the games that's here that comes

17:25.120 --> 17:30.320
out this week. I don't know if you've heard of Darkest of Dates. It is a time-traveling first

17:30.320 --> 17:35.680
person shooter, and it's actually by the same guys that make the real deal casino game.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.480
Yeah, it looked funny.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.600
It's kind of funny. But it was cool. They're coming out on PC and 360,

17:41.600 --> 17:44.640
and we're going to be running it on fnglive.net this Friday.

17:45.280 --> 17:50.480
All right. So Bobby Blackwell coming to us. That's all right. Bobby Blackwell coming to us live from

17:50.480 --> 17:55.520
Penny Arcade Expo. If you want to hear more Bobby, he has two shows he hosts. He's a busy guy,

17:55.520 --> 17:59.920
Friday Night Gaming, fnglive.net, as you just heard about, and of course, the Bobby Blackwell

17:59.920 --> 18:03.840
show right before us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights. Bobby, thank you so much for

18:03.840 --> 18:05.280
taking the time out to talk to us tonight.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.120
No problem. Thanks for interrupting your show flow to get me in.

18:09.120 --> 18:12.720
No problem. Anytime for you, Bobby. You always have us on your show every week.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.080
Have a very safe flight home, okay?

18:15.040 --> 18:15.840
All right. Thank you.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.800
All right. Take care. Bobby Blackwell live on Orange Lawn's radio, everybody. He always gives

18:20.800 --> 18:25.920
us like five minutes on his show every week. We can give him 15 on our show tonight, and a lot

18:25.920 --> 18:30.160
of great... I had no idea that Paxis was being run by a different company. That's huge news,

18:30.160 --> 18:34.640
in my opinion. Well, I don't know if it's huge news, but it's a huge interesting thing I didn't

18:34.640 --> 18:38.640
think about before. That's very interesting. That game Darkest of Days looks funny. It's basically,

18:38.640 --> 18:42.240
you can time travel to the past like the Civil War with giant weapons that you could totally

18:42.240 --> 18:43.600
hick everyone's ass with. Nice.

18:43.600 --> 18:48.320
It is intriguing, so I may have to try that. Very nice. All right. Well, hey, even though that was

18:48.320 --> 18:52.640
the start of our show tonight, we always like to start off the show normally with our gaming week,

18:52.640 --> 18:55.760
so we're gonna get right back into Orange Lawn's radio. We have plenty to talk about,

18:55.760 --> 18:59.920
not just stuff from Pax, other news, and of course, how we always start off our gaming week.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.360
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

19:01.360 --> 19:08.720
I shook my butt. I played Para Para First Mix and played a lot of 2DX Distorted,

19:09.280 --> 19:14.480
and what was that weird trippy ass game that you told me, here, play?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.760
DJ Max Technica, a new arcade game.

19:19.760 --> 19:24.080
It was all right. Not really my thing. It's a little too K-pop.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.800
Although it was pretty. I did have a good time playing it. It was just very K-pop.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.600
Yeah.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.600
It was like, wow, is this Andamiro?

19:36.960 --> 19:43.520
Also, Dan played the new Hydro Thunder spiritual successor. What was it called?

19:43.520 --> 19:47.280
I don't remember the name, but it was a big machine. That was a cool thing. It was

19:47.280 --> 19:52.720
Hydro something or Hydra, Hydro something. It was a cool little game. Big, big machine.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.520
Dan was like, give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card

19:57.520 --> 20:01.600
I wanna play. Oh yeah, and I played that punching bag game, which was stupid because it was in the

20:01.600 --> 20:10.000
corner and I was bored. And then I played lots of Sims 3, and I played some Ragnarok online

20:10.000 --> 20:16.720
before I got completely just fed up, fed up. And I have a guilty admission.

20:17.280 --> 20:17.680
What's that?

20:18.400 --> 20:24.960
I'm downloading. Well, I downloaded. Shut up. I'm not an addict. I haven't touched it in two years.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.960
Yeah, my last date of playing was October of 2007.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.480
What were you playing?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.840
I haven't played it yet. I'm just downloading it.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.280
But you're going to play?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.080
World of Warcraft.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.960
That's okay. I reactivated my account this week too.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.320
Ha, you're the addict.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.760
Hey, shut up. Shut it. Shut it. You're just as bad.

20:41.760 --> 20:46.560
But not really. I did check, and the last time I played was in October 2007.

20:46.560 --> 20:50.080
Geez. You should've let me cast a Scroll of Resurrection on you. I would've got a free month.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.840
Someone else did.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.960
Ah, cursed them. Alright. Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

20:57.920 --> 21:02.880
My gaming week was alright. I'm having a love-hate relationship right now with Rockstar,

21:02.880 --> 21:09.680
unfortunately. I love the new trailer for The Ballad of the Gay Tony. It's really making me

21:09.680 --> 21:13.200
excited of the next expansion they're going to have, because it's now more kind of over-the-top

21:13.200 --> 21:20.400
stuff. I did play more Grand Theft Auto this week. However, they did patch Grand Theft Auto

21:20.400 --> 21:25.360
so that we can't run our modded games anymore, which is very... We were completely depressed

21:25.360 --> 21:31.040
for the remainder of the week. It's absolute crap. However, I am not letting that stop me,

21:31.040 --> 21:33.120
and I will get by this one way or another.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.800
They'll find a way around it eventually.

21:34.800 --> 21:40.720
I'm already kind of working on a way. So yeah, it's kind of annoying, but I understand they did

21:40.720 --> 21:44.320
it for the greater good, because there's assholes out there that like to ruin everybody's games by

21:44.320 --> 21:48.000
doing all these different cheat things and stuff, and not exactly in the closed environments that

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
we're playing in. But hey, whatever. Still, though, it sucks that some people have to

21:52.000 --> 21:57.520
ruin it for everybody else. The other game I played, not that I got an early media copy,

21:57.520 --> 22:04.480
but I did get an early copy of The Beatles' Rock Band. And honestly, I think one of the things you

22:04.480 --> 22:09.280
got to consider when you're planning on buying The Beatles' Rock Band is you better damn well

22:09.280 --> 22:12.880
be a Beatles fan, because if you're not, then you're not going to enjoy it too much.

22:12.880 --> 22:19.200
I'm okay with The Beatles. I don't hate their music. I like some of their songs, but it kind

22:19.200 --> 22:24.480
of lost, after playing it for a little bit, it kind of lost its appeal. It's just like,

22:24.480 --> 22:28.880
oh yeah, that's really cool, amazing, all these dreamscapes and stuff, and now I've seen them,

22:28.880 --> 22:34.480
and it's just Rock Band. I don't know.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.280
So you're saying the presentation is somebody who is not as into The Beatles. Kind of the

22:39.280 --> 22:43.760
presentation and the new packaging of Rock Band kind of wore off on you really quick?

22:43.760 --> 22:50.000
Yes. It's not a bad game by any means. It's just, for me, I can't see myself playing this for a

22:50.000 --> 22:56.560
long time. If I could have imported my songs or imported these songs into Rock Band 2 or something,

22:56.560 --> 23:01.040
maybe I would have gotten more life out of it. But I don't know, it looks fun. I think it might

23:01.040 --> 23:05.040
be fun to bring out parties or something, but I couldn't see myself actually playing this for an

23:05.040 --> 23:12.880
extended period of time. But it's neat, given that, but I don't know. I think going forward,

23:12.880 --> 23:17.600
if there's any single band games or single artist games that they're going to be coming out with,

23:17.600 --> 23:22.800
I'll have to really evaluate whether I like that artist a lot or not. You know, if they did like

23:22.800 --> 23:27.360
a Michael Jackson game or something like that, I might be tempted. But The Beatles, it's pretty

23:27.360 --> 23:31.360
good. If you like The Beatles, you'll definitely like this game, and other than that, I mean,

23:31.360 --> 23:35.920
it's just basically Rock Band with three-part harmonies. Although I don't have three microphones,

23:35.920 --> 23:42.080
so, you know. And I don't sing either. A lot of reviews, I guess the embargo or whatever was

23:42.080 --> 23:44.800
lifted the other day, because all of a sudden there was just a ton of reviews that all hit

23:44.800 --> 23:52.160
the internet at once. And I'm seeing a lot of positive about the presentation, the way it looks,

23:52.160 --> 23:56.640
the way that it really feels like The Beatles. It's kind of interesting. You're one of the first

23:56.640 --> 24:01.120
negative things I've heard. Not so much negative, but just the fact that, as someone who's not as

24:01.120 --> 24:07.120
into The Beatles, it wore off on me. Interesting. I mean, let me put it this way, I'd be less

24:07.120 --> 24:13.200
satisfied with a Guitar Hero release that is basically just reskinned. They didn't put any

24:13.200 --> 24:17.360
effort into the presentation. I still love the intro to the game, and it's awesome. I haven't

24:17.360 --> 24:22.240
really played much of the story. It's mainly been just the quick play stuff. But, I don't know,

24:22.240 --> 24:28.800
it's neat. For me, I don't listen to Beatles music that much. I recognize their songs, but I don't

24:28.800 --> 24:35.200
really go seek out Beatles music. Let me ask you one more question. If you were, let's say, imagine

24:35.200 --> 24:41.040
that you were a hardcore Beatles fan, how do you think this game would compare to other artists'

24:41.040 --> 24:46.160
solitary games, such as Guitar Hero, Aerosmith, or the ACDC expansion for Rock Band? Oh, yeah,

24:46.160 --> 24:50.560
this would be awesome. I mean, they totally nailed The Beatles and just the whole feel of the game

24:50.560 --> 24:57.200
and everything. I like that. I really dig that. But, it's just, I'm not a huge fan of The Beatles.

24:57.200 --> 25:02.320
But, yeah, if they put that amount of effort into other artists' games, then I would still be

25:02.320 --> 25:08.080
likely to check them out. Even though I'm not a big fan of The Beatles, I still bought a copy of

25:08.080 --> 25:15.680
it because it looked really cool. I don't think I wasted my money on it. I'm not going to enjoy it

25:15.680 --> 25:20.240
as much as Rock Band, where if I don't like a track in it or whatever, it doesn't really matter

25:20.240 --> 25:23.920
because I can just always get different artists and stuff later on. Whereas, The Beatles stuff,

25:23.920 --> 25:27.760
if I don't like the tracks in it, I can't really buy more tracks because they're just more Beatles

25:27.760 --> 25:32.640
music. Going to our chat room, chat.orangelawnsradio.com, certainly a lot of comments going

25:32.640 --> 25:37.520
on about The Beatles' Rock Band. J-Rod in chat says, so because Rock Band Beatles has an opening

25:37.520 --> 25:42.000
cut scene, it's not a reskinned version and, quote, better than the Guitar Hero artist games.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.040
Oh, God, my brain is raging so hard. Well, let's not forget, this is not the first Rock Band

25:47.040 --> 25:52.480
artist-dedicated game. There was an ACDC game that a lot of people forget came out last year that was,

25:52.480 --> 25:56.400
I mean, it was probably even worse than the Guitar Hero games, right?

25:56.400 --> 25:58.560
Well, yeah, that was something that they did for Walmart.

25:58.560 --> 26:03.520
That was a cash-in, just straight-up cash-in. So, you know, it's not like they've always done

26:03.520 --> 26:10.800
perfect releases, but to, I guess, kind of defend it a little bit, what do you think makes this

26:10.800 --> 26:16.880
a step above Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Van Halen, if you do feel it is a step above?

26:16.880 --> 26:22.240
I think the step above is they went beyond just putting the artists in the game and just putting,

26:22.240 --> 26:27.440
like, you know, their tracks and stuff like that. They actually made it very much feel like, you

26:27.440 --> 26:32.640
know, the vibe of the Beatles, just the whole stylized version of the game. Everything is,

26:32.640 --> 26:38.320
like, catered to, you know, their kind of acid, trippy backgrounds that they have going on,

26:38.320 --> 26:43.200
the different songs, just the different styles of, you know, depending on when, you know,

26:43.200 --> 26:49.520
the songs came out, what decade and whatnot. It just really set it apart, I think. Whereas,

26:49.520 --> 26:55.520
like, you know, Guitar Hero Rock Band, or not, Guitar Hero, you know, like, Metallica or Van

26:55.520 --> 26:59.040
Halen or something like that, I mean, those are pretty much all interchangeable. I mean,

26:59.040 --> 27:02.800
they haven't really done anything with the interface other than, you know, replace the logo

27:02.800 --> 27:06.560
in it, and they changed, you know, the models so that it's, like, you know. Which is essentially

27:06.560 --> 27:13.200
what Lego Rock Band is going to be. Yes. True. I mean, let's be fair. Yeah, true. Lego Rock Band's

27:13.200 --> 27:16.240
pretty much going to be the same thing. But the thing with Lego Rock Band, though, is it's also

27:16.240 --> 27:20.960
more like the other Telltale games where they have the little, like, cutscenes there with the

27:20.960 --> 27:25.600
Lego characters and stuff. All the Lego games kind of feel the same as far as that, and they

27:25.600 --> 27:29.600
have a little bit of, like, different elements into there. But yeah, it's really not that much

27:29.600 --> 27:34.640
different than, say, you know, Guitar Hero, Van Halen or something like that. I mean, they have

27:34.640 --> 27:38.560
gone a little bit further in the presentation, but, you know, not enough to where I'm going to

27:38.560 --> 27:42.560
say it's, like, amazing or anything. Yeah, see, I'm not feeling Lego Rock Band. Like, I'm totally,

27:42.560 --> 27:47.120
like, even though I'm, like, just... Yeah, I appreciate the Beatles. I'm all about Beatles

27:47.120 --> 27:50.320
Rock Band, but I think the music games I'll probably buy this holiday season are the

27:50.320 --> 27:53.840
Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5. What about... And a lot of that boils down to the song list,

27:53.840 --> 27:58.080
because I think Guitar Hero 5 has a great song list for me, especially compared to World Tour.

27:58.080 --> 28:02.640
Like, I really want Guitar Hero 5. Well, we discussed that we were probably going to get

28:02.640 --> 28:07.360
Guitar Hero 5 so we could get the Van Halen, even though I don't... I'm a big fan of Van Hagar and

28:07.360 --> 28:13.680
not, you know, but I'm still more looking forward to Rock Band Beatles, you know, Beatles Rock Band

28:13.680 --> 28:19.360
myself, just because I am a fan. I mean, not as big fan as some people I know, but, you know,

28:19.360 --> 28:23.920
I'm a pretty... I love it, and I'm actually looking forward to the overall experience of it,

28:23.920 --> 28:28.640
you know. Yeah, and I'm just not... I'm not feeling it with Lego or... I don't know enough about Band

28:28.640 --> 28:32.800
Hero. I just... It seems like Band Hero is going to be a little bit... Band Hero should have, like,

28:32.800 --> 28:37.680
marching band moves and stuff. Okay, well, Band Hero is basically just the same thing as Lego

28:37.680 --> 28:42.240
Rock Band. I mean, it's basically their E10 Plus game. It's got a bunch of different artists. You

28:42.240 --> 28:46.000
know who they have pimping it out? Huh. Well, I found out the last artist that they haven't

28:46.000 --> 28:50.240
announced yet. What's that? No Doubt. Well, that's kind of cool, though. I like No Doubt. Yeah,

28:50.240 --> 28:53.920
they have No Doubt's going to be pimping that game out, too. Band Hero? That might... Yeah,

28:53.920 --> 28:59.040
and Band Hero. Okay, I don't... Band Hero might be kind of cool, actually. I don't know. It's

28:59.040 --> 29:03.120
really at this point, especially when you're doing, you know, when the... Well, you know,

29:03.120 --> 29:06.880
you can't really say that for Guitar Hero 5, because Guitar Hero 5 is not a reskinning. They

29:06.880 --> 29:11.040
have gone back and reinvented the game. Now you can play all the instruments. You can't say that.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.840
So, you know, that's another reason why... But Band Hero is a reskinning of Guitar Hero 5. Well,

29:13.840 --> 29:19.600
of Guitar Hero 5. Yeah. So... But I don't know, like, I'm okay with the reskinnings if the song

29:19.600 --> 29:24.560
lists are really, really good. And it sounds like Band Hero might have a pretty good song list. I

29:24.560 --> 29:29.440
don't know. I don't know. Well, all right. Anyways, enough of the music game, blah, blah, blah. So

29:29.440 --> 29:38.720
anything else you're giving me, Louie? Not really, but I'm still waiting for my cabinet to come in.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.800
I got more Dance Mania... I have two Dance Maniac sensors now, which I was hoping to actually create

29:42.800 --> 29:50.240
a real Dance Mania setup to go with my Dance Mania System 573 board. But the problem is,

29:50.240 --> 29:55.840
and I was unaware of this because I actually got the Dance Maniac's manual first sent to me because

29:55.840 --> 30:01.840
I, you know, I would like to know how to wire this thing up. Dance Maniac sensors come in top and

30:01.840 --> 30:07.280
bottom. The bottom have two sensors, one on top, one on bottom, I think, or two on the bottom,

30:07.280 --> 30:13.440
maybe. But the top sensors only have one sensor. And so I got two top sensors, unfortunately,

30:13.440 --> 30:19.200
and now I have to do something or create my own sensors or something. Talk to the guy that sold

30:19.200 --> 30:23.840
them to me to see if he has any bottom sensors, but he hasn't gotten back to me. He doesn't speak

30:23.840 --> 30:29.120
much English either. I'm looking at chat.orangeonstrader.com and Lumi's in chat says,

30:29.120 --> 30:33.440
didn't Rob see No Doubt Paramore concert a few weeks ago? We actually just call that the No Doubt

30:33.440 --> 30:36.960
concert because I didn't care about the other bands on the ticket. But, well, actually the

30:36.960 --> 30:43.360
sounds were pretty freaking awesome as far as that other band, yeah. But No Doubt, like, I'm not

30:43.360 --> 30:49.440
going to lie. I love No Doubt. Okay. I graduated high school in 1996. That was like the year of

30:49.440 --> 30:52.960
No Doubt. You know what? That's like the anthem of high school and everything for me. So you know

30:52.960 --> 30:59.200
what? Like if there was a Guitar Hero No Doubt game, even if it was just like a re-skinning or

30:59.200 --> 31:03.920
whatever, I'd probably buy it because I really like No Doubt. I bought that whole album and rock

31:03.920 --> 31:09.440
band and everything. And yeah, I don't know. Call me a sucker, whatever. But I think a lot of people,

31:09.440 --> 31:14.000
if their favorite band came out in whatever game, would feel the same way. So anyway, I don't want

31:14.000 --> 31:19.760
to get into too much more talking about music games. Well, you heard that Lego Rock Band,

31:19.760 --> 31:24.640
the rumor is that you're going to import those tracks into Rock Band 2. That's kind of cool.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.280
I hope that's the case because I'm going to rent it. Just rent it. Import those tracks.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.520
Shame on you. Hey, do what I can. All right. Hey, Saig is in chat and wants to correct Loki. Tell

31:37.520 --> 31:41.200
Tale Games does not make any of the Lego games. I think you botched the company name when you were

31:41.200 --> 31:46.080
talking about that. I'm sorry. I'm thinking of Traveler or something. Traveler's Tales. I'm

31:46.080 --> 31:53.360
sorry. Traveler's Tales. It's TT. I mean, close, but very different. Sorry. Traveler's Tales.

31:53.360 --> 32:00.240
Whatever. I mean, same initials. That's what I remember. That's right. Anyhow, at least we got

32:00.240 --> 32:05.600
that clarified. Moving on, My Gaming Week. Good lord, I played a lot of games this week, actually.

32:05.600 --> 32:10.000
I want to talk about DJ Max Technica real quick because I know Dark Sakura is kind of about it,

32:10.000 --> 32:15.360
but I really enjoyed it. It was like Elite Beat Agents, basically. Imagine if Elite Beat Agents

32:15.360 --> 32:19.840
were an arcade game where you tap the screen with your finger to hit the buttons. Basically,

32:19.840 --> 32:23.360
what happens, you see a bar going across the top and then it goes back down to the bottom. It's

32:23.360 --> 32:28.080
kind of like running a track around the screen. Then as it passes these dots, you have to tap the

32:28.080 --> 32:32.400
dots to play the music. Or you can drag your finger for some of them and some dots you have

32:32.400 --> 32:37.120
to hit over and over again to hit with a beat of the music. I really like the way it was set up.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.480
I had a really good time playing the game. The only problem I had with the game, the music was

32:42.480 --> 32:47.440
completely uninspiring and not memorable to me. I know that's going to piss a lot of people off

32:47.440 --> 32:51.120
that I said that. Some of the music game fans, especially if you like the Korean pop, but I'm

32:51.120 --> 32:56.160
sorry. It just was not... I wasn't able to distinguish one song from another that I was

32:56.160 --> 33:03.440
playing. I can't put my finger on it. 2DX just has such a variety and such cool songs in it.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.840
A lot of it is so memorable, at least in the past. I would almost say the same is true about

33:07.840 --> 33:14.240
BeatMania 2DX now, ever since 13th Style about there. Too bad they don't have a Ubi machine

33:14.240 --> 33:20.240
there. But the game itself, I thought was a lot of fun. I would play it again. Maybe the musical

33:20.240 --> 33:26.800
grow on me. I don't know. But the game itself I had a lot of fun with. And I'm seeing frowns

33:26.800 --> 33:31.840
in chat. I'm sorry guys. I guess maybe it's a personal preference thing. But the game itself,

33:31.840 --> 33:38.000
pretty cool. Also, some of the stuff I played this week. I played Zen Pinball. It's a pinball

33:38.000 --> 33:44.320
game that's available on PlayStation 3. Did you check this out yet? Not yet, but I saw one of the

33:44.320 --> 33:48.480
games in action. You know what? They have a Street Fighter 2 table that I actually downloaded as

33:48.480 --> 33:54.160
well. Yeah, it's cool. It's a fun little pinball simulator. The only tricky thing about pinball

33:54.160 --> 33:58.240
is that pinball is not really meant for a wide screen TV because the unfortunate thing about

33:58.240 --> 34:02.640
pinball is that you know how a pinball field looks. It's like a wide screen the other way.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.800
And it's not like you're going to turn your television on its side. So unfortunately,

34:06.800 --> 34:11.360
that makes the display a little difficult in a pinball game. But they do the best job they can.

34:11.360 --> 34:15.200
You have different view modes you can use in this game to look at the table from different angles.

34:15.200 --> 34:20.320
It really reminds me of a lot of the pinball games I played on the PC in the 90s. But obviously,

34:20.320 --> 34:24.080
you know, with the high def graphics and all that. I hear there's multiplayer too,

34:24.080 --> 34:28.560
but I haven't tested that mode out online. So I can't really review that component of it yet.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.560
On the PSP this week, I played Rock Band Unplugged, which basically is frequency or

34:34.560 --> 34:38.720
amplitude, but it's the rock band music. It's pretty much what you would expect,

34:38.720 --> 34:41.520
but I had fun with it. But you know what else I had fun with on the PSP?

34:41.520 --> 34:49.360
The things I'm learning about Sony is, and there's so much functionality in the PSP

34:49.920 --> 34:54.560
that I don't think Sony does a really good job at advertising because I was really surprised.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.240
You know, as I was looking at this, you know, I was like, oh yeah, I think we've talked about

34:58.240 --> 35:02.960
this on this show, but damn, I don't really hear about this a lot. And it's actually a really cool

35:02.960 --> 35:08.000
feature of the PSP. And that is that if you have a PSP, like let's say I was here at Jamie's right

35:08.000 --> 35:14.080
now, I could, if I connected to her internet, I could power on my PlayStation 3 from home,

35:14.800 --> 35:19.280
go into my crossbar, see my crossbar on the PSP as I would see it on the PS3,

35:19.280 --> 35:25.760
go to like a movie that I have downloaded on the PS3 or even a data disc full of movies that's

35:25.760 --> 35:30.160
in my PS3 right now. And I can play them, stream them over the internet to my PSP.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.720
That's awesome. Yet, and you know, and it's kind of one of those things where it's like,

35:34.720 --> 35:38.480
oh yeah, I think I remember hearing about this, but damn, they should be shoving this down my

35:38.480 --> 35:42.720
throat. That's really cool functionality. That's way better than anything the DS and the Wii could

35:42.720 --> 35:48.480
ever do. That makes the, that makes the PS3 PSP combo, in my opinion, that much more awesome is

35:48.480 --> 35:53.120
not just the movies thing or the data, this thing, sorry, you can't do Blu-rays or DVDs,

35:53.120 --> 35:58.400
but, um, you can do some of the games too, like especially the PS1 classics and some of the, um,

35:58.400 --> 36:02.880
I don't want to say arcade games, but the PSN downloadable games, you can also play on the PSP

36:02.880 --> 36:09.360
from anywhere by turning on your PS3 from somewhere else. That's like kind of neat. So

36:09.360 --> 36:16.800
that's a remote play, of course, is the feature there that they call that. Anyhow, um, let's see,

36:16.800 --> 36:20.160
what else did I play this week? I want to say there were more games, but I, I can't think of

36:20.160 --> 36:23.920
anything right now, honestly. So I guess I will just leave it at that so we can continue on with

36:23.920 --> 36:28.080
the show because I know we want to get into some gaming news, but first we have some housekeeping

36:28.080 --> 36:34.000
news. Um, not a whole lot of new stuff. I do want to let you guys know I am going to be out in two

36:34.000 --> 36:38.240
weeks. I'll be here next week, but I'll be out in two weeks. So I don't know if there will be a show

36:38.240 --> 36:42.960
or not, but we'll keep you posted, but I'm going to be in LA so I won't be here. So I'm going on

36:42.960 --> 36:47.200
a personal trip. So we'll see what happens in two weeks, but we will be back next week. As far as

36:47.200 --> 36:53.040
other housekeeping goes, uh, you can always follow us on Twitter, www.twitter.com slash O L R. We'll

36:53.040 --> 36:56.720
be getting into Twitter topics a little later in the show. And of course you can always send us

36:56.720 --> 37:00.640
emails, mail back at orange launch ready.com. Don't forget to join us on Facebook at the O L

37:00.640 --> 37:06.160
army or on life journal username orange lounge. All right. How about some gaming news? Loki

37:06.160 --> 37:11.200
start us off tonight with some gaming news. Yes. Lots of gaming news this week. Um, let's see,

37:11.200 --> 37:16.480
let's start off with, um, the rumor and this wasn't exactly a complete rumor, but we knew

37:16.480 --> 37:21.920
it was coming just, I didn't know if it was gonna be coming this soon, but, uh, there are DSI only

37:21.920 --> 37:28.880
games coming this fall apparently. Um, now of course no, you know, official announcements have

37:28.880 --> 37:34.480
been made yet about, you know, actual DSI only games coming in, but apparently a retail source

37:34.480 --> 37:40.800
that spoke with Kotaku said the new, um, DSI exclusive games will be out this fall and they're

37:40.800 --> 37:45.280
actually going to have a little bit of, um, differences to them, distinguishing them from

37:45.280 --> 37:50.480
the other DS games. The cases are going to be white and also they're going to have like a,

37:50.480 --> 37:56.400
you know, only plays on DSI, um, little sticker on them as well to let people know that you can't

37:56.400 --> 38:03.040
buy this for the DS. Now you may be wondering, well, what games are going to be DSI exclusive?

38:03.840 --> 38:09.360
Um, one of them that they have found is a game called Monster Finder. And apparently, um, this

38:09.360 --> 38:14.640
is sort of like, I think it was called, um, sort of similar to Invisimals, which is going to be on

38:14.640 --> 38:23.040
the PSP. I think it basically uses the DSI camera to find monsters, kind of like, uh, I guess, a,

38:23.040 --> 38:30.080
um, I don't know, alternative route or I guess an alternative reality game or something like that.

38:30.080 --> 38:34.640
Augmented reality game, that's the word I'm thinking about. Um, basically you find monsters

38:34.640 --> 38:38.560
and then you collect them and put them against each other, like kind of like Monster Rancher,

38:38.560 --> 38:42.480
but with a camera. It's just sort of like the barcode scanner games back, back when. Yes,

38:42.480 --> 38:48.480
yes, very similar to that too. And, um, so this will be the, this is one of the first DSI only

38:48.480 --> 38:54.400
games. If I remember correctly, I think from looking at Ubisoft, I think there are two more

38:54.400 --> 38:59.360
coming from them, their Style Lab series. I can't remember if those are DSI exclusive.

38:59.360 --> 39:04.000
I know they do use the DSI, but I don't remember if they were exclusive or not because they said

39:04.000 --> 39:10.320
they were, but then the sell sheet said not, but I don't know. Um, but there might be more coming.

39:10.320 --> 39:14.640
So interesting that Nintendo is kind of letting the third parties do this first. You know what

39:14.640 --> 39:18.880
I mean? Like, you know, I'm kind of torn on this. This is one of those things where I'm a little

39:18.880 --> 39:24.320
bit disappointed because I really didn't see the point in getting a DSI because the DS honestly

39:24.320 --> 39:28.640
has everything I want. I don't really need the camera or any of that stuff. I don't, yeah,

39:28.640 --> 39:32.560
I don't think you need this game either. I mean, it's just a lot of these games are going to be

39:32.560 --> 39:37.040
DSI only. They're obviously going to be using the gimmicks of it, the camera. That's basically it.

39:37.040 --> 39:41.280
Here's the thing. How long, Loki? And you know this is going to happen. How long, in fact,

39:41.280 --> 39:46.560
let's take bets here on the show. How long until Nintendo puts out the Zelda game that's going to

39:46.560 --> 39:51.360
need barcodes or the Mario game that's going to require the camera for something? I mean,

39:51.360 --> 39:54.960
or the, you know, the WarioWare, one of their first party titles, you know,

39:54.960 --> 39:59.840
WarioWare is a given or something that's going to require these peripherals. And then suddenly

39:59.840 --> 40:04.240
it's going to be at just this landslide where now all the games go DSI only. I mean,

40:04.240 --> 40:08.080
That's almost, I think, how they plan it.

40:08.080 --> 40:11.440
They would like that if they, if they're making money off the systems and yeah,

40:11.440 --> 40:15.200
of course they're going to like that. Doesn't this happen all the time too? I mean,

40:15.200 --> 40:19.200
you can go all the way back to the original Game Boy. Remember how Game Boy Color games

40:19.200 --> 40:23.760
would still play in the Game Boy, but then after a certain amount of time, finally it was, oh,

40:23.760 --> 40:28.240
they're a color exclusive. You can only play these on a Game Boy Color. The problem is though,

40:28.240 --> 40:30.880
is if they go that route, that's going to piss off a lot of people and they're,

40:30.880 --> 40:36.000
well, I know they may not care, but here's the thing though, their audience, the people that

40:36.000 --> 40:40.240
buy Nintendo products are a lot different than your normal consumer that buys, you know, any

40:40.240 --> 40:48.000
other console franchise. Like for example, you know, with the Wii and the DS, the DS owners,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.560
I think that they're pretty content with what they've got on DS or the Wii. And they're not

40:52.560 --> 40:57.040
going to exactly like if the Wii HD comes out, your normal mom and pop is not going to upgrade

40:57.040 --> 41:00.960
to a Wii HD because they could care less because they have Wii Sports and they don't really care

41:00.960 --> 41:06.560
about upgrading to another system. Same with the DSi. Until Wii Sports 3 is Wii HD only.

41:06.560 --> 41:12.800
It doesn't matter. I mean, I think right now, you know, with the DS, I mean, there's so many

41:12.800 --> 41:18.880
people that have the DS if they, unless, I mean, the DSi is not that much different than the DS.

41:18.880 --> 41:23.440
I mean, they were supposed to be put together so they can, you know, compete on the same market

41:23.440 --> 41:29.200
or whatever, but I don't see why, how they're going to convince people that they need to buy

41:29.200 --> 41:35.920
a DSi because, oh, this game uses a camera now. Good for them. Question from your distribution

41:35.920 --> 41:42.160
perspective, are the regular DS's being phased out? No. Interesting. Not necessarily being phased

41:42.160 --> 41:46.560
out, but there's not really new colors coming out for them. There's new colors for the DSi.

41:46.560 --> 41:50.160
But I mean, if you think about it, I guess, you know, there's four different colors for the DS

41:50.160 --> 41:54.800
right now, and now there's going to be four different colors for the DSi, so... They haven't,

41:54.800 --> 41:58.880
like, stopped production. No, they haven't stopped production. Okay. I mean, sales have certainly

41:58.880 --> 42:02.880
slowed down a bit, but, you know, not necessarily stopped production.

42:05.520 --> 42:10.160
Takeo Ray in chat says, that's why I never got the DSi. My DS Lite is perfectly fine for me.

42:10.160 --> 42:14.320
That's pretty much the same camp I'm in. I rarely play the DS as it is. If you've listened to this

42:14.320 --> 42:19.520
show before, you know kind of my little rant on handhelds, although I will say the PSP is quickly

42:19.520 --> 42:24.320
gaining a lot of favor, in my opinion, not necessarily as a gaming device, but as a

42:24.320 --> 42:30.080
multi-functional media device, is quickly gaining popularity with me. Well, here's the thing. I mean,

42:30.080 --> 42:34.480
I'm sorry, but if they come out with a new, like, Zelda game or something that requires a camera,

42:35.040 --> 42:39.680
I don't care. I won't buy it, because, you know what? I'm not going to buy another system for

42:39.680 --> 42:44.800
one fucking game. I'm sorry. You know, when your library plays on my system, except for this one

42:44.800 --> 42:50.880
game, boo-fucking-hoo, I'm not buying it. You know, I will make do. I mean, people, that's the problem.

42:50.880 --> 42:55.680
You're expecting these hardcore players, you know, to go, okay, let me buy a new system for this game,

42:55.680 --> 43:02.880
but the audience that buys the DS, they aren't really hardcore gamers. It's just the wrong

43:02.880 --> 43:08.880
expectation for their market. Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm betting this time next year,

43:08.880 --> 43:14.400
we're looking in the face of a Mario or Zelda game on the DS that's only on the DSi. Mario

43:14.400 --> 43:19.200
goes to Barcode Island or something like that. For the record, I'm probably going to have a DSi.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.800
Why? I mean, I'm not asking that in an accusatory way. I'm asking it as a

43:24.800 --> 43:29.520
why do you want that when you already have a DS? Why not? Because you already have a DS.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.160
I want to play the new stuff that comes out. I knew it was going to happen. Well,

43:34.160 --> 43:38.080
what if it sucks? Well, here's another thing. What if I don't care? Jamie's a little different,

43:38.080 --> 43:41.520
because she's a system collection whore. That's true. She's not your typical gamer.

43:41.520 --> 43:48.480
Honestly, anything new that comes out, I pretty much want it, and we pretty much end up getting

43:48.480 --> 43:52.080
it. She owns some fucking Dreamcast game that came with a dish, for heaven's sake. I mean,

43:52.080 --> 43:57.200
she's just a video game collector. So, yeah, you're not exactly going to want my opinion on

43:57.200 --> 44:00.640
that, because mine's going to be, well, why shouldn't it be in my collection? All right,

44:00.640 --> 44:04.240
fine. Well, let's move on to another story that maybe we will get your opinion on then,

44:04.240 --> 44:09.280
and that's about the iPhone. You know what's interesting is that there's always been that

44:09.280 --> 44:14.320
rumor that's been going around probably as long as we've been podcasting that Apple's going to

44:14.320 --> 44:18.400
get into gaming. Apple's going to get into gaming. They're going to do something. They're going to

44:18.400 --> 44:24.320
get into gaming. It's just a matter of time. Apple kind of just got into gaming when everybody was

44:24.320 --> 44:31.760
kind of looking everywhere else. Like, Apple is into gaming now, and they have a lot of users

44:31.760 --> 44:36.240
using their games. Of course, I'm talking about the iPhone. Don't believe me? Well,

44:36.240 --> 44:41.920
guess what they announced this week? Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Yes, the game that was the

44:41.920 --> 44:47.520
DS exclusive last, they were so excited about E3. Remember, they came out and, oh, GTA Chinatown

44:47.520 --> 44:52.880
Wars is coming out. Guess what? It's coming out on the iPhone. And this is right after they

44:52.880 --> 44:56.720
announced that a PSP version was coming out as well. Of course, that is on its way as well.

44:56.720 --> 45:00.800
But it's also coming to the iPhone, and of course, that would mean the iPod Touch as well.

45:00.800 --> 45:06.080
There's not a whole lot of other details at this time, but only just that they're calling it a

45:06.080 --> 45:11.600
perfect match for the iPhone and iPod Touch. I'm kind of iffy on this because I don't think,

45:12.240 --> 45:16.240
some games just don't run well on the iPhone and iPod Touch. I don't think it's a very

45:17.040 --> 45:22.400
powerful gaming system, but some of the games they have on there aren't bad at all.

45:22.400 --> 45:28.320
PEGL or any PopCap game. You know, certain games that are optimized for the iPhone and iPod Touch

45:28.320 --> 45:32.640
run pretty darn good. I mean, the only thing I see the iPhone and the iPod Touch,

45:32.640 --> 45:40.160
basically the app store that they have, it's just the most successful mobile gaming platform is

45:40.160 --> 45:46.000
basically it. Because, you know, if you try to, I mean, other phones and stuff like that don't

45:46.000 --> 45:51.040
really work well with gaming. Whereas this, you know, they built this phone around the apps that

45:51.040 --> 45:58.560
you can make and these programs, which is good. But, you know, as far as it being like a gaming

45:58.560 --> 46:04.000
platform, yeah, sure, I guess it could be. You know, as far as, you know, they can put lots of

46:04.000 --> 46:07.920
games on it, but you're not going to see the same functionality as some of these games that are on

46:07.920 --> 46:13.280
the DS and, you know, the PSP. But that's mainly because they don't have any sort of like control

46:13.280 --> 46:17.200
pad or anything. They mainly are stuck to the touch screen, so it doesn't work out that well.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.360
I just, I don't know why, just someday I could see them putting out a little thing that snaps

46:21.360 --> 46:25.920
in the bottom of the iPhone that's a little gaming thing with buttons on it and maybe that adds a

46:25.920 --> 46:30.080
little extra oomph to the, I don't know what they could do, like an independent card of some sort.

46:30.080 --> 46:34.640
Maybe, you know, I don't know enough about how hardware works, but I would just see that they

46:34.640 --> 46:38.960
could do something like that that would just add a lot of oomph to the iPhone and iPod touch and

46:38.960 --> 46:43.200
make it, you know, that much more. But don't you think it still is competition for the DS?

46:43.200 --> 46:49.040
Oh yeah, definitely. To an extent the PSP? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's always competition for

46:49.040 --> 46:54.320
them because, you know, their, you know, App Store right now is definitely working a lot better than,

46:54.320 --> 47:00.160
you know, what they have for DSiWare or, you know, the PlayStation Network stuff and obviously,

47:00.160 --> 47:05.440
you know, the PlayStation Go is going to try to kind of copy the App Store and I don't think it's

47:05.440 --> 47:09.680
going to even get close to what, you know, they're doing on the App Store. Well, I think it'll be

47:09.680 --> 47:15.040
great for PSP 3000 owners. It's not really, okay, well here's the, yeah, exactly. It's not even

47:15.040 --> 47:19.760
really necessary, they already have the infrastructure in PlayStation, they don't have

47:19.760 --> 47:24.560
the content on there and that's the problem. It's like same with the DSiWare stuff. They don't have,

47:24.560 --> 47:29.520
like, independent developers can't just throw stuff on there and, you know, have it, you know,

47:29.520 --> 47:33.600
be available. Whereas the App Store, you know, there's just lots of content quickly, you know,

47:33.600 --> 47:38.720
some of it may not be good, some of it is really good, but there's a lot of content on there and

47:38.720 --> 47:42.400
the process to get it up was pretty quick. Yeah, but to be fair, the iPhone also has a lot of crap.

47:42.400 --> 47:47.760
Like, one story that I don't think we are covering tonight, I think, but it was in the thread, we

47:47.760 --> 47:52.160
just ran out of room tonight. Yeah, there was a game on the iPhone that just came out this week

47:52.160 --> 47:57.120
that is, like, a PP simulation game. I think that's what it's called. IPP was the name of the

47:57.120 --> 48:02.800
game and you literally are, like, aiming at a urinal. Come on. It's funny, see, that's awesome.

48:02.800 --> 48:07.040
It's stupid. It's just dumb. It is stupid, but you know what? Here's my point, there's a lot of

48:07.040 --> 48:11.760
crap out there on the iPhone and iPod Touch. But one person's trash is another person's treasure,

48:11.760 --> 48:16.000
so you know what? Well, then couldn't the same be said about whatever Sony's planning with their

48:16.000 --> 48:21.440
mini bar and the DSI to an extent? Well, I don't have a problem with Sony's minis. I do have a

48:21.440 --> 48:27.120
problem with the DSIware because it's a lot of calculators and clocks, which, you know, I don't

48:27.120 --> 48:33.360
know, it just doesn't really add anything to the DSI. That's the problem. All right. Well, let's

48:33.360 --> 48:37.600
move on with some more gaming news. We'll get to release dates here in just a little bit, but first

48:37.600 --> 48:46.080
over to Dark Sakura. Oh, you sound so enthusiastic. But first, over to the one and only fabulous Dark

48:46.080 --> 48:54.080
Sakura. Well, you know Splatterhouse was being developed by Bottle Rocket Entertainment? Well,

48:54.080 --> 49:01.040
they don't exist anymore. They clung to life as long as they could, but the plug was pulled,

49:01.040 --> 49:13.200
so guess what? They got splattered. Their house got splattered. And so that means that... Actually,

49:13.200 --> 49:15.440
I really don't know what that means for Splatterhouse, except that it's not going

49:15.440 --> 49:20.320
to be coming out anytime soon unless someone else picks that up. Just let it die. I mean,

49:20.320 --> 49:26.000
it was a neat idea, but just let it die. Might as well come out at this point. They say that they're

49:26.000 --> 49:30.480
actually working on another company that they're going to start from the ground up. I just think

49:30.480 --> 49:34.560
it's sad, though, that although it seems like there's a silver lining here that forever door

49:34.560 --> 49:38.800
closes and other opens, blah, blah, blah, it's just kind of sad. I seriously feel like this is,

49:38.800 --> 49:43.680
again, we had a lot of this at the end of the year last year, but this is the fourth

49:44.240 --> 49:48.320
story I think we've had in the scope of two months about some studio closing down. Well,

49:48.320 --> 49:52.160
it's because they're way behind in schedule. That game was supposed to be out at the end of last

49:52.160 --> 49:58.000
year, and then they pushed it back to near June, and then it still wasn't done. So yeah, time to

49:58.000 --> 50:02.480
close. WhatupG in our chatroom at chat.orangelandstrategy.com asked me a question. Didn't

50:02.480 --> 50:06.400
Namco take Splatterhouse internally? I seem to remember hearing that at one point, too.

50:06.400 --> 50:11.280
Yeah. Well, actually, yeah, there's nothing about what exactly is going to happen with it,

50:11.280 --> 50:14.960
but Namco pulled the development of Splatterhouse back in. That's right,

50:14.960 --> 50:20.480
but there hasn't been anything else said about it. Interesting. All right. Well,

50:20.480 --> 50:26.480
hopefully those guys, as much as we're making silly jokes about Splatterhouse, it does suck

50:26.480 --> 50:30.640
when people lose their jobs, so I hope this whole starting a studio from the ground up works out

50:30.640 --> 50:36.480
for them. But, you know, just try to get stuff out there as soon as you can. Get the public

50:36.480 --> 50:40.720
experience. It's a really tricky balance, isn't it? You want to spend enough time on the products,

50:40.720 --> 50:45.200
you have a quality product, but at the same time, if you spend too much time on it,

50:45.920 --> 50:49.200
you go the way of Duke Nukem Forever and the guys behind that.

50:50.880 --> 50:54.080
I am confident that the game will be super epic when it comes out.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.080
Whatever you say. We'll see.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.760
I'm completely lying.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.080
That's... don't get your expectations too high.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.120
My expectations are incredibly low, okay?

51:03.120 --> 51:03.600
Your problem.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.040
Oh, low, then fine, okay, never mind then.

51:07.040 --> 51:11.520
Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on, Duke Nukem, that was like in the 90s. I don't remember the 90s.

51:12.160 --> 51:15.920
That was a long time ago. Anyways, so...

51:15.920 --> 51:17.680
Yes, it's when no doubt was popular.

51:18.320 --> 51:22.320
Exactly. Speaking of something from a long time ago,

51:22.320 --> 51:27.040
God of War and God of War 2. Actually, I guess that wasn't that long ago, but

51:27.040 --> 51:29.040
hey, it was a few years. That's ancient.

51:31.120 --> 51:35.520
They are now coming out on a brand new collection coming to the PS3,

51:35.520 --> 51:39.120
the God of War collection as its name, coming this holiday.

51:39.120 --> 51:43.920
They're going to be both displayed at 60 frames per second and at 720p,

51:44.560 --> 51:50.000
and it's going to cost somewhere around $40 retail, which is kind of cool.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.800
They're going to be... I don't know.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.840
Remember how we were talking about backwards compatibility,

51:55.840 --> 51:59.040
and how that they probably could do it, but they're not?

51:59.040 --> 52:04.240
Here's why they're not doing it, because now we can sell every game that we've made over again.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.800
I'm okay with it, actually,

52:08.800 --> 52:11.920
because how is this different than what Nintendo's doing Metroid Prime trilogy?

52:11.920 --> 52:14.800
It isn't different, and you know what? I don't...

52:14.800 --> 52:16.800
I think it's kind of cool, because then I can...

52:16.800 --> 52:20.240
You know, yeah, and why I'm okay with this, Loki, is because

52:20.240 --> 52:22.960
they're going back and they're making the games HD,

52:22.960 --> 52:24.720
they're giving them trophies.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.240
Sure, they might be old games, but they're giving them new treatment, you know?

52:28.880 --> 52:32.960
And this Katamari Damacy game that a lot of people are excited about is very similar,

52:32.960 --> 52:33.920
if you think about it.

52:33.920 --> 52:37.120
It might not be the two games that were out before, per se,

52:37.120 --> 52:39.280
but they took a piece here and a piece there,

52:39.280 --> 52:41.680
and then added some new effects and a couple new levels,

52:41.680 --> 52:44.400
and that's this new Katamari game we have coming out in a few weeks.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.960
You know, this seems to be kind of a trend.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.880
Well, I guess it was still a trend before.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.560
I mean, go back to the PlayStation 1, you would see Super Nintendo games,

52:52.560 --> 52:54.480
the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger re-release.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.160
You know, it's not like this is anything new,

52:56.160 --> 52:58.880
but what I think makes this kind of special and kind of cool

52:58.880 --> 53:02.800
is that the games are being souped up a little bit to match the times.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.360
Yeah, and...

53:03.360 --> 53:05.920
I missed the God of War boat back on the PlayStation 2.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.680
This actually really interests me.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.720
Well, God of War 2 actually did output at 720p,

53:10.720 --> 53:15.360
because there were a handful of games that were on the PlayStation 2 and on the Xbox

53:15.360 --> 53:20.160
that would both either output at 720p or they would do 1080i,

53:20.160 --> 53:21.280
which was kind of cool,

53:21.280 --> 53:26.080
but God of War 2 was one of the ones that actually did the 720p,

53:26.080 --> 53:27.440
so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.720
That's right, I remember that now.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.320
Wasn't there like a secret code or something you had to put in to do that?

53:30.320 --> 53:31.200
Yeah, something like that.

53:31.200 --> 53:31.840
That's so weird.

53:33.120 --> 53:39.040
But hey, definitely a good way to get ramped up for the new game coming out, obviously, in March.

53:39.040 --> 53:41.520
Reading some comments from chat.orangelandradio.com,

53:41.520 --> 53:42.320
Deakman says,

53:42.320 --> 53:47.360
I'm okay with it because it's only $40, 720p, 60 frames a second, and trophies.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.000
Sign me up.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.200
And true, that is the price.

53:49.200 --> 53:53.040
If you're gonna buy them both new right now on the PlayStation 2,

53:53.040 --> 53:54.480
that is the price that it would be.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.360
It's $40, so...

53:56.000 --> 53:57.840
So I think I'm gonna wait a little bit for this.

53:57.840 --> 53:58.160
We'll see.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.320
Because again, I never played God of War 1 and 2.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.160
Well, I played it like at a friend's house for a little bit,

54:02.160 --> 54:03.120
but I never played through one.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.000
Never played through two.

54:05.040 --> 54:07.680
Tigerclaw makes a comment about Metroid Prime.

54:07.680 --> 54:11.440
Metroid Prime 3 in Metroid Prime Trilogy was censored a tad.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.520
One of the cutscenes had a character say,

54:13.520 --> 54:16.000
damn, it was redubbed with a no.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.880
That's kind of a weird change, especially if it was different before.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.920
You want to hear something funny and this is off the topic of Metroid,

54:23.920 --> 54:28.160
but I was reading on some of the stuff that they're going to do for Brutal Legend.

54:28.160 --> 54:34.640
They have an option where you can actually take out a lot of the cussing in the game.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.680
So there's one scene, it's like, you know, so listen,

54:37.680 --> 54:39.360
I told you not to climb up there.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.160
What the eff?

54:40.160 --> 54:43.920
And then it pauses and says, okay, do you want him to say fuck?

54:43.920 --> 54:46.880
Or do you want him to like, you know, not use any, you know...

54:46.880 --> 54:47.280
Fudge!

54:48.160 --> 54:48.640
Exactly.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.280
What the fudge?

54:49.280 --> 54:51.600
And then it just, you know, sensors the rest of the game like that.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.480
And I think that's kind of funny, the way that they give that option to you.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.760
That's an interesting way to do it.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.080
Jayrod in chat gives his quick reviews.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.920
Like, these are like Twitter reviews of these games.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.160
It's very short, but maybe help you out, Loki.

55:04.160 --> 55:07.840
God of War 1, I think, has a better story, but God of War 2 was overall better.

55:09.440 --> 55:13.200
Yeah, I really wish I had played God of War 2, but the thing with God of War 1 is I got

55:13.200 --> 55:16.640
so frustrated at the end of the game because the last boss was really hard.

55:16.640 --> 55:20.720
Oh, and the last boss glitched out, so it didn't quite work right.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.280
So I beat the crap out of him just over and over and over again,

55:23.280 --> 55:25.040
even though I know what I was supposed to do in the game.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.000
But it still wouldn't work because the game glitched out.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.680
So I just got pissed off with it.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.520
All right.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.600
Well, let's go back over to the Nintendo Wii for a minute.

55:33.600 --> 55:35.600
Of course, we were talking about Metroid Prime trilogy.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.800
One other thing you might be...

55:36.800 --> 55:40.000
Which actually, by the way, the Metroid Prime games are pretty awesome.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.360
So, you know, I'm even thinking...

55:41.360 --> 55:44.160
I have Metroid Prime 3, but I'm thinking about getting the trilogy

55:44.160 --> 55:46.000
because I never had Metroid Prime 1 or 2.

55:46.000 --> 55:46.880
I know it's kind of weird.

55:46.880 --> 55:47.760
My roommate had them.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.920
So around that time, the roommate had...

55:49.920 --> 55:54.560
You know how you can't get, obviously, the Metroid or Metroid game downloaded

55:54.560 --> 55:57.440
to your Game Boy Advance with the Metroid Prime trilogy,

55:57.440 --> 56:03.120
but you can get the costume that was in that game as well

56:03.120 --> 56:08.240
to kind of download to the Fusion costume or whatever in the game.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.600
That unlocks.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.160
Interesting.

56:10.160 --> 56:10.480
Yeah.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.760
I'm curious what other kind of synergy between the three games there is, if any.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.480
I don't know.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.040
I don't know.

56:15.040 --> 56:18.160
Well, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, you know how they had a web browser.

56:18.160 --> 56:22.160
They had their Nintendo internet channel that you could download for a $5 fee.

56:22.160 --> 56:22.640
Guess what?

56:22.640 --> 56:26.400
Earlier this week in Japan and Europe, that fee went away.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.920
And then just a couple days later, it also went away in North America.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.240
The internet channel is now free to download.

56:32.240 --> 56:34.800
So if you have a Wii but you never got the internet channel,

56:34.800 --> 56:35.920
you can go ahead and download it.

56:35.920 --> 56:36.560
It's free.

56:36.560 --> 56:39.440
It used to cost 500 Wii points to download.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.120
Actually, I should take a step back.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.960
When it first came out, you might remember,

56:42.960 --> 56:46.640
if you were an early Wii owner like myself and I think the others in the studio here,

56:46.640 --> 56:49.280
we were able to get the internet channel really early on

56:49.280 --> 56:51.680
because they had it free for about three months or so.

56:51.680 --> 56:55.440
And then it went to being 500 Wii points when they released the full version.

56:55.440 --> 56:58.160
Well, now they've decided to remove the cost again.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.720
And they also did some little upgrades to the browser.

57:00.720 --> 57:05.200
It's now, instead of Flash 7, it's Flash Lite 3.1,

57:05.200 --> 57:07.440
which I know doesn't sound like an upgrade, but it is.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.840
It's going to let more Flash apps actually be able to play.

57:09.840 --> 57:13.520
And if you were one of the people that paid 500 Wii points for this,

57:13.520 --> 57:16.560
sadly, Nintendo isn't going to give you the 500 points back.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.600
But what they are going to do is they're going to give you a 500 point credit

57:19.600 --> 57:21.520
towards a virtual console game.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.680
So at least you get a little something.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.440
Although, I don't know.

57:25.440 --> 57:28.080
If I was one of the people that paid 500 points for it, I might be a little sad.

57:28.080 --> 57:30.800
But then again, it's only five bucks.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.680
I don't know.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.040
Five bucks is still a lot, I guess.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.160
So I don't know.

57:36.160 --> 57:39.440
But then again, I'm also kind of like, you know, as much as I think that's cool,

57:39.440 --> 57:40.640
they're making it free again.

57:41.520 --> 57:46.400
Unless this new remastered internet channel somehow made it a lot faster

57:46.400 --> 57:48.160
to browse the internet on the Wii,

57:48.160 --> 57:49.520
I don't think it's going to be that great.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.040
Like browsing the internet on the Wii is kind of slow.

57:53.040 --> 57:53.840
Yeah.

57:53.840 --> 57:56.240
You know, I don't know.

57:56.240 --> 57:58.880
And what did you do when you were only dial-up?

57:58.880 --> 58:00.400
Hmm.

58:00.400 --> 58:04.640
I lived in an age where I only expected things to come in at a dial-up rate.

58:04.640 --> 58:08.560
The games I was downloading were much smaller and would fit on a three and a half inch disc.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.120
Remember that?

58:09.120 --> 58:10.560
I had a download-

58:10.560 --> 58:12.880
I remember having Descent spread across 14 of them.

58:12.880 --> 58:13.360
Yeah.

58:13.360 --> 58:17.520
Remember when an epic game, you knew it was epic like King's Quest 6

58:17.520 --> 58:19.760
because it had seven discs that it came on?

58:19.760 --> 58:20.000
Yeah.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.360
Or Phantasmagoria, which was on seven CDs.

58:23.360 --> 58:26.800
I used to download overnight and I used to have a download accelerator

58:26.800 --> 58:31.280
to basically queue up a bunch of stuff to download.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.280
That was my thing.

58:33.280 --> 58:33.680
Yeah.

58:33.680 --> 58:34.000
Nice.

58:34.800 --> 58:37.040
And some folks in chat want to clarify,

58:37.040 --> 58:39.120
X-Link says the credit was only for Japan.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.560
Actually, no, it did open up.

58:40.560 --> 58:41.920
Go check out Nintendo.com.

58:42.640 --> 58:47.280
It is now, there is just a NES virtual console download credit that you can get now

58:47.280 --> 58:49.200
and it's not 500 points clarifies.

58:49.200 --> 58:53.920
Deep Bandit is a free NES game. That's right. It's basically a credit towards a free

58:53.920 --> 58:56.880
NES virtual console game, which of course is 500 points,

58:56.880 --> 59:00.560
but you can't like take the 500 points and apply it towards a Sega game or something else.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.000
Has to be an NES game.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.600
So there you go.

59:04.240 --> 59:04.560
All right.

59:05.360 --> 59:06.480
Let's move on with some more news.

59:09.840 --> 59:11.280
It would help if my brain worked.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.040
Yes, it would.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.480
It's kind of required to do a show.

59:14.480 --> 59:23.040
Well, actually, you know, the new Halo, the Halo 3 ODST is supposed to be coming out

59:23.040 --> 59:27.600
and it has a launch date of September 22nd from, of course, Xbox 360.

59:27.600 --> 59:32.240
But there are people out there who are playing illegitimate copies,

59:32.240 --> 59:38.400
meaning they either have a burn of some kind or received a copy that they weren't supposed to receive.

59:38.400 --> 59:47.040
And so the big Microsoft enforcer dude went on Twitter and said, and I quote,

59:47.040 --> 59:50.560
I spy with my little eye, some illegitimate ODST players.

59:50.560 --> 59:52.880
No early play for you commencing perma-bands.

59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.160
And except for those who actually have legit copies, like early, you know,

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.600
actual true early copies for reviewers and that type of thing, they're okay.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.440
Or if you have an actual legit copy of the game that you happen to get early,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.040
then that's okay too, apparently.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.200
I don't understand why people are playing the one that's out there now,

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.840
because the leaked one that's out there is actually in French.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.840
I'm kind of curious.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.360
Some people know French.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.080
Yeah, that's true.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.680
I'm kind of curious.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.720
I mean, we import Japanese games, even though we can't read Japanese.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.280
Come on.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.520
I'm kind of curious, though.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.440
How are they able to spot the difference?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.800
Well, I mean, I'm not sure.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.520
I'm kind of curious, though, how are they able to spot the difference?

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.760
Or is that some type of secret they're not saying?

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.720
There's no word on it.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.160
They're claiming that's a secret.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.200
I don't think they know.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.120
I think they're just going after whomever.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.280
But what if they get it wrong?

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.000
I think you're wrong.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.600
I mean, there's got to be a way that they know.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.120
There's a way they can tell the difference.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.760
That's what they're doing.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.880
They're basically...

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.080
Or is this a scare tactic?

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.360
I think it's a scare tactic.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.400
And the other thing I think is, you know, if you want to think, you know,

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.280
the real conspiracy theory to it is that people are thinking that this is actually a copy

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.320
that they leaked out that's modified in a way that they can flag people that have played

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.280
it or something like that, which would be entrapment, but I don't see how they were

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:11.680
doing that.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.480
I'm guessing that it's because you're going to see a bunch of people from, you know, all

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.880
playing this French-English version of it, like in the United States or something like

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.200
that, and people are going to be like, huh, I'm pretty sure that they didn't buy that

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.600
from, you know, wherever it was released at.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.480
It's probably going to be a hacked, you know, console that's playing it.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.000
Whereas, you know, if they actually are playing, you know, the U.S. version or something in

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.240
U.S., then that might be different.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.640
They're just going to look at regions is basically what it is.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.320
Because no one's going to import...

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.680
First off, the game's not even readily available there yet, I don't think.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.880
And also, no one's really going to import a game.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.800
It's going to be very rare if that happens.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.280
I like Act F's comments in chat right now at chat.orangetheonsready.com.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.160
Je n'est-ce si d'une weapon, je suis MasterChef.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.680
MasterChef...

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.720
Oh, he put Chef, but it's supposed to be Chief.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.600
That's why I read Chef.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.920
Although I would like a game called MasterChef to come out next to Cooking Mama.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.400
Anyhow, Dekeman in chat says it's the same way they tell if people are playing burn games

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:14.880
online.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.360
They can't.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.000
A lot of the new stuff that's out there now makes it very difficult for them to do that.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.040
They're really stealth.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.960
I would know, I played modified Grand Theft Auto IV's for like, what, how many months

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.680
now?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.800
Yeah, it's still risky.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.720
You know, it's risky to get into.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.240
All right.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.560
Let's go around the globe and explore some upcoming release dates from around the globe.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.800
All right.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.320
Well, in the US, there's actually quite a bit coming out this week.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.560
It's kind of kicking off, not really the fourth quarter because it's a little early for that,

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.040
but you know, the major gaming season.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.560
So starting off, we have Raiden IV.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.600
The wonderful shooter game is coming to Xbox 360 this week.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:06.000
Also, Mini Ninjas is going to be coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and DS.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.160
Kind of a little family action game.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.800
Darkness of Days is coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.080
It's a game where you can go back to the Civil War with a machine gun and blow everybody

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.400
away.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.280
Cool.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.440
That's what I was talking about earlier, right?

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.560
It's going to be awesome.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.120
Seriously.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Trine coming to PC this week.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.840
This guy had two Dark Hero Days on PSP.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.000
War Leader Clash of Nations on PC.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.240
Also, Fallen Earth, Welcome to the Apocalypse on PC.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.920
Go play City Sports on the Wii.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.720
He had another sports game collection.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.920
All this one has rooftop hockey, so I kind of have to think of a little bit of Clerks

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.320
there.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.360
That was kind of funny.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:57.280
Cubed, the Q games collection coming to Xbox 360 with your resin, every extend extra extreme.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.400
Time of Shadows on PC.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.360
Dirt 2 coming to PlayStation 3, DS, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.960
And I thought PSP as well.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.480
Imagine Detectives on DS.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:25.120
Aisle 2, Sturmovik, Birds of Prey coming to Xbox 360, PS3, DS, and PSP.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.520
Capcom Platinum Hits Triple Back, that wonderful collection of three games including Dead Rising,

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.760
Lost Planet, and Devil May Cry 4 coming to the 360 this week.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:44.640
Ant Nation on the DS, kind of, I guess, your kids' first real-time strategy game.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.440
Little Big Planet, Game of the Year edition coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.240
And of course the big one, the Beatles Rock Band coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.920
the Wii, as well as the standalone instruments and your two different bundles that are available

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.400
for that.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.240
Finally, if you have little kids that want to learn to read, they have three different

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.680
games for you for the DS, my virtual tutor reading K through first, pre-K through K,

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.600
and first through second.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:20.000
Also coming out, actually about a week from today, two new DSi colors, both white and

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.440
then pink, and then also a week from today, you're getting two more DS games.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.160
Princess in Love and My Boyfriend, both kind of like dating sim games.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:37.040
And then finally, you're going to be getting Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.000
is actually coming out a week from Monday.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.840
And that's it.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.000
Busy week, especially with Beatles Rock Band, of course, being the anchor for the week.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.640
Yeah.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.080
Hey, going to Japan and looking at the release dates over there.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.080
There is a new Xbox 360 Elite, one of those new bundles coming out over in Japan.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.200
I think that's a little bit of a price reduction for them, if I'm not mistaken.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.520
The last remnant, speaking of price reductions, is getting one this week on the 360, as is

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:06.080
Fable 2, both of those games moving into the Platinum Collection, as well as Call of Duty

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.480
4 Modern Warfare and Bioshock.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.920
So I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft's doing a little push in Japan right now with

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.360
all these recent price drops.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.000
That's all happening on the 10th of this month.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.480
Also happening on the 10th of this month, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, the Japanese

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.720
localized version, is out on the PlayStation 3, so check that out.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.120
As well as, of course, a price drop as well for Call of Duty 4 over there as well.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.400
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.880
Forever Blue 2 next week, but not this week.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.760
Also another House of the Dead game, but we'll cover that next week.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.480
PlayStation 2, nothing this week either.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.480
It's all on the 17th of September.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.640
There's not much coming out on PlayStation 2 right now.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.440
There's really not.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.760
I think you're going to kind of see that phasing out slowly but surely.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.640
Nintendo DS does have a new game called Arabians Lost that's coming out from Prototype over

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.840
in Japan this week.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.920
That game looks to be, they are calling this an adventure game.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.280
I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots from this to see what type of game it is.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.280
Looks like it's just kind of a standard role playing-ish type of game, but it doesn't look

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.320
like it has battles.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.640
But the subtitle of this game is called The Engagement on Desert.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.200
I'm guessing it's just kind of like an interactive manga type of game with hit points and stuff.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.400
That's what that is.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.360
Let's see if there's anything on the PSP to mention this week.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.840
Yes, there's a portable Navi 3, which I think is just one of those Navigator programs that

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.440
they have available on PSP.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.000
If you want to change your PSP into a GPS, which really will probably only help you if

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.360
you live in Japan.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.000
But there you go.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.240
That's what you got for Japanese releases this week.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.160
Well, for the UK, we have some, I mean, pretty much the standard stuff.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.000
On the 9th is Beatles Rock Band.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.360
On the 11th, we have Championship Manager 2010, Colin McRae Dirt 2, yay, Guitar Hero

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:56.720
5, Mini Ninjas, NHL 2K10, and Section 8.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.880
Also, Rob, there's something on the 15th that you might be interested in, Zuma's Revenge.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.560
Ah, I've heard about this.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.160
I think this has a similar release date here in the US if it's not out already.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, it's kind of like a sequel to Zuma.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.080
Not my favorite PopCap game.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.760
My problem with Zuma is it's not something you can sit down and play quickly, like a

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.960
game of Bejeweled or something.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.280
Zuma takes a long time to get through a game because not only does it take a long time

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.640
to beat each level, but then you have three lives.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:29.120
So I'm not as big on Zuma, but there are other PopCap games I really enjoy.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.400
And I know, I still got a copy of Bookworm Adventures 2 I need to play.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400
No, don't laugh.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400
It's an awesome game.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.400
I know, I know.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.400
I'm laughing because I've played it.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400
It's fun.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.400
It's a lot of fun.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.680
It's Final Fantasy meets Boggle.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.080
It's amazing.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.440
So I do want to check out the sequel.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.040
By the way, Rob, I have to say, I like your shirt and all of its Helvetica-ness.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040
Thank you.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.720
And for those, maybe Jamie will take a picture of it, but for those at home, because we are

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.040
a radio show and not a TV show, I'm wearing a shirt and I guess Jamie is going to put

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.920
a picture on our website right now in the picture gallery at www.orangetonsradio.com,

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.160
but it says Ms. Scarlet in the hall with a revolver, and it has a little picture of a

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.160
gun.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160
And as said in Helvetica.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160
Yes.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.560
You and your font wholeness.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.160
No, it's Helvetica, I swear.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.680
Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680
All right.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.440
So let's move on, a couple more stories for you before we get to the classic game of the

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440
week.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Yes.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.920
This week, we had the debut of the new trailer for the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.440
4, The Ballad of Gay Tony.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.920
And with that, there is actually, it looks like that's going to be returning back to

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.440
kind of the over-the-top Grand Theft Auto fun that you can expect from the rest of the

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.880
series.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.920
Some new stuff to note in there, there are some new weapons that they did kind of show

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.240
off in the trailer, a new machine gun that they had in there, I'm not really sure what

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.240
that was.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.520
I did spot a P90 though, because I have that, it's one of my first Airsoft guns.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.800
So there is a P90 in the game.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.400
Some new helicopters, apparently it's going to focus a lot on aerial combat, they did

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.320
show off a new helicopter that fired rockets, as well as another one that was a kind of

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:13.120
a cargo helicopter picking up a subway car, which is kind of cool.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.920
They had a golf cart in there as well, and some new sports cars.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.400
So that's going to be kind of fun.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.080
Did you notice what the song in the trailer was?

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.480
Yes I did.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480
I thought that was quite...

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.080
Those that listen to the Orange Laundry after birth that we only do live for a little bit

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.940
after we tape live will understand why that's funny.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:37.940
And then also, they had, apparently there was some other stuff rumored that there's

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:44.080
a FIB tank in the game, like their SWAT tank or something.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.600
And I don't know, it's going to be awesome.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.760
I'm looking forward to this because they ruined my modded game.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:56.640
So right now, I'm seriously, it's like we're coming out of depression or something.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.520
Going back to playing the normal game is just wrong.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.760
There are some pretty cool stuff coming for that.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.760
Also out of the trailer though, of course they had a lot of different cut scenes in

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.860
there and they recognized some of the characters.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:17.400
One of them I was kind of interested by is Gracie, which was actually one of the missions

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.400
in Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400
You have to kidnap her, which is kind of funny.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.560
But she's in there as well.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.240
And overall looks awesome.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.200
Okay, because I'm not as big of a Grand Theft Auto IV player as you are, who is Gay Tony?

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200
He's like a mob boss?

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.560
Yeah, he's a mob boss.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.400
He's Tony Prince is the guy.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:42.720
He basically owns nightclubs and he's a member of the Ancelotti Crime Syndicate.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:50.780
And basically, he owns the biggest gay and straight nightclubs in Algonquin.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.960
So that's who you play.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:59.160
You don't play him, but you play a guy that kind of helps him out, Luis Fernando Lopez.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.400
Which is like this Dominican guy that you play as.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.320
He's his bodyguard.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:11.200
And the games, all three episodes, including the main game, all kind of culminate around

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.000
this diamond deal that goes down and goes wrong.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And that's the Impossible Trinity is each one of their roles in this diamond deal.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And if I remember correctly, I think Luis comes in and actually breaks up the diamond

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.040
deal and tries to steal the diamonds.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.440
So that's definitely going to be part of the game.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.080
I got a weird question for you, but as the gay guy on the program and who isn't as familiar

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.660
with Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm kind of curious, not to get all glad on you, but I'm curious,

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:44.400
is this a step forward for gay rights or is this going to be a bunch of stereotypes?

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.880
Does gay Tony go around going, that's super!

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.320
No, he didn't really do that.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.880
There was a character, though, in Grand Theft Auto IV that was like that.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.720
I don't remember his name, but yeah, he was very flamboyant.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.480
But he didn't seem flamboyant in the trailer, of course he wasn't talking much, but I don't

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.480
think he is.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.600
Because, you know, I'm totally cool with it if it's like, you know, hey, you have a gay

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.540
character who's like a cool mob boss and all this stuff just like anybody else.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:14.300
But if it's just going to be stereotype after stereotype, then I'm just going to have face

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.300
palm.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.840
Well, I don't think it's going to be.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.400
I mean, they're usually pretty, you know...

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, I know, Rockstar's pretty good about that stuff usually, so I'm hopeful, but you

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
know.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.480
I don't want that anymore Full Frontal Penis again, because that was enough in the last

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.480
game.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480
We don't need Full Frontal Penis in this game.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.720
But you wouldn't have any problem with full boobage and everything.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.000
Yeah, because they haven't done that in this game, and I'm surprised, it being an emirated

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.960
game and stuff, you know, for nudity and that kind of stuff.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960
There's no...

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.160
It's establishment of a double standard, you don't want to see cock, but you don't mind

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160
seeing boobs.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160
No, I don't want to see more cock.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.720
There already is cock in the game.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.560
Now I want to see boobs that go along with the cock so we have an equal representation.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560
Equal representation.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.120
Equal opportunity nudity.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.000
I actually support his statement.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm just saying...

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.740
I can go for equal opportunity nudity.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.920
I don't have a problem with it, I'm just saying that they need to like, you know, I think

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.760
the stripper should be nude in the games, you know, that's only...

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760
It's a strip club.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.880
They're supposed to be stripping.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.720
Well, if they sell alcohol, then they can't get naked, can they?

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.760
Well, that's the only thing only in California, I don't know, but whatever.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760
It's a game.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760
What the hell do I care?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.480
It's just characters.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.600
I just want... but it's just funny how there's a lot of people out there that says, oh, because

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.840
it's gay Tony, I hope we don't have to see more cock.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.440
You know, I hope just for that, you get beaver shot in this, just for that kind of ignorant

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.440
comment.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.440
It's going to be cool.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.760
This game's going to be awesome, and I'm just hoping though that they bring back the tank,

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.240
because the tanks are awesome, the minigun, the flamethrower, and the chainsaw.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240
That's it.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.840
But already I like where they're going with it, so I can't wait to play it.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.000
One more story for you guys, and then we're going to go to the classic game of the week,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.960
and this story has to actually do with the 360, where this download content is.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.160
By the way, random-ass question.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.800
When they announce the Grand Theft Auto IV exclusive content, it is never coming to the

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.200
PlayStation 3.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.200
Is that correct?

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.680
As far as we're aware.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.400
But maybe someday they might say, okay, window's over, we're going to release this disc now

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400
on PlayStation 3.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400
Let me put it this way.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.760
It could be ported in a heartbeat.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.760
Yeah, I can see that.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.080
I'm just kind of curious.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.720
I mean, since all the formats are basically the same, it's just recoding the textures

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720
and that's it.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720
All right.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.320
Well, going back to the 360 a little bit, something changed in their technical certification

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.420
requirements this week that is a little bit interesting, and the word comes from develop.

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.400
It was the technical director David Jeffries, who works for BlackRock Studio.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:45.040
He actually mentioned that Microsoft actually removed the fact that 360s must run at a minimum

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.760
of 1280 by 720, which you know as 720p.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:55.000
If the system is in HD mode, and apparently anti-aliasing is also out, full screen anti-aliasing

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.120
you do not have to do.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.240
Those requirements are now out.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:07.460
Now Microsoft kind of was lenient on these rules before, and one very, very notable game

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:11.640
that got around these rules is Halo 3, because you might remember, and I remember some stories

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.080
on this when Halo 3 first came out, it's not running in true 720p.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:21.280
It's running at 1152 by 640, so it's 100 pixels short on either side.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.680
Apparently Call of Duty 4 is also 600p also.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.680
Interesting.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.720
I don't think this is a huge deal, because I'm all about frame rate a little more than

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.720
resolution.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.960
Granted, a great game should have both great resolution and good frame rate, something

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.640
like Oblivion or whatever, but some of the games that get really busy online they have

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.080
to scale back the resolution a little bit.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.560
Why now though, I'm kind of wondering, that they decided to get rid of this?

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.600
Is this because maybe 360 has enough penetration in the marketplace now, so they don't need

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:03.560
to be advertising all this HD HD HD?

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:09.960
Maybe there's a big game coming out that didn't have this or something, and they figured that

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.880
hey, let's make this available so that it's fair for everybody.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.920
I don't know, maybe it makes it easier to develop on the system.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.800
Alpha Kinanagram has an interesting thought.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.840
Maybe it's for the indie games.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.080
I don't know if the indie games were ever held to the same standard.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.080
I don't think so.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080
I don't think so either.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.080
There's no way.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.080
It's a good thought though.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.880
Yeah, because I don't think a lot of the indie games I've played have full screen anti-aliasing.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.920
I'm trying to think if that actually, hmm, anyway.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.400
Well there it is, the technical certifications are changing so we'll see what games come

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.360
of that a little later on, but for now, let's go to a classic video game in a little segment.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.440
We'd like to call it the classic video game of the week.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.880
This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer likes to browse the gaming vault and find

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.240
a game that she says, you know what?

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.660
You kids should be playing this game this week, or at least check it out and show this

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.660
game a little respect.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.440
Dark Soccer, what game did you pick for the kids this week?

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.840
I think Chew Chew Rocket, but we have to hear the very beginning of the clip though because

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.880
it's important.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.200
Fair enough, it's loading right now.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.760
That was what was important.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760
Why?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760
Because it's Sonic Team.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.480
Alright, tell us a little bit about Chew Chew Rocket.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.120
Just out of curiosity, does this have to do with the fact that 99 of 09 is this week?

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.680
No, actually, it has to do with Dan Fussing because I don't put in games he suggests,

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.720
or I already have put in games that he suggested.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720
So Catmania.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.760
So yeah, I put in Chew Chew Rocket.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.600
So this was one of the first of the online games that came on the Dreamcast, and then

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:54.240
they just started giving it away with the Dreamcast as an online demo, and it was also

01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:00.380
given away free in Europe when you would order a copy, well you could order your copy by

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:06.240
connecting to the Dream Arena service, but the whole point of the game is to get mice,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.840
as in Chew Chew, because in Japanese that's the sound a mouse makes, it's Chew.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:19.080
You get them onto a rocket while avoiding the cats, or the kapu kapu, that roam around

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.960
the board.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.360
You have to place down arrows to determine the path the mice are going to take, because

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.240
they just keep going in a straight line until they run into a wall, so you have to point

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.500
them in the direction that they're supposed to go.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:39.960
And you can do it up to four player multiplayer, and you can put the arrows everywhere, so

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.840
you can direct other people's mice away, you can direct yours forward, and like you were

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:51.480
saying with the Catmania, there's different obstacles, like Catmania means you have all

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.080
cats running around and you have to get them away from your ship, because if a cat hits

01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:00.040
your ship, then it damages your ship.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.160
And you can get special colored mice, like a gold mouse will give you 50 extra mice,

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:11.840
a pink mouse gives you those events like we were talking about, the Catmania, the Mousemania.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:19.080
But the single player mode is actually I think my favorite, because it's really, it's really,

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.320
it gets super complex, it really turns into a matter of figuring out how you're going

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.720
to get from point A to point B when you've got all these obstacles in your path and all

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.040
you have is a limited number of arrows.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.520
This game is fucking fast paced too, I mean that was my biggest problem with it, it was

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.160
too fast for me to keep up with.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.960
They need to like, chew chew slow.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:46.000
Well you also got a challenge mode where you have to get all the mice into rockets or get

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.320
a cat to eat all the mice, or put the cat into a guarded rocket or other stuff and you

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:58.800
had a time limit on it and it had 25 levels, you could do that actually one or two player

01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800
or two.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:07.080
There's a Game Boy Advance version that's really the same as the Dreamcast version but

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.120
you can actually play with one cartridge multiplayer.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:16.320
So multiple people, well you also had a level editor in it too.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.680
And actually the Game Boy Advance version wasn't made by Sega.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.800
Also in Sonic Battle, Tails has a choo-choo for his landmine.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:37.400
So yeah, it's a pretty fun little game, and it's just fun, play it.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400
Alright.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400
Get Dreamcast!

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:46.440
The choo-choo rocket, which Jamie swears has nothing to do with the 9-9-0-0-9 or 99 whatever

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440
you want to call it.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440
The anniversary of the Dreamcast this week.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.440
It's the classic game of the week.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.440
Choo.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.440
Choo.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.440
Alright.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.960
We're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.160
We always like to take a break in the middle of the show to just kind of stretch, you know,

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.160
refill our drinks or go to the restroom or what have you.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.000
So we suggest you take an opportunity to do the same because there is plenty more to come

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.240
in Part B of our show tonight, including Twitter topics, rapid fire news tonight, and more

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.240
long discussion.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.120
We're going to talk about Blur, which is a racing game I am really looking forward to.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.080
It's Damon Allburn.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080
Not that.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080
Blur.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080
Blur the racing game, silly.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.440
We're going to talk about a brand new reality show coming to Sony, PlayStation Network,

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.200
it sounds kind of interesting would be the word for it, and 3D, possibly on the PlayStation

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200
3.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.560
Some interesting developments with that this week.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.320
So we're going to do all that right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:41.720
Stay tuned.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.560
Welcome back everybody to Part B of our podcast.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.200
We're taping live on this Sunday evening, September 6, 2009.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.360
Happy Labor Day to all of our American listeners who will get tomorrow off of work or, you

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.640
know, if it's not America that you're from, then just have a happy Monday or happy week

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640
wherever you're at.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.680
We're going to get into some more gaming news as we tape live on this Sunday evening at

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.360
www.allgames.com.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.280
And we have Bobby Blackwolf joining us earlier in the show live from Seattle where he had

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.260
just wrapped up Penny Arcade Expo, which just came to a close earlier.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:20.600
Any word on what the final game was and their little PAX, what do they call that?

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.600
The little PAX?

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.600
Omega-thon.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:23.600
Omega-thon.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600
Thank you.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600
Any word on what the final game was yet?

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.720
Does that hit the internet?

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.640
I don't think I've seen it on the internet, but I will look.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.000
All right, yeah, check that out because I'm curious.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I'm sure somebody in chat.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.600
The lovely thing about having a chat room during the show is that they are there to

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.420
yell things out when...

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.560
And the final Omega-thon was skee-ball.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.920
Skee-ball.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920
That's rad.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.920
They actually wheeled out a machine and...

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.920
Yes, they did.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.320
Oh, that's awesome.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.640
Props.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.840
Mega-props to you guys.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840
Oh, my God.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.860
No pressure or anything, but can you imagine the amount of pressure that it all comes down

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.360
to skee-ball?

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.960
That reminds me, though, there was a pricing game on The Price is Right, you know, because

01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960
your shirt reminds me of this, too.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.560
Loki's wearing a Price is Right shirt today, everybody.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.720
You should see it.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.400
There was a skee-ball game that, like, if you could hit the target on the skee-ball,

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400
you'd win, like, a new car.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.160
Like, there's almost as much pressure.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.000
Well, it's like, okay, so the rounds as it went...

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.860
The first round was Mario Kart Wii.

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.600
The second round was Bookworm Adventures.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.760
Round three was Halo 3 ODST.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.760
Round four was the Beatles Rock Band.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.480
Round five was Connect Four, and then, of course, the final round being skee-ball.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:32.600
Very interesting, because you have, like, some new games mixed with some board games.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.840
Very good mix at the Omega-thon this year.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840
Awesome.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840
All right.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.480
We're going to get back into our show tonight.

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.680
We're going to start off with some Twitter topics.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.600
Oh, we have theme song now for Twitter topics, don't we?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.840
I totally forgot to queue it up.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.040
I'm a bad host tonight.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040
Fired!

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.760
Hold on a minute.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760
Let me get the theme song here.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.620
Only if we get to use fire.

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.440
Any exciting plans for Labor Day, you guys?

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.440
I'm going to sleep.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440
Yeah?

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440
Rob.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440
What?

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440
We have to do something tomorrow.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440
Maybe.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.440
We'll see.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440
I kind of want to just stay in and play WoW all day.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.320
Well, I know what's going on tonight.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320
What's that?

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.000
Becky's going to come over tonight, and we're going to watch My Fair Lady.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Fun!

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.800
Any reason why you were just deciding to get into old-school musicals, just for the fun

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.960
of it?

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.880
I really don't remember how to, except that it was very random.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.760
Nothing wrong with that.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.040
We're thinking about going to yoga after the show.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.040
You should come with us.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.000
I'll go to yoga, but I'm probably not going to stay for the movie.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Oh, come on.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I got other stuff I want to do at home.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
What, like sleep?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yeah, actually.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.520
All right, I found the music.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.960
Let's get into the chatters and the listeners of Orange Islands Radio, showing us their

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.640
tweets.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.160
We can't read them all tonight, guys.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.400
We got a lot.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400
We got a lot tonight.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.400
We can't read them all.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.240
I'm going to be offended if we get yours.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:00.680
Fernando asked the very first question, what if there was a mariachi band as a game?

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.880
It might sound a little like our background music.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.280
Let's play a mariachi game.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.600
I would totally play one, but I think the novelty would honestly wear off.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.760
Let's be honest.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.440
There was that tambourine game.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.880
I don't know if you've ever seen this, but the makers of Samba de Amigo, at least in

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.600
the arcade, also made a tambourine game, and I forget the name of this game.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.840
It is the gayest game I've ever played in my life, and I use that term to mean really

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:30.520
homosexual, like this would sleep with other tambourine games of the same gender, okay?

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:36.220
This was, wow, like gayer than Stevie Nicks, but it was a lot of fun, actually, and it's

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.540
the closest thing I think I've played to an actual mariachi band.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.540
So there you go.

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.240
Not that I'm saying mariachi's gay, but just, you know, I don't know why the tambourine music

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.320
and the whole Samba thing kind of reminds me.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.760
It's like the closest that we've had.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.240
Tigerclaw305 says, there's a story here he's linking us to.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.060
The creator of Mobile Suit Gundam says that video games are evil, and links us to a story

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.560
that ran on Gamasutra earlier this week.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:10.280
Apparently Yoshiyuki Tomino gave a keynote speech at the CEDEC Game Conference and said,

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.340
quote, I think that video games are evil.

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:17.680
Gaming is not a type of activity that provides any support to our daily lives, and all these

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.320
consoles are just consuming electricity.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.760
Let's say we have about 3 billion people on this planet wasting their time bringing no

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.240
productivity at all.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.440
Add 10 billion more people, and what would happen to our planet?

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.000
Video games are assisting the death of our planet.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.800
Okay crazy man, way to bite the hand that feeds you, right?

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.680
I don't know, why would he say something like that?

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.000
I don't know.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.720
Gundam is on like every fucking game platform ever in Japan.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.700
Way to be a sellout.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:50.840
Maybe the speech was like irony and we just don't get it, I don't know.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.440
Retertainment wants us to talk about this topic.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.800
Most people complain that early adopters are getting screwed over, does the PS3 Slim mean

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.480
it the other way around?

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:07.280
That's kind of been true of Sony for a long time, well at least in this generation.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.040
If you didn't buy a PlayStation 3 when they first came out, you didn't get backwards compatibility.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.280
Or you didn't get the extra USB slots were on there for a while, then there were some

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.500
other on-board ports, right?

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.640
So it's not like the Slim is anything new for Sony this generation, but if you didn't

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.480
want the machine to cost $600, they had to cut corners somewhere.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.360
But I do find the whole lack of even software emulation and the removal of Linux, I do find

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360
that odd.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360
Like the rest of it I get.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.360
I get why they take out USB slots, I get some of this other stuff.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.400
I get that the Slim might have a slightly longer loading time.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.960
The rest of this I don't think I get.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960
Does that make sense?

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960
It makes sense.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.560
I don't understand why they removed Linux, I mean I understand that maybe no one's used

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.520
in that function, but I don't see how that function really did anything, unless people

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:59.240
found a way to hack the PS3 through Linux, which I don't know.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.240
I haven't heard of that.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.960
It actually would be fairly easy using Linux I would think.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.120
No, I think they keep everything separated, but I don't understand.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120
Whatever.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.240
All right, well, we're also going to move on to another Twitter topic.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.320
This comes from a friend of mine, The Segg, on Twitter, and he actually wants us to name

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.680
drop something he's going to be working with in the next couple months, and he's already

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.840
working on it now, FundaRazor.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.200
That of course is a nice fancy way of saying fundraiser, which is a fundraiser for the

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.320
Child's Play charity, and it's a national event that's going to be happening this December.

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.600
San Francisco, Austin, New York City, Portland, Denver.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.960
If you want more information, I urge you to follow them on Twitter.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.880
They're at Twitter.com slash FundaRazor.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.440
I just linked it in chat.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.440
F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:52.160
They only have 10 followers right now.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160
It's for charity.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.160
They should have 10,000.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160
Check out that event near you.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.280
I'm going to try and go to the one in San Francisco.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.720
In fact, I'm pretty sure I will be going.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.960
Well, I kind of told Segg I would, so I'm going to go, and then probably take the next

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:03.960
day off work so I can go.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960
I'd like to go.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:05.960
You want to go?

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960
Sure.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.960
We'll cover it for OLR.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:08.960
That sounds great.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.120
Maybe we can get some swanky press access or something.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.920
I'll have to talk and see if we can get a hookup.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.920
That'll be fun.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.920
That would be.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.920
But you know what?

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.920
It's not about that.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.920
It's about a good cause.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.880
And you know, between the marathon we talked about last week that unfortunately I got so

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.640
busy this week I couldn't follow up on that, but there's the marathon we're going to do

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.600
October 17th.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.600
I will hopefully have all the details on that next week.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.420
There's a lot of great stuff coming this holiday season.

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:37.760
As I understand it, FundaRazor is also on Facebook.

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.200
And wants some more fans on Facebook.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.040
I don't think I'm following them on Facebook yet, so I will go add them myself a little

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040
later in the show.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.000
But again, that's F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And K.O.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.200
Ray is reminding us about Extra Life, which is the marathon that's also happening on October

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.440
17th that we talked about last week.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.400
Extra Life SG is their Twitter.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:00.400
So two great events, one in October, one in December.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:01.400
Do them both.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.680
Think of the children, damn you.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.200
And how crunchy they are.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.200
Shush.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:13.680
Spazinator says, PlayStation 3 firmware 3.0 unannounced or hidden feature.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.960
The addition of print screen and screenshot to the web browser.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960
I was not aware.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.960
That's kind of interesting.

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.280
I mean, nothing you can't already do on a PC, but I guess it's kind of nice to have

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.280
that on the PlayStation.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.500
You know that screenshotting is coming to home as well.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.280
And they're going to do like a first person view so you can screenshot there.

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.160
So check that out.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.240
I think that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.840
All right, I'll do one more.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840
K.O.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.880
Ray says, just beat Batman Arkham Asylum.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.880
What do you guys think of it?

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:44.880
That game was beautiful.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.400
And Dan was playing a lot of it while Misty was here.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.560
And of course, and who's also here right now, our other friend Mystique.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.600
So we had Misty and Misty and me making commentary the entire time.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.160
We were doing the MST3K version of Batman Arkham Asylum and it was pretty funny.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.640
And then every time Harley came out, I was like, Harley.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.640
So yeah, pretty good.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.600
But I wish it had more of an ending.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:14.320
I know you're a fan girl of the comics, so how in the series?

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.320
What I'm not.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.320
I don't like DC Comics.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.960
I thought you were like the show, not the I'm sorry, I'm at the comic book show.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.840
You know, I watch some of the animated series.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.480
I'm not the world's biggest Batman fan.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.480
I just like that.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.480
Dan loves it.

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.480
Dan loves it.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.480
I am not.

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.120
Mystique just came in and let's see.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.600
Has Mystique ever been on the show?

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.600
No.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:33.600
Come here, Mystique.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:34.600
Wait, come here, come here.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.600
Let's end Twitter topics.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600
Let's talk to Mystique for a little bit.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600
Hi, Mystique.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.600
How are you?

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.600
Hey, what's up?

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.600
Good.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.600
Just be, just be, talk loud and strong in that microphone because it's kind of sensitive.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.600
You don't want me to be loud.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.600
All right.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.600
You don't want me to be that loud.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.440
What do you, uh, you hold in your hand a bunch of DC, what is this DVDs of movies?

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.440
Yes.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440
Yeah.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.080
It is Superman, the animated series and Justice League Unlimited.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:59.020
Are you guys going to a Mystery Science 3000 that like the movie you were watching last

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.020
week when I was here?

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.020
Possibly.

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.020
Possibly.

01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:06.720
Uh, oh, there might be, there might be a fighting going on over the TV.

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.120
There's going to be a throw down.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.120
Oh, there's going to be a throw down.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.800
Uh, what do you think of Batman Arkham Asylum?

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.840
I cannot wait to play that game, even though I watched a lot of it with Dan, although I'm

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.400
really upset that I can't play the Joker and the Xbox 360.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.440
Oh, because he has the 360 version.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.240
And he just, he just had to tell me after I made a decision of which one I was going

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.240
to buy.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.240
I'm like, hmm.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.980
Both of them went down in price.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:35.160
You know, I think I'm going to get the 360 since I have an, I have Netflix and all that.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.900
And then Dan had to go and tell me, you know, on the PS3 you can play the Joker.

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.000
I was like, you're a bastard.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.760
Only in one mode.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760
I don't care.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760
It's only a little piece of the game.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.640
By the way, I'm loving the purple hair matching glasses, matching the top.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.640
That is perfect today.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.640
It's my signature color.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640
That's right.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640
All right.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.960
Well thank you Mystique for being on the show and have fun with your movies.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.960
Okay.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:54.960
New problem.

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:55.960
All right.

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.960
We like having new people.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.960
Better play the death hill when Becky comes over because we are totally watching My Fair

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.960
Lady.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:06.560
So we, we have not had guests a lot in the studio dark room's freaking small, very small

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.560
space.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.640
Dan, I think we need a bigger box.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.640
All right.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.120
It's time to get a bigger boat.

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.120
Salsa shark.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.120
All right.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120
Twitter topics.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.120
We're done with that for tonight.

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.560
So thank you guys very much for contributing to Twitter topics.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.160
Let's get back into some gaming news.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.940
Actually rapid fire news is up next.

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:25.160
So some quick gaming news starting from Loki.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.160
Yes.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.560
The card too, of course, is getting a collector's edition, which will be coming out with the

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.400
game in October.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.080
And with the collector's edition, you will be able to get a replica knife.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.080
Yes.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.520
Because that's what gamers need things to stab stuff with.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.520
I want a knife.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.520
Yes.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.520
Now that's a knife.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.920
Yes.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.200
It's the Fortune Hunter edition and it does come with the replica of the game's mystery,

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.640
mysterious ancient artifact.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.760
And I don't know.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:03.160
But yeah, it is going to be very limited and I guess apparently only available through

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:07.720
GameStop, which, you know, they get all the limited editions nowadays.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.920
I don't know why.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:16.480
Konami in kind of a strange turn of events is publishing the new 99 Nights game, 99 Nights

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.560
2, which judging by the screenshot looks way better than the first one.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.560
And yeah, it's pretty awesome.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.800
But right now it's scheduled to come out in Japan soon.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.960
No word on when it's coming out over here, but you better believe it'll be coming out

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.960
over here at some point.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.360
Probably next year, because that's when all the games are coming out.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:42.880
And then finally, Guitar Hero 5 has a lot of download content coming its way for the

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.480
month of September.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.660
Starting things off next week on September 10th, you're going to be getting the Street

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:55.920
Sweeper Social Club Track Pack, which includes 100 Little Curses, Fight Smash Win, and Somewhere

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.640
in the World It's Midnight, all available for $2 or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.640
Points.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:09.280
And the week after that, they're going to be getting the AFI Track Pack, which is going

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.800
to include Beautiful Thieves, Girls Not Gray, and The Missing Frame, also available for

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.160
$2 each or 160 Microsoft Points.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:24.720
Or of course, the track packs as a whole you can buy in a bundle for $5.49.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.280
And then finally, September 24th, we'll be getting another track pack.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.840
No name for this track pack, but apparently it includes The Editors with Munich, Faint

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:43.000
with Geeks Were Right, and the Yaya Yas with Dull Life, and also available for $2 each

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.120
or $5.49 for the pack.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.560
And that's it.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.200
All right, moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.000
A new WiiWare game has been announced.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.520
It's Bit.Trip Void, if that sounds familiar.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.720
It's because you probably played Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Chord, I'm sorry, Bit.Trip

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720
Core.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.640
Void is coming out, of course, in the Bit.Trip fashion.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.840
It kind of looks like the Atari 2600, but with chiptunes, and it looks like it's going

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.840
to be pretty cool.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.860
I'm looking at a trailer here in studio.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:15.120
The trailer, it makes it look like Ikaruga, because you have to collect black dots in

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.120
your Void conspiracy.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.960
Oh, and you kind of avoid the white ones.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.560
That actually looks like fun.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.280
The Bit.Trip games are actually a lot of fun.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.720
I wonder if they'll release a compilation of this a little later on.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.720
I don't know.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.840
That could be a very fun game.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.680
I don't think there is a release date yet announced for this.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.360
They just say later this year.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.960
By the way, it was playable at PAX, so some folks already got to play it.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.340
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Attack is coming to the Nintendo DS.

01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:44.260
Apparently it's a brand new game.

01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:48.720
It has the arcade style controls like you see in Turtles in Time.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.840
You are going up against Shredder.

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.620
By the way, this was also shown at PAX.

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:57.560
You lucky PAX attendees getting your hands on some early stuff.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:03.440
Another game that's coming out onto Xbox Live Arcade, Puzzle Bobble Live, coming out in

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.960
Japan.

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.940
It will probably make its way over here as Bust-A-Move Live or something like that over

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.200
here in America, because you know there's that whole fact that Bust-A-Move over here

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.960
is actually Puzzle Bobble.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.300
Why they call it Bust-A-Move and then ruined the name of the actual Bust-A-Move game is

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.520
Bust-A-Groove over here?

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:22.520
I will never understand that.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.260
Oh, I have an answer for that.

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.640
Why do they call Puzzle Bobble Bust-A-Move here?

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.640
Because they're stupid.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.640
Oh, okay.

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:29.640
That makes perfect sense.

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:36.000
Anyway, the game's coming out in Japan on September 30th for 800 Microsoft Points.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.220
No comment yet on North America or Europe release dates, but I'm sure the games will

01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.380
be ported soon enough.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.640
Those are... That's a pretty standard game.

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.240
Do you remember on the PlayStation 2, Bust-A-Move was one of the first games that came out for

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.040
it, and on the cover it had a baby wearing sunglasses and had a big bubble that said

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040
Bust-

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.040
It made no sense.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.040
It made no sense at all.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.760
That was Bust-A-Move 2 that had the baby, I think, on the cover.

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:03.240
Seriously, what the hell was that?

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.880
That just sums up in a nutshell the transition of Puzzle Bobble to Bust-A-Move.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.360
I'll just never understand.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.040
Never get it.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.920
Kochikawa says it's copyright infringement.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.920
Forget on what, though.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.920
Really?

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.920
Whatever.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920
Young MC.

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.080
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.520
I have some stuff.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:29.720
Actually, some kind of interesting news in looking at almost an international point of

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.720
view.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.000
First of all, I was in Japan.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:42.800
The PlayStation 3 sales have plummeted with my bad sound effects.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:49.840
That actually is going ahead of the PS3 Slim launch.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:40:05.560
They've gone, for the regular PS3, it's only sold 1,040 units with the last week, and however

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:13.960
the Xbox 360 rose to sell 7,254 units.

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:21.040
Of course, there's a little bit of Nintendo sale drop, but they're still pushing a lot

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:29.680
of the DSi and DS Lite.

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:39.200
As far as other stuff going on, for some rock band news, there's a new PAX track that's

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.840
going to be Freeze Pop, Jonathan Colton, MC Frontalot, and Paul and Storm.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.240
And each song will be $1 apiece.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.680
So you've got that.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.680
A whole dollar?

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680
Yep.

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.920
Yeah, but it's Freeze Pop and Jonathan Colton and other bands that are pretty cool.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.360
You know, I'm going to have both of those at least.

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:04.240
And then the last thing, this gets the Face Palm award of the night, other than those

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.360
idiot people wanting to pull their children out of school so they can't see Obama's speech.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.360
So stupid.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:19.240
But yeah, there's a special, a special function for the 6-axis in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.360
It's going to have 6-axis support.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.240
You know what it's going to do?

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.240
No.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240
What?

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.240
Boob jiggle.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.240
Awesome.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.800
You can control boob jiggle.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.200
It is the next likely progression.

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.200
Whatever.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.880
It's like I was telling Sauce earlier today, I was like, yeah, I bet the developers are

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.520
sitting around going, we should do something with the 6-axis.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.880
I don't know, what should we do?

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.800
We could wiggle their boobies.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.800
Hey, that works.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.800
And that's it.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.240
I bet the conversation went just like that too.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.400
All right.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.400
Funny.

01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.400
Let's get back into some longer news that we'll talk a little more about, and then soon

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.880
your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.160
Now I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy about this or not.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.720
And we know that with the new updates, especially coming in the fall, that they're going to

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.640
be having some support for Facebook support and stuff like that.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.920
I know with the Xbox 360.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.640
Now what's interesting though is apparently the game Blur coming out is going to have

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.040
Twitter support.

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:28.280
Yes, it will apparently tweet when you do different things.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.920
And for one example, one of the tweets, I guess, might be like, I just won first place

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.440
and blah, blah, blah.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.520
I hope they can turn that off.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.520
I don't know.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.520
Yeah, you don't give it your login.

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.520
That's how you turn it off.

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.840
This sounds like a horrible idea.

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:44.840
I'm sorry.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.840
I don't know.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.760
It's a horrible, horrible idea that is just contributing to the problem.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.560
And don't get me wrong, I think Blur is an amazing looking game, and I really enjoy the

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.560
demo at E3.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560
It's one of my favorites.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.240
That being said, the plug needs to be pulled on this immediately.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.960
And if you spam this shit to your Twitter and I'm following you right now, you will

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.080
be dropped.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:09.200
Because unfortunately, and here's the problem with Twitter, is that you cannot filter posts

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.600
like you can on Facebook.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.980
I would be okay with it if you could click a little button and then like filter all posts

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:16.400
made by Blur because I would have done that with Blur.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.600
I would have done that with that friend feed or whatever.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:26.960
And I would do that with Raptor because I seriously drop people for all those things.

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.160
And it's nothing personal.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.040
I just, you know, here's the thing.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.280
It is personal with me, by the way.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.440
There's a finite amount of tweets that my iPhone app will download at a time.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.840
It's 200 tweets.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.160
And if 20 of those tweets are your fucking friend feed or something, I'm sorry.

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.120
That's going to piss me off because that's 20 things I could have read about somebody

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.360
else, you know, that might be like actually about their day or something interesting.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.680
You know, I just, I am not a fan of these auto tweets at all and kind of, and think

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.560
they're going to destroy Twitter unless something is done about them very soon.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.280
Because I know this is not going to be the first or last thing.

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.860
What Activision destroy something like, I don't know, beloved guitar franchise.

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:11.320
This is just so strange though, because you know, usually bizarre creations is, is we've

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320
had them on the show.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320
They're a great studio.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.120
Uh, and I understand, you know, they're just trying to be on the cutting edge of technology,

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.740
but this, I just, and I'm really, you should do it really with Facebook and maybe we're

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:23.840
misinterpreting this and I'll give credit there.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.240
Maybe we need clarification on how exactly this is going to work.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.000
And I think it's pretty obvious to say if you don't give this game your Twitter login,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.100
it can't do it.

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.760
So to some extent you're going to have to want it to post to Twitter for you.

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.600
But why that's, that's the part I failed to see.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600
Why is this useful?

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:44.960
And the other thing too is apparently it's going to feature like a faux social networking

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:52.280
site like inner tube, I guess it's their bizarre version of YouTube or something, but yeah,

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.480
it will have real, um, Twitter support as well.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.480
I don't know.

01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:00.220
I think it's fine if they want to, you know, if you have updates or something like that,

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:03.520
but that's something more like Facebook because at least then you can filter it out.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.240
But Twitter, I don't want to see updates about, you know, stuff like that.

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.240
I don't know.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:12.840
Or maybe it gives you the option like say you want first place and you get the option,

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.560
do you want to tweet this or not?

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.800
That might be a little more tolerable depending on how often people do it.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.200
You know, I, I, I just, I'm a little iffy on it though.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.200
Yeah.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.960
I just want to say this.

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.320
Just don't do it.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.760
Just don't bother with it.

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.120
If my Twitter gets filled up with blur race updates, then I can't read that so and so

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.580
just took a big poop on Twitter, you know, and isn't that what Twitter's really about

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.960
is what you ate for breakfast this morning?

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.960
Exactly.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.520
With the new, uh, was it the new, um, action or whatever?

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.840
I am actually starting to get really annoyed with Twitter.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.800
Like it's a love hate thing with Twitter.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.660
There's a lot of dumb shit on Twitter, but at the same time I found it to be really good

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:54.000
for networking and getting the information out there.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.600
Like it's been really good for the show.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.040
That's what I use it for.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.520
As I use it for a lot of my networking now.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.920
I use it for O.L.R.

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:02.920
Foodio.

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.920
Yeah.

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.520
Now there's a new hashtag.

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.600
Loki invented a new hashtag and the thing is people are using it that listen to this

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.600
show.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.240
Like it's not just me, but like I saw like three other people using the new O.L.R.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.560
Foodio tweet and I'm somewhere torn between this is really funny and you know, I just

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.640
think Twitter needs to take some cues from Facebook and give us better ways to filter

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.640
content.

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:26.640
I think it's really what they need.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.640
I've actually been using my Facebook a whole lot more than Twitter now.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.920
I mean, simply because of a lot of the reasons that you just mentioned.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.720
So, uh, Bochi Kawa in chat makes a very good point.

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.280
Poop is greater than waste race win.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.280
I agree.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.520
All right.

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:47.160
So anyhow, Blur getting Twitter support, uh, we'll see exactly how that plays out a little

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.160
later on.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.520
Meantime, one game that's not going to have Twitter support, but it will have support

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.160
for your balance board is of course, Wii Fit Plus and a release date has been announced

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:57.560
for Wii Fit Plus.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.840
It's coming out on October 4th.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.040
Here's the great thing about Wii Fit Plus.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.440
Remember how a lot of us were thinking that on Nintendo's just going to price gouge on

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440
this and that?

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.440
Nope.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.320
It's going to cost $20 Wii Fit Plus is only going to set you back $20.

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:14.480
Now keep in mind that's if you already have a balance board.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.960
So they figure if you have a balance board, then they got to once already with Wii Fit

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.680
because they don't sell a balance board separately.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.680
Do they?

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:26.560
So, but so they're, and they're going to get rid of the skew that is the Wii Fit with the

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.560
balance board.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:31.200
Now you will only be able to buy Wii Fit Plus with the balance board, but I guess the good

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.160
news, the silver lining is that, you know, for those of you that just want to upgrade

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.560
because there are some new games, there are some new things with this, it's only going

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.120
to cost you $20.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.120
Good news.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.120
Bad news.

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.120
Loki.

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.380
The bad news, which you forgot to mention was now they also raised the price of that

01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.480
bundle by $10.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480
Sorry about that.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.560
And that'll be $99.99 for that bundle.

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.800
So if you didn't get in on the ground floor of Wii Fit, which I'm going to tell you this

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.720
much, if you didn't get in on the ground floor of that, you're not missing out.

01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:58.720
Seriously.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.860
And you know, if you're dumb enough to buy the game by itself, no offense, but like it's

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:05.400
almost the same game again.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.360
I don't know why you'd buy the same game again.

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:11.320
Because there are some extra things that some of the little mini games were kind of cute.

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.000
I mean, you know, if you're going to buy that Wii Play or whatever, you know, you spend

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.120
an extra $10 to get Wii Play and none of those games are good.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.120
Right?

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.120
I don't know.

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.120
Whatever.

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:30.000
I mean, I don't know, see, I don't think the same way issue about Wii Fit.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.560
Like I get the point behind Wii Fit and I actually kind of like it.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:41.880
I think if you actually make it a point to play the game every day and you know, some

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.400
exercise is better than none.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.600
You know, granted, it's not the best thing you could be doing.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.920
You could be lifting weights or you could be running or jogging, but you know, if it's

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:57.080
kind of a nice meet you in the middle type of thing and I think that's what Wii Fit's

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.080
always been about.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080
Right?

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.080
I guess.

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:06.000
It's trying to make exercising more fun for kids and non-kids who are just not as motivated.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.720
They should just have you bench press the board and make it way more...

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.760
I'll have to put D cell batteries in it to make it a little heavier.

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.160
No, just put in big ol' 9 volts.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.160
I don't know.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.480
I'm actually considering picking out...

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.760
It's only $20.

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.160
That's not that bad considering...

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:25.280
Is this supposed to have some internet stuff too where you're gonna be able to pair with

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.280
friends around the globe?

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.280
Just wait for the peer use.

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280
I'm sure it will.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.280
All right.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.280
Fine.

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.280
Maybe I'll do that.

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.280
We'll see.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:36.380
Takeo Ray in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, my friend's aunt lost 40 pounds using

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.380
Wii Fit.

01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.880
She was just by it.

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.980
Lumi's in chat says, it's all about your diet and how consistent you are.

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:47.160
That's kind of true too is that you can't expect that you play Wii Fit by itself for

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.260
like 10 minutes a day and that anything major is gonna happen.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:53.960
It kind of has to be part of a greater lifestyle adjustment.

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:54.960
And that's why...

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.800
And I also noticed that xlink in chat says, I'll play my EA Active.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.040
One thing about EA Active is that EA Active kind of encourages you as well to be eating

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.440
and doing other stuff.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:13.160
Any exercises besides just EA Active, I don't think it implements it very well, but at least

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.560
it kind of makes it a point to emphasize that as a part of the game as well.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:17.560
Yeah.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.800
Cause I mean, it's, you can't just do one or I mean, you could do one or the other,

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.640
but they're more effective done together.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:27.040
I'll tell you what I mean, to be honest, I think one website I think has been very good

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.420
for this.

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:32.740
You know, when I was kind of trying to lose weight and I still am to an extent, one website

01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:37.000
I found that I really enjoyed was Spark People, which is actually a pretty good website where

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.080
you can monitor your food intake and you monitor your exercise and how many glasses of water

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.080
you drink a day.

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:44.080
The day does that too.

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.080
And everything.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.760
I just, I really liked the way Spark People was set up.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:50.520
So I, and it has an iPhone app, which was the other big thing about that that was cool.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:55.840
So I would definitely recommend that as a part of your diet if you're going to start

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:59.180
Wii Fit or what have you, because you can actually enter in, Hey, I did 40 minutes of

01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.700
Wii Fit and it'll count that as calories burned.

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:04.480
So it's a really nice way to incorporate something like that into your diet.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.480
That's cool.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:09.500
I think Wii Fit may be great for people who don't like to exercise in public.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.680
I think for some people don't like to do that.

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680
That makes sense.

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.080
No, that makes perfect sense.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.680
I know a lot of people like that.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.800
I'm kind of one of them.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:18.800
Like I'll go out and run.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.400
I'm not a gym person at all, but I know I have a, I have a friend really, really trying

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400
to get me to go to the gym.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.400
I'm kind of on the fence.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400
I'm like, I don't know.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.520
I don't mind going to the gym, but I usually hide myself in the weight room and, and you

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:36.000
know, which is sometimes kind of really nerve wracking, especially when you have all the

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
guys there.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.520
Not that I have a problem with all the guys there or anything.

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.880
It's just that I don't like going, you know, with, with all the guys there.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880
Not ever.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.880
Yeah.

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.480
And it's probably there's some people that listen to us like, come on you pussies.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.760
But I, I can't explain it.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.760
It's just.

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:54.520
Well, if I'm the only girl there and there's like 10 guys that just got off the basketball

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.440
court all pumping away, so I'm like, uh, yeah, bye.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440
All right.

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.120
Let's move on with some more news.

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.680
Y'all I could take them.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.680
Bench press them.

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.680
They'll cry.

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.680
Um, Sony has a stupid idea.

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.880
They've had a lot of stupid ideas.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.880
This is really stupid.

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.480
And by stupid, I mean stupid.

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.600
Um, they're doing a reality TV show.

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.600
Yeah.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.680
I laughed when I saw this.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.240
Isn't that kind of all the rage right now?

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:24.240
I mean.

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.240
That's stupid.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.920
Reality TV is ass.

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:35.160
Um, so basically it's got a gaming related reality TV show called the tester.

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:42.080
That's going to be a PSN later in the year where the, uh, people in it can, uh, play

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:48.960
some different, um, elimination challenges so, uh, they can see, you know, who has the

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:54.960
best mental, you know, physical, their best, uh, knowledge too.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:59.760
And then, um, they get a job as a game tester with, um, the PlayStation QA department in

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:01.840
San Diego.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840
Here's the thing.

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.440
I am feel completely different from Jamie.

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.640
I don't think all reality TV is trash.

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:07.640
You watch big brother.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.760
I think some of it is trash.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.080
Well, I like reality shows that are basically modern game shows.

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:16.920
Like, you know, in my opinion, big brother is a game show as is survivor is a game show

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:17.920
of sorts.

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.800
And I've always liked game shows of all different types.

01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:22.080
So I, I'm not bothered by those shows.

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.840
And even to an extent I can tolerate some of those like VH1 and Bravo shows like project

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.840
runway is pretty good too.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.200
And some of that project runway though is more like a design contest.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.120
Well, see, but now you see, you can't, you can't say you hate reality shows and then

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.320
say, but, but this one's okay.

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:40.640
Well, this to me though is like, what was the Trump one?

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.120
Um, the apprentice, I hated that show.

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:48.240
See, the apprentice is okay, but my biggest problem with it is that it basically came

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:51.600
down to one dude's opinion, you know, and I think it would have been better if there

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.600
was a board.

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.680
But anyway, I don't want to get into diagnosing all these reality shows.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:54:00.820
What I don't like is like this VH1 is getting so saturated with these shows.

01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:04.920
Like I turned on the other day, it was like the Terrell Owens reality show or something.

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:07.840
I'm like, really, really no.

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.120
And there's just a lot of these types of shows, like the dating shows too much, too much.

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.880
Give me back my own reality.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.520
I want, I want sitcoms.

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:16.520
Okay.

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:21.440
Here's the funniest part about this reality show is we've known game testers and it's

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.360
not as glamorous as you would think.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.080
That's what I actually wanted to get to is that the prize here, I hate to say it is not

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.080
very good.

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:33.720
Like, and no offense to the game testers I know out there, a lot of you work very hard

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.600
for very little money.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:40.120
And that's why I don't understand this whole glamorization of the gaming testing.

01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:44.120
Like it's this really like gaming testing again, it's not that hard to get into.

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.660
I don't think here's what's going to have to be offended, but it's kind of an entry

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:48.660
level position.

01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:50.640
It's how you get your foot in the door at gaming companies.

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.840
But a lot of people take that and work up to something a lot bigger.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.520
Shouldn't a prize on a reality game show be something bigger?

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.440
See, here's what I think is going to happen is that the person's going to play all these

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.520
really cool challenge things that come out and, oh yeah.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.520
Which are all Sony games.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.840
But they're going to be all like, yeah, I'm into it.

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:06.840
Yeah, this is fun.

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.240
Yeah, I win.

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.200
I have to work.

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:12.200
I have to show up for my job.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:16.920
You want me to test a cow milking game?

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.920
You know what this is going to be?

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.400
This is just going to be a holiday tie in.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.240
It's going to be a free download on PlayStation Network.

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.600
This is going to be product placement after product placement of all these Sony upcoming

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.600
games.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.760
I don't think it's a terrible idea.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.640
I mean, especially if it's a free show.

01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:30.640
Hey.

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.640
I'll enter.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.640
How about that?

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:33.640
Why don't I enter?

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:34.640
You want to enter?

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.400
I can't quit my day job, but if you want to enter and move to San Diego, good luck with

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.400
that.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.400
No, thanks.

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:42.400
I don't want to move to San Diego to test games for like eight bucks an hour.

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.400
I like San Diego, but I sure as hell don't want to live there.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.040
I hope somebody from OLR wins it.

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:52.840
If you want to do it, it might be a pretty awesome way to get exposure, but I don't know.

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840
Yeah.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840
I'm kind of with Loki.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.560
The prize is not that awesome, but I don't think this show is really about giving someone

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.480
a once in a lifetime dream opportunity.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.960
I think the show is going to be nothing but nonstop product placement for holiday Sony

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.200
games, but granted, it's a pretty clever way to do it.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.200
Patty said something funny.

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.200
Uh, Giovedea in chat.

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.200
Yeah.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200
That's what I was...

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200
Yeah.

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.200
Go ahead and read it.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.200
Oh.

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:20.520
I'm on reality TV, life with my grandma.

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.600
I just don't know how compelling that would be.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.920
Unless your grandma like competes in the X games, then I would watch a show like that.

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.320
Or she was like a serial killer grandma.

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:31.320
Yes.

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.320
All right.

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.320
So...

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.520
I would watch a show called Serial Killer Grandma.

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.240
Do they have that on Discovery Channel?

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.960
I don't know.

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.820
I will check out an episode of this and see if it's any good, but I just kind of have

01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:47.280
a feeling it's just going to be product placement and trailers I can download somewhere else

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.760
on PlayStation Network.

01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.680
But we'll see.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:57.480
Something that this winner might be testing out is the brand new 3D support for the PlayStation

01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.480
3.

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:02.920
Now, this is kind of...

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.920
I don't know.

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:09.920
It's neat, but at the same time, it's not that special because in order for you to be

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:16.920
able to use it, you need one of those brand new TVs that can refresh at over 200 hertz.

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.220
So that is a problem, and not a lot of people have those TVs right now.

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:27.720
But if you happen to do, and you have the special stereoscopic glasses for that, then

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.760
you can actually play some of the games.

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.320
One of them, of course, Wipeout in 3D, and that'll be coming out in 2010.

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.360
I know, actually, sooner than that, they're going to be doing that with Avatar.

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:43.280
But once again, you need that really high-end TV, and right now, there's maybe five different

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:49.440
TVs out there that have that kind of feature for them.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.280
You think this might be the future of gaming, though?

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.840
Because when we see things like this, I kind of go, okay, well, maybe it's for a certain

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:57.360
group of people right now, but could it be the future of gaming?

01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.560
It's cutting edge, yes, but it might be too cutting edge.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.940
It's too early because people aren't going to upgrade their TV just to get one of these

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:09.480
TVs that does 200Hz until they start coming out with a lot of 3D movies and stuff, and

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.360
this stuff comes out at a price.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:17.200
But right now, I guess they can claim that they were the first to do this, or something.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.920
I don't know.

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.360
But actually, they can't claim they were the first to do this, because now that I think

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:27.040
of it, because if Avatar's coming out on both the 360 and PS3, then they will be doing it

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.040
at the same time.

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.120
Wasn't like Rad Racer on the NES in 3D?

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.440
Yeah, but that was with those red-blue glasses.

01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:37.840
Wasn't the Virtual Boy in 3D?

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.440
The amazing migraine machine?

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:46.800
Yeah, see, that was actually true 3D, but this, though, yeah, I don't know.

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:48.000
It's a neat thing, but it's-

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.600
I kind of don't want to see gaming go all 3D like this.

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:55.280
Like, I went and saw Up in 3D, which, don't get me wrong, great movie, had a great time,

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.400
but I kind of had a little bit of a headache after it for watching that for like 90 minutes.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.200
And even though they say you're supposed to take a break every hour when you play video

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.120
games, you guys know that's not how it goes.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:06.120
No.

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.120
You'll sit there and play a video game for four hours.

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.120
Okay, like-

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.120
Until you gotta pee.

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.680
Yeah, or I need to eat.

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.280
But if I sit there with those 3D glasses on playing, like, I don't know, I think I saw

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:19.540
some demo online, like Wipeout HD was being presented in 3D glasses, I bet that looks

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:22.880
fucking awesome, because Wipeout HD already looks fucking awesome.

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.880
It's just-

01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.120
But I would have a headache after four hours.

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:28.160
Well, it's just, you know, they're gonna be starting to support more of this stuff.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.920
It's just like why games now are 5-1 Dolby, you know?

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:37.680
And HD and all that stuff, it's just because people, it's the progression that's gonna

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:38.680
go in.

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:43.320
I mean, that's what their push is for cinema right now is more 3D, and, you know, eventually

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.640
that's gonna move to the home market.

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:50.120
So it makes sense that games are gonna go in that direction, especially since, you know,

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:54.720
hey, 3D might come in handy when like Project Intel comes out, or, you know, these games

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:59.480
are gonna be using the Sony motion capture thing that they're gonna have, you know?

01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:05.520
You might need to see stuff in 3D space in that sense, but I don't know, it's not cheap

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520
right now, though.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:10.760
Like, if you wanna buy a monitor for your PC and, you know, the stereoscopic glasses,

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:13.280
it's gonna set you back $500.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:16.480
I mean, that's pretty cheap, you know, compared to an HGTV.

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:18.720
Yeah, but technology's gonna come down in price eventually.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:19.720
Exactly, it will.

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:26.960
You know, remember when HGTVDs, or sorry, H, I just, I can't talk anymore, HGTVs, remember

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:32.520
when those were like thousands of dollars to get an HGTV, and now, like, this Christmas,

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.920
I think you're gonna see those flying off the shelves, yeah.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.920
Remember the big deal?

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:37.920
They were like $5,000.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.920
Ooh, I have 2DX and a WEGA.

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920
Yeah.

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.200
Well, a lot of that was faux HD, too.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:47.720
A lot of those WEGAs didn't even really do HD, but yeah, I mean, technology's gonna come

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.720
down in price.

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.720
It just does, right?

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.720
Yeah.

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:51.720
I don't know, but...

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:56.960
And if it doesn't, it kills the thing, too, you know.

02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.840
That's right, because, you know, not everybody's rich.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:00:59.840
Yeah.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.240
Something to keep in mind.

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:04.720
I wanna go back to our chatroom, chat.orangelandrader.com, and read some comments.

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:08.720
There was a comment on the last story about the whole reality television from Salacious

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:09.720
Pop.

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:10.720
Hi there.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.880
Says, if I recall correctly, the Penny Arcade guys were doing something reality-based at

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:15.960
Penny Arcade Expo.

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:20.760
I don't know if it's a mini-doc for the DVD or a standalone thing or what.

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:25.360
Jamie, being a person that hates all reality television, would you hate a Penny Arcade

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.400
documentary as well?

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.420
There's a difference between a reality TV show and a documentary.

02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:31.420
Is there?

02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.560
Yes.

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:34.200
What is the difference?

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:37.780
The documentary being that it's set for an informative purpose.

02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:40.760
Its purpose is not necessarily entertainment.

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.840
It is to give you the information regarding a particular situation, a historical event,

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:46.840
for an individual.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.000
Couldn't a documentary be entertaining?

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.440
Like, depending on where you are.

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:54.160
That's why I said, not necessarily just for entertainment.

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.600
Reality TV is supposed to be, oh, here's your slice of how other people live.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:04.560
You know, like, for example, if you took a documentary to Somalia to see about, you know,

02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:13.680
the results of the war and their own little mafia thing going on there, and you get unfiltered

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:20.000
information, or if it's filtered, it's just to make it, you know, slightly more palatable,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.780
but it's not scripted.

02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.940
This is what's going on.

02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.160
It's inquisitive.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.480
It's editorial.

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.520
This is what is going on.

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:33.400
Whereas reality TV is, in the end, a manufactured reality.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:37.080
All right, fine.

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.720
I just was kind of curious.

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:45.440
I don't think that's a pretty, pretty definite, you know, definition.

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.760
It's the purpose between having, this is actually what's happening versus, well, this is what

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.160
we want you to see happening.

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.520
This is a made up reality.

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:58.080
These people auditioned to be in our version of real life.

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.720
You know what that has me kind of thinking about, though, is that, you know, I bet there

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.640
would be a lot of people that would be interested in watching something like that, kind of a

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:07.440
behind the scenes thing at PAX, and even though, you know, it was commented that it's probably

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.080
going to be for a DVD, wouldn't it be kind of neat if this was a downloadable exclusive

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.080
on PlayStation Network or Xbox 360, I know has done a lot of work with Penny Arcade?

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.080
I think that'd be cool.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.680
Or even like, you know what might be a really cool tie in?

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:22.900
Have it be something that's on Xbox 360 Netflix.

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:26.840
Put it on Netflix as an instant queue title, and then people could watch it.

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:28.720
I think that would be worthwhile.

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:29.720
That'd be pretty cool.

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.960
See, like, I think that is something that if PlayStation Network is going to make up

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.660
this reality show or whatever, that should also be an avenue that they should think about

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:41.040
doing is, you know, maybe, or maybe Microsoft will beat them to the punch, who knows, is

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.020
creating these shows about, like, behind the scenes development of games or fandom, I guess

02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:51.600
you could say in this case, or, you know, Expos, whatever it is, kind of, you know,

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.600
gamer documentaries.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:56.480
Well, it was like what I was watching today, Dan, because, you know, my, pretty much my

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:59.480
favorite type of sports car is the Bugatti Veyron, right?

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:05.080
Well, Dan was showing me the video for Forza 2 about how they got the Bugatti license,

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:12.440
and, you know, were mapping out the car, how it was done, the meat of how they, you know,

02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.560
put the car in the game.

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:16.160
That type of stuff is always interesting to me.

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:18.560
Like, I love behind the scenes stuff in movies.

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.040
I like watching the how they do that type thing, you know.

02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.080
I did love watching Ripley's Believe It or Not.

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.600
You know what I love?

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:27.880
Unwrapped on the Food Network.

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.200
Now, that's a documentary.

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.200
I don't have Food Network.

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.760
Hosted by the one and only Mark Summers.

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.040
Loki, am I right or am I right?

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.040
It is a documentary.

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.080
I don't know if it's like, oh my god, awesome, but, you know, it's interesting.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.280
It's what we watch to kill time for something else to watch.

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.280
Haters.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.200
Hey, I don't hate it.

02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.560
I just don't love it.

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.380
Like, especially when you've seen, like, the same episode over and over, they start reusing

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:54.680
some of their, you know, segments on other episodes.

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:55.680
I'll give you that.

02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.680
I'll give you that.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:57.680
They do need to make some new stuff.

02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:59.360
Like, this episode's the stuff that's packaged in plastic.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:01.200
Oh, this episode's about baskets.

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.320
So, this episode's about Cheez Whiz.

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.680
It's like, I don't care.

02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:07.480
No, there was an episode on Cheez Whiz?

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:09.680
No, there was not an episode on Cheez Whiz.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.800
But there's been, like, three episodes about picnics and there's, like, you know, they

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.440
show how they make picnic baskets.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.440
I don't care.

02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:17.440
It has nothing to do with food.

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:20.280
A picnic basket?

02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:23.760
What about those little, don't they call those picnics, those little potato fried things

02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:25.480
you can buy in the, forget it?

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:32.040
You know what is a weird show that's kind of along the lines of Unwrapped is how it's

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.480
made or something like that?

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.760
And they have, like, the most random stuff, like, put together.

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:40.720
It's like, this episode you're gonna learn how they make galvanized steel, doorknobs,

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:44.600
that's great, bowling balls, and mayonnaise.

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.680
It's like, what the fuck is that?

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:49.480
I mean, it's like, it's so random.

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.120
It's like, ooh, steel!

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:52.120
Oh, doorknobs.

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.120
I'm sorry.

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:56.920
When I was just out of high school, though, there was a show that they used to come on,

02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.000
and I don't think, I think this was, you know, before the day of the Food Network, they used

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.720
to come on where they would show you how to make snacks that you buy in the grocery store,

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:06.560
like, they showed how to make Twinkies.

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:12.840
Twinkies will always and forever make me think about the tournament we did, the DDR and Beat

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:15.160
Mania 2DX tournament we did at Scandia.

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:19.120
It was called the Sacramento Hosts Another Fabulous Tournament, or we called it Behind

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.840
the Scenes Another Fucking Tournament.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.720
It was SHAFT for short.

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.920
And it was great, but it was better than SCAT before it.

02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:33.440
You have to remember, when our buddy Keith worked at Scandia, we could, we ran that fucking

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:37.560
joint when we wanted to do a tournament, and we did the most random things.

02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:41.880
I know the employees there must have hated us, and so did all the customers, which is

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.880
part of the reason why that worked.

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.880
But we stayed and helped clean up.

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:44.880
We did.

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:45.880
We did.

02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.640
No, we did a really awesome tournament there and probably brought up some new business,

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.220
but we did the most random stuff.

02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:54.120
We turned the birthday party room into a station where you could buy fried Twinkies.

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.360
Yes, we did.

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.800
Deep fried Twinkies.

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.200
What the hell that has to do with the OBS?

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:00.920
I don't know.

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:01.920
That was Irene.

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:02.920
Yeah, I know.

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:07.400
That was Irene and Justin B., who now does all these remixes that are popular on YouTube.

02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:08.400
Who knew?

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.720
And all this stuff.

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:16.840
Keep in mind, though, that we also had, the tournament before that had a cosplay event.

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:19.320
It was Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320
Yeah, SCAT.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.320
Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.320
I remember that.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.320
It was SCAT.

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:24.400
It was awesome.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:25.400
We need to...

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.880
See, if we were to have like an OLR con or something, it just needs to be like fucking

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.960
random like that, where we have a fried Twinkie station.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.080
We should just have random con.

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:37.800
Loki presents the Baconator station or something.

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:40.480
I'm telling you, listen, hold on, hold on.

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.680
We are seriously kicking around an idea of doing an all-bacon party for my birthday.

02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.680
I'm serious.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.160
Didn't your birthday already happen?

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:48.160
I don't know.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.160
It's coming up.

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.160
Next Friday.

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:51.160
Oh, you should do it.

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160
Well, we're thinking about it.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:53.400
Have some bacon fried bacon.

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.360
We're not bacon frying bacon.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.640
That's just redundant.

02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:57.640
All right.

02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:58.640
Look, look.

02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:01.760
I want to get to some more comments because we had some funny stuff on Unwrapped.

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:03.720
We had two fans of Unwrapped in chat.

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:06.280
Takeo Ray says, Unwrapped is the best show on Food Network.

02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.120
Act Def says, Unwrapped is awesome.

02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.080
Salacious Pop says, That show makes me lol because I'm like, oh, go jump in some Gak

02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:13.400
Mark summers.

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.400
He couldn't.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.040
He would have a, he's got that whole OCD thing going on.

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:18.040
That's right.

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:19.440
Did you see those documentaries about double dairy?

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.440
It scared him.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:26.120
Well, yeah, because, because he, he's, um, what, what type of phobia is it where you're

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.400
afraid of messes?

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:33.200
I thought it was a type of OCD that he had like a, like a clean cleanliness OCD.

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:34.200
Something like that.

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.880
Either that or he had like an actual phobia.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:36.880
All right.

02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:39.880
Rama in chat simply says, Fuck Unwrapped.

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:40.880
Good eats is better.

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.720
Alton Brown is, is pretty awesome.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.720
All right.

02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:44.720
I agree.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:45.720
Good eats is better.

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:46.720
Enough food.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:47.800
Let's get to emails.

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:48.960
You can't eat emails.

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:52.240
I'm sure if you could, Dark Sakura would have eaten one by now.

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.240
Nope.

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:54.240
Nope.

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:55.240
You're wrong.

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:56.240
I would have thrown them up.

02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.200
You could print out emails on that paper that they use to print photos on a cake, then you

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.200
could eat emails.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.960
That's true!

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.720
We need to have a contest where we eat somebody's email one night, live on air.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.760
Have your email eaten by a cast member.

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.600
We don't have the printer for that.

02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:13.600
We'd have to take it out.

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:14.600
How much does that cost?

02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:15.600
I don't know.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.600
Not that much.

02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.600
Hm.

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:18.600
Haha.

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.600
Ugh.

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.600
You people are sick.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:21.600
Mailbag!

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:25.600
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.600
Dark Sakura, dive into the email bag and read us an email.

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:30.240
Um, what?

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.240
Okay.

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:35.720
The first one comes from Deathwishing, which is actually the last email I received.

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:41.680
I will have wrote, it's written, this message from a place called Howie's Game Shack.

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.120
Well, I went to Guitar Hero 5 and it is fucking amazing.

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.680
It's probably the best one in the franchise.

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:48.680
I know, right?

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:49.680
Weird.

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:50.680
But seriously, you gotta try it out.

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:53.720
Just skip Smash Hits Van Halen and Metallica and any other...

02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.720
Whereid.

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.480
Or weird, I should say.

02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.160
Cause he spelled it the same way twice.

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:00.000
Um, any other weird...

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.560
Whereid tie in games they will make.

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:03.560
Haha.

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:04.560
What is it?

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:05.560
Whereid tie.

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.560
Haha.

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.020
Cyber Cafe Love Deathwishing.

02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:10.200
I think he meant weird tie in game.

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.200
So yeah.

02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:12.200
Um.

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:13.200
Okay.

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.360
Thank you.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.360
This comes from...

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.200
I think I've been to that place.

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.720
I was trying to look at Howie's Cyber...

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:22.320
I think I've been there.

02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.560
I think I used the computers there once one time too.

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:25.560
That's kind of funny.

02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.560
Um, this comes from...

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:28.560
One.

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:31.560
Yeah, we did use one of the Cyber Cafes on Hollywood Boulevard.

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:34.720
There was one in Koreatown that I think was it.

02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:35.720
Anyway, sorry.

02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:36.720
Sorry.

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.720
Hey, O.L.R.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.480
I was looking on the net and I heard if you have a PSP Go and a PS3 you can pair up the

02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:45.040
PS3 controller with a PSP Go to have dual analog sticks.

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:54.360
A half assed way to solve that problem analog nub and make you buy more stuff from them.

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:55.360
Problem Solved.

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:56.360
P.S.

02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:05.640
I recently bought a UMD M1, oh a Umid A M1, a 4 inch netbook and it can play high def

02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.640
games.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.200
Now it looks stupid with the USB hub, external CD-ROM and a controller sticking out of it

02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:11.640
but it is a good thing to know.

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:12.640
Bye.

02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:14.940
Clearly that email was written on a PSP as well.

02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:19.640
You can actually do that on a PSP, well any PSP actually right now because you can do

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:25.500
that with like I know Resistance Retribution that links up with the PS3 and you can use

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:32.360
your PSP Dual Shock or 6-axis to use dual analogs.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.200
That's interesting because how many games really support that?

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.200
One.

02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.200
One?

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.480
Well that feature isn't any good unless your PSP games actually support it but I guess

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:44.720
maybe it's a trend that will be starting.

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:45.720
And if you have a PS3 and you're near your PS3.

02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.360
Hey but I was talking about earlier in the show there's a lot of hidden functionality

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:55.000
between the PS3 and the PSP that Sony does a really poor job at advertising that is very

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
cool.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.640
They play in the PSP on your TV like if you did that dual shock thing you could put your

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.520
resistance game on your TV and then play with the dual shock controller.

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:08.280
I noticed Dark Sockers looking at a little thing for Diss it up.

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.040
I tried the download demo with that.

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:13.200
This is part of the soundtrack.

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.200
Is it?

02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.200
Yeah.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:16.640
I couldn't get a grasp on the game.

02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.680
Like I just couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.860
I just was button mashing.

02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:20.860
Is that all the game is?

02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:21.860
Button mashing with Final Fantasy characters?

02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.860
No not exactly.

02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:23.860
Really?

02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:24.860
I couldn't figure out the strategy behind it.

02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:26.000
I think the demo was set up very well.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.880
It needed like a tutorial or something.

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.480
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.480
That's fine too.

02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:31.480
Nah.

02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:32.480
Alright anyhow.

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:33.480
Next email.

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:34.480
Hi!

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.480
Hi.

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.480
My name is Megan by the way.

02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:41.520
I have been listening to your podcast for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:45.360
I wanted to say I don't know why so many people are complaining about the cost of the PSP

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.360
Go.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:53.160
I live in Toronto Canada and a PSP 3000 costs $167 and a 16 gigabyte memory stick costs

02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:57.680
$139 so the PSP Go is a good deal for a new player.

02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.440
Keep up the great work on your podcast.

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:02.000
A 6 gigabyte memory stick you said?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
16.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.720
I don't know.

02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:05.720
You'd get the bundle.

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:08.560
I don't know how much it would cost Canadian but it can't be much more than it is here.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.480
I just got a bundle because my old PSP was kind of dying so I actually just picked up

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:13.840
a PSP 3000 this week.

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:20.600
I bought a $199 bundle that came with the PSP 3000, a 4 gig memory stick, School of

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.800
Rock little codes you can use which whatever I don't really care for Jack Black but I'll

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:28.700
just download it because it was free and then Rock Band Unplugged all came with it.

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:32.040
So you know that wasn't a bad deal at all for the PSP 3000.

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:38.960
The problem is the PSP Go is what $50 cheaper than a PlayStation 3 is now and it's got less

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.960
features than a PSP 3000.

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:43.960
That's where the logic fails me.

02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:45.640
If you're going to go PSP, go PSP 3000.

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:52.120
To be honest you can find memory sticks pretty cheap and here's the other thing too.

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.040
I don't know if you really need 16 gigabytes of storage.

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:59.040
Even if you're buying games on there, I don't think you need that.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.880
When I was putting ISO's on there I didn't need that amount of space.

02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.400
4 gigs at the most maybe and then how many games do you plan on storing on there?

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:13.640
Yeah they need 16 gigabytes on a PSP Go because that's all you can do is download stuff but

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:16.660
you're going to be playing a lot of your games off UMDs anyways.

02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:21.340
There's really no reason to get the Go other than ooh look it slides.

02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:24.720
By the way my comments on Final Fantasy Dissida kind of got the chat room talking about that

02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:25.720
a little bit.

02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:29.240
AlphaCananagram says the demo doesn't do it justice and he puts demo in caps.

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:34.160
GioVedeo says Dissida is fucking amazing I heart it and AlphaCananagram wants you to

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:39.160
know he is playing Dissida right now a level 100 onion knight on hardcore play mode.

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.440
I guess maybe I'll have to check out the full game at some point.

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:49.420
The last email and I'm kind of not going to say who it's coming from but he also didn't

02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:52.080
say who he got it from.

02:14:52.080 --> 02:15:00.480
It's an email that was sent out to Disney cast members about the acquisition of Marvel

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:09.240
Entertainment and just looking this over they're actually talking about here's what really

02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.240
got me.

02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:14.960
Marvel's business meshes perfectly with ours and what we've all been doing to maximize

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.840
the value of Disney's creative properties across our business media platforms and geographical

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.200
markets and then goes on to talk about Pixar and but here's the other line.

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.680
The acquisition of Marvel offers us a similar opportunity to advance that strategy meaning

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:35.400
putting out things all over the world for using it for marketing purposes.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:42.520
So I am sort of maybe I'm reading a bit more into this but since they've been talking about

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:48.180
use of the Marvel brand and you know the consumer market I have a feeling we're going to start

02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:55.040
seeing actual this was sent out to cast members meaning I think it's the park.

02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:01.320
That means that we might start seeing characters in the parks and of course you know that's

02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.400
also going to mean games.

02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.160
It's going to mean movies.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.920
It's going to mean more things that happen tomorrow.

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.960
Not tomorrow but I'm saying down the line let me put it this way that their licenses

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:17.120
are going to run into like 2015 2017 I mean it's that long.

02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:21.280
You know what else is interesting in for some reason that the whole story about Disney buying

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:24.920
Marvel didn't make tonight show role but I'm sure everybody read about it somewhere on

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.920
the Internet.

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:26.920
You couldn't get away from it.

02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:30.200
I thought it was very interesting about when that story hit is that you just saw all this

02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:35.760
like freaking cross fanboy wank all over the Internet all at once about like OMG there's

02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:39.800
going to be Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters and like all this stuff that ain't happening

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:42.160
as if Spider-Man was going to be in Toy Story 4.

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.160
No it's not.

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.280
I see that and I realize some of you might be making a joke but like seriously I heard

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.460
those jokes like 500 times this week all the that type of stuff and I don't think anything's

02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.460
going to change overnight.

02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:57.300
I mean I I kind of go back to Disney buying the Muppets like I realize it's a little different

02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:00.280
because the Muppets were the Muppets a company.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.040
I guess they were of some sort Jim Henson productions.

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.360
I guess it's a little different at the same time.

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.500
What changed with the Muppets.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.760
Not a lot.

02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.360
We got a cool 3D thing at Disneyland.

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:14.520
And so maybe we'll get a cool Marvel ride at California Adventure or whatever.

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:16.320
Maybe they'll bring back the 7th portal.

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.640
But it's going to be a while.

02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.320
Doesn't Marvel have an agreement with other theme parks.

02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.880
I know DC does.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.840
DC is what you see all over Magic Mountain and the Six Flags.

02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.800
I want to see the 7th portal come back.

02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:31.400
Oh come on you went on that with me at Great America.

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.560
I just I just don't think it's going to be like I don't think Disney is going to mean

02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.240
that Marvel is going to run the same way Disney does.

02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.920
I just think a lot of people are jumping to conclusions.

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:45.000
Ronma also said Darkwing Duck and the Avengers Disney fund it.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.680
And act up says the Incredibles versus Fantastic Four.

02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:49.920
Oh this is the best salacious pop.

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:53.400
I'd be on board for a Deadpool Hannah Montana crossover.

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:55.600
See I would totally be down for that.

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.600
Come on.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:58.480
Come on.

02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:00.200
Not happening.

02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:01.520
I would be so down for that.

02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.880
Although hey the Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters is kind of a neat idea.

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:07.280
It's just not going to happen right away.

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:11.400
Well hell we don't even know when Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to happen if anytime soon.

02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:17.320
So Ronma says Rob Roberts yeah but Disney already pulled the old budget cuts on one

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.160
of their publishing arms.

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:23.240
Well I hate to say it but that's kind of what happens sometimes when you know the businesses

02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:24.240
consolidate.

02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:26.200
But I don't know we'll see.

02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:29.280
We'll see if the creativity is stifled at all.

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:32.680
I just I just think a lot of people are doom and glooming a little early.

02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:33.680
We'll see.

02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:36.280
Anyhow let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.320
It's a segment here on the show where we get a little ranty a little angsty.

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:43.120
We have some sand in places that we need to have removed.

02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.040
So we do a little ranting here on the show.

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:47.640
It's something it's tradition we've done ever since episode one.

02:18:47.640 --> 02:19:02.880
Don't ask just rant.

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:05.160
We don't really have anything to inspire the FUs tonight.

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.360
I don't have a story but what about that guy that said that video games were poison or

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:10.360
whatever.

02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:11.680
We'll dedicate the FUs tonight to him.

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.680
The Gundam guy.

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.680
I had something actually.

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.680
Go for it.

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.680
Already.

02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:24.760
You know they're supposed to be doing Obama's speech in public schools on the 8th.

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:27.600
I don't know how I feel about this whole political but okay go for it.

02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:31.360
Well it's really it's an encouragement to stay in school.

02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:32.360
That's what it is.

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.120
I think it's great that you know that this is going out.

02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:40.640
It's a sign that you know our president does care about children instead of you know Bush

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.840
going how do you read.

02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:51.320
But at the same time what really pisses me off are all those people who say oh well this

02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.080
is going to interrupt my kids school day so I'm going to not let them go to school that

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:59.120
day.

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:00.120
That makes no sense.

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:03.960
It makes makes my brain go what.

02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:05.960
Why what.

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:09.520
You know especially when all the schools are making arrangements for children who don't

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:17.920
want for parents who don't want their children to see the the the speech that the schools

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:21.760
are making arrangements for children who aren't going to be allowed to see it.

02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:28.860
So I mean if you don't want to interrupt their education then why are you interrupting a

02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:34.640
full day of education as opposed to seven hours of education I mean that that makes

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.120
no sense to me.

02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:39.940
You people make no sense.

02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:44.880
My whole thing with the people just need to stop thinking in one extreme or the other.

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:49.000
I bet you when all is said and done nobody is blue and nobody is red everybody's a little

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:54.600
bit purple and just I'm the whole like taking kids out of school as some type of political

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.200
statement or whatever is just too extreme.

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:02.480
They're saying that they're doing it not so that their education isn't interrupted but

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:05.440
they're interrupting their children's education that day.

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:09.400
It's just you need to have a better argument just come right out and say I'm a fucking

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:15.960
racist or I you know my brain's too thick and my children I don't want them to have

02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:17.020
an open mind.

02:21:17.020 --> 02:21:19.840
Why not encourage disagreeing with the president.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:20.840
That's what this company is.

02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:24.640
If you disagree with the speech encourage your children to watch the speech let your

02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:30.080
children watch the speech and then talk about it you know be a fucking parent.

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.120
You know part of being a parent yeah true you have to make sure that your child's not

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:38.820
going to see anything harmful but at the same time you can't protect them from every damn

02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:41.680
little thing that you don't want them to see.

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:46.360
That's what the real world is you know I've met people who've grown up sheltered and they're

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:48.360
frightening people.

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:55.640
I also think that these same people if it had been a different president would be calling

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:58.880
the same acts that they are doing right now an American.

02:21:58.880 --> 02:21:59.880
You know what I mean?

02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:03.100
Like I just have a bad feeling there's a lot of hypocrites out there.

02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:05.840
So anyway let's get into the F.U.'s of the week.

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:06.840
So Dark Sakura.

02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:07.840
That was my F.U.

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:08.840
That was your F.U.

02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:09.840
All right there you go.

02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.160
I just thought it was my F.U.

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.240
I thought that was the story that inspires the F.U.

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:15.680
That inspired my F.U. and it was my F.U.

02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.680
Fair enough.

02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:21.680
Thank you Rockstar for getting rid of my modded Grand Theft Auto games and it's absolutely

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:25.240
ruined the whole Grand Theft Auto experience to us.

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:26.240
But you know what?

02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.960
I will find a way around it like I always do.

02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:32.600
I'm going to say something that's a total inside joke.

02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:35.760
There's maybe like two or three people that listening that would understand this.

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:41.360
But I'm just going to give a big F.U. this week to exclamation points.

02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:42.880
That's all I'm going to say F.U.

02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:45.160
Exclamation points.

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:50.920
Let's move on with a couple more gaming stories and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:56.680
Well people like making a lot of fan videos for different games and Makima is pretty popular.

02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:02.360
Well Naughty Dog has decided to show off what they've done to aid in that for Uncharted

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:03.640
2.

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:10.080
There's a lot of Makima tools available for you including the ability to actually green

02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:13.960
screen the backgrounds with your characters in there so you can actually edit different

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.320
things in there.

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:21.320
And also the ability to sync up your voice with the player's mouth movements so it actually

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:23.400
makes it look like they're talking.

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:28.480
And yeah it's really really cool.

02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:32.280
Apparently they do have an animation system I guess that's intelligent enough to turn

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:38.760
your audio stream into lip syncing for the on screen characters.

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:44.080
But I don't know I guess it's neat that they're offering all these things.

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:48.720
I wonder if we will actually see a lot of Makima videos for this.

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:52.480
That's kind of interesting when gaming companies kind of really embrace the whole Makima thing

02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.480
you know.

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:54.480
Yeah.

02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:57.800
That's what I liked about this story was that you know they're really kind of showing that

02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:02.040
off and you know leaving it to people's creativity to make whatever they're going to make.

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:04.920
But it's really interesting how more and more gaming companies really embrace it.

02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.880
But you know I mean obviously a lot of that stuff is just free promotion for the game

02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:09.880
right.

02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:10.880
Yeah exactly.

02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:12.340
Well there you go.

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:15.840
One more story for you guys and then your phone calls.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:20.320
There is a company that will be making a brand new console.

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:27.540
It's a company called Xtal Corporation or maybe Shtal Corporation I don't know X-T-A-L.

02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:31.640
Actually their full name is Silicon Xtal Corporation.

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:35.880
They filed a trademark recently for the term sex box.

02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:41.040
That's right sex box because this company they're going to be making a video game system

02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:46.800
that only plays interactive adult only rated video game titles.

02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:48.320
Hell yes.

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:53.960
By the way just so you know only about 20 adult only titles even exist right now.

02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.200
One of them being Grand Theft Auto 4 after the whole debacle of hot coffee.

02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.840
But most of them are just dumpy little PC games that happen to involve a lot of sex.

02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:02.840
You mean Sandra's?

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:03.840
Yeah I'm sorry Sandra's.

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.880
Yeah that's what I meant sorry.

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:14.320
By the way as well as specializing in the adult only games the sex box will also give

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.440
its owners access to adult only content and entertainment and all sorts of other digital

02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:20.440
forms.

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:24.440
I'm assuming this means like streaming movies and video and all that.

02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:30.680
Video video HDTV DVD online gaming social networking webcams video on demand downloading

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:38.760
movie rentals purchases etc etc etc everything but real fucking will be included on this

02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:39.760
sex box.

02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.140
Only because the technology doesn't exist yet.

02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:43.140
What do you think?

02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:44.880
Loki you seem to be a big advocate for the sex box.

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.260
I mean is this something legit or is this TEEHEE?

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:50.520
I think the way they're going to approach it is going to be TEEHEE.

02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:56.240
But I'm all about a system that will allow publishers assuming that they actually want

02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:01.360
to put out stuff on this system the opportunity to put out games uncensored.

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.000
And yes we're probably going to see a lot of porno games that are probably going to

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.220
be crap but at the same time if they want to release a really fucking crazy version

02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:11.160
of Manhunt 2 or something like that they can do it.

02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:16.000
And you know I applaud that but at the same time I think it's going to be kind of lame.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.740
However that being said assuming that the games on there look pretty decent I will probably

02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:27.480
pick one of these up because it will be funny I can go hee hee I have a sex box.

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:34.680
You know what I'm all for I've gotten into this rant a long long time ago on this show

02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:40.360
I'm all for sexier video games and all this and just downloading porn on your Playstation

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:41.360
3 and Xbox.

02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:44.240
I understand why the companies don't want to open Pandora's box and that whole thing

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.880
but why not?

02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.720
I mean it's just because we have this whole stigma in our society where the violence is

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:56.480
okay Manhunt 2 is okay in a lot of these games and the Saw movies are fine but heaven

02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:02.640
forbid we show a cock or some bush and I'm not talking about a president on the television

02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.400
you know it's just I'll never get it.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.840
But granted how can you make a serious game out of sex?

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:14.080
I mean a lot of these AO games we've seen like the what the three feel and stuff those

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:15.720
were all a little silly.

02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:19.360
Well they are a little silly but also some of the games do get an AO rating it's really

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.000
silly what they're getting it for and I would be fine to see legitimate games and just maybe

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.280
push they just you know push the boundaries a bit but at the same time I think a lot of

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:32.400
it's just gonna be like hey look now that we can do adult only content let's just put

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:36.960
boobs and tits everywhere and you know just like make lots of fucking everywhere and that's

02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:40.800
it it's gonna be kind of gimmicky.

02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:46.200
I hope they put some real time and investment into making like a serious game out of it

02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:50.160
to just really wow everybody instead of all these cheap games that just have titties and

02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:53.760
stuff like make like an epic fuck quest or something like that.

02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:58.840
Not necessarily you know with you know sex but like over the top violence you know something

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:03.520
like absolutely crazy where you can just rip parts off of people and it's you know gruesomely

02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.360
detailed and stuff like that.

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:08.560
I don't want violence I want cock and titty.

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.400
I like violence.

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:11.920
I like I want violence.

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:17.080
Fine you'll play a cock and a titty that goes around ripping you know limbs off of people

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:21.440
there you go or deke man in chat says rip parts off of people and fuck them with it

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:27.980
you know you're dirty make what is wrong with you a game called naked slayer huh naked slayer

02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.480
you can play slayer you can play either a guy or girl you can choose you know whatever

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:38.000
their orientation is and they run around naked killing people that's like American Psycho

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:41.960
pretty much that's like seeing through a two or just golden golden axe was almost there

02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:48.840
I mean those costumes golden axe didn't leave much to the imagination you know so um salacious

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:52.400
pop and chat says apparently they're still making leisure suit Larry games though Sierra

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:55.560
and the dude who originally made them have nothing to do with that and they're terrible

02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.800
that's true uh in fact that last one was had an AO rated version and it was pretty bad

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.920
and they are making still a new one there's a new one right they have that magna cum laude

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.640
or whatever that was a little stupid and they have a new one coming out right I think I

02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.520
remember hearing a story on that earlier they had a new one that came out a while ago that

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:21.120
was kind of eh I like that idea by salacious pop uh professor Layton goes to boner town

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:27.680
professor Layton Layton that's funny um you know the whole the whole social networking

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:33.800
thing though could be interesting I mean a lot of people really unleash their sexuality

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.940
when they're hiding behind a computer monitor and you might be able to find people that

02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:42.320
are into the same freaky shit you might be into like for example let me think of a fetish

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:45.880
that not a lot of people are into that's not completely disgusting there's actually you

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:52.720
can actually um quote Patton Oswald on that huh talking about there's a magazine for that

02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:56.040
you know for every fetish that you think is so dirty and awful there's a magazine about

02:29:56.040 --> 02:30:02.240
it yeah piss drinkers oh god although I'm sure there's people into that so whatever

02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:05.800
but I'm saying that that's like the perfect the perfect uh so that just reminded me I'm

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:09.160
trying to think of something that's not just like totally disgusting that I can use my

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:15.720
example okay here's one some people have a food fight fetish okay they want to have sex

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:20.600
after a food fight like getting like really dirty like just rubbing around and like yeah

02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:24.920
I don't know like pies and and salads and stuff I don't know like we're gonna have a

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:30.480
food fight and then we're no one has a salad I've heard about this on the radio it's true

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:33.800
but here's the thing like if you have a food fight fetish or whatever like you could go

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:39.240
on to this like sex box console find somebody else with the same fetish as you and then

02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:46.540
have some safe fun together that what's wrong with that as long as these consoles preach

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:52.420
safety and you know not things that are illegal like ripping parts off of dead people and

02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:58.200
fucking them with them that's not legal but as long as this encourages save money legal

02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:03.080
things within boundaries with consenting adults that have to prove that they are adults in

02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:12.860
order to even be able to log into this service why not why not all right Leo Shannon chat

02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:16.860
says Rob you should give angels feather a try it's basically a game with Final Fantasy

02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:22.720

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:35.980
too all right anyhow salacious pop it chat says I don't think ants should be a possible

02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:46.980
consequence of sex that's why you shower afterwards I don't know I'm just trying to think of something

02:31:46.980 --> 02:31:51.800
that's not like drinking pee like Jamie suggested that's a bit much but if you're if that's

02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:56.720
what you're into and both people consent then and your doctor says it's okay then have fun

02:31:56.720 --> 02:32:03.040
it looks like that one of those dating sim type games there we go act-def people have

balloon fetishes that's that why isn't there any like pie pod fetishes remember the pie

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:15.540

those sex machines but it's the sex machine stuff with a food fetish in there as well

02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:30.640

some key kooka right now just like uh had my first lighter my first heart cider um but

02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:42.720
yeah i've just like been keeping up on what's been going on in packs especially the fact

02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:47.620
that one of the one of the guys in xbox live you know had at the little quote unquote sermon

02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:52.700
about the band hammer i actually caught on kataku earlier today i did not hear about

02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:58.040
this tell us a little bit about it huh i didn't hear about this whole spiel what happened

02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.640
there tell us a little bit about what happened i think it was basically one of the guys who

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:07.020
worked for microsoft or xbox live and his charter but maintaining order within there

02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:16.020
and, you know, the one that wields a ban hammer, and he was basically just, basically, you know, giving a speech in the form of an actual, like, religious sermon,

02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:27.020
and the way he was using, like, a lot of religious terms in terms of how he managed to wield the, you know, in other words, like, the name, like, the gamer tags,

02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:39.020
and how, you know, they get banned, and then he's saying, like, but this guy is merciful, even though, you know, and he'll give you a second chance if you use any ban term in your gamer tag.

02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:46.020
And then the other one, and then this other thing, hold on a sec, I already did it.

02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:47.020
Oh, sure, we can hold.

02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:59.020
But, yeah, he was basically saying stuff about, like, the, like, in Battlefield, where they were just, like, trying to, he was just preaching about how they were kicking certain other players.

02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:01.020
It was basically some really, really religious stuff in PAX.

02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:09.020
You know, PAX does manage to get some pretty kick-ass speeches, usually, and that is one thing I'm sad about missing in PAX this year.

02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:10.020
All right.

02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:13.020
All right, you gotta go, Zaku? You gotta get your hook on?

02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:14.020
No, no, I'm still here.

02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:15.020
Oh, okay.

02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:19.020
No, no, I'm still here. I think we're about to head out, but I'm actually still good for talking.

02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:23.020
All right, well, give us any final thoughts, quickly, because we do want to get some other calls.

02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:34.020
Well, basically, I heard that the new WiiWare game, that Contra game, is, like, supposed to be really hard to tell, that you can't even, that you can't even get through.

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:40.020
I know it was already out in Japan earlier this year, but I figured that it might present a challenge to folks.

02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:42.020
The original Contra was hard as hell.

02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:46.020
Do you know anybody that can beat it without the up, up, down, down, left, right code?

02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:47.020
Dan can.

02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.020
Dan's a freak.

02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:54.020
Basically, the way, I mean, from what I've seen, it's pretty much, it's a hard, I mean, it's pretty damn hard.

02:35:54.020 --> 02:36:03.020
I mean, if you're going to be chugging away lives on Contra and the fact that it's, like, old-school classic Contra where you just, like, get your ass kicked after the first seconds without the code.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:16.020
I mean, I'm already, I'm already talking right now with this other guy who's, like, really good in, like, you know, really deep in games and the fact that he managed to get Contra evolved a lot earlier than most of us did.

02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:18.020
He got the Japanese version.

02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:26.020
But even then, he's just, he's just chugging it off because he's, you know, he's pretty much a classic gamer in that sense.

02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:30.020
So a challenge like that wouldn't be, it would be a no-brainer.

02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:34.020
Weird that they haven't released that over here in the U.S. yet, though, but I guess soon enough.

02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:40.020
I know, it's supposed to come out, actually, it's supposed to come out tomorrow, but it only came out in Europe.

02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:44.020
I hope they dumbed it down for us Americans like they usually do.

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.020
What?

02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:50.020
I said I hope they dumbed it down for the Americans like they usually do then and give us the 30 last words.

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:56.020
I heard the folks at Kotaku were complaining about the fact that it was, that it was pretty damn hard.

02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:57.020
All right.

02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:00.020
Well, Zaku, we gotta let you go. Have fun at the hookah bar.

02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:01.020
All right.

02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:03.020
Smoke one for us, all right?

02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:06.020
Yes, I will. Have a good one. Have a good liberty.

02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:07.020
All right.

02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:12.020
See, you know what's interesting is I always tease Zaku for sounding like a stoner even though I don't really think he is.

02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:14.020
I think he's told me like he's not.

02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:18.020
But he actually, didn't he sound like really upbeat and happy tonight?

02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:21.020
Like he didn't sound like so stoned calling us from the hookah bar.

02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:22.020
I'm not surprised.

02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:23.020
He sounded really happy and upbeat tonight.

02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:25.020
Because he's at a hookah bar.

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:26.020
That's right. He's smoking up.

02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:28.020
Light another one, dude.

02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:32.020
Hookah bar does not get you high raw.

02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:33.020
No, I know it doesn't.

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:35.020
However, it's really fun to blow smoke bubbles.

02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:37.020
I know. I had hookah once.

02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:40.020
Anyway, so back to the Data East collection here.

02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:42.020
Some of the games are going to be included with it.

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:52.020
Magical Drop 3, Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, Burger Time, Caveman Ninja, Street Slam, and Secret Agent.

02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:54.020
Too many ninjas as if there was such a thing.

02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:55.020
Yeah.

02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:59.020
So, I don't know. It's pretty awesome.

02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:01.020
Alright, let's go to another call.

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:03.020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:06.020
Hey, I'm DS Master 25.

02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:09.020
Hi, DS Master 25. What is on your mind?

02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:13.020
Oh, I'm 26 because I aged.

02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:15.020
But, oh well.

02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:22.020
Basically, the whole, I've been playing a whole lot of old school titles.

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.020
Like what?

02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:24.020
For the past few weeks now.

02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:33.020
I've been trying my best at trying to beat Contra for the Super C.

02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:35.020
For the Super NES.

02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:38.020
And, I swear to you.

02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.020
Hold on.

02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:40.020
Hold on.

02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:43.020
What is with all the Contra revival tonight?

02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:45.020
Like, that's two Contra calls in a row.

02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.020
That is some strange anomaly.

02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:48.020
It's a rite of passage, Rob.

02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:49.020
I don't understand.

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:52.020
For the life of any young gamer, the rite of passage is making it through Contra.

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:56.020
Don't get me wrong. Super C on the Super Nintendo was badass.

02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:59.020
And, everybody should play it once. Those Mode 7 stages were pretty awesome.

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:03.020
But, I just find it very strange. We've had two calls about Contra back to back.

02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:06.020
Is every caller going to ask about Contra tonight?

02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.020
No, I don't know.

02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:09.020
It's not just Contra I've been playing.

02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:20.020
But, also, this homebrew version of DDR for the Nintendo DS I came across called DS DS Revolution.

02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:23.020
Well, I would hope you don't dance on your DS. You might break it.

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.020
No, it's like...

02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:30.020
Did you guys ever come across, like, the old Game Boy?

02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:35.020
Yeah, I played the Game Boy Color ones. They were hideous.

02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:39.020
It was just a way to memorize step charts on the go. That's really the only reason I have it.

02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:42.020
Well, basically, okay.

02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:49.020
The controls came to do multiple arrows and everything with using A and B for the up and right arrows.

02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:56.020
Apparently, DS DS Revolution seems to do the same exact thing, which is weird.

02:39:56.020 --> 02:40:02.020
And, of course, I got the new R4i so I can play my homebrew stuff on my DSi.

02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:08.020
And, I'll say here, it sounds a whole lot better than it did on my DS Lite.

02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:16.020
But, other than that, I've mostly been trying to play some of my old Genesis games.

02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:20.020
My Genesis doesn't work anymore. Which sucks.

02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:22.020
What was that on Genesis?

02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:26.020
My Genesis does not work anymore. Period.

02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:33.020
Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, get that freaking collection on the 360 or PS3. It's amazing. There's, like, tons of games on it.

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:42.020
No, but here's the cool thing, though. Because I found a really easy to use, easy to install emulator for the Nintendo DS,

02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:48.020
I've been using that now. Because I also had the thought of trying to play Genesis games on the go.

02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:57.020
And most of my collection was as follows. Outrun, King of Fighters, I had Monopoly, but the emulator does not run.

02:40:57.020 --> 02:41:04.020
Look, I'm just saying, if you want to do it legitimately, the Mega collection's not a bad deal. But anyway, sorry.

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:15.020
Yeah, I mean, it, you know, even though, like, you know, granted, I'm 17, you know, and I was never around when these games originally came out,

02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:21.020
but I'm like, you know, it's great every once in a while to, you know, have an old school jig every once in a while.

02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:28.020
Wait, wait, wait. I have a very important question. You said at the top, you introduced yourself as DS Master 25,

02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:34.020
and then said, no, wait, I'm DS Master 26 because I age. And now you just said you're 17. I'm totally lost.

02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:36.020
How old are you?

02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:39.020
Well, I'm 17.

02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:42.020
Okay, so where's the 26 come from?

02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:48.020
Well, because all the DS Master tells are taken up, and 25 is the only one available at the time.

02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:54.020
So it took that, and so now it's 26.

02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:58.020
Okay. All right, I had, no, this was important.

02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.020
No, it wasn't.

02:41:59.020 --> 02:42:01.020
This is very important.

02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:12.020
Oh, and plus I have a review for a bit on a new DS, well, semi-new DS title that I came across, Chinatown Wars.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:15.020
All right, make it quick, because we gotta get some more calls.

02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:24.020
Basically, I gotta say here, it looks exactly like the old PlayStation 1 GTA renditions.

02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:28.020
It actually runs quite well on the DS.

02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:37.020
And then another quickie, which I give that one a five stars, and then my last quickie review, Quake Live.

02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:46.020
Recommended, you have a pretty decent hardware, because I got, it was getting a little bit shaky when there was multiple explosions on the screen.

02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:56.020
And don't try to play with a trackpad mouse on a laptop, because I'll tell you this, this says murder on my hands beyond belief.

02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:57.020
Yeah.

02:42:57.020 --> 02:43:08.020
I had my index finger and all the rest of my fingers up to the WSAD keys, my thumb all the way stretched down to the left mouse button to shoot, and used my right hand to try to aim.

02:43:08.020 --> 02:43:11.020
I definitely don't play Quake Live on the netbook.

02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:15.020
All right, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.

02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:16.020
Peace out.

02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:18.020
Later.

02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:23.020
Well, you see, DS Master 1 through 24 was taken, so I just went for 25.

02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:27.020
I'll have you know that someone linked me in chat to a listing on eBay.

02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:37.020
Yes, for $235 plus shipping, we can own our own edible image, edible ink cake printer that will allow us to print emails and eat them.

02:43:37.020 --> 02:43:41.020
For $235, that's not bad. I'm thinking about it. That would be good.

02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.020
I do have a challenge, though, on a future show.

02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:48.020
I would like to hear from DS Masters 1 through 23 at some point.

02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:52.020
I just want to know where they are, 1 through 24.

02:43:52.020 --> 02:44:00.020
I would love to hear from DS Master 2 or someone with a lot of seniority in the DS Master chain.

02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:07.020
1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to hear your voice on our lovely radio program, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:07.020 --> 02:44:09.020
I mean, while distracting Rob.

02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:11.020
Oh, with people of Walmart.com?

02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:12.020
With people of Walmart.com.

02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:15.020
That site is hilarious, but I'm just worried it's going to get old in a month.

02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:17.020
Just look at the fail.

02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:19.020
It's pretty funny.

02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:23.020
Our phone's not ringing. I guess we're not getting any other calls.

02:44:23.020 --> 02:44:27.020
We sometimes have a quick delay, so I'll give it another moment for calls.

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:29.020
One more story, Logan?

02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:35.020
Crazy Kart Racing comes to the iPhone App Store, apparently, last week.

02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:43.020
For $8, it's a Konami racing game featuring a cool roster of characters, including Pyramid Head, Robby the Rabbit,

02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:51.020
and, of course, characters from Rumble Roses, Frogger, Goemon.

02:44:51.020 --> 02:44:59.020
They even have Taco from Parodius, it looks like.

02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:01.020
So that's interesting.

02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:03.020
They even have Pyramid Head in the shot. It's kind of funny.

02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:05.020
Phone's ringing.

02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:08.020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:10.020
Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:12.020
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind?

02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:15.020
Oh, you know, a couple things.

02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:25.020
Yeah, I just got one of your little stories about an adults-only console that's about to come out.

02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:28.020
And what are your thoughts on the adults-only console?

02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:40.020
It's kind of Fe. I would have to get some more information about it before I fully form an opinion one way or the other.

02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:51.020
But at least for the moment, the question is, even though the game's going to be adults-only, are they going to be actually any good?

02:45:51.020 --> 02:46:01.020
I mean, you can always draw a parallel to a lot of the mature titles that came out at least last generation.

02:46:01.020 --> 02:46:14.020
Like, for example, if you want to compare them to, like, the Grand Theft Auto games to, like, BMX Triple X or the Rumble Roll.

02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:20.020
BMX Triple X was awesome. Awesomely bad, but in a so-bad-it-was-good kind of way.

02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:22.020
You could carry a hose around on your bike.

02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:31.020
I got to derail this conversation for a minute, Spazinator, because I have a topic I need to hear about from you, because we just had DS Master on the show talking about where his name comes from.

02:46:31.020 --> 02:46:34.020
I need to know where Spazinator comes from.

02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:41.020
It's kind of a weird story. I assume you're familiar with the American pie movies, right?

02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:43.020
Yes.

02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:51.020
Yeah, you know how there's a character on here that goes by the name of the Shervenator?

02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:52.020
Yes.

02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:59.020
Well, when I mean Spazinator, this is back in the PS2 days.

02:46:59.020 --> 02:47:13.020
I literally just got down watching the first American pie movie, and I also had those kinds of network adapters and SoCon 2.

02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:23.020
I went to create a screen name, and I thought, there's a Shervenator. I like the American pie movies.

02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:32.020
I changed the name up a little bit, and the first thing I paid the money was Spazinator.

02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:46.020
Eventually, the name kind of stuck. I started using the screen name on all the games. It's just really a little consistent, so it kind of stuck.

02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:51.020
I'm so glad I asked. Okay, that's cool.

02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:58.020
What else do I want to ask you about? I don't know. Tell us one more thing that's on your mind, and then we're going to take another call.

02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:11.020
Yeah, right at the top of the show, F.B. got off the pole with Bobby. You mentioned during your gaming week that you picked up the pinball game.

02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:13.020
Yes.

02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:24.020
Yeah, I actually just got there a couple days ago, and by looking at it, I figured out what table it's on, and I actually beat one of your scores so far.

02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:30.020
Well, I haven't played it enough, so give me a little credit. I barely, barely touched the game yet.

02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:36.020
All right, Spazinator, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much. Take care, okay?

02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:37.020
All right, have a good one.

02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:40.020
Later.

02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:45.020
Excuse me. What's wrong? You all right over there?

02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:46.020
I'm crying for other reasons.

02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:49.020
Why? Did a Sim die on you or something?

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:50.020
No.

02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:53.020
Okay. Did a part of your soul die?

02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:55.020
She's playing Sims 3.

02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:58.020
Part of my soul died just in the last...

02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:05.020
1877 Game O.L.R., if you'd like to give us a call, or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype.

02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:09.020
Loki, did you have some more last minute stories? Oh, never mind. We're getting another call. Let's take the call.

02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:12.020
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:14.020
This is Deathwishing.

02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:15.020
Woohoo!

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:16.020
Hi, Deathwishing. Hey.

02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:19.020
I'm sorry I tore apart your grammar earlier.

02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:23.020
You got to talk loud so I can barely hear you.

02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:27.020
Okay, I will talk loud.

02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:35.020
Deathwishing, I don't care why you called tonight. I have a question for you.

02:49:35.020 --> 02:49:36.020
About my name?

02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:41.020
Yes, where does your name come from? I must know.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.020
Counter-Strike.

02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.020
Actually, I died a lot.

02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:54.020
Why can't everybody have a story like that?

02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:57.020
Where did your name come from? You're a mom.

02:49:57.020 --> 02:50:04.020
Alright, fine. Since your story was so short, what did you want to call in about tonight?

02:50:04.020 --> 02:50:20.020
My name is Deathwishing, the sex box. It's kind of stupid in a way. One, it's kind of a rip-off of Internet meme name stuff. Do we really need a porn game console?

02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:25.020
It's not a lolcat console. It's not a Two Girls One Cup console.

02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:31.020
It probably has a lolcat fetish, so it probably will be a lolcat console.

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:39.020
There's something I hadn't thought of. Would you be interested in meeting people on the Internet with a lolcat fetish, Deathwishing?

02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:42.020
No, I have a girlfriend, so I don't mean it.

02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:48.020
I can has fucking? Is there any lolcat cosplay is what I want to know?

02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:56.020
I should do that. I'll just walk around in cat ears with a sign that says, I can has, and then insert random items.

02:50:56.020 --> 02:50:57.020
It has to have been done.

02:50:57.020 --> 02:50:59.020
Yes, it has been done.

02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:00.020
I'm sorry.

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:04.020
We had someone go around as a lolcat.

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:07.020
Yes, your thoughts on the sex box, sir?

02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:12.020
You guys were following PAX coverage, right?

02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:15.020
Yeah, a little bit. We had Bobby calling in from PAX.

02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:22.020
Well, apparently there's Street Fighter 6 they have for sale there, like limited edition for PAX only.

02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:23.020
That's pretty cool.

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:24.020
Yeah, the girl one.

02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:25.020
Nice.

02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:29.020
And, well, you gave one away for free.

02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:30.020
Lucky.

02:51:30.020 --> 02:51:33.020
Oh, they didn't get a thousand viewers.

02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:40.020
Oh, yeah, I heard something like some people were streaming it live on the Internet, like all of PAX.

02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:44.020
And they did give one away, or they didn't?

02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:49.020
I'm not sure they might have. All I know is they gave away a lot of swag and stuff.

02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:54.020
But they would only give it away if they got a thousand viewers, you said?

02:51:54.020 --> 02:51:59.020
You know, they'd try to give it away anyway. I mean, the guy they heard about, they just went and bought two.

02:51:59.020 --> 02:52:02.020
Because, I don't know, for some reason I thought for a minute about those whole, like,

02:52:02.020 --> 02:52:06.020
we're only going to give something away when we get so many followers on Twitter or something like that.

02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:11.020
Like, I hate those contests because obviously it's just a complete attention-horror grab, which, yeah, I understand that.

02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:18.020
But at the same time, aren't you disrespecting the listeners you do have or the viewers or followers you do have by saying, well...

02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:20.020
It's just a shameless promotion.

02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:22.020
It is completely shameless.

02:52:22.020 --> 02:52:26.020
Like, hey, you know what? We used to do Orange Laundrio for 12 people and loved it.

02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:31.020
And so I don't understand this whole, like, we're not going to pay attention to you until we get 500.

02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:33.020
I just think it's disrespectful to others.

02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:37.020
I'm sorry, that was a tangent you probably weren't intending on, but you got it.

02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:42.020
You know, I really think no one really even cared about the new track thing either.

02:52:42.020 --> 02:52:50.020
I think someone said they posted the link to it on Chan.com and nothing happened.

02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:57.020
I saw a user tell I was watching off to, like, from 197 to 200 and then went back down lower than before.

02:52:57.020 --> 02:52:59.020
Maybe everybody was at PAX.

02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:03.020
I don't know.

02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:06.020
Death Wishing, is there a fight breaking out behind you?

02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:14.020
Well, there's these people playing some game called, oh, well, they stopped playing Hero of New Earth, which is kind of like Dota.

02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:16.020
And they're all playing Star Cry 2 now.

02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.020
Oh, okay.

02:53:17.020 --> 02:53:22.020
Alright, we're going to let you go Death Wishing so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

02:53:22.020 --> 02:53:23.020
Bye bye.

02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:24.020
Later.

02:53:24.020 --> 02:53:27.020
I'm now shutting off the Skype line.

02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:29.020
That's it. No more calls tonight.

02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:32.020
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:35.020
Loki, did you have anything else for us before we close out shop tonight?

02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:36.020
Yeah, real quick.

02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:39.020
The ESRB has rated more games coming to the PlayStation Network.

02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:43.020
These are PlayStation 1 download titles, including Blood Omen, Legacy of Kain,

02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:50.020
Cool Borders 3, International Track and Field, Oddworld Ape's Exodus, and Oddworld Ape's Odyssey,

02:53:50.020 --> 02:53:54.020
Pandemonium, Syphon Filter 2, and Umjammer Lammy.

02:53:54.020 --> 02:53:56.020
Didn't some of those already come out this week?

02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:58.020
I thought I heard some of those came out this week.

02:53:58.020 --> 02:54:10.020
Um, well, Umjammer Lammy came out in Japan, and actually, Blood Omen and Pandemonium were rated before previously in March.

02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:13.020
I don't think any of them actually came out this week, though.

02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:17.020
But it's in need, I guess.

02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:23.020
And we talked a little bit, I think, before about how Guitar Hero World Tour is going to have an option to,

02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:28.020
or Guitar Hero 5 is going to have an option to import some tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:31.020
However, it's actually quite pathetic.

02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:36.020
Only 35 of World Tour's 86 tracks are actually going to be available to import,

02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:40.020
and it's going to cost you $3.50 to do so.

02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:45.020
And also, Smash Hits is only going to have a few tracks to import as well.

02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:54.020
I believe they're going to have, oh, let's see here, 21 songs from Smash Hits available to import,

02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:58.020
with an undisclosed price on that one, and that's coming out later this fall.

02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:03.020
But it's still pathetic, if you ask me, since Rock Band, you can import everything except for three tracks.

02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:07.020
Well, it depends what the songs are, too. Maybe they weren't willing to pony up the money, I don't know.

02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:09.020
Whatever.

02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:19.020
And then finally, apparently there's new versions of Bonk, Bomberman, and I think maybe some other games coming as well.

02:55:19.020 --> 02:55:22.020
And these were discovered on Hudson's website.

02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:27.020
Apparently there's a Bonk update coming, a Bomberman live sequel,

02:55:27.020 --> 02:55:34.020
and a Wii and DS version of a game called Rooms the Main Building.

02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:38.020
And apparently the Bonk game's called Brink of Extinction.

02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:41.020
It's coming to WiiWare, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live.

02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:47.020
It's going to be a 2.5D action platformer game with online co-op.

02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:50.020
And apparently Bonk's going to have eight different transformations.

02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:58.020
And also, it's supposed to be out spring 2010.

02:55:58.020 --> 02:56:02.020
And I guess Bomberman Live Battle Fest coming to all three consoles as well.

02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:05.020
And they've got new arenas, game types, and team play.

02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:13.020
And I guess Rooms the Main Building, that's supposed to be a Wii or DS retail title.

02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:15.020
Interesting.

02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:20.020
And I guess now Bonk and Bomberman have been officially announced by Hudson with screenshots.

02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:24.020
And it looks like Bonk and Bomberman.

02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:27.020
So not much to report there.

02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:29.020
That's it.

02:56:29.020 --> 02:56:31.020
Alright.

02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:33.020
Sounds awesome.

02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:37.020
Bonk is one of those things that's a little better left in my memory, I think.

02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:39.020
But I don't know, if they soup it up a little bit it might be cool.

02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:48.020
It's going to be like a 3D remake of Hudson's Adventure Island and it was not very good, if I remember correctly.

02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:49.020
Alright.

02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:53.020
Well, let's go ahead and start to wrap up and get the hell out of here for the night.

02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:56.020
And in order to do that we need to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:56:56.020 --> 02:56:58.020
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:56:58.020 --> 02:57:01.020
Frozen yogurt.

02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:03.020
My final thought is, sounds amazing.

02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:07.020
And I thought this show would be shorter tonight, but it was actually kind of long tonight.

02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:08.020
Go figure.

02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:11.020
Sometimes you just never know how long the show is going to go.

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.020
Loki.

02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:14.020
So, I have a toy for my cat.

02:57:14.020 --> 02:57:18.020
It's a laser pointer, but the thing is the laser pointer is shaped like a cat.

02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:22.020
So does that make it a laser cat?

02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:24.020
Possibly.

02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:26.020
Definitely.

02:57:26.020 --> 02:57:29.020
Because it is a cat that fires a laser, so.

02:57:29.020 --> 02:57:31.020
At least you don't have a laser cat fetish.

02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:34.020
And on that note, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into Orange Laundry Video.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:36.020
We really appreciate your support.

02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:40.020
Hey, if you like what you've heard, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the station.

02:57:40.020 --> 02:57:43.020
Because you know what, we don't have a big magazine promoting us.

02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:45.020
We don't have zillions of followers on Twitter.

02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:49.020
And we're never going to have a contest that we'll only do if so many people follow us or what have you.

02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:51.020
You know, just help us get the word out.

02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:52.020
That's all we ask.

02:57:52.020 --> 02:57:53.020
However you can do it.

02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:55.020
Through an iTunes review, through anything.

02:57:55.020 --> 02:57:59.020
And we'll try to keep it free for you guys for another seven years, all right?

02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:00.020
Have a good night everybody.

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:01.020
We'll see you next week.

02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:04.020
We will be back next week with even more of the latest and greatest in video gaming.

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:09.020
And of course, we're starting to get to the start of that fourth quarter where we're just going to have games after games after games.

02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:15.020
So our reviews and yours sitting around talking smack about what we love, video games.

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:16.020
I'm Rob Roberts.

02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:17.020
She's DarkSakura.

02:58:17.020 --> 02:58:18.020
He's Loki.

02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:20.020
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:23.020
