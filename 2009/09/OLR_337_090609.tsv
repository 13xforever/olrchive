0	19760	Today, September 6th, 2009, a once-pay-wee channel goes free, a new racing game will
19760	29800	be integrating Twitter, and we recap and talk about the news from PAX 2009.
29800	35160	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week here of
35160	39760	Orange Lounge Radio. We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming,
39760	46600	gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We tape live every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.
46600	50360	A big thanks to our friends at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.
50360	54320	I'm here with you for the next three hours. My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always,
54320	58240	for the past seven and a half years, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,
58240	63120	Jamie Summers. Nom, nom, nom. Nom, nom, nom. How are you? Nomming. Okay, quickly,
63120	67920	Orange Lounge Fudio, what are you nomming on tonight? Brains. Shut up. Pizza. Pizza.
67920	72000	With extra garlic. It's a cheese pizza, but I added garlic to it because garlic makes
72000	76360	everything better. It will keep the vampires away. Awesome. Also, joining us tonight,
76360	79840	say hello to the one and only Loki. Hello. Loki, you look like you're listening to
79840	83640	something else over there. I'm trying to, but I hate these, like, earbud headphones.
83640	87560	What are you, uh, any hints on what you, is this cage match for later, or what is it? Yeah,
87560	91080	because I didn't pick anything. I see. Per usual. All right, and if you don't know what
91080	93760	I'm talking about, that's because you've never tuned in live before. We do a little,
93760	96960	little special thing after the show. You'll have to tune in live sometime. I'm hoping,
96960	100720	because it's Labor Day, maybe we get some people listening live that haven't listened before. So,
100720	107720	a big hello to all of you, uh, that are new to us broadcasting live. Be sure to join our chat room,
107720	113160	chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and we will read, uh, some comments from chat, and, uh, comment
113160	118000	from the Rob D in chat, uh, early this evening. You know it's PAX weekend when Orange Lounge is
118000	123000	talking old DDR, and AllGames.com is discussing condom reviews. I guess the AllGames chat is
123000	129160	talking about, uh, condoms. So, uh, way to be mature. No, I'm... Please, like, I should be
129160	133120	judging on that, uh, part. Um, we're completely immature here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'm
133120	138360	glad the Rob D brought up PAX, because it is Penny Arcade Week, uh, Penny Arcade Expo Weekend.
138360	143880	Sadly, the three of us could not go this year. We all went last year, but we kinda ate the money
143880	150040	in the budget for E3. But, our dear friend, Bobby Blackwolf, is live at the show. We're gonna call
150040	156360	him right now, and talk to him about Penny Arcade Expo. One ringy dingy dingy.
156360	160280	Farid Exterminators.
160280	161360	Hi, Bobby.
161360	164440	Hey, Bob. Hey, Rob. What's up, guys?
164440	165960	Not much. How are you doing?
165960	170840	Doing good. It's, uh, been a long weekend, but I've had a lot of fun here.
170840	175000	Alright, Bobby Blackwolf, of course. I need to give you a proper introduction. He is the man who
175000	180560	takes the Bobby Blackwolf show live at five o'clock right before we are live. He sadly was
180560	185480	not live tonight, but he did have a sneak peek of the rock band Beatles that he got a little early
185480	188640	from Harmonix. So, uh, props to you, Blackwolf.
188640	193120	And, by the way, it's the Beatles rock band. They are very strict on that.
193120	198480	Oh. Oh, well, I am sorry. The Beatles rock band. I'm sorry. Beatles first. How dare I?
198480	202320	Of course, the Beatles always first. Alright, well, Bobby, let's talk about it. If they want to hear
202320	208480	Beatles rock band, they can download that show. Bobby, let's talk about PAX. How was it? Did you have fun?
208480	214240	I had fun. And, I mean, I kind of did kind of what you guys did at E3. We did not do any appointments.
214240	218400	We did not set any interviews. So, we were able to just kind of go around and spend as much or as
218400	225520	little time as we wanted. And, but, for those of us who did go to E3, there's a lot here that was
225520	231360	repeated and regurgitated. A lot of the same E3 builds, the E3 demos were here on the show floor.
231360	236640	But, it was nice to see regular folk get a chance at the same things that we saw a couple months ago.
236640	239920	So, it was a lot of fun to see their reactions, see what they thought about it.
239920	243280	You know, I kind of had a feeling that what happened is that you'd see at Penny Arcade Expo
243280	247680	kind of a lot of the same stuff that you saw at E3. And, let's not forget Blizzcon because, you know,
247680	252320	Blizzard showed up at PAX. They didn't go to E3, but brought mini Blizzcon with them a little bit.
253760	257920	What was, did you see anything interesting to you that you did not see at E3? Some new things?
259360	262320	Well, one of them I saw was Star Trek Online.
263040	265520	Oh snap. You know I want the details on this.
267120	271920	So, you know, I played through one of their episodes, like they did any episode type of thing
271920	276960	where you start off in your ship and you kind of fly around and they say you get a distress call.
276960	282560	So, you go and you fight some Klingon birds of prey in the ship combat, and then you beam down
282560	286960	to the planet, which was kind of like the city on the edge of forever, and the Klingons are trying
286960	293440	to take over the forever. And so, you had to defend it and then talk to it, and that was kind
293440	297360	of the end of the mission. But, it kind of showed, you know, the combat and stuff, and it's another
297360	301200	one of those MMOs where, you know, you press one to do this attack and two to do this attack.
301760	306080	But, they really captured the Star Trek feel, especially in the HUD a lot.
306080	311200	So, I'm looking forward to it. There is a closed beta that you can sign up for on their website.
311200	315120	You didn't have to be just attacked to get it. So, I encourage people to go to their website
315120	317360	and sign up for that closed beta if they're interested in it.
317360	317920	I did.
317920	321040	Yes, and we'll be giving more details on that a little later on in the show. I think that's one
321040	325120	of our stories coming up a little later. But, my question about Star Trek Online, was it fun?
327200	331840	It was fun, the little bit that they showed, but they even said that, you know, this was a very
331840	337760	small episode. What they're basically doing, their missions are scheduled to be kind of like 45
337760	341760	minutes to an hour, and they're calling them episodes. They're hiring Star Trek writers.
341760	342480	Oh, nice.
342480	346000	So, they were basically just showing the combat portion, but they said there's going to be
346000	350880	puzzles and other things to do that aren't, you know, just fight, fight, fight. But, here at PAX,
350880	355280	they were just showing the fighting. But, it was fun. It was kind of a nice little taste.
355840	360320	But, they said it's going to be in 45 minutes to one hour chunks, just like an episode instance
360320	363840	for up to five people. So, it could be a lot of fun.
363840	367680	It's interesting. It sounds like they borrowed some ideas from WoW, which I guess are kind of
367680	371920	general MMO things anyway, but the whole like, you know, one, two, three combat and the instances of
371920	376800	five people. Kind of interesting. Anything else on the show floor that caught your attention that
376800	378160	didn't catch at E3?
379520	386160	Well, I actually got to play Heavy Rain this time around, which I missed at E3. And, it was kind of
386160	391200	interesting watching, like, going through the line of people and basically Heavy Rain. It reminds me
391200	395520	a lot of Shenmue. Like, I really didn't understand or get what Heavy Rain was, but it's basically,
395520	400240	you know, quick time action sequences along with tank driving in terms of moving your character.
400960	410880	But, it's basically, there's a gunpoint heist in a grocery store or a quickie mark. And, basically,
410880	416160	you can actually determine how it ends up. And, the guy before me actually convinced the guy to
416160	422640	leave the store. And, I had to punch him in the face. But, it was a very interesting mechanic and
422640	428240	just interesting the way that it went down. And, it's not a game. I, you know, I haven't seen this
428240	432720	kind of gameplay all that much in terms of a whole game. I've seen it in, like, minigames and, like,
432720	438480	God of War and, you know, and Shenmue and things like that. But, it's going to be kind of interesting
438480	442160	to see how this game really turns out longer than a five-minute demo.
442160	447360	All right. Well, we're monitoring our chat room at chat.orangeontrader.com. We're getting some
447360	451600	questions for you, Bobby. Act Def wants to know about Scribblenauts. Did you go to the Scribblenauts
451600	456800	panel? Was it there on the show floor? I did not go to the panel, but they were once again on the
456800	461600	corner of the show floor where they belong, apparently. But, they brought this kiosk and
461600	469520	the lines were long the entire time. But, I actually did talk to them and even talked to some
469520	474880	of the developers. And, for people who've listened to my show for a long time, know that when I went
474880	481840	to GDC in 2007, one of the student competition IGF winners I interviewed with a group that made
481840	486880	a game called Toblo. And, during that interview, I was apparently, I met up with the guy that I
486880	491520	interviewed then. He said I was one of the three people that wanted to talk to them at GDC.
491520	497120	And, they thought it was really cool. And, apparently, I announced their first game,
497120	501440	Drawn to Life, because he had talked about it on our show, gave us a rundown,
502000	505680	well before they had even done any kind of formal announcements or anything like that.
505680	509040	And, he didn't get in trouble. But, it was kind of neat to hear him talk about it and how he
509040	516960	remembered me. And, it was kind of cool to talk to them. And, I did get to play one level, just
516960	520640	getting one of the stars. But, that was about all I could do because it was near the end of the show
520640	524720	and the lines were just so long the entire show. Right. What a turnaround from E3 because we walked
524720	530240	right up to the kiosk at E3. So, apparently, word of mouth is spreading. Yeah. Well, they've been
530240	533680	very happy with all the coverage and surprised. They didn't think they would get the kind of
533680	539360	coverage that they got. And so, they came a little bit more prepared this time, like WB,
539360	544000	their little booth. They were showing Fear II and Scribblenauts. And, that's it. And, they had
544000	549680	six Scribblenauts kiosks and two K kiosks for Fear II or a Fear thing or something. Fear II or what.
549680	555200	Yeah. Why would they show Fear II? It's been out forever now. I don't know. Well, it was a Fear
555200	559040	something. I didn't look at it because Scribblenauts was next to it. Maybe it was a new platform.
559040	563360	There might be a new expansion or something. Yeah. Bobby, what about others? Oh, go ahead.
564560	569440	No. There were some games that were already out, like Metroid Prime, the trilogy was in Nintendo's
569440	573120	booth. And, it's already out in stores. But, they were bribing people with t-shirts if they came up
573120	578640	and played it. So, there was some stuff that's already out. Bobby, let me ask you about other
578640	582560	live events going on at the show, like panels, concerts. I don't know if you got to do any of
582560	586400	those. I know last year when we all went, we didn't do a whole lot of those because we were
586400	590800	broadcasting, but since you didn't have that this year, did you get to experience a lot outside of
590800	596960	the show for any of the events? No, because I was able to get into a lot of the parties,
596960	602080	a lot of the company parties. So, I didn't really get into any of the panels or anything. But,
602080	607120	I mean, I'm very happy because I've been a fan of Paul and Storm and Jonathan Colton for a long
607120	611280	time. And, you know, they're coming to Rock Band this week. That's the PAX Pack. And, I've actually
611280	614640	referenced Paul and Storm several times on the show. Every time I reference myself as an opening
614640	620160	band, that's the song that's going to be in Rock Band 2. So, once again, we're showcasing
620720	624880	artists that people are going to know very soon. Very cool. And, you know, it's interesting. I
624880	629360	heard at the Rock Band panel, they actually were putting together one of Jonathan Colton's songs
629360	633360	in the new indie development, the Rock Band Network, which I guess is a pretty cool thing
633360	637920	to experience. So, well, okay then, if you went to parties, what can you tell us about some of
637920	645120	the parties that were going on? CPP people are freaky. That was probably the most hilarious one,
645120	649120	just because it's not my scene. CPP bought White Wolf, which is World of Darkness,
649120	653360	and they did, usually at Dragon Con, they do the Succubus Club, which is at like this
653360	658800	golf night club or whatever. And, you know, just a lot of weird things happen from that scene.
658800	663840	I think we got an invite to something like that in E3. Let's have pictures of that.
665120	669760	Yeah, there's probably pictures of it. I mean, we saw, like, when I was there, it was just,
669760	674560	the comedy was great, where they had a guy doing, like, this whole routine with a lightsaber,
675920	680000	techno music, and actually the techno music was actually going with, he was timing the
680000	686960	lightsaber moves with the bass and stuff. And, you know, seeing people use iPhones as glow sticks,
686960	693680	because they didn't have the wrong, you know, I mean, the glow stick app's pretty funny.
694800	697600	Yeah, they weren't even doing that. They just had, like, the screen on, the home screen on,
697600	702320	and they were just waving them around. Nice. Very nice. Well, Bobby, before we let you go,
702320	705920	because I know you want to get a flight and all that fun stuff, I want to know, like,
705920	710080	what was the best thing about PAX, and what was the worst thing about PAX?
712000	714720	The best thing about PAX is that it started, and the worst thing is that it ended.
714720	721600	That's a tricky response. All right, how did it compare to E3 this year?
723440	726960	Well, see, you can't really compare it to E3. I mean, basically, I can actually compare
726960	732720	PAX to last year. There were 70,000 people here. All the badges were sold out. You know,
732720	736160	my girlfriend actually bought a badge. She thought she was coming out, and she didn't,
736160	739680	and she wound up being able to sell it for 170 bucks. So I thought it was going to be very
739680	745440	crowded. I say I thought, but the difference between PAX with 70,000 people and, say, E3
745440	753520	2006 with 68,000 people is that PAX is spread out. Not all 70,000 people are trying to be on
753520	759200	the expo hall at the same time, whereas E3, pretty much you could say 60,000 of the 68,000
759200	762880	were all trying to be in the exhibit hall, so you couldn't move around. Other than when they
762880	768160	were throwing T-shirts and giving away raffles, I could still walk around just fine. Now, the big
768160	773920	games I had to wait in line to play, but it was pretty manageable. You didn't think that there
773920	779280	were 70,000 people here this weekend. Interesting. I guess a lot go for the live gaming events,
779280	783280	too, and I bet those rooms take away quite a few people. And I think when they say 70,000,
783280	788320	they also, you know, that's spread out through the three days. PAX sells a lot of individual day
788320	792560	badges, too, and it's never really, I think, accounted for just how many they're selling
792560	797440	of those Friday, Saturday, Sunday badges. Well, they have the numbers because the convention
797440	803360	center actually let them sell 1,000 of the one-day PAX for Saturday and Sunday at the last minute,
803360	808400	and they were very surprised about that. Oh, wow. So, I mean, so people who did come up here
808400	814480	hoping to get a badge were actually able to get badges at the last minute, so that was really
814480	818880	nice. But basically, the thing is, there's only two or three events at this convention center
818880	822720	that take up the entire center. Usually, they double book. They had a Jewish convention
822720	827520	last year. I don't know if you ever remember that. Yeah, I do remember that. Way up on the sixth floor.
827520	831520	PAX actually had the entire building this time, and they're like one of two events in the entire
831520	836160	year that actually need the entire building, and that's also why they're on Labor Day weekend,
836160	840640	because that's the only time they can schedule just one event. Wow. Yeah, I heard SoccerCon,
840640	844240	I think, is the other event, if I remember right, which is a big anime thing they do up there, so.
844240	848960	I still want to go. Busy, busy, busy. Well, Bobby, before we let you go, anything else you want to
848960	852720	us to share about your experiences at PAX, or any plugs you want to give, or what have you?
854560	859280	Not really. I mean, I walked in, and I wanted to bring up one other game that I saw a demo of that
859280	865840	I didn't see at E3, and that's Red Dead Redemption was Rockstar's big game that they were trying to
865840	872400	show off here, and it's basically GTA meets Wild West. I know, it looks awesome. And if you thought
872400	879520	Liberty City was big, or not Liberty, yeah Liberty City, if you thought GTA 4 was big, this one is
879520	885840	huge, open world, it's basically GTA Wild West, and it actually looked really good from the demo
885840	890880	they showed, so that shows that they can make a good demo, so we'll see, eventually. And the
890880	895680	Flipsecond guys were there, people were playing Flipsecond, and they say that's probably going to
895680	899920	be in spring of 2010 or summer, they say it's kind of been pushed back, which means they have
899920	904080	even more time to work on it from what we saw at E3. Awesome, well that was definitely one of the
904080	909120	all-stars at E3, so I'm hoping they got a lot of air time, I guess you could say, out there on the
909120	914880	show floor, so sounds like a lot of fun stuff. Did you, was DJ Hero playable there? Activision
914880	919840	was not here. Ah, they suck. Blizzard was, though, that's interesting. Blizzard was here.
919840	925680	Interesting. But Activision apparently did like an invite-only event Thursday night, and that's
925680	931200	when they showed off some stuff, but I was not invited to that, so I didn't get to go to that,
931200	934480	but no, Activision themselves were not physically here at the show this year.
935120	938880	I did think of one more question I have for you, Bobby, because it just sprung to mind,
938880	942560	because unfortunately none of us were able to go to PAX West this year, or PAX Prime,
942560	946800	I guess as they're calling it. What about PAX East? Was there any kind of clues or hints or
947600	950400	promos going on for PAX East, an idea what to expect?
950400	955680	No, not really, and even like the enforcers don't know if they're working PAX East,
955680	959680	like I was talking to the media guy, because I want to start doing broadcasting again. They
959680	963200	couldn't fit us in, like the space that we were in last year for All Games Radio
964160	969040	was taken up by other tables, so like there was like tabletop gaming going on in that area,
969040	972000	and that's why we couldn't have that area, and they didn't want to run the network all the way
972000	977360	across, but I asked them, I'm like, are you the new guy that's running the media? He said,
977360	980880	I asked them, are you running the media at Boston? So we can go ahead and kind of start
980880	985920	talking about that, and he's like, I don't know. So basically, here's the thing that he did tell
985920	990800	me, is that PAX East has been outsourced to another company, so it's not the same people
990800	996720	running it. So I don't know if that's going to change how it feels or not, because I mean,
997120	1003200	the guys that run PAX are just a little bit too overwhelmed with this show. So they've kind of
1003200	1008000	had to farm it out and outsource it to another company while still having the reins on it, but
1008800	1013360	we don't know if it's going to be the same as this. It's going to be kind of interesting.
1013360	1018400	That is very interesting news. I'm very curious to see how PAX East develops, but I know,
1018400	1021920	excuse me, I know I'm heading out there one way or another. I've always wanted to go to Boston.
1021920	1025280	I have some friends out there. I want to go to the con. We have a lot of OR listeners on the East
1025280	1030560	Coast. I definitely want to go, and hopefully Dark Soccer or Loki can swing it, but if they can't,
1030560	1034160	then that's fine. We'll have Orange Lawns Radio one way or another coming from PAX East.
1035920	1041520	Yep, and I'll be up there too. So this Friday, we're actually going to be running a show on my TV
1041520	1045120	show Friday Night Gaming. We're actually going to be running one of the games that's here that comes
1045120	1050320	out this week. I don't know if you've heard of Darkest of Dates. It is a time-traveling first
1050320	1055680	person shooter, and it's actually by the same guys that make the real deal casino game.
1055680	1056480	Yeah, it looked funny.
1056480	1061600	It's kind of funny. But it was cool. They're coming out on PC and 360,
1061600	1064640	and we're going to be running it on fnglive.net this Friday.
1065280	1070480	All right. So Bobby Blackwell coming to us. That's all right. Bobby Blackwell coming to us live from
1070480	1075520	Penny Arcade Expo. If you want to hear more Bobby, he has two shows he hosts. He's a busy guy,
1075520	1079920	Friday Night Gaming, fnglive.net, as you just heard about, and of course, the Bobby Blackwell
1079920	1083840	show right before us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights. Bobby, thank you so much for
1083840	1085280	taking the time out to talk to us tonight.
1085280	1089120	No problem. Thanks for interrupting your show flow to get me in.
1089120	1092720	No problem. Anytime for you, Bobby. You always have us on your show every week.
1092720	1094080	Have a very safe flight home, okay?
1095040	1095840	All right. Thank you.
1095840	1100800	All right. Take care. Bobby Blackwell live on Orange Lawn's radio, everybody. He always gives
1100800	1105920	us like five minutes on his show every week. We can give him 15 on our show tonight, and a lot
1105920	1110160	of great... I had no idea that Paxis was being run by a different company. That's huge news,
1110160	1114640	in my opinion. Well, I don't know if it's huge news, but it's a huge interesting thing I didn't
1114640	1118640	think about before. That's very interesting. That game Darkest of Days looks funny. It's basically,
1118640	1122240	you can time travel to the past like the Civil War with giant weapons that you could totally
1122240	1123600	hick everyone's ass with. Nice.
1123600	1128320	It is intriguing, so I may have to try that. Very nice. All right. Well, hey, even though that was
1128320	1132640	the start of our show tonight, we always like to start off the show normally with our gaming week,
1132640	1135760	so we're gonna get right back into Orange Lawn's radio. We have plenty to talk about,
1135760	1139920	not just stuff from Pax, other news, and of course, how we always start off our gaming week.
1139920	1141360	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1141360	1148720	I shook my butt. I played Para Para First Mix and played a lot of 2DX Distorted,
1149280	1154480	and what was that weird trippy ass game that you told me, here, play?
1156880	1159760	DJ Max Technica, a new arcade game.
1159760	1164080	It was all right. Not really my thing. It's a little too K-pop.
1167360	1170800	Although it was pretty. I did have a good time playing it. It was just very K-pop.
1170800	1171600	Yeah.
1171600	1173600	It was like, wow, is this Andamiro?
1176960	1183520	Also, Dan played the new Hydro Thunder spiritual successor. What was it called?
1183520	1187280	I don't remember the name, but it was a big machine. That was a cool thing. It was
1187280	1192720	Hydro something or Hydra, Hydro something. It was a cool little game. Big, big machine.
1194560	1197520	Dan was like, give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card
1197520	1201600	I wanna play. Oh yeah, and I played that punching bag game, which was stupid because it was in the
1201600	1210000	corner and I was bored. And then I played lots of Sims 3, and I played some Ragnarok online
1210000	1216720	before I got completely just fed up, fed up. And I have a guilty admission.
1217280	1217680	What's that?
1218400	1224960	I'm downloading. Well, I downloaded. Shut up. I'm not an addict. I haven't touched it in two years.
1224960	1228960	Yeah, my last date of playing was October of 2007.
1228960	1230480	What were you playing?
1230480	1231840	I haven't played it yet. I'm just downloading it.
1231840	1233280	But you're going to play?
1233280	1234080	World of Warcraft.
1235040	1236960	That's okay. I reactivated my account this week too.
1236960	1238320	Ha, you're the addict.
1238320	1241760	Hey, shut up. Shut it. Shut it. You're just as bad.
1241760	1246560	But not really. I did check, and the last time I played was in October 2007.
1246560	1250080	Geez. You should've let me cast a Scroll of Resurrection on you. I would've got a free month.
1250960	1251840	Someone else did.
1251840	1256960	Ah, cursed them. Alright. Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1257920	1262880	My gaming week was alright. I'm having a love-hate relationship right now with Rockstar,
1262880	1269680	unfortunately. I love the new trailer for The Ballad of the Gay Tony. It's really making me
1269680	1273200	excited of the next expansion they're going to have, because it's now more kind of over-the-top
1273200	1280400	stuff. I did play more Grand Theft Auto this week. However, they did patch Grand Theft Auto
1280400	1285360	so that we can't run our modded games anymore, which is very... We were completely depressed
1285360	1291040	for the remainder of the week. It's absolute crap. However, I am not letting that stop me,
1291040	1293120	and I will get by this one way or another.
1293120	1294800	They'll find a way around it eventually.
1294800	1300720	I'm already kind of working on a way. So yeah, it's kind of annoying, but I understand they did
1300720	1304320	it for the greater good, because there's assholes out there that like to ruin everybody's games by
1304320	1308000	doing all these different cheat things and stuff, and not exactly in the closed environments that
1308000	1312000	we're playing in. But hey, whatever. Still, though, it sucks that some people have to
1312000	1317520	ruin it for everybody else. The other game I played, not that I got an early media copy,
1317520	1324480	but I did get an early copy of The Beatles' Rock Band. And honestly, I think one of the things you
1324480	1329280	got to consider when you're planning on buying The Beatles' Rock Band is you better damn well
1329280	1332880	be a Beatles fan, because if you're not, then you're not going to enjoy it too much.
1332880	1339200	I'm okay with The Beatles. I don't hate their music. I like some of their songs, but it kind
1339200	1344480	of lost, after playing it for a little bit, it kind of lost its appeal. It's just like,
1344480	1348880	oh yeah, that's really cool, amazing, all these dreamscapes and stuff, and now I've seen them,
1348880	1354480	and it's just Rock Band. I don't know.
1355840	1359280	So you're saying the presentation is somebody who is not as into The Beatles. Kind of the
1359280	1363760	presentation and the new packaging of Rock Band kind of wore off on you really quick?
1363760	1370000	Yes. It's not a bad game by any means. It's just, for me, I can't see myself playing this for a
1370000	1376560	long time. If I could have imported my songs or imported these songs into Rock Band 2 or something,
1376560	1381040	maybe I would have gotten more life out of it. But I don't know, it looks fun. I think it might
1381040	1385040	be fun to bring out parties or something, but I couldn't see myself actually playing this for an
1385040	1392880	extended period of time. But it's neat, given that, but I don't know. I think going forward,
1392880	1397600	if there's any single band games or single artist games that they're going to be coming out with,
1397600	1402800	I'll have to really evaluate whether I like that artist a lot or not. You know, if they did like
1402800	1407360	a Michael Jackson game or something like that, I might be tempted. But The Beatles, it's pretty
1407360	1411360	good. If you like The Beatles, you'll definitely like this game, and other than that, I mean,
1411360	1415920	it's just basically Rock Band with three-part harmonies. Although I don't have three microphones,
1415920	1422080	so, you know. And I don't sing either. A lot of reviews, I guess the embargo or whatever was
1422080	1424800	lifted the other day, because all of a sudden there was just a ton of reviews that all hit
1424800	1432160	the internet at once. And I'm seeing a lot of positive about the presentation, the way it looks,
1432160	1436640	the way that it really feels like The Beatles. It's kind of interesting. You're one of the first
1436640	1441120	negative things I've heard. Not so much negative, but just the fact that, as someone who's not as
1441120	1447120	into The Beatles, it wore off on me. Interesting. I mean, let me put it this way, I'd be less
1447120	1453200	satisfied with a Guitar Hero release that is basically just reskinned. They didn't put any
1453200	1457360	effort into the presentation. I still love the intro to the game, and it's awesome. I haven't
1457360	1462240	really played much of the story. It's mainly been just the quick play stuff. But, I don't know,
1462240	1468800	it's neat. For me, I don't listen to Beatles music that much. I recognize their songs, but I don't
1468800	1475200	really go seek out Beatles music. Let me ask you one more question. If you were, let's say, imagine
1475200	1481040	that you were a hardcore Beatles fan, how do you think this game would compare to other artists'
1481040	1486160	solitary games, such as Guitar Hero, Aerosmith, or the ACDC expansion for Rock Band? Oh, yeah,
1486160	1490560	this would be awesome. I mean, they totally nailed The Beatles and just the whole feel of the game
1490560	1497200	and everything. I like that. I really dig that. But, it's just, I'm not a huge fan of The Beatles.
1497200	1502320	But, yeah, if they put that amount of effort into other artists' games, then I would still be
1502320	1508080	likely to check them out. Even though I'm not a big fan of The Beatles, I still bought a copy of
1508080	1515680	it because it looked really cool. I don't think I wasted my money on it. I'm not going to enjoy it
1515680	1520240	as much as Rock Band, where if I don't like a track in it or whatever, it doesn't really matter
1520240	1523920	because I can just always get different artists and stuff later on. Whereas, The Beatles stuff,
1523920	1527760	if I don't like the tracks in it, I can't really buy more tracks because they're just more Beatles
1527760	1532640	music. Going to our chat room, chat.orangelawnsradio.com, certainly a lot of comments going
1532640	1537520	on about The Beatles' Rock Band. J-Rod in chat says, so because Rock Band Beatles has an opening
1537520	1542000	cut scene, it's not a reskinned version and, quote, better than the Guitar Hero artist games.
1542000	1547040	Oh, God, my brain is raging so hard. Well, let's not forget, this is not the first Rock Band
1547040	1552480	artist-dedicated game. There was an ACDC game that a lot of people forget came out last year that was,
1552480	1556400	I mean, it was probably even worse than the Guitar Hero games, right?
1556400	1558560	Well, yeah, that was something that they did for Walmart.
1558560	1563520	That was a cash-in, just straight-up cash-in. So, you know, it's not like they've always done
1563520	1570800	perfect releases, but to, I guess, kind of defend it a little bit, what do you think makes this
1570800	1576880	a step above Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Van Halen, if you do feel it is a step above?
1576880	1582240	I think the step above is they went beyond just putting the artists in the game and just putting,
1582240	1587440	like, you know, their tracks and stuff like that. They actually made it very much feel like, you
1587440	1592640	know, the vibe of the Beatles, just the whole stylized version of the game. Everything is,
1592640	1598320	like, catered to, you know, their kind of acid, trippy backgrounds that they have going on,
1598320	1603200	the different songs, just the different styles of, you know, depending on when, you know,
1603200	1609520	the songs came out, what decade and whatnot. It just really set it apart, I think. Whereas,
1609520	1615520	like, you know, Guitar Hero Rock Band, or not, Guitar Hero, you know, like, Metallica or Van
1615520	1619040	Halen or something like that, I mean, those are pretty much all interchangeable. I mean,
1619040	1622800	they haven't really done anything with the interface other than, you know, replace the logo
1622800	1626560	in it, and they changed, you know, the models so that it's, like, you know. Which is essentially
1626560	1633200	what Lego Rock Band is going to be. Yes. True. I mean, let's be fair. Yeah, true. Lego Rock Band's
1633200	1636240	pretty much going to be the same thing. But the thing with Lego Rock Band, though, is it's also
1636240	1640960	more like the other Telltale games where they have the little, like, cutscenes there with the
1640960	1645600	Lego characters and stuff. All the Lego games kind of feel the same as far as that, and they
1645600	1649600	have a little bit of, like, different elements into there. But yeah, it's really not that much
1649600	1654640	different than, say, you know, Guitar Hero, Van Halen or something like that. I mean, they have
1654640	1658560	gone a little bit further in the presentation, but, you know, not enough to where I'm going to
1658560	1662560	say it's, like, amazing or anything. Yeah, see, I'm not feeling Lego Rock Band. Like, I'm totally,
1662560	1667120	like, even though I'm, like, just... Yeah, I appreciate the Beatles. I'm all about Beatles
1667120	1670320	Rock Band, but I think the music games I'll probably buy this holiday season are the
1670320	1673840	Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5. What about... And a lot of that boils down to the song list,
1673840	1678080	because I think Guitar Hero 5 has a great song list for me, especially compared to World Tour.
1678080	1682640	Like, I really want Guitar Hero 5. Well, we discussed that we were probably going to get
1682640	1687360	Guitar Hero 5 so we could get the Van Halen, even though I don't... I'm a big fan of Van Hagar and
1687360	1693680	not, you know, but I'm still more looking forward to Rock Band Beatles, you know, Beatles Rock Band
1693680	1699360	myself, just because I am a fan. I mean, not as big fan as some people I know, but, you know,
1699360	1703920	I'm a pretty... I love it, and I'm actually looking forward to the overall experience of it,
1703920	1708640	you know. Yeah, and I'm just not... I'm not feeling it with Lego or... I don't know enough about Band
1708640	1712800	Hero. I just... It seems like Band Hero is going to be a little bit... Band Hero should have, like,
1712800	1717680	marching band moves and stuff. Okay, well, Band Hero is basically just the same thing as Lego
1717680	1722240	Rock Band. I mean, it's basically their E10 Plus game. It's got a bunch of different artists. You
1722240	1726000	know who they have pimping it out? Huh. Well, I found out the last artist that they haven't
1726000	1730240	announced yet. What's that? No Doubt. Well, that's kind of cool, though. I like No Doubt. Yeah,
1730240	1733920	they have No Doubt's going to be pimping that game out, too. Band Hero? That might... Yeah,
1733920	1739040	and Band Hero. Okay, I don't... Band Hero might be kind of cool, actually. I don't know. It's
1739040	1743120	really at this point, especially when you're doing, you know, when the... Well, you know,
1743120	1746880	you can't really say that for Guitar Hero 5, because Guitar Hero 5 is not a reskinning. They
1746880	1751040	have gone back and reinvented the game. Now you can play all the instruments. You can't say that.
1751040	1753840	So, you know, that's another reason why... But Band Hero is a reskinning of Guitar Hero 5. Well,
1753840	1759600	of Guitar Hero 5. Yeah. So... But I don't know, like, I'm okay with the reskinnings if the song
1759600	1764560	lists are really, really good. And it sounds like Band Hero might have a pretty good song list. I
1764560	1769440	don't know. I don't know. Well, all right. Anyways, enough of the music game, blah, blah, blah. So
1769440	1778720	anything else you're giving me, Louie? Not really, but I'm still waiting for my cabinet to come in.
1778720	1782800	I got more Dance Mania... I have two Dance Maniac sensors now, which I was hoping to actually create
1782800	1790240	a real Dance Mania setup to go with my Dance Mania System 573 board. But the problem is,
1790240	1795840	and I was unaware of this because I actually got the Dance Maniac's manual first sent to me because
1795840	1801840	I, you know, I would like to know how to wire this thing up. Dance Maniac sensors come in top and
1801840	1807280	bottom. The bottom have two sensors, one on top, one on bottom, I think, or two on the bottom,
1807280	1813440	maybe. But the top sensors only have one sensor. And so I got two top sensors, unfortunately,
1813440	1819200	and now I have to do something or create my own sensors or something. Talk to the guy that sold
1819200	1823840	them to me to see if he has any bottom sensors, but he hasn't gotten back to me. He doesn't speak
1823840	1829120	much English either. I'm looking at chat.orangeonstrader.com and Lumi's in chat says,
1829120	1833440	didn't Rob see No Doubt Paramore concert a few weeks ago? We actually just call that the No Doubt
1833440	1836960	concert because I didn't care about the other bands on the ticket. But, well, actually the
1836960	1843360	sounds were pretty freaking awesome as far as that other band, yeah. But No Doubt, like, I'm not
1843360	1849440	going to lie. I love No Doubt. Okay. I graduated high school in 1996. That was like the year of
1849440	1852960	No Doubt. You know what? That's like the anthem of high school and everything for me. So you know
1852960	1859200	what? Like if there was a Guitar Hero No Doubt game, even if it was just like a re-skinning or
1859200	1863920	whatever, I'd probably buy it because I really like No Doubt. I bought that whole album and rock
1863920	1869440	band and everything. And yeah, I don't know. Call me a sucker, whatever. But I think a lot of people,
1869440	1874000	if their favorite band came out in whatever game, would feel the same way. So anyway, I don't want
1874000	1879760	to get into too much more talking about music games. Well, you heard that Lego Rock Band,
1879760	1884640	the rumor is that you're going to import those tracks into Rock Band 2. That's kind of cool.
1885200	1889280	I hope that's the case because I'm going to rent it. Just rent it. Import those tracks.
1890000	1897520	Shame on you. Hey, do what I can. All right. Hey, Saig is in chat and wants to correct Loki. Tell
1897520	1901200	Tale Games does not make any of the Lego games. I think you botched the company name when you were
1901200	1906080	talking about that. I'm sorry. I'm thinking of Traveler or something. Traveler's Tales. I'm
1906080	1913360	sorry. Traveler's Tales. It's TT. I mean, close, but very different. Sorry. Traveler's Tales.
1913360	1920240	Whatever. I mean, same initials. That's what I remember. That's right. Anyhow, at least we got
1920240	1925600	that clarified. Moving on, My Gaming Week. Good lord, I played a lot of games this week, actually.
1925600	1930000	I want to talk about DJ Max Technica real quick because I know Dark Sakura is kind of about it,
1930000	1935360	but I really enjoyed it. It was like Elite Beat Agents, basically. Imagine if Elite Beat Agents
1935360	1939840	were an arcade game where you tap the screen with your finger to hit the buttons. Basically,
1939840	1943360	what happens, you see a bar going across the top and then it goes back down to the bottom. It's
1943360	1948080	kind of like running a track around the screen. Then as it passes these dots, you have to tap the
1948080	1952400	dots to play the music. Or you can drag your finger for some of them and some dots you have
1952400	1957120	to hit over and over again to hit with a beat of the music. I really like the way it was set up.
1958720	1962480	I had a really good time playing the game. The only problem I had with the game, the music was
1962480	1967440	completely uninspiring and not memorable to me. I know that's going to piss a lot of people off
1967440	1971120	that I said that. Some of the music game fans, especially if you like the Korean pop, but I'm
1971120	1976160	sorry. It just was not... I wasn't able to distinguish one song from another that I was
1976160	1983440	playing. I can't put my finger on it. 2DX just has such a variety and such cool songs in it.
1984080	1987840	A lot of it is so memorable, at least in the past. I would almost say the same is true about
1987840	1994240	BeatMania 2DX now, ever since 13th Style about there. Too bad they don't have a Ubi machine
1994240	2000240	there. But the game itself, I thought was a lot of fun. I would play it again. Maybe the musical
2000240	2006800	grow on me. I don't know. But the game itself I had a lot of fun with. And I'm seeing frowns
2006800	2011840	in chat. I'm sorry guys. I guess maybe it's a personal preference thing. But the game itself,
2011840	2018000	pretty cool. Also, some of the stuff I played this week. I played Zen Pinball. It's a pinball
2018000	2024320	game that's available on PlayStation 3. Did you check this out yet? Not yet, but I saw one of the
2024320	2028480	games in action. You know what? They have a Street Fighter 2 table that I actually downloaded as
2028480	2034160	well. Yeah, it's cool. It's a fun little pinball simulator. The only tricky thing about pinball
2034160	2038240	is that pinball is not really meant for a wide screen TV because the unfortunate thing about
2038240	2042640	pinball is that you know how a pinball field looks. It's like a wide screen the other way.
2042640	2046800	And it's not like you're going to turn your television on its side. So unfortunately,
2046800	2051360	that makes the display a little difficult in a pinball game. But they do the best job they can.
2051360	2055200	You have different view modes you can use in this game to look at the table from different angles.
2055200	2060320	It really reminds me of a lot of the pinball games I played on the PC in the 90s. But obviously,
2060320	2064080	you know, with the high def graphics and all that. I hear there's multiplayer too,
2064080	2068560	but I haven't tested that mode out online. So I can't really review that component of it yet.
2069200	2074560	On the PSP this week, I played Rock Band Unplugged, which basically is frequency or
2074560	2078720	amplitude, but it's the rock band music. It's pretty much what you would expect,
2078720	2081520	but I had fun with it. But you know what else I had fun with on the PSP?
2081520	2089360	The things I'm learning about Sony is, and there's so much functionality in the PSP
2089920	2094560	that I don't think Sony does a really good job at advertising because I was really surprised.
2094560	2098240	You know, as I was looking at this, you know, I was like, oh yeah, I think we've talked about
2098240	2102960	this on this show, but damn, I don't really hear about this a lot. And it's actually a really cool
2102960	2108000	feature of the PSP. And that is that if you have a PSP, like let's say I was here at Jamie's right
2108000	2114080	now, I could, if I connected to her internet, I could power on my PlayStation 3 from home,
2114800	2119280	go into my crossbar, see my crossbar on the PSP as I would see it on the PS3,
2119280	2125760	go to like a movie that I have downloaded on the PS3 or even a data disc full of movies that's
2125760	2130160	in my PS3 right now. And I can play them, stream them over the internet to my PSP.
2131120	2134720	That's awesome. Yet, and you know, and it's kind of one of those things where it's like,
2134720	2138480	oh yeah, I think I remember hearing about this, but damn, they should be shoving this down my
2138480	2142720	throat. That's really cool functionality. That's way better than anything the DS and the Wii could
2142720	2148480	ever do. That makes the, that makes the PS3 PSP combo, in my opinion, that much more awesome is
2148480	2153120	not just the movies thing or the data, this thing, sorry, you can't do Blu-rays or DVDs,
2153120	2158400	but, um, you can do some of the games too, like especially the PS1 classics and some of the, um,
2158400	2162880	I don't want to say arcade games, but the PSN downloadable games, you can also play on the PSP
2162880	2169360	from anywhere by turning on your PS3 from somewhere else. That's like kind of neat. So
2169360	2176800	that's a remote play, of course, is the feature there that they call that. Anyhow, um, let's see,
2176800	2180160	what else did I play this week? I want to say there were more games, but I, I can't think of
2180160	2183920	anything right now, honestly. So I guess I will just leave it at that so we can continue on with
2183920	2188080	the show because I know we want to get into some gaming news, but first we have some housekeeping
2188080	2194000	news. Um, not a whole lot of new stuff. I do want to let you guys know I am going to be out in two
2194000	2198240	weeks. I'll be here next week, but I'll be out in two weeks. So I don't know if there will be a show
2198240	2202960	or not, but we'll keep you posted, but I'm going to be in LA so I won't be here. So I'm going on
2202960	2207200	a personal trip. So we'll see what happens in two weeks, but we will be back next week. As far as
2207200	2213040	other housekeeping goes, uh, you can always follow us on Twitter, www.twitter.com slash O L R. We'll
2213040	2216720	be getting into Twitter topics a little later in the show. And of course you can always send us
2216720	2220640	emails, mail back at orange launch ready.com. Don't forget to join us on Facebook at the O L
2220640	2226160	army or on life journal username orange lounge. All right. How about some gaming news? Loki
2226160	2231200	start us off tonight with some gaming news. Yes. Lots of gaming news this week. Um, let's see,
2231200	2236480	let's start off with, um, the rumor and this wasn't exactly a complete rumor, but we knew
2236480	2241920	it was coming just, I didn't know if it was gonna be coming this soon, but, uh, there are DSI only
2241920	2248880	games coming this fall apparently. Um, now of course no, you know, official announcements have
2248880	2254480	been made yet about, you know, actual DSI only games coming in, but apparently a retail source
2254480	2260800	that spoke with Kotaku said the new, um, DSI exclusive games will be out this fall and they're
2260800	2265280	actually going to have a little bit of, um, differences to them, distinguishing them from
2265280	2270480	the other DS games. The cases are going to be white and also they're going to have like a,
2270480	2276400	you know, only plays on DSI, um, little sticker on them as well to let people know that you can't
2276400	2283040	buy this for the DS. Now you may be wondering, well, what games are going to be DSI exclusive?
2283840	2289360	Um, one of them that they have found is a game called Monster Finder. And apparently, um, this
2289360	2294640	is sort of like, I think it was called, um, sort of similar to Invisimals, which is going to be on
2294640	2303040	the PSP. I think it basically uses the DSI camera to find monsters, kind of like, uh, I guess, a,
2303040	2310080	um, I don't know, alternative route or I guess an alternative reality game or something like that.
2310080	2314640	Augmented reality game, that's the word I'm thinking about. Um, basically you find monsters
2314640	2318560	and then you collect them and put them against each other, like kind of like Monster Rancher,
2318560	2322480	but with a camera. It's just sort of like the barcode scanner games back, back when. Yes,
2322480	2328480	yes, very similar to that too. And, um, so this will be the, this is one of the first DSI only
2328480	2334400	games. If I remember correctly, I think from looking at Ubisoft, I think there are two more
2334400	2339360	coming from them, their Style Lab series. I can't remember if those are DSI exclusive.
2339360	2344000	I know they do use the DSI, but I don't remember if they were exclusive or not because they said
2344000	2350320	they were, but then the sell sheet said not, but I don't know. Um, but there might be more coming.
2350320	2354640	So interesting that Nintendo is kind of letting the third parties do this first. You know what
2354640	2358880	I mean? Like, you know, I'm kind of torn on this. This is one of those things where I'm a little
2358880	2364320	bit disappointed because I really didn't see the point in getting a DSI because the DS honestly
2364320	2368640	has everything I want. I don't really need the camera or any of that stuff. I don't, yeah,
2368640	2372560	I don't think you need this game either. I mean, it's just a lot of these games are going to be
2372560	2377040	DSI only. They're obviously going to be using the gimmicks of it, the camera. That's basically it.
2377040	2381280	Here's the thing. How long, Loki? And you know this is going to happen. How long, in fact,
2381280	2386560	let's take bets here on the show. How long until Nintendo puts out the Zelda game that's going to
2386560	2391360	need barcodes or the Mario game that's going to require the camera for something? I mean,
2391360	2394960	or the, you know, the WarioWare, one of their first party titles, you know,
2394960	2399840	WarioWare is a given or something that's going to require these peripherals. And then suddenly
2399840	2404240	it's going to be at just this landslide where now all the games go DSI only. I mean,
2404240	2408080	That's almost, I think, how they plan it.
2408080	2411440	They would like that if they, if they're making money off the systems and yeah,
2411440	2415200	of course they're going to like that. Doesn't this happen all the time too? I mean,
2415200	2419200	you can go all the way back to the original Game Boy. Remember how Game Boy Color games
2419200	2423760	would still play in the Game Boy, but then after a certain amount of time, finally it was, oh,
2423760	2428240	they're a color exclusive. You can only play these on a Game Boy Color. The problem is though,
2428240	2430880	is if they go that route, that's going to piss off a lot of people and they're,
2430880	2436000	well, I know they may not care, but here's the thing though, their audience, the people that
2436000	2440240	buy Nintendo products are a lot different than your normal consumer that buys, you know, any
2440240	2448000	other console franchise. Like for example, you know, with the Wii and the DS, the DS owners,
2448000	2452560	I think that they're pretty content with what they've got on DS or the Wii. And they're not
2452560	2457040	going to exactly like if the Wii HD comes out, your normal mom and pop is not going to upgrade
2457040	2460960	to a Wii HD because they could care less because they have Wii Sports and they don't really care
2460960	2466560	about upgrading to another system. Same with the DSi. Until Wii Sports 3 is Wii HD only.
2466560	2472800	It doesn't matter. I mean, I think right now, you know, with the DS, I mean, there's so many
2472800	2478880	people that have the DS if they, unless, I mean, the DSi is not that much different than the DS.
2478880	2483440	I mean, they were supposed to be put together so they can, you know, compete on the same market
2483440	2489200	or whatever, but I don't see why, how they're going to convince people that they need to buy
2489200	2495920	a DSi because, oh, this game uses a camera now. Good for them. Question from your distribution
2495920	2502160	perspective, are the regular DS's being phased out? No. Interesting. Not necessarily being phased
2502160	2506560	out, but there's not really new colors coming out for them. There's new colors for the DSi.
2506560	2510160	But I mean, if you think about it, I guess, you know, there's four different colors for the DS
2510160	2514800	right now, and now there's going to be four different colors for the DSi, so... They haven't,
2514800	2518880	like, stopped production. No, they haven't stopped production. Okay. I mean, sales have certainly
2518880	2522880	slowed down a bit, but, you know, not necessarily stopped production.
2525520	2530160	Takeo Ray in chat says, that's why I never got the DSi. My DS Lite is perfectly fine for me.
2530160	2534320	That's pretty much the same camp I'm in. I rarely play the DS as it is. If you've listened to this
2534320	2539520	show before, you know kind of my little rant on handhelds, although I will say the PSP is quickly
2539520	2544320	gaining a lot of favor, in my opinion, not necessarily as a gaming device, but as a
2544320	2550080	multi-functional media device, is quickly gaining popularity with me. Well, here's the thing. I mean,
2550080	2554480	I'm sorry, but if they come out with a new, like, Zelda game or something that requires a camera,
2555040	2559680	I don't care. I won't buy it, because, you know what? I'm not going to buy another system for
2559680	2564800	one fucking game. I'm sorry. You know, when your library plays on my system, except for this one
2564800	2570880	game, boo-fucking-hoo, I'm not buying it. You know, I will make do. I mean, people, that's the problem.
2570880	2575680	You're expecting these hardcore players, you know, to go, okay, let me buy a new system for this game,
2575680	2582880	but the audience that buys the DS, they aren't really hardcore gamers. It's just the wrong
2582880	2588880	expectation for their market. Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm betting this time next year,
2588880	2594400	we're looking in the face of a Mario or Zelda game on the DS that's only on the DSi. Mario
2594400	2599200	goes to Barcode Island or something like that. For the record, I'm probably going to have a DSi.
2600480	2604800	Why? I mean, I'm not asking that in an accusatory way. I'm asking it as a
2604800	2609520	why do you want that when you already have a DS? Why not? Because you already have a DS.
2610800	2614160	I want to play the new stuff that comes out. I knew it was going to happen. Well,
2614160	2618080	what if it sucks? Well, here's another thing. What if I don't care? Jamie's a little different,
2618080	2621520	because she's a system collection whore. That's true. She's not your typical gamer.
2621520	2628480	Honestly, anything new that comes out, I pretty much want it, and we pretty much end up getting
2628480	2632080	it. She owns some fucking Dreamcast game that came with a dish, for heaven's sake. I mean,
2632080	2637200	she's just a video game collector. So, yeah, you're not exactly going to want my opinion on
2637200	2640640	that, because mine's going to be, well, why shouldn't it be in my collection? All right,
2640640	2644240	fine. Well, let's move on to another story that maybe we will get your opinion on then,
2644240	2649280	and that's about the iPhone. You know what's interesting is that there's always been that
2649280	2654320	rumor that's been going around probably as long as we've been podcasting that Apple's going to
2654320	2658400	get into gaming. Apple's going to get into gaming. They're going to do something. They're going to
2658400	2664320	get into gaming. It's just a matter of time. Apple kind of just got into gaming when everybody was
2664320	2671760	kind of looking everywhere else. Like, Apple is into gaming now, and they have a lot of users
2671760	2676240	using their games. Of course, I'm talking about the iPhone. Don't believe me? Well,
2676240	2681920	guess what they announced this week? Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Yes, the game that was the
2681920	2687520	DS exclusive last, they were so excited about E3. Remember, they came out and, oh, GTA Chinatown
2687520	2692880	Wars is coming out. Guess what? It's coming out on the iPhone. And this is right after they
2692880	2696720	announced that a PSP version was coming out as well. Of course, that is on its way as well.
2696720	2700800	But it's also coming to the iPhone, and of course, that would mean the iPod Touch as well.
2700800	2706080	There's not a whole lot of other details at this time, but only just that they're calling it a
2706080	2711600	perfect match for the iPhone and iPod Touch. I'm kind of iffy on this because I don't think,
2712240	2716240	some games just don't run well on the iPhone and iPod Touch. I don't think it's a very
2717040	2722400	powerful gaming system, but some of the games they have on there aren't bad at all.
2722400	2728320	PEGL or any PopCap game. You know, certain games that are optimized for the iPhone and iPod Touch
2728320	2732640	run pretty darn good. I mean, the only thing I see the iPhone and the iPod Touch,
2732640	2740160	basically the app store that they have, it's just the most successful mobile gaming platform is
2740160	2746000	basically it. Because, you know, if you try to, I mean, other phones and stuff like that don't
2746000	2751040	really work well with gaming. Whereas this, you know, they built this phone around the apps that
2751040	2758560	you can make and these programs, which is good. But, you know, as far as it being like a gaming
2758560	2764000	platform, yeah, sure, I guess it could be. You know, as far as, you know, they can put lots of
2764000	2767920	games on it, but you're not going to see the same functionality as some of these games that are on
2767920	2773280	the DS and, you know, the PSP. But that's mainly because they don't have any sort of like control
2773280	2777200	pad or anything. They mainly are stuck to the touch screen, so it doesn't work out that well.
2777200	2781360	I just, I don't know why, just someday I could see them putting out a little thing that snaps
2781360	2785920	in the bottom of the iPhone that's a little gaming thing with buttons on it and maybe that adds a
2785920	2790080	little extra oomph to the, I don't know what they could do, like an independent card of some sort.
2790080	2794640	Maybe, you know, I don't know enough about how hardware works, but I would just see that they
2794640	2798960	could do something like that that would just add a lot of oomph to the iPhone and iPod touch and
2798960	2803200	make it, you know, that much more. But don't you think it still is competition for the DS?
2803200	2809040	Oh yeah, definitely. To an extent the PSP? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's always competition for
2809040	2814320	them because, you know, their, you know, App Store right now is definitely working a lot better than,
2814320	2820160	you know, what they have for DSiWare or, you know, the PlayStation Network stuff and obviously,
2820160	2825440	you know, the PlayStation Go is going to try to kind of copy the App Store and I don't think it's
2825440	2829680	going to even get close to what, you know, they're doing on the App Store. Well, I think it'll be
2829680	2835040	great for PSP 3000 owners. It's not really, okay, well here's the, yeah, exactly. It's not even
2835040	2839760	really necessary, they already have the infrastructure in PlayStation, they don't have
2839760	2844560	the content on there and that's the problem. It's like same with the DSiWare stuff. They don't have,
2844560	2849520	like, independent developers can't just throw stuff on there and, you know, have it, you know,
2849520	2853600	be available. Whereas the App Store, you know, there's just lots of content quickly, you know,
2853600	2858720	some of it may not be good, some of it is really good, but there's a lot of content on there and
2858720	2862400	the process to get it up was pretty quick. Yeah, but to be fair, the iPhone also has a lot of crap.
2862400	2867760	Like, one story that I don't think we are covering tonight, I think, but it was in the thread, we
2867760	2872160	just ran out of room tonight. Yeah, there was a game on the iPhone that just came out this week
2872160	2877120	that is, like, a PP simulation game. I think that's what it's called. IPP was the name of the
2877120	2882800	game and you literally are, like, aiming at a urinal. Come on. It's funny, see, that's awesome.
2882800	2887040	It's stupid. It's just dumb. It is stupid, but you know what? Here's my point, there's a lot of
2887040	2891760	crap out there on the iPhone and iPod Touch. But one person's trash is another person's treasure,
2891760	2896000	so you know what? Well, then couldn't the same be said about whatever Sony's planning with their
2896000	2901440	mini bar and the DSI to an extent? Well, I don't have a problem with Sony's minis. I do have a
2901440	2907120	problem with the DSIware because it's a lot of calculators and clocks, which, you know, I don't
2907120	2913360	know, it just doesn't really add anything to the DSI. That's the problem. All right. Well, let's
2913360	2917600	move on with some more gaming news. We'll get to release dates here in just a little bit, but first
2917600	2926080	over to Dark Sakura. Oh, you sound so enthusiastic. But first, over to the one and only fabulous Dark
2926080	2934080	Sakura. Well, you know Splatterhouse was being developed by Bottle Rocket Entertainment? Well,
2934080	2941040	they don't exist anymore. They clung to life as long as they could, but the plug was pulled,
2941040	2953200	so guess what? They got splattered. Their house got splattered. And so that means that... Actually,
2953200	2955440	I really don't know what that means for Splatterhouse, except that it's not going
2955440	2960320	to be coming out anytime soon unless someone else picks that up. Just let it die. I mean,
2960320	2966000	it was a neat idea, but just let it die. Might as well come out at this point. They say that they're
2966000	2970480	actually working on another company that they're going to start from the ground up. I just think
2970480	2974560	it's sad, though, that although it seems like there's a silver lining here that forever door
2974560	2978800	closes and other opens, blah, blah, blah, it's just kind of sad. I seriously feel like this is,
2978800	2983680	again, we had a lot of this at the end of the year last year, but this is the fourth
2984240	2988320	story I think we've had in the scope of two months about some studio closing down. Well,
2988320	2992160	it's because they're way behind in schedule. That game was supposed to be out at the end of last
2992160	2998000	year, and then they pushed it back to near June, and then it still wasn't done. So yeah, time to
2998000	3002480	close. WhatupG in our chatroom at chat.orangelandstrategy.com asked me a question. Didn't
3002480	3006400	Namco take Splatterhouse internally? I seem to remember hearing that at one point, too.
3006400	3011280	Yeah. Well, actually, yeah, there's nothing about what exactly is going to happen with it,
3011280	3014960	but Namco pulled the development of Splatterhouse back in. That's right,
3014960	3020480	but there hasn't been anything else said about it. Interesting. All right. Well,
3020480	3026480	hopefully those guys, as much as we're making silly jokes about Splatterhouse, it does suck
3026480	3030640	when people lose their jobs, so I hope this whole starting a studio from the ground up works out
3030640	3036480	for them. But, you know, just try to get stuff out there as soon as you can. Get the public
3036480	3040720	experience. It's a really tricky balance, isn't it? You want to spend enough time on the products,
3040720	3045200	you have a quality product, but at the same time, if you spend too much time on it,
3045920	3049200	you go the way of Duke Nukem Forever and the guys behind that.
3050880	3054080	I am confident that the game will be super epic when it comes out.
3054080	3056080	Whatever you say. We'll see.
3056080	3057760	I'm completely lying.
3057760	3060080	That's... don't get your expectations too high.
3060080	3063120	My expectations are incredibly low, okay?
3063120	3063600	Your problem.
3065120	3067040	Oh, low, then fine, okay, never mind then.
3067040	3071520	Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on, Duke Nukem, that was like in the 90s. I don't remember the 90s.
3072160	3075920	That was a long time ago. Anyways, so...
3075920	3077680	Yes, it's when no doubt was popular.
3078320	3082320	Exactly. Speaking of something from a long time ago,
3082320	3087040	God of War and God of War 2. Actually, I guess that wasn't that long ago, but
3087040	3089040	hey, it was a few years. That's ancient.
3091120	3095520	They are now coming out on a brand new collection coming to the PS3,
3095520	3099120	the God of War collection as its name, coming this holiday.
3099120	3103920	They're going to be both displayed at 60 frames per second and at 720p,
3104560	3110000	and it's going to cost somewhere around $40 retail, which is kind of cool.
3110000	3112800	They're going to be... I don't know.
3112800	3115840	Remember how we were talking about backwards compatibility,
3115840	3119040	and how that they probably could do it, but they're not?
3119040	3124240	Here's why they're not doing it, because now we can sell every game that we've made over again.
3126880	3128800	I'm okay with it, actually,
3128800	3131920	because how is this different than what Nintendo's doing Metroid Prime trilogy?
3131920	3134800	It isn't different, and you know what? I don't...
3134800	3136800	I think it's kind of cool, because then I can...
3136800	3140240	You know, yeah, and why I'm okay with this, Loki, is because
3140240	3142960	they're going back and they're making the games HD,
3142960	3144720	they're giving them trophies.
3144720	3148240	Sure, they might be old games, but they're giving them new treatment, you know?
3148880	3152960	And this Katamari Damacy game that a lot of people are excited about is very similar,
3152960	3153920	if you think about it.
3153920	3157120	It might not be the two games that were out before, per se,
3157120	3159280	but they took a piece here and a piece there,
3159280	3161680	and then added some new effects and a couple new levels,
3161680	3164400	and that's this new Katamari game we have coming out in a few weeks.
3164400	3166960	You know, this seems to be kind of a trend.
3166960	3168880	Well, I guess it was still a trend before.
3168880	3172560	I mean, go back to the PlayStation 1, you would see Super Nintendo games,
3172560	3174480	the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger re-release.
3174480	3176160	You know, it's not like this is anything new,
3176160	3178880	but what I think makes this kind of special and kind of cool
3178880	3182800	is that the games are being souped up a little bit to match the times.
3182800	3183360	Yeah, and...
3183360	3185920	I missed the God of War boat back on the PlayStation 2.
3185920	3187680	This actually really interests me.
3187680	3190720	Well, God of War 2 actually did output at 720p,
3190720	3195360	because there were a handful of games that were on the PlayStation 2 and on the Xbox
3195360	3200160	that would both either output at 720p or they would do 1080i,
3200160	3201280	which was kind of cool,
3201280	3206080	but God of War 2 was one of the ones that actually did the 720p,
3206080	3207440	so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.
3207440	3208720	That's right, I remember that now.
3208720	3210320	Wasn't there like a secret code or something you had to put in to do that?
3210320	3211200	Yeah, something like that.
3211200	3211840	That's so weird.
3213120	3219040	But hey, definitely a good way to get ramped up for the new game coming out, obviously, in March.
3219040	3221520	Reading some comments from chat.orangelandradio.com,
3221520	3222320	Deakman says,
3222320	3227360	I'm okay with it because it's only $40, 720p, 60 frames a second, and trophies.
3227360	3228000	Sign me up.
3228000	3229200	And true, that is the price.
3229200	3233040	If you're gonna buy them both new right now on the PlayStation 2,
3233040	3234480	that is the price that it would be.
3234480	3235360	It's $40, so...
3236000	3237840	So I think I'm gonna wait a little bit for this.
3237840	3238160	We'll see.
3238160	3240320	Because again, I never played God of War 1 and 2.
3240320	3242160	Well, I played it like at a friend's house for a little bit,
3242160	3243120	but I never played through one.
3243120	3244000	Never played through two.
3245040	3247680	Tigerclaw makes a comment about Metroid Prime.
3247680	3251440	Metroid Prime 3 in Metroid Prime Trilogy was censored a tad.
3251440	3253520	One of the cutscenes had a character say,
3253520	3256000	damn, it was redubbed with a no.
3257840	3260880	That's kind of a weird change, especially if it was different before.
3260880	3263920	You want to hear something funny and this is off the topic of Metroid,
3263920	3268160	but I was reading on some of the stuff that they're going to do for Brutal Legend.
3268160	3274640	They have an option where you can actually take out a lot of the cussing in the game.
3274640	3277680	So there's one scene, it's like, you know, so listen,
3277680	3279360	I told you not to climb up there.
3279360	3280160	What the eff?
3280160	3283920	And then it pauses and says, okay, do you want him to say fuck?
3283920	3286880	Or do you want him to like, you know, not use any, you know...
3286880	3287280	Fudge!
3288160	3288640	Exactly.
3288640	3289280	What the fudge?
3289280	3291600	And then it just, you know, sensors the rest of the game like that.
3291600	3294480	And I think that's kind of funny, the way that they give that option to you.
3294480	3295760	That's an interesting way to do it.
3298000	3300080	Jayrod in chat gives his quick reviews.
3300080	3301920	Like, these are like Twitter reviews of these games.
3301920	3304160	It's very short, but maybe help you out, Loki.
3304160	3307840	God of War 1, I think, has a better story, but God of War 2 was overall better.
3309440	3313200	Yeah, I really wish I had played God of War 2, but the thing with God of War 1 is I got
3313200	3316640	so frustrated at the end of the game because the last boss was really hard.
3316640	3320720	Oh, and the last boss glitched out, so it didn't quite work right.
3320720	3323280	So I beat the crap out of him just over and over and over again,
3323280	3325040	even though I know what I was supposed to do in the game.
3325680	3328000	But it still wouldn't work because the game glitched out.
3328000	3329680	So I just got pissed off with it.
3330960	3331520	All right.
3331520	3333600	Well, let's go back over to the Nintendo Wii for a minute.
3333600	3335600	Of course, we were talking about Metroid Prime trilogy.
3335600	3336800	One other thing you might be...
3336800	3340000	Which actually, by the way, the Metroid Prime games are pretty awesome.
3340000	3341360	So, you know, I'm even thinking...
3341360	3344160	I have Metroid Prime 3, but I'm thinking about getting the trilogy
3344160	3346000	because I never had Metroid Prime 1 or 2.
3346000	3346880	I know it's kind of weird.
3346880	3347760	My roommate had them.
3347760	3349920	So around that time, the roommate had...
3349920	3354560	You know how you can't get, obviously, the Metroid or Metroid game downloaded
3354560	3357440	to your Game Boy Advance with the Metroid Prime trilogy,
3357440	3363120	but you can get the costume that was in that game as well
3363120	3368240	to kind of download to the Fusion costume or whatever in the game.
3368240	3369600	That unlocks.
3369600	3370160	Interesting.
3370160	3370480	Yeah.
3370480	3373760	I'm curious what other kind of synergy between the three games there is, if any.
3373760	3374480	I don't know.
3374480	3375040	I don't know.
3375040	3378160	Well, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, you know how they had a web browser.
3378160	3382160	They had their Nintendo internet channel that you could download for a $5 fee.
3382160	3382640	Guess what?
3382640	3386400	Earlier this week in Japan and Europe, that fee went away.
3386400	3389920	And then just a couple days later, it also went away in North America.
3389920	3392240	The internet channel is now free to download.
3392240	3394800	So if you have a Wii but you never got the internet channel,
3394800	3395920	you can go ahead and download it.
3395920	3396560	It's free.
3396560	3399440	It used to cost 500 Wii points to download.
3399440	3401120	Actually, I should take a step back.
3401120	3402960	When it first came out, you might remember,
3402960	3406640	if you were an early Wii owner like myself and I think the others in the studio here,
3406640	3409280	we were able to get the internet channel really early on
3409280	3411680	because they had it free for about three months or so.
3411680	3415440	And then it went to being 500 Wii points when they released the full version.
3415440	3418160	Well, now they've decided to remove the cost again.
3418160	3420720	And they also did some little upgrades to the browser.
3420720	3425200	It's now, instead of Flash 7, it's Flash Lite 3.1,
3425200	3427440	which I know doesn't sound like an upgrade, but it is.
3427440	3429840	It's going to let more Flash apps actually be able to play.
3429840	3433520	And if you were one of the people that paid 500 Wii points for this,
3433520	3436560	sadly, Nintendo isn't going to give you the 500 points back.
3436560	3439600	But what they are going to do is they're going to give you a 500 point credit
3439600	3441520	towards a virtual console game.
3441520	3443680	So at least you get a little something.
3443680	3445440	Although, I don't know.
3445440	3448080	If I was one of the people that paid 500 points for it, I might be a little sad.
3448080	3450800	But then again, it's only five bucks.
3450800	3451680	I don't know.
3451680	3453040	Five bucks is still a lot, I guess.
3454720	3456160	So I don't know.
3456160	3459440	But then again, I'm also kind of like, you know, as much as I think that's cool,
3459440	3460640	they're making it free again.
3461520	3466400	Unless this new remastered internet channel somehow made it a lot faster
3466400	3468160	to browse the internet on the Wii,
3468160	3469520	I don't think it's going to be that great.
3470560	3473040	Like browsing the internet on the Wii is kind of slow.
3473040	3473840	Yeah.
3473840	3476240	You know, I don't know.
3476240	3478880	And what did you do when you were only dial-up?
3478880	3480400	Hmm.
3480400	3484640	I lived in an age where I only expected things to come in at a dial-up rate.
3484640	3488560	The games I was downloading were much smaller and would fit on a three and a half inch disc.
3488560	3489120	Remember that?
3489120	3490560	I had a download-
3490560	3492880	I remember having Descent spread across 14 of them.
3492880	3493360	Yeah.
3493360	3497520	Remember when an epic game, you knew it was epic like King's Quest 6
3497520	3499760	because it had seven discs that it came on?
3499760	3500000	Yeah.
3500960	3503360	Or Phantasmagoria, which was on seven CDs.
3503360	3506800	I used to download overnight and I used to have a download accelerator
3506800	3511280	to basically queue up a bunch of stuff to download.
3511280	3513280	That was my thing.
3513280	3513680	Yeah.
3513680	3514000	Nice.
3514800	3517040	And some folks in chat want to clarify,
3517040	3519120	X-Link says the credit was only for Japan.
3519120	3520560	Actually, no, it did open up.
3520560	3521920	Go check out Nintendo.com.
3522640	3527280	It is now, there is just a NES virtual console download credit that you can get now
3527280	3529200	and it's not 500 points clarifies.
3529200	3533920	Deep Bandit is a free NES game. That's right. It's basically a credit towards a free
3533920	3536880	NES virtual console game, which of course is 500 points,
3536880	3540560	but you can't like take the 500 points and apply it towards a Sega game or something else.
3540560	3542000	Has to be an NES game.
3542000	3543600	So there you go.
3544240	3544560	All right.
3545360	3546480	Let's move on with some more news.
3549840	3551280	It would help if my brain worked.
3552320	3553040	Yes, it would.
3553040	3554480	It's kind of required to do a show.
3554480	3563040	Well, actually, you know, the new Halo, the Halo 3 ODST is supposed to be coming out
3563040	3567600	and it has a launch date of September 22nd from, of course, Xbox 360.
3567600	3572240	But there are people out there who are playing illegitimate copies,
3572240	3578400	meaning they either have a burn of some kind or received a copy that they weren't supposed to receive.
3578400	3587040	And so the big Microsoft enforcer dude went on Twitter and said, and I quote,
3587040	3590560	I spy with my little eye, some illegitimate ODST players.
3590560	3592880	No early play for you commencing perma-bands.
3594880	3600160	And except for those who actually have legit copies, like early, you know,
3600160	3603600	actual true early copies for reviewers and that type of thing, they're okay.
3603600	3607440	Or if you have an actual legit copy of the game that you happen to get early,
3607440	3609040	then that's okay too, apparently.
3611200	3613200	I don't understand why people are playing the one that's out there now,
3613200	3615840	because the leaked one that's out there is actually in French.
3616480	3617840	I'm kind of curious.
3617840	3619360	Some people know French.
3619360	3620080	Yeah, that's true.
3620080	3621680	I'm kind of curious.
3621680	3624720	I mean, we import Japanese games, even though we can't read Japanese.
3624720	3625280	Come on.
3626560	3627520	I'm kind of curious, though.
3627520	3629440	How are they able to spot the difference?
3629440	3630800	Well, I mean, I'm not sure.
3630800	3633520	I'm kind of curious, though, how are they able to spot the difference?
3633520	3635760	Or is that some type of secret they're not saying?
3635760	3636720	There's no word on it.
3636720	3638160	They're claiming that's a secret.
3638160	3639200	I don't think they know.
3639200	3641120	I think they're just going after whomever.
3642000	3643280	But what if they get it wrong?
3645360	3646000	I think you're wrong.
3646000	3647600	I mean, there's got to be a way that they know.
3647600	3649120	There's a way they can tell the difference.
3649120	3649760	That's what they're doing.
3649760	3650880	They're basically...
3650880	3652080	Or is this a scare tactic?
3652080	3653360	I think it's a scare tactic.
3653360	3658400	And the other thing I think is, you know, if you want to think, you know,
3658400	3663280	the real conspiracy theory to it is that people are thinking that this is actually a copy
3663280	3668320	that they leaked out that's modified in a way that they can flag people that have played
3668320	3671280	it or something like that, which would be entrapment, but I don't see how they were
3671280	3671680	doing that.
3672720	3676480	I'm guessing that it's because you're going to see a bunch of people from, you know, all
3676480	3680880	playing this French-English version of it, like in the United States or something like
3680880	3685200	that, and people are going to be like, huh, I'm pretty sure that they didn't buy that
3685200	3687600	from, you know, wherever it was released at.
3687600	3692480	It's probably going to be a hacked, you know, console that's playing it.
3692480	3696000	Whereas, you know, if they actually are playing, you know, the U.S. version or something in
3696000	3698240	U.S., then that might be different.
3698240	3700640	They're just going to look at regions is basically what it is.
3700640	3702320	Because no one's going to import...
3702320	3705680	First off, the game's not even readily available there yet, I don't think.
3705680	3708880	And also, no one's really going to import a game.
3708880	3710800	It's going to be very rare if that happens.
3711440	3715280	I like Act F's comments in chat right now at chat.orangetheonsready.com.
3715280	3718160	Je n'est-ce si d'une weapon, je suis MasterChef.
3719040	3719680	MasterChef...
3720240	3722720	Oh, he put Chef, but it's supposed to be Chief.
3722720	3723600	That's why I read Chef.
3724640	3729920	Although I would like a game called MasterChef to come out next to Cooking Mama.
3730560	3734400	Anyhow, Dekeman in chat says it's the same way they tell if people are playing burn games
3734400	3734880	online.
3734880	3735360	They can't.
3735360	3740000	A lot of the new stuff that's out there now makes it very difficult for them to do that.
3740000	3741040	They're really stealth.
3741040	3746960	I would know, I played modified Grand Theft Auto IV's for like, what, how many months
3746960	3747680	now?
3747680	3748800	Yeah, it's still risky.
3748800	3750720	You know, it's risky to get into.
3751520	3752240	All right.
3752240	3756560	Let's go around the globe and explore some upcoming release dates from around the globe.
3758000	3758800	All right.
3758800	3762320	Well, in the US, there's actually quite a bit coming out this week.
3762320	3766560	It's kind of kicking off, not really the fourth quarter because it's a little early for that,
3766560	3769040	but you know, the major gaming season.
3769040	3772560	So starting off, we have Raiden IV.
3772560	3777600	The wonderful shooter game is coming to Xbox 360 this week.
3778160	3786000	Also, Mini Ninjas is going to be coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and DS.
3786560	3788160	Kind of a little family action game.
3789280	3792800	Darkness of Days is coming out on PC and Xbox 360.
3792800	3796080	It's a game where you can go back to the Civil War with a machine gun and blow everybody
3796080	3796400	away.
3796960	3797280	Cool.
3797280	3799440	That's what I was talking about earlier, right?
3799440	3800560	It's going to be awesome.
3800560	3801120	Seriously.
3802000	3804000	Trine coming to PC this week.
3804880	3807840	This guy had two Dark Hero Days on PSP.
3809200	3812000	War Leader Clash of Nations on PC.
3813200	3816240	Also, Fallen Earth, Welcome to the Apocalypse on PC.
3817760	3819920	Go play City Sports on the Wii.
3819920	3822720	He had another sports game collection.
3822720	3825920	All this one has rooftop hockey, so I kind of have to think of a little bit of Clerks
3825920	3826320	there.
3826320	3827360	That was kind of funny.
3828240	3837280	Cubed, the Q games collection coming to Xbox 360 with your resin, every extend extra extreme.
3838320	3840400	Time of Shadows on PC.
3841760	3847360	Dirt 2 coming to PlayStation 3, DS, Xbox 360, and Wii.
3848880	3850960	And I thought PSP as well.
3852320	3854480	Imagine Detectives on DS.
3854480	3865120	Aisle 2, Sturmovik, Birds of Prey coming to Xbox 360, PS3, DS, and PSP.
3867120	3873520	Capcom Platinum Hits Triple Back, that wonderful collection of three games including Dead Rising,
3873520	3877760	Lost Planet, and Devil May Cry 4 coming to the 360 this week.
3877760	3884640	Ant Nation on the DS, kind of, I guess, your kids' first real-time strategy game.
3885920	3889440	Little Big Planet, Game of the Year edition coming out on PlayStation 3.
3889440	3894240	And of course the big one, the Beatles Rock Band coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
3894240	3899920	the Wii, as well as the standalone instruments and your two different bundles that are available
3899920	3900400	for that.
3901120	3904240	Finally, if you have little kids that want to learn to read, they have three different
3904240	3909680	games for you for the DS, my virtual tutor reading K through first, pre-K through K,
3909680	3911600	and first through second.
3912160	3920000	Also coming out, actually about a week from today, two new DSi colors, both white and
3920000	3925440	then pink, and then also a week from today, you're getting two more DS games.
3925440	3930160	Princess in Love and My Boyfriend, both kind of like dating sim games.
3930160	3937040	And then finally, you're going to be getting Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which
3937040	3940000	is actually coming out a week from Monday.
3940000	3941840	And that's it.
3941840	3946000	Busy week, especially with Beatles Rock Band, of course, being the anchor for the week.
3946000	3946640	Yeah.
3946640	3950080	Hey, going to Japan and looking at the release dates over there.
3950080	3954080	There is a new Xbox 360 Elite, one of those new bundles coming out over in Japan.
3954080	3957200	I think that's a little bit of a price reduction for them, if I'm not mistaken.
3957200	3961520	The last remnant, speaking of price reductions, is getting one this week on the 360, as is
3961520	3966080	Fable 2, both of those games moving into the Platinum Collection, as well as Call of Duty
3966080	3968480	4 Modern Warfare and Bioshock.
3968480	3971920	So I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft's doing a little push in Japan right now with
3971920	3973360	all these recent price drops.
3973360	3976000	That's all happening on the 10th of this month.
3976000	3980480	Also happening on the 10th of this month, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, the Japanese
3980480	3984720	localized version, is out on the PlayStation 3, so check that out.
3984720	3989120	As well as, of course, a price drop as well for Call of Duty 4 over there as well.
3989120	3992400	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.
3992400	3994880	Forever Blue 2 next week, but not this week.
3994880	3997760	Also another House of the Dead game, but we'll cover that next week.
3997760	4000480	PlayStation 2, nothing this week either.
4000480	4002480	It's all on the 17th of September.
4002480	4004640	There's not much coming out on PlayStation 2 right now.
4004640	4005440	There's really not.
4005440	4007760	I think you're going to kind of see that phasing out slowly but surely.
4007760	4012640	Nintendo DS does have a new game called Arabians Lost that's coming out from Prototype over
4012640	4013840	in Japan this week.
4013840	4019920	That game looks to be, they are calling this an adventure game.
4019920	4023280	I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots from this to see what type of game it is.
4023280	4027280	Looks like it's just kind of a standard role playing-ish type of game, but it doesn't look
4027280	4028320	like it has battles.
4028320	4032640	But the subtitle of this game is called The Engagement on Desert.
4032640	4037200	I'm guessing it's just kind of like an interactive manga type of game with hit points and stuff.
4037200	4038400	That's what that is.
4038400	4041360	Let's see if there's anything on the PSP to mention this week.
4041360	4045840	Yes, there's a portable Navi 3, which I think is just one of those Navigator programs that
4045840	4047440	they have available on PSP.
4047440	4052000	If you want to change your PSP into a GPS, which really will probably only help you if
4052000	4053360	you live in Japan.
4053360	4054000	But there you go.
4054000	4056240	That's what you got for Japanese releases this week.
4056240	4060160	Well, for the UK, we have some, I mean, pretty much the standard stuff.
4060160	4062000	On the 9th is Beatles Rock Band.
4062000	4069360	On the 11th, we have Championship Manager 2010, Colin McRae Dirt 2, yay, Guitar Hero
4069360	4076720	5, Mini Ninjas, NHL 2K10, and Section 8.
4076720	4080880	Also, Rob, there's something on the 15th that you might be interested in, Zuma's Revenge.
4080880	4082560	Ah, I've heard about this.
4082560	4086160	I think this has a similar release date here in the US if it's not out already.
4086160	4088000	Yeah, it's kind of like a sequel to Zuma.
4088000	4090080	Not my favorite PopCap game.
4090080	4093760	My problem with Zuma is it's not something you can sit down and play quickly, like a
4093760	4094960	game of Bejeweled or something.
4094960	4099280	Zuma takes a long time to get through a game because not only does it take a long time
4099280	4102640	to beat each level, but then you have three lives.
4102640	4109120	So I'm not as big on Zuma, but there are other PopCap games I really enjoy.
4109120	4112400	And I know, I still got a copy of Bookworm Adventures 2 I need to play.
4112400	4113400	No, don't laugh.
4113400	4114400	It's an awesome game.
4114400	4115400	I know, I know.
4115400	4116400	I'm laughing because I've played it.
4116400	4117400	It's fun.
4117400	4118400	It's a lot of fun.
4118400	4119680	It's Final Fantasy meets Boggle.
4119680	4121080	It's amazing.
4121080	4123440	So I do want to check out the sequel.
4123440	4128040	By the way, Rob, I have to say, I like your shirt and all of its Helvetica-ness.
4128040	4129040	Thank you.
4129040	4132720	And for those, maybe Jamie will take a picture of it, but for those at home, because we are
4132720	4138040	a radio show and not a TV show, I'm wearing a shirt and I guess Jamie is going to put
4138040	4141920	a picture on our website right now in the picture gallery at www.orangetonsradio.com,
4141920	4147160	but it says Ms. Scarlet in the hall with a revolver, and it has a little picture of a
4147160	4148160	gun.
4148160	4149160	And as said in Helvetica.
4149160	4150160	Yes.
4150160	4151560	You and your font wholeness.
4151560	4153160	No, it's Helvetica, I swear.
4153160	4155680	Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
4155680	4156680	All right.
4156680	4159440	So let's move on, a couple more stories for you before we get to the classic game of the
4159440	4160440	week.
4160440	4161440	Yes.
4161440	4167920	This week, we had the debut of the new trailer for the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto
4167920	4170440	4, The Ballad of Gay Tony.
4170440	4174920	And with that, there is actually, it looks like that's going to be returning back to
4174920	4180440	kind of the over-the-top Grand Theft Auto fun that you can expect from the rest of the
4180440	4181880	series.
4181880	4185920	Some new stuff to note in there, there are some new weapons that they did kind of show
4185920	4191240	off in the trailer, a new machine gun that they had in there, I'm not really sure what
4191240	4192240	that was.
4192240	4196520	I did spot a P90 though, because I have that, it's one of my first Airsoft guns.
4196520	4198800	So there is a P90 in the game.
4198800	4202400	Some new helicopters, apparently it's going to focus a lot on aerial combat, they did
4202400	4207320	show off a new helicopter that fired rockets, as well as another one that was a kind of
4207320	4213120	a cargo helicopter picking up a subway car, which is kind of cool.
4213120	4218920	They had a golf cart in there as well, and some new sports cars.
4218920	4220400	So that's going to be kind of fun.
4220400	4222080	Did you notice what the song in the trailer was?
4222080	4223480	Yes I did.
4223480	4224480	I thought that was quite...
4224480	4228080	Those that listen to the Orange Laundry after birth that we only do live for a little bit
4228080	4231940	after we tape live will understand why that's funny.
4231940	4237940	And then also, they had, apparently there was some other stuff rumored that there's
4237940	4244080	a FIB tank in the game, like their SWAT tank or something.
4244080	4246600	And I don't know, it's going to be awesome.
4246600	4249760	I'm looking forward to this because they ruined my modded game.
4249760	4256640	So right now, I'm seriously, it's like we're coming out of depression or something.
4256640	4261520	Going back to playing the normal game is just wrong.
4261520	4267760	There are some pretty cool stuff coming for that.
4267760	4270760	Also out of the trailer though, of course they had a lot of different cut scenes in
4270760	4272860	there and they recognized some of the characters.
4272860	4277400	One of them I was kind of interested by is Gracie, which was actually one of the missions
4277400	4278400	in Grand Theft Auto IV.
4278400	4280400	You have to kidnap her, which is kind of funny.
4280400	4282560	But she's in there as well.
4282560	4284240	And overall looks awesome.
4284240	4289200	Okay, because I'm not as big of a Grand Theft Auto IV player as you are, who is Gay Tony?
4289200	4290200	He's like a mob boss?
4290200	4291560	Yeah, he's a mob boss.
4291560	4293400	He's Tony Prince is the guy.
4293400	4302720	He basically owns nightclubs and he's a member of the Ancelotti Crime Syndicate.
4302720	4310780	And basically, he owns the biggest gay and straight nightclubs in Algonquin.
4310780	4312960	So that's who you play.
4312960	4319160	You don't play him, but you play a guy that kind of helps him out, Luis Fernando Lopez.
4319160	4322400	Which is like this Dominican guy that you play as.
4322400	4324320	He's his bodyguard.
4324320	4331200	And the games, all three episodes, including the main game, all kind of culminate around
4331200	4334000	this diamond deal that goes down and goes wrong.
4334000	4340000	And that's the Impossible Trinity is each one of their roles in this diamond deal.
4340000	4343000	And if I remember correctly, I think Luis comes in and actually breaks up the diamond
4343000	4345040	deal and tries to steal the diamonds.
4345040	4348440	So that's definitely going to be part of the game.
4348440	4354080	I got a weird question for you, but as the gay guy on the program and who isn't as familiar
4354080	4358660	with Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm kind of curious, not to get all glad on you, but I'm curious,
4358660	4364400	is this a step forward for gay rights or is this going to be a bunch of stereotypes?
4364400	4366880	Does gay Tony go around going, that's super!
4366880	4370320	No, he didn't really do that.
4370320	4374880	There was a character, though, in Grand Theft Auto IV that was like that.
4374880	4377720	I don't remember his name, but yeah, he was very flamboyant.
4377720	4382480	But he didn't seem flamboyant in the trailer, of course he wasn't talking much, but I don't
4382480	4383480	think he is.
4383480	4386600	Because, you know, I'm totally cool with it if it's like, you know, hey, you have a gay
4386600	4390540	character who's like a cool mob boss and all this stuff just like anybody else.
4390540	4394300	But if it's just going to be stereotype after stereotype, then I'm just going to have face
4394300	4395300	palm.
4395300	4396840	Well, I don't think it's going to be.
4396840	4399400	I mean, they're usually pretty, you know...
4399400	4405000	Yeah, I know, Rockstar's pretty good about that stuff usually, so I'm hopeful, but you
4405000	4406000	know.
4406000	4409480	I don't want that anymore Full Frontal Penis again, because that was enough in the last
4409480	4410480	game.
4410480	4411480	We don't need Full Frontal Penis in this game.
4411480	4414720	But you wouldn't have any problem with full boobage and everything.
4414720	4418000	Yeah, because they haven't done that in this game, and I'm surprised, it being an emirated
4418000	4420960	game and stuff, you know, for nudity and that kind of stuff.
4420960	4421960	There's no...
4421960	4425160	It's establishment of a double standard, you don't want to see cock, but you don't mind
4425160	4426160	seeing boobs.
4426160	4427160	No, I don't want to see more cock.
4427160	4428720	There already is cock in the game.
4428720	4433560	Now I want to see boobs that go along with the cock so we have an equal representation.
4433560	4434560	Equal representation.
4434560	4436120	Equal opportunity nudity.
4436120	4438000	I actually support his statement.
4438000	4439000	I'm just saying...
4439000	4440740	I can go for equal opportunity nudity.
4440740	4444920	I don't have a problem with it, I'm just saying that they need to like, you know, I think
4444920	4447760	the stripper should be nude in the games, you know, that's only...
4447760	4448760	It's a strip club.
4448760	4449880	They're supposed to be stripping.
4449880	4452720	Well, if they sell alcohol, then they can't get naked, can they?
4452720	4458760	Well, that's the only thing only in California, I don't know, but whatever.
4458760	4459760	It's a game.
4459760	4460760	What the hell do I care?
4460760	4462480	It's just characters.
4462480	4465600	I just want... but it's just funny how there's a lot of people out there that says, oh, because
4465600	4468840	it's gay Tony, I hope we don't have to see more cock.
4468840	4473440	You know, I hope just for that, you get beaver shot in this, just for that kind of ignorant
4473440	4474440	comment.
4474440	4475440	It's going to be cool.
4475440	4478760	This game's going to be awesome, and I'm just hoping though that they bring back the tank,
4478760	4484240	because the tanks are awesome, the minigun, the flamethrower, and the chainsaw.
4484240	4485240	That's it.
4485240	4489840	But already I like where they're going with it, so I can't wait to play it.
4489840	4494000	One more story for you guys, and then we're going to go to the classic game of the week,
4494000	4497960	and this story has to actually do with the 360, where this download content is.
4497960	4500160	By the way, random-ass question.
4500160	4503800	When they announce the Grand Theft Auto IV exclusive content, it is never coming to the
4503800	4505200	PlayStation 3.
4505200	4506200	Is that correct?
4506200	4507680	As far as we're aware.
4507680	4511400	But maybe someday they might say, okay, window's over, we're going to release this disc now
4511400	4512400	on PlayStation 3.
4512400	4514400	Let me put it this way.
4514400	4515760	It could be ported in a heartbeat.
4515760	4517760	Yeah, I can see that.
4517760	4519080	I'm just kind of curious.
4519080	4522720	I mean, since all the formats are basically the same, it's just recoding the textures
4522720	4523720	and that's it.
4523720	4524720	All right.
4524720	4529320	Well, going back to the 360 a little bit, something changed in their technical certification
4529320	4534420	requirements this week that is a little bit interesting, and the word comes from develop.
4534420	4539400	It was the technical director David Jeffries, who works for BlackRock Studio.
4539400	4545040	He actually mentioned that Microsoft actually removed the fact that 360s must run at a minimum
4545040	4548760	of 1280 by 720, which you know as 720p.
4548760	4555000	If the system is in HD mode, and apparently anti-aliasing is also out, full screen anti-aliasing
4555000	4559120	you do not have to do.
4559120	4561240	Those requirements are now out.
4561240	4567460	Now Microsoft kind of was lenient on these rules before, and one very, very notable game
4567460	4571640	that got around these rules is Halo 3, because you might remember, and I remember some stories
4571640	4575080	on this when Halo 3 first came out, it's not running in true 720p.
4575080	4581280	It's running at 1152 by 640, so it's 100 pixels short on either side.
4581280	4585680	Apparently Call of Duty 4 is also 600p also.
4585680	4588680	Interesting.
4588680	4593720	I don't think this is a huge deal, because I'm all about frame rate a little more than
4593720	4594720	resolution.
4594720	4598960	Granted, a great game should have both great resolution and good frame rate, something
4598960	4603640	like Oblivion or whatever, but some of the games that get really busy online they have
4603640	4608080	to scale back the resolution a little bit.
4608080	4612560	Why now though, I'm kind of wondering, that they decided to get rid of this?
4612560	4616600	Is this because maybe 360 has enough penetration in the marketplace now, so they don't need
4616600	4623560	to be advertising all this HD HD HD?
4623560	4629960	Maybe there's a big game coming out that didn't have this or something, and they figured that
4629960	4633880	hey, let's make this available so that it's fair for everybody.
4633880	4636920	I don't know, maybe it makes it easier to develop on the system.
4636920	4638800	Alpha Kinanagram has an interesting thought.
4638800	4640840	Maybe it's for the indie games.
4640840	4643080	I don't know if the indie games were ever held to the same standard.
4643080	4644080	I don't think so.
4644080	4645080	I don't think so either.
4645080	4646080	There's no way.
4646080	4647080	It's a good thought though.
4647080	4649880	Yeah, because I don't think a lot of the indie games I've played have full screen anti-aliasing.
4649880	4655920	I'm trying to think if that actually, hmm, anyway.
4655920	4659400	Well there it is, the technical certifications are changing so we'll see what games come
4659400	4664360	of that a little later on, but for now, let's go to a classic video game in a little segment.
4664360	4668440	We'd like to call it the classic video game of the week.
4668440	4673880	This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer likes to browse the gaming vault and find
4673880	4676240	a game that she says, you know what?
4676240	4679660	You kids should be playing this game this week, or at least check it out and show this
4679660	4680660	game a little respect.
4680660	4683440	Dark Soccer, what game did you pick for the kids this week?
4683440	4688840	I think Chew Chew Rocket, but we have to hear the very beginning of the clip though because
4688840	4690880	it's important.
4690880	4696200	Fair enough, it's loading right now.
4696200	4697760	That was what was important.
4697760	4698760	Why?
4698760	4699760	Because it's Sonic Team.
4699760	4702480	Alright, tell us a little bit about Chew Chew Rocket.
4702480	4707120	Just out of curiosity, does this have to do with the fact that 99 of 09 is this week?
4707120	4712680	No, actually, it has to do with Dan Fussing because I don't put in games he suggests,
4712680	4716720	or I already have put in games that he suggested.
4716720	4717720	So Catmania.
4717720	4721760	So yeah, I put in Chew Chew Rocket.
4721760	4728600	So this was one of the first of the online games that came on the Dreamcast, and then
4728600	4734240	they just started giving it away with the Dreamcast as an online demo, and it was also
4734240	4740380	given away free in Europe when you would order a copy, well you could order your copy by
4740380	4746240	connecting to the Dream Arena service, but the whole point of the game is to get mice,
4746240	4752840	as in Chew Chew, because in Japanese that's the sound a mouse makes, it's Chew.
4752840	4759080	You get them onto a rocket while avoiding the cats, or the kapu kapu, that roam around
4759080	4760960	the board.
4760960	4765360	You have to place down arrows to determine the path the mice are going to take, because
4765360	4770240	they just keep going in a straight line until they run into a wall, so you have to point
4770240	4772500	them in the direction that they're supposed to go.
4772500	4779960	And you can do it up to four player multiplayer, and you can put the arrows everywhere, so
4779960	4783840	you can direct other people's mice away, you can direct yours forward, and like you were
4783840	4791480	saying with the Catmania, there's different obstacles, like Catmania means you have all
4791480	4795080	cats running around and you have to get them away from your ship, because if a cat hits
4795080	4800040	your ship, then it damages your ship.
4800040	4804160	And you can get special colored mice, like a gold mouse will give you 50 extra mice,
4804160	4811840	a pink mouse gives you those events like we were talking about, the Catmania, the Mousemania.
4811840	4819080	But the single player mode is actually I think my favorite, because it's really, it's really,
4819080	4824320	it gets super complex, it really turns into a matter of figuring out how you're going
4824320	4828720	to get from point A to point B when you've got all these obstacles in your path and all
4828720	4831040	you have is a limited number of arrows.
4831040	4834520	This game is fucking fast paced too, I mean that was my biggest problem with it, it was
4834520	4836160	too fast for me to keep up with.
4836160	4838960	They need to like, chew chew slow.
4838960	4846000	Well you also got a challenge mode where you have to get all the mice into rockets or get
4846000	4852320	a cat to eat all the mice, or put the cat into a guarded rocket or other stuff and you
4852320	4858800	had a time limit on it and it had 25 levels, you could do that actually one or two player
4858800	4859800	or two.
4859800	4867080	There's a Game Boy Advance version that's really the same as the Dreamcast version but
4867080	4871120	you can actually play with one cartridge multiplayer.
4871120	4876320	So multiple people, well you also had a level editor in it too.
4876320	4882680	And actually the Game Boy Advance version wasn't made by Sega.
4882680	4887800	Also in Sonic Battle, Tails has a choo-choo for his landmine.
4887800	4897400	So yeah, it's a pretty fun little game, and it's just fun, play it.
4897400	4898400	Alright.
4898400	4899400	Get Dreamcast!
4899400	4906440	The choo-choo rocket, which Jamie swears has nothing to do with the 9-9-0-0-9 or 99 whatever
4906440	4907440	you want to call it.
4907440	4908440	The anniversary of the Dreamcast this week.
4908440	4910440	It's the classic game of the week.
4910440	4911440	Choo.
4911440	4912440	Choo.
4912440	4913440	Alright.
4913440	4916960	We're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4916960	4920160	We always like to take a break in the middle of the show to just kind of stretch, you know,
4920160	4923160	refill our drinks or go to the restroom or what have you.
4923160	4926000	So we suggest you take an opportunity to do the same because there is plenty more to come
4926000	4930240	in Part B of our show tonight, including Twitter topics, rapid fire news tonight, and more
4930240	4931240	long discussion.
4931240	4934120	We're going to talk about Blur, which is a racing game I am really looking forward to.
4934120	4936080	It's Damon Allburn.
4936080	4937080	Not that.
4937080	4938080	Blur.
4938080	4939080	Blur the racing game, silly.
4939080	4943440	We're going to talk about a brand new reality show coming to Sony, PlayStation Network,
4943440	4949200	it sounds kind of interesting would be the word for it, and 3D, possibly on the PlayStation
4949200	4950200	3.
4950200	4951560	Some interesting developments with that this week.
4951560	4955320	So we're going to do all that right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4955320	4961720	Stay tuned.
4961720	4965560	Welcome back everybody to Part B of our podcast.
4965560	4969200	We're taping live on this Sunday evening, September 6, 2009.
4969200	4974360	Happy Labor Day to all of our American listeners who will get tomorrow off of work or, you
4974360	4979640	know, if it's not America that you're from, then just have a happy Monday or happy week
4979640	4980640	wherever you're at.
4980640	4985680	We're going to get into some more gaming news as we tape live on this Sunday evening at
4985680	4988360	www.allgames.com.
4988360	4992280	And we have Bobby Blackwolf joining us earlier in the show live from Seattle where he had
4992280	4996260	just wrapped up Penny Arcade Expo, which just came to a close earlier.
4996260	5000600	Any word on what the final game was and their little PAX, what do they call that?
5000600	5001600	The little PAX?
5001600	5002600	Omega-thon.
5002600	5003600	Omega-thon.
5003600	5004600	Thank you.
5004600	5005600	Any word on what the final game was yet?
5005600	5006720	Does that hit the internet?
5006720	5009640	I don't think I've seen it on the internet, but I will look.
5009640	5011000	All right, yeah, check that out because I'm curious.
5011000	5012000	I'm sure somebody in chat.
5012000	5014600	The lovely thing about having a chat room during the show is that they are there to
5014600	5016420	yell things out when...
5016420	5018560	And the final Omega-thon was skee-ball.
5018560	5020920	Skee-ball.
5020920	5021920	That's rad.
5021920	5023920	They actually wheeled out a machine and...
5023920	5024920	Yes, they did.
5024920	5026320	Oh, that's awesome.
5026320	5027640	Props.
5027640	5028840	Mega-props to you guys.
5028840	5029840	Oh, my God.
5029840	5034860	No pressure or anything, but can you imagine the amount of pressure that it all comes down
5034860	5036360	to skee-ball?
5036360	5038960	That reminds me, though, there was a pricing game on The Price is Right, you know, because
5038960	5039960	your shirt reminds me of this, too.
5039960	5041560	Loki's wearing a Price is Right shirt today, everybody.
5041560	5043720	You should see it.
5043720	5047400	There was a skee-ball game that, like, if you could hit the target on the skee-ball,
5047400	5048400	you'd win, like, a new car.
5048400	5050160	Like, there's almost as much pressure.
5050160	5053000	Well, it's like, okay, so the rounds as it went...
5053000	5054860	The first round was Mario Kart Wii.
5054860	5057600	The second round was Bookworm Adventures.
5057600	5060760	Round three was Halo 3 ODST.
5060760	5062760	Round four was the Beatles Rock Band.
5062760	5067480	Round five was Connect Four, and then, of course, the final round being skee-ball.
5067480	5072600	Very interesting, because you have, like, some new games mixed with some board games.
5072600	5074840	Very good mix at the Omega-thon this year.
5074840	5075840	Awesome.
5075840	5076840	All right.
5076840	5079480	We're going to get back into our show tonight.
5079480	5081680	We're going to start off with some Twitter topics.
5081680	5085600	Oh, we have theme song now for Twitter topics, don't we?
5085600	5086840	I totally forgot to queue it up.
5086840	5089040	I'm a bad host tonight.
5089040	5090040	Fired!
5090040	5091760	Hold on a minute.
5091760	5092760	Let me get the theme song here.
5092760	5095620	Only if we get to use fire.
5095620	5098440	Any exciting plans for Labor Day, you guys?
5098440	5100440	I'm going to sleep.
5100440	5101440	Yeah?
5101440	5102440	Rob.
5102440	5103440	What?
5103440	5104440	We have to do something tomorrow.
5104440	5105440	Maybe.
5105440	5106440	We'll see.
5106440	5107440	I kind of want to just stay in and play WoW all day.
5107440	5109320	Well, I know what's going on tonight.
5109320	5110320	What's that?
5110320	5113000	Becky's going to come over tonight, and we're going to watch My Fair Lady.
5113000	5114000	Fun!
5114000	5116800	Any reason why you were just deciding to get into old-school musicals, just for the fun
5116800	5117960	of it?
5117960	5120880	I really don't remember how to, except that it was very random.
5120880	5122760	Nothing wrong with that.
5122760	5126040	We're thinking about going to yoga after the show.
5126040	5128040	You should come with us.
5128040	5130000	I'll go to yoga, but I'm probably not going to stay for the movie.
5130000	5131000	Oh, come on.
5131000	5134000	I got other stuff I want to do at home.
5134000	5135000	What, like sleep?
5135000	5136000	Yeah, actually.
5136000	5138520	All right, I found the music.
5138520	5142960	Let's get into the chatters and the listeners of Orange Islands Radio, showing us their
5142960	5147640	tweets.
5147640	5149160	We can't read them all tonight, guys.
5149160	5150400	We got a lot.
5150400	5151400	We got a lot tonight.
5151400	5152400	We can't read them all.
5152400	5154240	I'm going to be offended if we get yours.
5154240	5160680	Fernando asked the very first question, what if there was a mariachi band as a game?
5160680	5162880	It might sound a little like our background music.
5162880	5165280	Let's play a mariachi game.
5165280	5168600	I would totally play one, but I think the novelty would honestly wear off.
5168600	5169760	Let's be honest.
5169760	5171440	There was that tambourine game.
5171440	5174880	I don't know if you've ever seen this, but the makers of Samba de Amigo, at least in
5174880	5179600	the arcade, also made a tambourine game, and I forget the name of this game.
5179600	5184840	It is the gayest game I've ever played in my life, and I use that term to mean really
5184840	5190520	homosexual, like this would sleep with other tambourine games of the same gender, okay?
5190520	5196220	This was, wow, like gayer than Stevie Nicks, but it was a lot of fun, actually, and it's
5196220	5199540	the closest thing I think I've played to an actual mariachi band.
5199540	5200540	So there you go.
5200540	5203240	Not that I'm saying mariachi's gay, but just, you know, I don't know why the tambourine music
5203240	5205320	and the whole Samba thing kind of reminds me.
5205320	5208760	It's like the closest that we've had.
5208760	5214240	Tigerclaw305 says, there's a story here he's linking us to.
5214240	5220060	The creator of Mobile Suit Gundam says that video games are evil, and links us to a story
5220060	5222560	that ran on Gamasutra earlier this week.
5222560	5230280	Apparently Yoshiyuki Tomino gave a keynote speech at the CEDEC Game Conference and said,
5230280	5233340	quote, I think that video games are evil.
5233340	5237680	Gaming is not a type of activity that provides any support to our daily lives, and all these
5237680	5240320	consoles are just consuming electricity.
5240320	5243760	Let's say we have about 3 billion people on this planet wasting their time bringing no
5243760	5245240	productivity at all.
5245240	5248440	Add 10 billion more people, and what would happen to our planet?
5248440	5252000	Video games are assisting the death of our planet.
5252000	5255800	Okay crazy man, way to bite the hand that feeds you, right?
5255800	5257680	I don't know, why would he say something like that?
5257680	5259000	I don't know.
5259000	5263720	Gundam is on like every fucking game platform ever in Japan.
5263720	5265700	Way to be a sellout.
5265700	5270840	Maybe the speech was like irony and we just don't get it, I don't know.
5270840	5273440	Retertainment wants us to talk about this topic.
5273440	5278800	Most people complain that early adopters are getting screwed over, does the PS3 Slim mean
5278800	5281480	it the other way around?
5281480	5287280	That's kind of been true of Sony for a long time, well at least in this generation.
5287280	5292040	If you didn't buy a PlayStation 3 when they first came out, you didn't get backwards compatibility.
5292040	5296280	Or you didn't get the extra USB slots were on there for a while, then there were some
5296280	5298500	other on-board ports, right?
5298500	5303640	So it's not like the Slim is anything new for Sony this generation, but if you didn't
5303640	5308480	want the machine to cost $600, they had to cut corners somewhere.
5308480	5313360	But I do find the whole lack of even software emulation and the removal of Linux, I do find
5313360	5314360	that odd.
5314360	5315360	Like the rest of it I get.
5315360	5318360	I get why they take out USB slots, I get some of this other stuff.
5318360	5321400	I get that the Slim might have a slightly longer loading time.
5321400	5322960	The rest of this I don't think I get.
5322960	5323960	Does that make sense?
5323960	5324960	It makes sense.
5324960	5329560	I don't understand why they removed Linux, I mean I understand that maybe no one's used
5329560	5334520	in that function, but I don't see how that function really did anything, unless people
5334520	5339240	found a way to hack the PS3 through Linux, which I don't know.
5339240	5340240	I haven't heard of that.
5340240	5342960	It actually would be fairly easy using Linux I would think.
5342960	5348120	No, I think they keep everything separated, but I don't understand.
5348120	5349120	Whatever.
5349120	5353240	All right, well, we're also going to move on to another Twitter topic.
5353240	5358320	This comes from a friend of mine, The Segg, on Twitter, and he actually wants us to name
5358320	5361680	drop something he's going to be working with in the next couple months, and he's already
5361680	5364840	working on it now, FundaRazor.
5364840	5369200	That of course is a nice fancy way of saying fundraiser, which is a fundraiser for the
5369200	5374320	Child's Play charity, and it's a national event that's going to be happening this December.
5374320	5378600	San Francisco, Austin, New York City, Portland, Denver.
5378600	5381960	If you want more information, I urge you to follow them on Twitter.
5381960	5384880	They're at Twitter.com slash FundaRazor.
5384880	5386440	I just linked it in chat.
5386440	5387440	F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.
5387440	5392160	They only have 10 followers right now.
5392160	5393160	It's for charity.
5393160	5395160	They should have 10,000.
5395160	5396160	Check out that event near you.
5396160	5397280	I'm going to try and go to the one in San Francisco.
5397280	5398720	In fact, I'm pretty sure I will be going.
5398720	5402960	Well, I kind of told Segg I would, so I'm going to go, and then probably take the next
5402960	5403960	day off work so I can go.
5403960	5404960	I'd like to go.
5404960	5405960	You want to go?
5405960	5406960	Sure.
5406960	5407960	We'll cover it for OLR.
5407960	5408960	That sounds great.
5408960	5411120	Maybe we can get some swanky press access or something.
5411120	5412920	I'll have to talk and see if we can get a hookup.
5412920	5413920	That'll be fun.
5413920	5414920	That would be.
5414920	5415920	But you know what?
5415920	5416920	It's not about that.
5416920	5417920	It's about a good cause.
5417920	5421880	And you know, between the marathon we talked about last week that unfortunately I got so
5421880	5424640	busy this week I couldn't follow up on that, but there's the marathon we're going to do
5424640	5426600	October 17th.
5426600	5429600	I will hopefully have all the details on that next week.
5429600	5432420	There's a lot of great stuff coming this holiday season.
5432420	5437760	As I understand it, FundaRazor is also on Facebook.
5437760	5439200	And wants some more fans on Facebook.
5439200	5443040	I don't think I'm following them on Facebook yet, so I will go add them myself a little
5443040	5444040	later in the show.
5444040	5448000	But again, that's F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.
5448000	5449000	And K.O.
5449000	5452200	Ray is reminding us about Extra Life, which is the marathon that's also happening on October
5452200	5455440	17th that we talked about last week.
5455440	5457400	Extra Life SG is their Twitter.
5457400	5460400	So two great events, one in October, one in December.
5460400	5461400	Do them both.
5461400	5463680	Think of the children, damn you.
5463680	5466200	And how crunchy they are.
5466200	5467200	Shush.
5467200	5473680	Spazinator says, PlayStation 3 firmware 3.0 unannounced or hidden feature.
5473680	5476960	The addition of print screen and screenshot to the web browser.
5476960	5477960	I was not aware.
5477960	5478960	That's kind of interesting.
5478960	5484280	I mean, nothing you can't already do on a PC, but I guess it's kind of nice to have
5484280	5485280	that on the PlayStation.
5485280	5488500	You know that screenshotting is coming to home as well.
5488500	5491280	And they're going to do like a first person view so you can screenshot there.
5491280	5495160	So check that out.
5495160	5498240	I think that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
5498240	5499840	All right, I'll do one more.
5499840	5500840	K.O.
5500840	5502880	Ray says, just beat Batman Arkham Asylum.
5502880	5503880	What do you guys think of it?
5503880	5504880	That game was beautiful.
5504880	5508400	And Dan was playing a lot of it while Misty was here.
5508400	5513560	And of course, and who's also here right now, our other friend Mystique.
5513560	5517600	So we had Misty and Misty and me making commentary the entire time.
5517600	5523160	We were doing the MST3K version of Batman Arkham Asylum and it was pretty funny.
5523160	5525640	And then every time Harley came out, I was like, Harley.
5525640	5526640	So yeah, pretty good.
5526640	5528600	But I wish it had more of an ending.
5528600	5534320	I know you're a fan girl of the comics, so how in the series?
5534320	5535320	What I'm not.
5535320	5536320	I don't like DC Comics.
5536320	5539960	I thought you were like the show, not the I'm sorry, I'm at the comic book show.
5539960	5542840	You know, I watch some of the animated series.
5542840	5544480	I'm not the world's biggest Batman fan.
5544480	5545480	I just like that.
5545480	5546480	Dan loves it.
5546480	5547480	Dan loves it.
5547480	5548480	I am not.
5548480	5550120	Mystique just came in and let's see.
5550120	5551600	Has Mystique ever been on the show?
5551600	5552600	No.
5552600	5553600	Come here, Mystique.
5553600	5554600	Wait, come here, come here.
5554600	5555600	Let's end Twitter topics.
5555600	5556600	Let's talk to Mystique for a little bit.
5556600	5557600	Hi, Mystique.
5557600	5558600	How are you?
5558600	5559600	Hey, what's up?
5559600	5560600	Good.
5560600	5561600	Just be, just be, talk loud and strong in that microphone because it's kind of sensitive.
5561600	5562600	You don't want me to be loud.
5562600	5563600	All right.
5563600	5564600	You don't want me to be that loud.
5564600	5569440	What do you, uh, you hold in your hand a bunch of DC, what is this DVDs of movies?
5569440	5570440	Yes.
5570440	5571440	Yeah.
5571440	5575080	It is Superman, the animated series and Justice League Unlimited.
5575080	5579020	Are you guys going to a Mystery Science 3000 that like the movie you were watching last
5579020	5580020	week when I was here?
5580020	5581020	Possibly.
5581020	5582020	Possibly.
5582020	5586720	Uh, oh, there might be, there might be a fighting going on over the TV.
5586720	5588120	There's going to be a throw down.
5588120	5589120	Oh, there's going to be a throw down.
5589120	5591800	Uh, what do you think of Batman Arkham Asylum?
5591800	5595840	I cannot wait to play that game, even though I watched a lot of it with Dan, although I'm
5595840	5600400	really upset that I can't play the Joker and the Xbox 360.
5600400	5602440	Oh, because he has the 360 version.
5602440	5607240	And he just, he just had to tell me after I made a decision of which one I was going
5607240	5608240	to buy.
5608240	5609240	I'm like, hmm.
5609240	5610980	Both of them went down in price.
5610980	5615160	You know, I think I'm going to get the 360 since I have an, I have Netflix and all that.
5615160	5619900	And then Dan had to go and tell me, you know, on the PS3 you can play the Joker.
5619900	5621000	I was like, you're a bastard.
5621000	5622760	Only in one mode.
5622760	5623760	I don't care.
5623760	5624760	It's only a little piece of the game.
5624760	5627640	By the way, I'm loving the purple hair matching glasses, matching the top.
5627640	5628640	That is perfect today.
5628640	5629640	It's my signature color.
5629640	5630640	That's right.
5630640	5631640	All right.
5631640	5632960	Well thank you Mystique for being on the show and have fun with your movies.
5632960	5633960	Okay.
5633960	5634960	New problem.
5634960	5635960	All right.
5635960	5636960	We like having new people.
5636960	5637960	Better play the death hill when Becky comes over because we are totally watching My Fair
5637960	5638960	Lady.
5638960	5646560	So we, we have not had guests a lot in the studio dark room's freaking small, very small
5646560	5647560	space.
5647560	5649640	Dan, I think we need a bigger box.
5649640	5650640	All right.
5650640	5652120	It's time to get a bigger boat.
5652120	5653120	Salsa shark.
5653120	5654120	All right.
5654120	5655120	Twitter topics.
5655120	5656120	We're done with that for tonight.
5656120	5658560	So thank you guys very much for contributing to Twitter topics.
5658560	5661160	Let's get back into some gaming news.
5661160	5662940	Actually rapid fire news is up next.
5662940	5665160	So some quick gaming news starting from Loki.
5665160	5666160	Yes.
5666160	5670560	The card too, of course, is getting a collector's edition, which will be coming out with the
5670560	5672400	game in October.
5672400	5676080	And with the collector's edition, you will be able to get a replica knife.
5676080	5677080	Yes.
5677080	5679520	Because that's what gamers need things to stab stuff with.
5679520	5681520	I want a knife.
5681520	5682520	Yes.
5682520	5684520	Now that's a knife.
5684520	5685920	Yes.
5685920	5692200	It's the Fortune Hunter edition and it does come with the replica of the game's mystery,
5692200	5694640	mysterious ancient artifact.
5694640	5698760	And I don't know.
5698760	5703160	But yeah, it is going to be very limited and I guess apparently only available through
5703160	5707720	GameStop, which, you know, they get all the limited editions nowadays.
5707720	5709920	I don't know why.
5709920	5716480	Konami in kind of a strange turn of events is publishing the new 99 Nights game, 99 Nights
5716480	5721560	2, which judging by the screenshot looks way better than the first one.
5721560	5724560	And yeah, it's pretty awesome.
5724560	5728800	But right now it's scheduled to come out in Japan soon.
5728800	5731960	No word on when it's coming out over here, but you better believe it'll be coming out
5731960	5732960	over here at some point.
5732960	5736360	Probably next year, because that's when all the games are coming out.
5736360	5742880	And then finally, Guitar Hero 5 has a lot of download content coming its way for the
5742880	5744480	month of September.
5744480	5748660	Starting things off next week on September 10th, you're going to be getting the Street
5748660	5755920	Sweeper Social Club Track Pack, which includes 100 Little Curses, Fight Smash Win, and Somewhere
5755920	5762640	in the World It's Midnight, all available for $2 or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii
5762640	5763640	Points.
5763640	5769280	And the week after that, they're going to be getting the AFI Track Pack, which is going
5769280	5774800	to include Beautiful Thieves, Girls Not Gray, and The Missing Frame, also available for
5774800	5778160	$2 each or 160 Microsoft Points.
5778160	5784720	Or of course, the track packs as a whole you can buy in a bundle for $5.49.
5784720	5790280	And then finally, September 24th, we'll be getting another track pack.
5790280	5796840	No name for this track pack, but apparently it includes The Editors with Munich, Faint
5796840	5803000	with Geeks Were Right, and the Yaya Yas with Dull Life, and also available for $2 each
5803000	5806120	or $5.49 for the pack.
5806120	5808560	And that's it.
5808560	5811200	All right, moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
5811200	5813000	A new WiiWare game has been announced.
5813000	5815520	It's Bit.Trip Void, if that sounds familiar.
5815520	5819720	It's because you probably played Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Chord, I'm sorry, Bit.Trip
5819720	5820720	Core.
5820720	5823640	Void is coming out, of course, in the Bit.Trip fashion.
5823640	5827840	It kind of looks like the Atari 2600, but with chiptunes, and it looks like it's going
5827840	5828840	to be pretty cool.
5828840	5830860	I'm looking at a trailer here in studio.
5830860	5835120	The trailer, it makes it look like Ikaruga, because you have to collect black dots in
5835120	5836120	your Void conspiracy.
5836120	5837960	Oh, and you kind of avoid the white ones.
5837960	5841560	That actually looks like fun.
5841560	5843280	The Bit.Trip games are actually a lot of fun.
5843280	5845720	I wonder if they'll release a compilation of this a little later on.
5845720	5846720	I don't know.
5846720	5847840	That could be a very fun game.
5847840	5850680	I don't think there is a release date yet announced for this.
5850680	5852360	They just say later this year.
5852360	5856960	By the way, it was playable at PAX, so some folks already got to play it.
5856960	5862340	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Attack is coming to the Nintendo DS.
5862340	5864260	Apparently it's a brand new game.
5864260	5868720	It has the arcade style controls like you see in Turtles in Time.
5868720	5870840	You are going up against Shredder.
5870840	5874620	By the way, this was also shown at PAX.
5874620	5877560	You lucky PAX attendees getting your hands on some early stuff.
5877560	5883440	Another game that's coming out onto Xbox Live Arcade, Puzzle Bobble Live, coming out in
5883440	5884960	Japan.
5884960	5888940	It will probably make its way over here as Bust-A-Move Live or something like that over
5888940	5893200	here in America, because you know there's that whole fact that Bust-A-Move over here
5893200	5894960	is actually Puzzle Bobble.
5894960	5900300	Why they call it Bust-A-Move and then ruined the name of the actual Bust-A-Move game is
5900300	5901520	Bust-A-Groove over here?
5901520	5902520	I will never understand that.
5902520	5904260	Oh, I have an answer for that.
5904260	5906640	Why do they call Puzzle Bobble Bust-A-Move here?
5906640	5907640	Because they're stupid.
5907640	5908640	Oh, okay.
5908640	5909640	That makes perfect sense.
5909640	5916000	Anyway, the game's coming out in Japan on September 30th for 800 Microsoft Points.
5916000	5921220	No comment yet on North America or Europe release dates, but I'm sure the games will
5921220	5922380	be ported soon enough.
5922380	5925640	Those are... That's a pretty standard game.
5925640	5930240	Do you remember on the PlayStation 2, Bust-A-Move was one of the first games that came out for
5930240	5935040	it, and on the cover it had a baby wearing sunglasses and had a big bubble that said
5935040	5936040	Bust-
5936040	5937040	It made no sense.
5937040	5938040	It made no sense at all.
5938040	5940760	That was Bust-A-Move 2 that had the baby, I think, on the cover.
5940760	5943240	Seriously, what the hell was that?
5943240	5947880	That just sums up in a nutshell the transition of Puzzle Bobble to Bust-A-Move.
5947880	5950360	I'll just never understand.
5950360	5952040	Never get it.
5952040	5953920	Kochikawa says it's copyright infringement.
5953920	5955920	Forget on what, though.
5955920	5956920	Really?
5956920	5957920	Whatever.
5957920	5958920	Young MC.
5958920	5960080	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5960080	5962520	I have some stuff.
5962520	5969720	Actually, some kind of interesting news in looking at almost an international point of
5969720	5970720	view.
5970720	5972000	First of all, I was in Japan.
5972000	5982800	The PlayStation 3 sales have plummeted with my bad sound effects.
5982800	5989840	That actually is going ahead of the PS3 Slim launch.
5989840	6005560	They've gone, for the regular PS3, it's only sold 1,040 units with the last week, and however
6005560	6013960	the Xbox 360 rose to sell 7,254 units.
6013960	6021040	Of course, there's a little bit of Nintendo sale drop, but they're still pushing a lot
6021040	6029680	of the DSi and DS Lite.
6029680	6039200	As far as other stuff going on, for some rock band news, there's a new PAX track that's
6039200	6044840	going to be Freeze Pop, Jonathan Colton, MC Frontalot, and Paul and Storm.
6044840	6048240	And each song will be $1 apiece.
6048240	6049680	So you've got that.
6049680	6050680	A whole dollar?
6050680	6051680	Yep.
6051680	6054920	Yeah, but it's Freeze Pop and Jonathan Colton and other bands that are pretty cool.
6054920	6058360	You know, I'm going to have both of those at least.
6058360	6064240	And then the last thing, this gets the Face Palm award of the night, other than those
6064240	6068360	idiot people wanting to pull their children out of school so they can't see Obama's speech.
6068360	6069360	So stupid.
6069360	6079240	But yeah, there's a special, a special function for the 6-axis in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
6079240	6082360	It's going to have 6-axis support.
6082360	6084240	You know what it's going to do?
6084240	6085240	No.
6085240	6086240	What?
6086240	6087240	Boob jiggle.
6087240	6088240	Awesome.
6088240	6089800	You can control boob jiggle.
6089800	6092200	It is the next likely progression.
6092200	6093200	Whatever.
6093200	6098880	It's like I was telling Sauce earlier today, I was like, yeah, I bet the developers are
6098880	6101520	sitting around going, we should do something with the 6-axis.
6101520	6104880	I don't know, what should we do?
6104880	6106800	We could wiggle their boobies.
6106800	6107800	Hey, that works.
6107800	6108800	And that's it.
6108800	6112240	I bet the conversation went just like that too.
6112240	6114400	All right.
6114400	6115400	Funny.
6115400	6120400	Let's get back into some longer news that we'll talk a little more about, and then soon
6120400	6123880	your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6123880	6126160	Now I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy about this or not.
6126160	6130720	And we know that with the new updates, especially coming in the fall, that they're going to
6130720	6136640	be having some support for Facebook support and stuff like that.
6136640	6138920	I know with the Xbox 360.
6138920	6142640	Now what's interesting though is apparently the game Blur coming out is going to have
6142640	6144040	Twitter support.
6144040	6148280	Yes, it will apparently tweet when you do different things.
6148280	6153920	And for one example, one of the tweets, I guess, might be like, I just won first place
6153920	6156440	and blah, blah, blah.
6156440	6159520	I hope they can turn that off.
6159520	6160520	I don't know.
6160520	6161520	Yeah, you don't give it your login.
6161520	6162520	That's how you turn it off.
6162520	6163840	This sounds like a horrible idea.
6163840	6164840	I'm sorry.
6164840	6165840	I don't know.
6165840	6168760	It's a horrible, horrible idea that is just contributing to the problem.
6168760	6173560	And don't get me wrong, I think Blur is an amazing looking game, and I really enjoy the
6173560	6174560	demo at E3.
6174560	6175560	It's one of my favorites.
6175560	6178240	That being said, the plug needs to be pulled on this immediately.
6178240	6180960	And if you spam this shit to your Twitter and I'm following you right now, you will
6180960	6182080	be dropped.
6182080	6189200	Because unfortunately, and here's the problem with Twitter, is that you cannot filter posts
6189200	6190600	like you can on Facebook.
6190600	6193980	I would be okay with it if you could click a little button and then like filter all posts
6193980	6196400	made by Blur because I would have done that with Blur.
6196400	6198600	I would have done that with that friend feed or whatever.
6198600	6206960	And I would do that with Raptor because I seriously drop people for all those things.
6206960	6208160	And it's nothing personal.
6208160	6210040	I just, you know, here's the thing.
6210040	6212280	It is personal with me, by the way.
6212280	6216440	There's a finite amount of tweets that my iPhone app will download at a time.
6216440	6217840	It's 200 tweets.
6217840	6221160	And if 20 of those tweets are your fucking friend feed or something, I'm sorry.
6221160	6224120	That's going to piss me off because that's 20 things I could have read about somebody
6224120	6228360	else, you know, that might be like actually about their day or something interesting.
6228360	6233680	You know, I just, I am not a fan of these auto tweets at all and kind of, and think
6233680	6237560	they're going to destroy Twitter unless something is done about them very soon.
6237560	6240280	Because I know this is not going to be the first or last thing.
6240280	6245860	What Activision destroy something like, I don't know, beloved guitar franchise.
6245860	6251320	This is just so strange though, because you know, usually bizarre creations is, is we've
6251320	6252320	had them on the show.
6252320	6253320	They're a great studio.
6253320	6257120	Uh, and I understand, you know, they're just trying to be on the cutting edge of technology,
6257120	6260740	but this, I just, and I'm really, you should do it really with Facebook and maybe we're
6260740	6263840	misinterpreting this and I'll give credit there.
6263840	6266240	Maybe we need clarification on how exactly this is going to work.
6266240	6270000	And I think it's pretty obvious to say if you don't give this game your Twitter login,
6270000	6271100	it can't do it.
6271100	6274760	So to some extent you're going to have to want it to post to Twitter for you.
6274760	6278600	But why that's, that's the part I failed to see.
6278600	6279600	Why is this useful?
6279600	6284960	And the other thing too is apparently it's going to feature like a faux social networking
6284960	6292280	site like inner tube, I guess it's their bizarre version of YouTube or something, but yeah,
6292280	6296480	it will have real, um, Twitter support as well.
6296480	6297480	I don't know.
6297480	6300220	I think it's fine if they want to, you know, if you have updates or something like that,
6300220	6303520	but that's something more like Facebook because at least then you can filter it out.
6303520	6308240	But Twitter, I don't want to see updates about, you know, stuff like that.
6308240	6309240	I don't know.
6309240	6312840	Or maybe it gives you the option like say you want first place and you get the option,
6312840	6315560	do you want to tweet this or not?
6315560	6318800	That might be a little more tolerable depending on how often people do it.
6318800	6321200	You know, I, I, I just, I'm a little iffy on it though.
6321200	6322200	Yeah.
6322200	6323960	I just want to say this.
6323960	6325320	Just don't do it.
6325320	6326760	Just don't bother with it.
6326760	6331120	If my Twitter gets filled up with blur race updates, then I can't read that so and so
6331120	6336580	just took a big poop on Twitter, you know, and isn't that what Twitter's really about
6336580	6338960	is what you ate for breakfast this morning?
6338960	6339960	Exactly.
6339960	6342520	With the new, uh, was it the new, um, action or whatever?
6342520	6344840	I am actually starting to get really annoyed with Twitter.
6344840	6346800	Like it's a love hate thing with Twitter.
6346800	6351660	There's a lot of dumb shit on Twitter, but at the same time I found it to be really good
6351660	6354000	for networking and getting the information out there.
6354000	6355600	Like it's been really good for the show.
6355600	6358040	That's what I use it for.
6358040	6360520	As I use it for a lot of my networking now.
6360520	6361920	I use it for O.L.R.
6361920	6362920	Foodio.
6362920	6363920	Yeah.
6363920	6366520	Now there's a new hashtag.
6366520	6369600	Loki invented a new hashtag and the thing is people are using it that listen to this
6369600	6370600	show.
6370600	6374240	Like it's not just me, but like I saw like three other people using the new O.L.R.
6374240	6379560	Foodio tweet and I'm somewhere torn between this is really funny and you know, I just
6379560	6384640	think Twitter needs to take some cues from Facebook and give us better ways to filter
6384640	6385640	content.
6385640	6386640	I think it's really what they need.
6386640	6388640	I've actually been using my Facebook a whole lot more than Twitter now.
6388640	6391920	I mean, simply because of a lot of the reasons that you just mentioned.
6391920	6395720	So, uh, Bochi Kawa in chat makes a very good point.
6395720	6398280	Poop is greater than waste race win.
6398280	6400280	I agree.
6400280	6402520	All right.
6402520	6407160	So anyhow, Blur getting Twitter support, uh, we'll see exactly how that plays out a little
6407160	6408160	later on.
6408160	6411520	Meantime, one game that's not going to have Twitter support, but it will have support
6411520	6416160	for your balance board is of course, Wii Fit Plus and a release date has been announced
6416160	6417560	for Wii Fit Plus.
6417560	6419840	It's coming out on October 4th.
6419840	6422040	Here's the great thing about Wii Fit Plus.
6422040	6425440	Remember how a lot of us were thinking that on Nintendo's just going to price gouge on
6425440	6426440	this and that?
6426440	6427440	Nope.
6427440	6431320	It's going to cost $20 Wii Fit Plus is only going to set you back $20.
6431320	6434480	Now keep in mind that's if you already have a balance board.
6434480	6437960	So they figure if you have a balance board, then they got to once already with Wii Fit
6437960	6439680	because they don't sell a balance board separately.
6439680	6440680	Do they?
6440680	6446560	So, but so they're, and they're going to get rid of the skew that is the Wii Fit with the
6446560	6447560	balance board.
6447560	6451200	Now you will only be able to buy Wii Fit Plus with the balance board, but I guess the good
6451200	6454160	news, the silver lining is that, you know, for those of you that just want to upgrade
6454160	6457560	because there are some new games, there are some new things with this, it's only going
6457560	6459120	to cost you $20.
6459120	6460120	Good news.
6460120	6461120	Bad news.
6461120	6462120	Loki.
6462120	6464380	The bad news, which you forgot to mention was now they also raised the price of that
6464380	6466480	bundle by $10.
6466480	6467480	Sorry about that.
6467480	6469560	And that'll be $99.99 for that bundle.
6469560	6473800	So if you didn't get in on the ground floor of Wii Fit, which I'm going to tell you this
6473800	6477720	much, if you didn't get in on the ground floor of that, you're not missing out.
6477720	6478720	Seriously.
6478720	6483860	And you know, if you're dumb enough to buy the game by itself, no offense, but like it's
6483860	6485400	almost the same game again.
6485400	6487360	I don't know why you'd buy the same game again.
6487360	6491320	Because there are some extra things that some of the little mini games were kind of cute.
6491320	6497000	I mean, you know, if you're going to buy that Wii Play or whatever, you know, you spend
6497000	6500120	an extra $10 to get Wii Play and none of those games are good.
6500120	6501120	Right?
6501120	6502120	I don't know.
6502120	6503120	Whatever.
6503120	6510000	I mean, I don't know, see, I don't think the same way issue about Wii Fit.
6510000	6515560	Like I get the point behind Wii Fit and I actually kind of like it.
6515560	6521880	I think if you actually make it a point to play the game every day and you know, some
6521880	6524400	exercise is better than none.
6524400	6527600	You know, granted, it's not the best thing you could be doing.
6527600	6533920	You could be lifting weights or you could be running or jogging, but you know, if it's
6533920	6537080	kind of a nice meet you in the middle type of thing and I think that's what Wii Fit's
6537080	6538080	always been about.
6538080	6539080	Right?
6539080	6540080	I guess.
6540080	6546000	It's trying to make exercising more fun for kids and non-kids who are just not as motivated.
6546000	6548720	They should just have you bench press the board and make it way more...
6548720	6554760	I'll have to put D cell batteries in it to make it a little heavier.
6554760	6557160	No, just put in big ol' 9 volts.
6557160	6558160	I don't know.
6558160	6559480	I'm actually considering picking out...
6559480	6560760	It's only $20.
6560760	6562160	That's not that bad considering...
6562160	6565280	Is this supposed to have some internet stuff too where you're gonna be able to pair with
6565280	6566280	friends around the globe?
6566280	6567280	Just wait for the peer use.
6567280	6568280	I'm sure it will.
6568280	6569280	All right.
6569280	6570280	Fine.
6570280	6571280	Maybe I'll do that.
6571280	6572280	We'll see.
6572280	6576380	Takeo Ray in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, my friend's aunt lost 40 pounds using
6576380	6577380	Wii Fit.
6577380	6578880	She was just by it.
6578880	6582980	Lumi's in chat says, it's all about your diet and how consistent you are.
6582980	6587160	That's kind of true too is that you can't expect that you play Wii Fit by itself for
6587160	6590260	like 10 minutes a day and that anything major is gonna happen.
6590260	6593960	It kind of has to be part of a greater lifestyle adjustment.
6593960	6594960	And that's why...
6594960	6599800	And I also noticed that xlink in chat says, I'll play my EA Active.
6599800	6605040	One thing about EA Active is that EA Active kind of encourages you as well to be eating
6605040	6606440	and doing other stuff.
6606440	6613160	Any exercises besides just EA Active, I don't think it implements it very well, but at least
6613160	6616560	it kind of makes it a point to emphasize that as a part of the game as well.
6616560	6617560	Yeah.
6617560	6620800	Cause I mean, it's, you can't just do one or I mean, you could do one or the other,
6620800	6622640	but they're more effective done together.
6622640	6627040	I'll tell you what I mean, to be honest, I think one website I think has been very good
6627040	6628420	for this.
6628420	6632740	You know, when I was kind of trying to lose weight and I still am to an extent, one website
6632740	6637000	I found that I really enjoyed was Spark People, which is actually a pretty good website where
6637000	6642080	you can monitor your food intake and you monitor your exercise and how many glasses of water
6642080	6643080	you drink a day.
6643080	6644080	The day does that too.
6644080	6645080	And everything.
6645080	6646760	I just, I really liked the way Spark People was set up.
6646760	6650520	So I, and it has an iPhone app, which was the other big thing about that that was cool.
6650520	6655840	So I would definitely recommend that as a part of your diet if you're going to start
6655840	6659180	Wii Fit or what have you, because you can actually enter in, Hey, I did 40 minutes of
6659180	6661700	Wii Fit and it'll count that as calories burned.
6661700	6664480	So it's a really nice way to incorporate something like that into your diet.
6664480	6665480	That's cool.
6665480	6669500	I think Wii Fit may be great for people who don't like to exercise in public.
6669500	6671680	I think for some people don't like to do that.
6671680	6672680	That makes sense.
6672680	6674080	No, that makes perfect sense.
6674080	6676680	I know a lot of people like that.
6676680	6677800	I'm kind of one of them.
6677800	6678800	Like I'll go out and run.
6678800	6683400	I'm not a gym person at all, but I know I have a, I have a friend really, really trying
6683400	6684400	to get me to go to the gym.
6684400	6685400	I'm kind of on the fence.
6685400	6687400	I'm like, I don't know.
6687400	6691520	I don't mind going to the gym, but I usually hide myself in the weight room and, and you
6691520	6696000	know, which is sometimes kind of really nerve wracking, especially when you have all the
6696000	6697000	guys there.
6697000	6699520	Not that I have a problem with all the guys there or anything.
6699520	6703880	It's just that I don't like going, you know, with, with all the guys there.
6703880	6704880	Not ever.
6704880	6705880	Yeah.
6705880	6708480	And it's probably there's some people that listen to us like, come on you pussies.
6708480	6709760	But I, I can't explain it.
6709760	6710760	It's just.
6710760	6714520	Well, if I'm the only girl there and there's like 10 guys that just got off the basketball
6714520	6717440	court all pumping away, so I'm like, uh, yeah, bye.
6717440	6718440	All right.
6718440	6720120	Let's move on with some more news.
6720120	6722680	Y'all I could take them.
6722680	6723680	Bench press them.
6723680	6724680	They'll cry.
6724680	6726680	Um, Sony has a stupid idea.
6726680	6728880	They've had a lot of stupid ideas.
6728880	6729880	This is really stupid.
6729880	6733480	And by stupid, I mean stupid.
6733480	6738600	Um, they're doing a reality TV show.
6738600	6739600	Yeah.
6739600	6741680	I laughed when I saw this.
6741680	6743240	Isn't that kind of all the rage right now?
6743240	6744240	I mean.
6744240	6745240	That's stupid.
6745240	6746920	Reality TV is ass.
6746920	6755160	Um, so basically it's got a gaming related reality TV show called the tester.
6755160	6762080	That's going to be a PSN later in the year where the, uh, people in it can, uh, play
6762080	6768960	some different, um, elimination challenges so, uh, they can see, you know, who has the
6768960	6774960	best mental, you know, physical, their best, uh, knowledge too.
6774960	6779760	And then, um, they get a job as a game tester with, um, the PlayStation QA department in
6779760	6781840	San Diego.
6781840	6782840	Here's the thing.
6782840	6784440	I am feel completely different from Jamie.
6784440	6786640	I don't think all reality TV is trash.
6786640	6787640	You watch big brother.
6787640	6788760	I think some of it is trash.
6788760	6792080	Well, I like reality shows that are basically modern game shows.
6792080	6796920	Like, you know, in my opinion, big brother is a game show as is survivor is a game show
6796920	6797920	of sorts.
6797920	6799800	And I've always liked game shows of all different types.
6799800	6802080	So I, I'm not bothered by those shows.
6802080	6806840	And even to an extent I can tolerate some of those like VH1 and Bravo shows like project
6806840	6808840	runway is pretty good too.
6808840	6812200	And some of that project runway though is more like a design contest.
6812200	6816120	Well, see, but now you see, you can't, you can't say you hate reality shows and then
6816120	6817320	say, but, but this one's okay.
6817320	6820640	Well, this to me though is like, what was the Trump one?
6820640	6824120	Um, the apprentice, I hated that show.
6824120	6828240	See, the apprentice is okay, but my biggest problem with it is that it basically came
6828240	6831600	down to one dude's opinion, you know, and I think it would have been better if there
6831600	6832600	was a board.
6832600	6834680	But anyway, I don't want to get into diagnosing all these reality shows.
6834680	6840820	What I don't like is like this VH1 is getting so saturated with these shows.
6840820	6844920	Like I turned on the other day, it was like the Terrell Owens reality show or something.
6844920	6847840	I'm like, really, really no.
6847840	6852120	And there's just a lot of these types of shows, like the dating shows too much, too much.
6852120	6853880	Give me back my own reality.
6853880	6855520	I want, I want sitcoms.
6855520	6856520	Okay.
6856520	6861440	Here's the funniest part about this reality show is we've known game testers and it's
6861440	6863360	not as glamorous as you would think.
6863360	6868080	That's what I actually wanted to get to is that the prize here, I hate to say it is not
6868080	6869080	very good.
6869080	6873720	Like, and no offense to the game testers I know out there, a lot of you work very hard
6873720	6875600	for very little money.
6875600	6880120	And that's why I don't understand this whole glamorization of the gaming testing.
6880120	6884120	Like it's this really like gaming testing again, it's not that hard to get into.
6884120	6887660	I don't think here's what's going to have to be offended, but it's kind of an entry
6887660	6888660	level position.
6888660	6890640	It's how you get your foot in the door at gaming companies.
6890640	6893840	But a lot of people take that and work up to something a lot bigger.
6893840	6896520	Shouldn't a prize on a reality game show be something bigger?
6896520	6899440	See, here's what I think is going to happen is that the person's going to play all these
6899440	6902520	really cool challenge things that come out and, oh yeah.
6902520	6903520	Which are all Sony games.
6903520	6905840	But they're going to be all like, yeah, I'm into it.
6905840	6906840	Yeah, this is fun.
6906840	6908240	Yeah, I win.
6908240	6910200	I have to work.
6910200	6912200	I have to show up for my job.
6912200	6916920	You want me to test a cow milking game?
6916920	6917920	You know what this is going to be?
6917920	6919400	This is just going to be a holiday tie in.
6919400	6921240	It's going to be a free download on PlayStation Network.
6921240	6925600	This is going to be product placement after product placement of all these Sony upcoming
6925600	6926600	games.
6926600	6927760	I don't think it's a terrible idea.
6927760	6929640	I mean, especially if it's a free show.
6929640	6930640	Hey.
6930640	6931640	I'll enter.
6931640	6932640	How about that?
6932640	6933640	Why don't I enter?
6933640	6934640	You want to enter?
6934640	6937400	I can't quit my day job, but if you want to enter and move to San Diego, good luck with
6937400	6938400	that.
6938400	6939400	No, thanks.
6939400	6942400	I don't want to move to San Diego to test games for like eight bucks an hour.
6942400	6945400	I like San Diego, but I sure as hell don't want to live there.
6945400	6948040	I hope somebody from OLR wins it.
6948040	6952840	If you want to do it, it might be a pretty awesome way to get exposure, but I don't know.
6952840	6953840	Yeah.
6953840	6954840	I'm kind of with Loki.
6954840	6960560	The prize is not that awesome, but I don't think this show is really about giving someone
6960560	6962480	a once in a lifetime dream opportunity.
6962480	6965960	I think the show is going to be nothing but nonstop product placement for holiday Sony
6965960	6969200	games, but granted, it's a pretty clever way to do it.
6969200	6970200	Patty said something funny.
6970200	6971200	Uh, Giovedea in chat.
6971200	6972200	Yeah.
6972200	6973200	That's what I was...
6973200	6974200	Yeah.
6974200	6975200	Go ahead and read it.
6975200	6976200	Oh.
6976200	6980520	I'm on reality TV, life with my grandma.
6980520	6983600	I just don't know how compelling that would be.
6983600	6987920	Unless your grandma like competes in the X games, then I would watch a show like that.
6987920	6990320	Or she was like a serial killer grandma.
6990320	6991320	Yes.
6991320	6992320	All right.
6992320	6993320	So...
6993320	6995520	I would watch a show called Serial Killer Grandma.
6995520	6998240	Do they have that on Discovery Channel?
6998240	6999960	I don't know.
6999960	7003820	I will check out an episode of this and see if it's any good, but I just kind of have
7003820	7007280	a feeling it's just going to be product placement and trailers I can download somewhere else
7007280	7008760	on PlayStation Network.
7008760	7010680	But we'll see.
7010680	7017480	Something that this winner might be testing out is the brand new 3D support for the PlayStation
7017480	7018480	3.
7018480	7022920	Now, this is kind of...
7022920	7024920	I don't know.
7024920	7029920	It's neat, but at the same time, it's not that special because in order for you to be
7029920	7036920	able to use it, you need one of those brand new TVs that can refresh at over 200 hertz.
7036920	7042220	So that is a problem, and not a lot of people have those TVs right now.
7042220	7047720	But if you happen to do, and you have the special stereoscopic glasses for that, then
7047720	7049760	you can actually play some of the games.
7049760	7054320	One of them, of course, Wipeout in 3D, and that'll be coming out in 2010.
7054320	7057360	I know, actually, sooner than that, they're going to be doing that with Avatar.
7057360	7063280	But once again, you need that really high-end TV, and right now, there's maybe five different
7063280	7069440	TVs out there that have that kind of feature for them.
7069440	7071280	You think this might be the future of gaming, though?
7071280	7074840	Because when we see things like this, I kind of go, okay, well, maybe it's for a certain
7074840	7077360	group of people right now, but could it be the future of gaming?
7077360	7080560	It's cutting edge, yes, but it might be too cutting edge.
7080560	7084940	It's too early because people aren't going to upgrade their TV just to get one of these
7084940	7089480	TVs that does 200Hz until they start coming out with a lot of 3D movies and stuff, and
7089480	7091360	this stuff comes out at a price.
7091360	7097200	But right now, I guess they can claim that they were the first to do this, or something.
7097200	7099920	I don't know.
7099920	7102360	But actually, they can't claim they were the first to do this, because now that I think
7102360	7107040	of it, because if Avatar's coming out on both the 360 and PS3, then they will be doing it
7107040	7108040	at the same time.
7108040	7111120	Wasn't like Rad Racer on the NES in 3D?
7111120	7115440	Yeah, but that was with those red-blue glasses.
7115440	7117840	Wasn't the Virtual Boy in 3D?
7117840	7119440	The amazing migraine machine?
7119440	7126800	Yeah, see, that was actually true 3D, but this, though, yeah, I don't know.
7126800	7128000	It's a neat thing, but it's-
7128000	7130600	I kind of don't want to see gaming go all 3D like this.
7130600	7135280	Like, I went and saw Up in 3D, which, don't get me wrong, great movie, had a great time,
7135280	7140400	but I kind of had a little bit of a headache after it for watching that for like 90 minutes.
7140400	7143200	And even though they say you're supposed to take a break every hour when you play video
7143200	7145120	games, you guys know that's not how it goes.
7145120	7146120	No.
7146120	7147120	You'll sit there and play a video game for four hours.
7147120	7148120	Okay, like-
7148120	7149120	Until you gotta pee.
7149120	7150680	Yeah, or I need to eat.
7150680	7154280	But if I sit there with those 3D glasses on playing, like, I don't know, I think I saw
7154280	7159540	some demo online, like Wipeout HD was being presented in 3D glasses, I bet that looks
7159540	7162880	fucking awesome, because Wipeout HD already looks fucking awesome.
7162880	7163880	It's just-
7163880	7165120	But I would have a headache after four hours.
7165120	7168160	Well, it's just, you know, they're gonna be starting to support more of this stuff.
7168160	7171920	It's just like why games now are 5-1 Dolby, you know?
7171920	7177680	And HD and all that stuff, it's just because people, it's the progression that's gonna
7177680	7178680	go in.
7178680	7183320	I mean, that's what their push is for cinema right now is more 3D, and, you know, eventually
7183320	7185640	that's gonna move to the home market.
7185640	7190120	So it makes sense that games are gonna go in that direction, especially since, you know,
7190120	7194720	hey, 3D might come in handy when like Project Intel comes out, or, you know, these games
7194720	7199480	are gonna be using the Sony motion capture thing that they're gonna have, you know?
7199480	7205520	You might need to see stuff in 3D space in that sense, but I don't know, it's not cheap
7205520	7206520	right now, though.
7206520	7210760	Like, if you wanna buy a monitor for your PC and, you know, the stereoscopic glasses,
7210760	7213280	it's gonna set you back $500.
7213280	7216480	I mean, that's pretty cheap, you know, compared to an HGTV.
7216480	7218720	Yeah, but technology's gonna come down in price eventually.
7218720	7219720	Exactly, it will.
7219720	7226960	You know, remember when HGTVDs, or sorry, H, I just, I can't talk anymore, HGTVs, remember
7226960	7232520	when those were like thousands of dollars to get an HGTV, and now, like, this Christmas,
7232520	7235920	I think you're gonna see those flying off the shelves, yeah.
7235920	7236920	Remember the big deal?
7236920	7237920	They were like $5,000.
7237920	7239920	Ooh, I have 2DX and a WEGA.
7239920	7240920	Yeah.
7240920	7242200	Well, a lot of that was faux HD, too.
7242200	7247720	A lot of those WEGAs didn't even really do HD, but yeah, I mean, technology's gonna come
7247720	7248720	down in price.
7248720	7249720	It just does, right?
7249720	7250720	Yeah.
7250720	7251720	I don't know, but...
7251720	7256960	And if it doesn't, it kills the thing, too, you know.
7256960	7258840	That's right, because, you know, not everybody's rich.
7258840	7259840	Yeah.
7259840	7261240	Something to keep in mind.
7261240	7264720	I wanna go back to our chatroom, chat.orangelandrader.com, and read some comments.
7264720	7268720	There was a comment on the last story about the whole reality television from Salacious
7268720	7269720	Pop.
7269720	7270720	Hi there.
7270720	7274880	Says, if I recall correctly, the Penny Arcade guys were doing something reality-based at
7274880	7275960	Penny Arcade Expo.
7275960	7280760	I don't know if it's a mini-doc for the DVD or a standalone thing or what.
7280760	7285360	Jamie, being a person that hates all reality television, would you hate a Penny Arcade
7285360	7287400	documentary as well?
7287400	7290420	There's a difference between a reality TV show and a documentary.
7290420	7291420	Is there?
7291420	7292560	Yes.
7292560	7294200	What is the difference?
7294200	7297780	The documentary being that it's set for an informative purpose.
7297780	7300760	Its purpose is not necessarily entertainment.
7300760	7305840	It is to give you the information regarding a particular situation, a historical event,
7305840	7306840	for an individual.
7306840	7309000	Couldn't a documentary be entertaining?
7309000	7310440	Like, depending on where you are.
7310440	7314160	That's why I said, not necessarily just for entertainment.
7314160	7318600	Reality TV is supposed to be, oh, here's your slice of how other people live.
7318600	7324560	You know, like, for example, if you took a documentary to Somalia to see about, you know,
7324560	7333680	the results of the war and their own little mafia thing going on there, and you get unfiltered
7333680	7340000	information, or if it's filtered, it's just to make it, you know, slightly more palatable,
7340000	7341780	but it's not scripted.
7341780	7343940	This is what's going on.
7343940	7346160	It's inquisitive.
7346160	7347480	It's editorial.
7347480	7349520	This is what is going on.
7349520	7353400	Whereas reality TV is, in the end, a manufactured reality.
7353400	7357080	All right, fine.
7357080	7358720	I just was kind of curious.
7358720	7365440	I don't think that's a pretty, pretty definite, you know, definition.
7365440	7370760	It's the purpose between having, this is actually what's happening versus, well, this is what
7370760	7372160	we want you to see happening.
7372160	7373520	This is a made up reality.
7373520	7378080	These people auditioned to be in our version of real life.
7378080	7380720	You know what that has me kind of thinking about, though, is that, you know, I bet there
7380720	7383640	would be a lot of people that would be interested in watching something like that, kind of a
7383640	7387440	behind the scenes thing at PAX, and even though, you know, it was commented that it's probably
7387440	7392080	going to be for a DVD, wouldn't it be kind of neat if this was a downloadable exclusive
7392080	7396080	on PlayStation Network or Xbox 360, I know has done a lot of work with Penny Arcade?
7396080	7397080	I think that'd be cool.
7397080	7399680	Or even like, you know what might be a really cool tie in?
7399680	7402900	Have it be something that's on Xbox 360 Netflix.
7402900	7406840	Put it on Netflix as an instant queue title, and then people could watch it.
7406840	7408720	I think that would be worthwhile.
7408720	7409720	That'd be pretty cool.
7409720	7412960	See, like, I think that is something that if PlayStation Network is going to make up
7412960	7416660	this reality show or whatever, that should also be an avenue that they should think about
7416660	7421040	doing is, you know, maybe, or maybe Microsoft will beat them to the punch, who knows, is
7421040	7427020	creating these shows about, like, behind the scenes development of games or fandom, I guess
7427020	7431600	you could say in this case, or, you know, Expos, whatever it is, kind of, you know,
7431600	7432600	gamer documentaries.
7432600	7436480	Well, it was like what I was watching today, Dan, because, you know, my, pretty much my
7436480	7439480	favorite type of sports car is the Bugatti Veyron, right?
7439480	7445080	Well, Dan was showing me the video for Forza 2 about how they got the Bugatti license,
7445080	7452440	and, you know, were mapping out the car, how it was done, the meat of how they, you know,
7452440	7454560	put the car in the game.
7454560	7456160	That type of stuff is always interesting to me.
7456160	7458560	Like, I love behind the scenes stuff in movies.
7458560	7462040	I like watching the how they do that type thing, you know.
7462040	7465080	I did love watching Ripley's Believe It or Not.
7465080	7466600	You know what I love?
7466600	7467880	Unwrapped on the Food Network.
7467880	7469200	Now, that's a documentary.
7469200	7470200	I don't have Food Network.
7470200	7471760	Hosted by the one and only Mark Summers.
7471760	7474040	Loki, am I right or am I right?
7474040	7475040	It is a documentary.
7475040	7481080	I don't know if it's like, oh my god, awesome, but, you know, it's interesting.
7481080	7484280	It's what we watch to kill time for something else to watch.
7484280	7485280	Haters.
7485280	7487200	Hey, I don't hate it.
7487200	7488560	I just don't love it.
7488560	7492380	Like, especially when you've seen, like, the same episode over and over, they start reusing
7492380	7494680	some of their, you know, segments on other episodes.
7494680	7495680	I'll give you that.
7495680	7496680	I'll give you that.
7496680	7497680	They do need to make some new stuff.
7497680	7499360	Like, this episode's the stuff that's packaged in plastic.
7499360	7501200	Oh, this episode's about baskets.
7501200	7504320	So, this episode's about Cheez Whiz.
7504320	7505680	It's like, I don't care.
7505680	7507480	No, there was an episode on Cheez Whiz?
7507480	7509680	No, there was not an episode on Cheez Whiz.
7509680	7513800	But there's been, like, three episodes about picnics and there's, like, you know, they
7513800	7515440	show how they make picnic baskets.
7515440	7516440	I don't care.
7516440	7517440	It has nothing to do with food.
7517440	7520280	A picnic basket?
7520280	7523760	What about those little, don't they call those picnics, those little potato fried things
7523760	7525480	you can buy in the, forget it?
7525480	7532040	You know what is a weird show that's kind of along the lines of Unwrapped is how it's
7532040	7533480	made or something like that?
7533480	7535760	And they have, like, the most random stuff, like, put together.
7535760	7540720	It's like, this episode you're gonna learn how they make galvanized steel, doorknobs,
7540720	7544600	that's great, bowling balls, and mayonnaise.
7544600	7546680	It's like, what the fuck is that?
7546680	7549480	I mean, it's like, it's so random.
7549480	7551120	It's like, ooh, steel!
7551120	7552120	Oh, doorknobs.
7552120	7553120	I'm sorry.
7553120	7556920	When I was just out of high school, though, there was a show that they used to come on,
7556920	7560000	and I don't think, I think this was, you know, before the day of the Food Network, they used
7560000	7563720	to come on where they would show you how to make snacks that you buy in the grocery store,
7563720	7566560	like, they showed how to make Twinkies.
7566560	7572840	Twinkies will always and forever make me think about the tournament we did, the DDR and Beat
7572840	7575160	Mania 2DX tournament we did at Scandia.
7575160	7579120	It was called the Sacramento Hosts Another Fabulous Tournament, or we called it Behind
7579120	7580840	the Scenes Another Fucking Tournament.
7580840	7582720	It was SHAFT for short.
7582720	7586920	And it was great, but it was better than SCAT before it.
7586920	7593440	You have to remember, when our buddy Keith worked at Scandia, we could, we ran that fucking
7593440	7597560	joint when we wanted to do a tournament, and we did the most random things.
7597560	7601880	I know the employees there must have hated us, and so did all the customers, which is
7601880	7602880	part of the reason why that worked.
7602880	7603880	But we stayed and helped clean up.
7603880	7604880	We did.
7604880	7605880	We did.
7605880	7607640	No, we did a really awesome tournament there and probably brought up some new business,
7607640	7609220	but we did the most random stuff.
7609220	7614120	We turned the birthday party room into a station where you could buy fried Twinkies.
7614120	7615360	Yes, we did.
7615360	7616800	Deep fried Twinkies.
7616800	7619200	What the hell that has to do with the OBS?
7619200	7620920	I don't know.
7620920	7621920	That was Irene.
7621920	7622920	Yeah, I know.
7622920	7627400	That was Irene and Justin B., who now does all these remixes that are popular on YouTube.
7627400	7628400	Who knew?
7628400	7629720	And all this stuff.
7629720	7636840	Keep in mind, though, that we also had, the tournament before that had a cosplay event.
7636840	7639320	It was Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.
7639320	7640320	Yeah, SCAT.
7640320	7641320	Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.
7641320	7642320	I remember that.
7642320	7643320	It was SCAT.
7643320	7644400	It was awesome.
7644400	7645400	We need to...
7645400	7648880	See, if we were to have like an OLR con or something, it just needs to be like fucking
7648880	7651960	random like that, where we have a fried Twinkie station.
7651960	7654080	We should just have random con.
7654080	7657800	Loki presents the Baconator station or something.
7657800	7660480	I'm telling you, listen, hold on, hold on.
7660480	7664680	We are seriously kicking around an idea of doing an all-bacon party for my birthday.
7664680	7665680	I'm serious.
7665680	7667160	Didn't your birthday already happen?
7667160	7668160	I don't know.
7668160	7669160	It's coming up.
7669160	7670160	Next Friday.
7670160	7671160	Oh, you should do it.
7671160	7672160	Well, we're thinking about it.
7672160	7673400	Have some bacon fried bacon.
7673400	7675360	We're not bacon frying bacon.
7675360	7676640	That's just redundant.
7676640	7677640	All right.
7677640	7678640	Look, look.
7678640	7681760	I want to get to some more comments because we had some funny stuff on Unwrapped.
7681760	7683720	We had two fans of Unwrapped in chat.
7683720	7686280	Takeo Ray says, Unwrapped is the best show on Food Network.
7686280	7688120	Act Def says, Unwrapped is awesome.
7688120	7692080	Salacious Pop says, That show makes me lol because I'm like, oh, go jump in some Gak
7692080	7693400	Mark summers.
7693400	7694400	He couldn't.
7694400	7697040	He would have a, he's got that whole OCD thing going on.
7697040	7698040	That's right.
7698040	7699440	Did you see those documentaries about double dairy?
7699440	7700440	It scared him.
7700440	7706120	Well, yeah, because, because he, he's, um, what, what type of phobia is it where you're
7706120	7708400	afraid of messes?
7708400	7713200	I thought it was a type of OCD that he had like a, like a clean cleanliness OCD.
7713200	7714200	Something like that.
7714200	7715880	Either that or he had like an actual phobia.
7715880	7716880	All right.
7716880	7719880	Rama in chat simply says, Fuck Unwrapped.
7719880	7720880	Good eats is better.
7720880	7722720	Alton Brown is, is pretty awesome.
7722720	7723720	All right.
7723720	7724720	I agree.
7724720	7725720	Good eats is better.
7725720	7726720	Enough food.
7726720	7727800	Let's get to emails.
7727800	7728960	You can't eat emails.
7728960	7732240	I'm sure if you could, Dark Sakura would have eaten one by now.
7732240	7733240	Nope.
7733240	7734240	Nope.
7734240	7735240	You're wrong.
7735240	7736240	I would have thrown them up.
7736240	7739200	You could print out emails on that paper that they use to print photos on a cake, then you
7739200	7741200	could eat emails.
7741200	7743960	That's true!
7743960	7748720	We need to have a contest where we eat somebody's email one night, live on air.
7748720	7750760	Have your email eaten by a cast member.
7750760	7752600	We don't have the printer for that.
7752600	7753600	We'd have to take it out.
7753600	7754600	How much does that cost?
7754600	7755600	I don't know.
7755600	7756600	Not that much.
7756600	7757600	Hm.
7757600	7758600	Haha.
7758600	7759600	Ugh.
7759600	7760600	You people are sick.
7760600	7761600	Mailbag!
7761600	7765600	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7765600	7768600	Dark Sakura, dive into the email bag and read us an email.
7768600	7770240	Um, what?
7770240	7771240	Okay.
7771240	7775720	The first one comes from Deathwishing, which is actually the last email I received.
7775720	7781680	I will have wrote, it's written, this message from a place called Howie's Game Shack.
7781680	7785120	Well, I went to Guitar Hero 5 and it is fucking amazing.
7785120	7787680	It's probably the best one in the franchise.
7787680	7788680	I know, right?
7788680	7789680	Weird.
7789680	7790680	But seriously, you gotta try it out.
7790680	7793720	Just skip Smash Hits Van Halen and Metallica and any other...
7793720	7794720	Whereid.
7794720	7796480	Or weird, I should say.
7796480	7798160	Cause he spelled it the same way twice.
7798160	7800000	Um, any other weird...
7800000	7802560	Whereid tie in games they will make.
7802560	7803560	Haha.
7803560	7804560	What is it?
7804560	7805560	Whereid tie.
7805560	7806560	Haha.
7806560	7808020	Cyber Cafe Love Deathwishing.
7808020	7810200	I think he meant weird tie in game.
7810200	7811200	So yeah.
7811200	7812200	Um.
7812200	7813200	Okay.
7813200	7816360	Thank you.
7816360	7817360	This comes from...
7817360	7819200	I think I've been to that place.
7819200	7820720	I was trying to look at Howie's Cyber...
7820720	7822320	I think I've been there.
7822320	7824560	I think I used the computers there once one time too.
7824560	7825560	That's kind of funny.
7825560	7827560	Um, this comes from...
7827560	7828560	One.
7828560	7831560	Yeah, we did use one of the Cyber Cafes on Hollywood Boulevard.
7831560	7834720	There was one in Koreatown that I think was it.
7834720	7835720	Anyway, sorry.
7835720	7836720	Sorry.
7836720	7837720	Hey, O.L.R.
7837720	7840480	I was looking on the net and I heard if you have a PSP Go and a PS3 you can pair up the
7840480	7845040	PS3 controller with a PSP Go to have dual analog sticks.
7845040	7854360	A half assed way to solve that problem analog nub and make you buy more stuff from them.
7854360	7855360	Problem Solved.
7855360	7856360	P.S.
7856360	7865640	I recently bought a UMD M1, oh a Umid A M1, a 4 inch netbook and it can play high def
7865640	7866640	games.
7866640	7870200	Now it looks stupid with the USB hub, external CD-ROM and a controller sticking out of it
7870200	7871640	but it is a good thing to know.
7871640	7872640	Bye.
7872640	7874940	Clearly that email was written on a PSP as well.
7874940	7879640	You can actually do that on a PSP, well any PSP actually right now because you can do
7879640	7885500	that with like I know Resistance Retribution that links up with the PS3 and you can use
7885500	7892360	your PSP Dual Shock or 6-axis to use dual analogs.
7892360	7895200	That's interesting because how many games really support that?
7895200	7896200	One.
7896200	7897200	One?
7897200	7902480	Well that feature isn't any good unless your PSP games actually support it but I guess
7902480	7904720	maybe it's a trend that will be starting.
7904720	7905720	And if you have a PS3 and you're near your PS3.
7905720	7909360	Hey but I was talking about earlier in the show there's a lot of hidden functionality
7909360	7915000	between the PS3 and the PSP that Sony does a really poor job at advertising that is very
7915000	7916000	cool.
7916000	7920640	They play in the PSP on your TV like if you did that dual shock thing you could put your
7920640	7925520	resistance game on your TV and then play with the dual shock controller.
7925520	7928280	I noticed Dark Sockers looking at a little thing for Diss it up.
7928280	7931040	I tried the download demo with that.
7931040	7933200	This is part of the soundtrack.
7933200	7934200	Is it?
7934200	7935200	Yeah.
7935200	7936640	I couldn't get a grasp on the game.
7936640	7938680	Like I just couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.
7938680	7939860	I just was button mashing.
7939860	7940860	Is that all the game is?
7940860	7941860	Button mashing with Final Fantasy characters?
7941860	7942860	No not exactly.
7942860	7943860	Really?
7943860	7944860	I couldn't figure out the strategy behind it.
7944860	7946000	I think the demo was set up very well.
7946000	7947880	It needed like a tutorial or something.
7947880	7949480	Or maybe I'm just stupid.
7949480	7950480	That's fine too.
7950480	7951480	Nah.
7951480	7952480	Alright anyhow.
7952480	7953480	Next email.
7953480	7954480	Hi!
7954480	7955480	Hi.
7955480	7956480	My name is Megan by the way.
7956480	7961520	I have been listening to your podcast for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.
7961520	7965360	I wanted to say I don't know why so many people are complaining about the cost of the PSP
7965360	7966360	Go.
7966360	7973160	I live in Toronto Canada and a PSP 3000 costs $167 and a 16 gigabyte memory stick costs
7973160	7977680	$139 so the PSP Go is a good deal for a new player.
7977680	7979440	Keep up the great work on your podcast.
7979440	7982000	A 6 gigabyte memory stick you said?
7982000	7983000	16.
7983000	7984720	I don't know.
7984720	7985720	You'd get the bundle.
7985720	7988560	I don't know how much it would cost Canadian but it can't be much more than it is here.
7988560	7991480	I just got a bundle because my old PSP was kind of dying so I actually just picked up
7991480	7993840	a PSP 3000 this week.
7993840	8000600	I bought a $199 bundle that came with the PSP 3000, a 4 gig memory stick, School of
8000600	8004800	Rock little codes you can use which whatever I don't really care for Jack Black but I'll
8004800	8008700	just download it because it was free and then Rock Band Unplugged all came with it.
8008700	8012040	So you know that wasn't a bad deal at all for the PSP 3000.
8012040	8018960	The problem is the PSP Go is what $50 cheaper than a PlayStation 3 is now and it's got less
8018960	8022960	features than a PSP 3000.
8022960	8023960	That's where the logic fails me.
8023960	8025640	If you're going to go PSP, go PSP 3000.
8025640	8032120	To be honest you can find memory sticks pretty cheap and here's the other thing too.
8032120	8035040	I don't know if you really need 16 gigabytes of storage.
8035040	8039040	Even if you're buying games on there, I don't think you need that.
8039040	8043880	When I was putting ISO's on there I didn't need that amount of space.
8043880	8049400	4 gigs at the most maybe and then how many games do you plan on storing on there?
8049400	8053640	Yeah they need 16 gigabytes on a PSP Go because that's all you can do is download stuff but
8053640	8056660	you're going to be playing a lot of your games off UMDs anyways.
8056660	8061340	There's really no reason to get the Go other than ooh look it slides.
8061340	8064720	By the way my comments on Final Fantasy Dissida kind of got the chat room talking about that
8064720	8065720	a little bit.
8065720	8069240	AlphaCananagram says the demo doesn't do it justice and he puts demo in caps.
8069240	8074160	GioVedeo says Dissida is fucking amazing I heart it and AlphaCananagram wants you to
8074160	8079160	know he is playing Dissida right now a level 100 onion knight on hardcore play mode.
8079160	8083440	I guess maybe I'll have to check out the full game at some point.
8083440	8089420	The last email and I'm kind of not going to say who it's coming from but he also didn't
8089420	8092080	say who he got it from.
8092080	8100480	It's an email that was sent out to Disney cast members about the acquisition of Marvel
8100480	8109240	Entertainment and just looking this over they're actually talking about here's what really
8109240	8110240	got me.
8110240	8114960	Marvel's business meshes perfectly with ours and what we've all been doing to maximize
8114960	8119840	the value of Disney's creative properties across our business media platforms and geographical
8119840	8125200	markets and then goes on to talk about Pixar and but here's the other line.
8125200	8130680	The acquisition of Marvel offers us a similar opportunity to advance that strategy meaning
8130680	8135400	putting out things all over the world for using it for marketing purposes.
8135400	8142520	So I am sort of maybe I'm reading a bit more into this but since they've been talking about
8142520	8148180	use of the Marvel brand and you know the consumer market I have a feeling we're going to start
8148180	8155040	seeing actual this was sent out to cast members meaning I think it's the park.
8155040	8161320	That means that we might start seeing characters in the parks and of course you know that's
8161320	8163400	also going to mean games.
8163400	8165160	It's going to mean movies.
8165160	8167920	It's going to mean more things that happen tomorrow.
8167920	8171960	Not tomorrow but I'm saying down the line let me put it this way that their licenses
8171960	8177120	are going to run into like 2015 2017 I mean it's that long.
8177120	8181280	You know what else is interesting in for some reason that the whole story about Disney buying
8181280	8184920	Marvel didn't make tonight show role but I'm sure everybody read about it somewhere on
8184920	8185920	the Internet.
8185920	8186920	You couldn't get away from it.
8186920	8190200	I thought it was very interesting about when that story hit is that you just saw all this
8190200	8195760	like freaking cross fanboy wank all over the Internet all at once about like OMG there's
8195760	8199800	going to be Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters and like all this stuff that ain't happening
8199800	8202160	as if Spider-Man was going to be in Toy Story 4.
8202160	8203160	No it's not.
8203160	8207280	I see that and I realize some of you might be making a joke but like seriously I heard
8207280	8211460	those jokes like 500 times this week all the that type of stuff and I don't think anything's
8211460	8212460	going to change overnight.
8212460	8217300	I mean I I kind of go back to Disney buying the Muppets like I realize it's a little different
8217300	8220280	because the Muppets were the Muppets a company.
8220280	8223040	I guess they were of some sort Jim Henson productions.
8223040	8225360	I guess it's a little different at the same time.
8225360	8227500	What changed with the Muppets.
8227500	8228760	Not a lot.
8228760	8231360	We got a cool 3D thing at Disneyland.
8231360	8234520	And so maybe we'll get a cool Marvel ride at California Adventure or whatever.
8234520	8236320	Maybe they'll bring back the 7th portal.
8236320	8237640	But it's going to be a while.
8237640	8239320	Doesn't Marvel have an agreement with other theme parks.
8239320	8240880	I know DC does.
8240880	8244840	DC is what you see all over Magic Mountain and the Six Flags.
8244840	8246800	I want to see the 7th portal come back.
8246800	8251400	Oh come on you went on that with me at Great America.
8251400	8256560	I just I just don't think it's going to be like I don't think Disney is going to mean
8256560	8259240	that Marvel is going to run the same way Disney does.
8259240	8260920	I just think a lot of people are jumping to conclusions.
8260920	8265000	Ronma also said Darkwing Duck and the Avengers Disney fund it.
8265000	8267680	And act up says the Incredibles versus Fantastic Four.
8267680	8269920	Oh this is the best salacious pop.
8269920	8273400	I'd be on board for a Deadpool Hannah Montana crossover.
8273400	8275600	See I would totally be down for that.
8275600	8276600	Come on.
8276600	8278480	Come on.
8278480	8280200	Not happening.
8280200	8281520	I would be so down for that.
8281520	8285880	Although hey the Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters is kind of a neat idea.
8285880	8287280	It's just not going to happen right away.
8287280	8291400	Well hell we don't even know when Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to happen if anytime soon.
8291400	8297320	So Ronma says Rob Roberts yeah but Disney already pulled the old budget cuts on one
8297320	8299160	of their publishing arms.
8299160	8303240	Well I hate to say it but that's kind of what happens sometimes when you know the businesses
8303240	8304240	consolidate.
8304240	8306200	But I don't know we'll see.
8306200	8309280	We'll see if the creativity is stifled at all.
8309280	8312680	I just I just think a lot of people are doom and glooming a little early.
8312680	8313680	We'll see.
8313680	8316280	Anyhow let's get into the FUs of the week.
8316280	8320320	It's a segment here on the show where we get a little ranty a little angsty.
8320320	8323120	We have some sand in places that we need to have removed.
8323120	8325040	So we do a little ranting here on the show.
8325040	8327640	It's something it's tradition we've done ever since episode one.
8327640	8342880	Don't ask just rant.
8342880	8345160	We don't really have anything to inspire the FUs tonight.
8345160	8349360	I don't have a story but what about that guy that said that video games were poison or
8349360	8350360	whatever.
8350360	8351680	We'll dedicate the FUs tonight to him.
8351680	8352680	The Gundam guy.
8352680	8354680	I had something actually.
8354680	8355680	Go for it.
8355680	8356680	Already.
8356680	8364760	You know they're supposed to be doing Obama's speech in public schools on the 8th.
8364760	8367600	I don't know how I feel about this whole political but okay go for it.
8367600	8371360	Well it's really it's an encouragement to stay in school.
8371360	8372360	That's what it is.
8372360	8375120	I think it's great that you know that this is going out.
8375120	8380640	It's a sign that you know our president does care about children instead of you know Bush
8380640	8384840	going how do you read.
8384840	8391320	But at the same time what really pisses me off are all those people who say oh well this
8391320	8396080	is going to interrupt my kids school day so I'm going to not let them go to school that
8396080	8399120	day.
8399120	8400120	That makes no sense.
8400120	8403960	It makes makes my brain go what.
8403960	8405960	Why what.
8405960	8409520	You know especially when all the schools are making arrangements for children who don't
8409520	8417920	want for parents who don't want their children to see the the the speech that the schools
8417920	8421760	are making arrangements for children who aren't going to be allowed to see it.
8421760	8428860	So I mean if you don't want to interrupt their education then why are you interrupting a
8428860	8434640	full day of education as opposed to seven hours of education I mean that that makes
8434640	8436120	no sense to me.
8436120	8439940	You people make no sense.
8439940	8444880	My whole thing with the people just need to stop thinking in one extreme or the other.
8444880	8449000	I bet you when all is said and done nobody is blue and nobody is red everybody's a little
8449000	8454600	bit purple and just I'm the whole like taking kids out of school as some type of political
8454600	8457200	statement or whatever is just too extreme.
8457200	8462480	They're saying that they're doing it not so that their education isn't interrupted but
8462480	8465440	they're interrupting their children's education that day.
8465440	8469400	It's just you need to have a better argument just come right out and say I'm a fucking
8469400	8475960	racist or I you know my brain's too thick and my children I don't want them to have
8475960	8477020	an open mind.
8477020	8479840	Why not encourage disagreeing with the president.
8479840	8480840	That's what this company is.
8480840	8484640	If you disagree with the speech encourage your children to watch the speech let your
8484640	8490080	children watch the speech and then talk about it you know be a fucking parent.
8490080	8494120	You know part of being a parent yeah true you have to make sure that your child's not
8494120	8498820	going to see anything harmful but at the same time you can't protect them from every damn
8498820	8501680	little thing that you don't want them to see.
8501680	8506360	That's what the real world is you know I've met people who've grown up sheltered and they're
8506360	8508360	frightening people.
8508360	8515640	I also think that these same people if it had been a different president would be calling
8515640	8518880	the same acts that they are doing right now an American.
8518880	8519880	You know what I mean?
8519880	8523100	Like I just have a bad feeling there's a lot of hypocrites out there.
8523100	8525840	So anyway let's get into the F.U.'s of the week.
8525840	8526840	So Dark Sakura.
8526840	8527840	That was my F.U.
8527840	8528840	That was your F.U.
8528840	8529840	All right there you go.
8529840	8531160	I just thought it was my F.U.
8531160	8533240	I thought that was the story that inspires the F.U.
8533240	8535680	That inspired my F.U. and it was my F.U.
8535680	8536680	Fair enough.
8536680	8541680	Thank you Rockstar for getting rid of my modded Grand Theft Auto games and it's absolutely
8541680	8545240	ruined the whole Grand Theft Auto experience to us.
8545240	8546240	But you know what?
8546240	8549960	I will find a way around it like I always do.
8549960	8552600	I'm going to say something that's a total inside joke.
8552600	8555760	There's maybe like two or three people that listening that would understand this.
8555760	8561360	But I'm just going to give a big F.U. this week to exclamation points.
8561360	8562880	That's all I'm going to say F.U.
8562880	8565160	Exclamation points.
8565160	8570920	Let's move on with a couple more gaming stories and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8570920	8576680	Well people like making a lot of fan videos for different games and Makima is pretty popular.
8576680	8582360	Well Naughty Dog has decided to show off what they've done to aid in that for Uncharted
8582360	8583640	2.
8583640	8590080	There's a lot of Makima tools available for you including the ability to actually green
8590080	8593960	screen the backgrounds with your characters in there so you can actually edit different
8593960	8595320	things in there.
8595320	8601320	And also the ability to sync up your voice with the player's mouth movements so it actually
8601320	8603400	makes it look like they're talking.
8603400	8608480	And yeah it's really really cool.
8608480	8612280	Apparently they do have an animation system I guess that's intelligent enough to turn
8612280	8618760	your audio stream into lip syncing for the on screen characters.
8618760	8624080	But I don't know I guess it's neat that they're offering all these things.
8624080	8628720	I wonder if we will actually see a lot of Makima videos for this.
8628720	8632480	That's kind of interesting when gaming companies kind of really embrace the whole Makima thing
8632480	8633480	you know.
8633480	8634480	Yeah.
8634480	8637800	That's what I liked about this story was that you know they're really kind of showing that
8637800	8642040	off and you know leaving it to people's creativity to make whatever they're going to make.
8642040	8644920	But it's really interesting how more and more gaming companies really embrace it.
8644920	8648880	But you know I mean obviously a lot of that stuff is just free promotion for the game
8648880	8649880	right.
8649880	8650880	Yeah exactly.
8650880	8652340	Well there you go.
8652340	8655840	One more story for you guys and then your phone calls.
8655840	8660320	There is a company that will be making a brand new console.
8660320	8667540	It's a company called Xtal Corporation or maybe Shtal Corporation I don't know X-T-A-L.
8667540	8671640	Actually their full name is Silicon Xtal Corporation.
8671640	8675880	They filed a trademark recently for the term sex box.
8675880	8681040	That's right sex box because this company they're going to be making a video game system
8681040	8686800	that only plays interactive adult only rated video game titles.
8686800	8688320	Hell yes.
8688320	8693960	By the way just so you know only about 20 adult only titles even exist right now.
8693960	8698200	One of them being Grand Theft Auto 4 after the whole debacle of hot coffee.
8698200	8701840	But most of them are just dumpy little PC games that happen to involve a lot of sex.
8701840	8702840	You mean Sandra's?
8702840	8703840	Yeah I'm sorry Sandra's.
8703840	8707880	Yeah that's what I meant sorry.
8707880	8714320	By the way as well as specializing in the adult only games the sex box will also give
8714320	8719440	its owners access to adult only content and entertainment and all sorts of other digital
8719440	8720440	forms.
8720440	8724440	I'm assuming this means like streaming movies and video and all that.
8724440	8730680	Video video HDTV DVD online gaming social networking webcams video on demand downloading
8730680	8738760	movie rentals purchases etc etc etc everything but real fucking will be included on this
8738760	8739760	sex box.
8739760	8742140	Only because the technology doesn't exist yet.
8742140	8743140	What do you think?
8743140	8744880	Loki you seem to be a big advocate for the sex box.
8744880	8747260	I mean is this something legit or is this TEEHEE?
8747260	8750520	I think the way they're going to approach it is going to be TEEHEE.
8750520	8756240	But I'm all about a system that will allow publishers assuming that they actually want
8756240	8761360	to put out stuff on this system the opportunity to put out games uncensored.
8761360	8764000	And yes we're probably going to see a lot of porno games that are probably going to
8764000	8768220	be crap but at the same time if they want to release a really fucking crazy version
8768220	8771160	of Manhunt 2 or something like that they can do it.
8771160	8776000	And you know I applaud that but at the same time I think it's going to be kind of lame.
8776000	8779740	However that being said assuming that the games on there look pretty decent I will probably
8779740	8787480	pick one of these up because it will be funny I can go hee hee I have a sex box.
8787480	8794680	You know what I'm all for I've gotten into this rant a long long time ago on this show
8794680	8800360	I'm all for sexier video games and all this and just downloading porn on your Playstation
8800360	8801360	3 and Xbox.
8801360	8804240	I understand why the companies don't want to open Pandora's box and that whole thing
8804240	8805880	but why not?
8805880	8810720	I mean it's just because we have this whole stigma in our society where the violence is
8810720	8816480	okay Manhunt 2 is okay in a lot of these games and the Saw movies are fine but heaven
8816480	8822640	forbid we show a cock or some bush and I'm not talking about a president on the television
8822640	8825400	you know it's just I'll never get it.
8825400	8829840	But granted how can you make a serious game out of sex?
8829840	8834080	I mean a lot of these AO games we've seen like the what the three feel and stuff those
8834080	8835720	were all a little silly.
8835720	8839360	Well they are a little silly but also some of the games do get an AO rating it's really
8839360	8844000	silly what they're getting it for and I would be fine to see legitimate games and just maybe
8844000	8848280	push they just you know push the boundaries a bit but at the same time I think a lot of
8848280	8852400	it's just gonna be like hey look now that we can do adult only content let's just put
8852400	8856960	boobs and tits everywhere and you know just like make lots of fucking everywhere and that's
8856960	8860800	it it's gonna be kind of gimmicky.
8860800	8866200	I hope they put some real time and investment into making like a serious game out of it
8866200	8870160	to just really wow everybody instead of all these cheap games that just have titties and
8870160	8873760	stuff like make like an epic fuck quest or something like that.
8873760	8878840	Not necessarily you know with you know sex but like over the top violence you know something
8878840	8883520	like absolutely crazy where you can just rip parts off of people and it's you know gruesomely
8883520	8885360	detailed and stuff like that.
8885360	8888560	I don't want violence I want cock and titty.
8888560	8890400	I like violence.
8890400	8891920	I like I want violence.
8891920	8897080	Fine you'll play a cock and a titty that goes around ripping you know limbs off of people
8897080	8901440	there you go or deke man in chat says rip parts off of people and fuck them with it
8901440	8907980	you know you're dirty make what is wrong with you a game called naked slayer huh naked slayer
8907980	8912480	you can play slayer you can play either a guy or girl you can choose you know whatever
8912480	8918000	their orientation is and they run around naked killing people that's like American Psycho
8918000	8921960	pretty much that's like seeing through a two or just golden golden axe was almost there
8921960	8928840	I mean those costumes golden axe didn't leave much to the imagination you know so um salacious
8928840	8932400	pop and chat says apparently they're still making leisure suit Larry games though Sierra
8932400	8935560	and the dude who originally made them have nothing to do with that and they're terrible
8935560	8940800	that's true uh in fact that last one was had an AO rated version and it was pretty bad
8940800	8943920	and they are making still a new one there's a new one right they have that magna cum laude
8943920	8947640	or whatever that was a little stupid and they have a new one coming out right I think I
8947640	8951520	remember hearing a story on that earlier they had a new one that came out a while ago that
8951520	8961120	was kind of eh I like that idea by salacious pop uh professor Layton goes to boner town
8961120	8967680	professor Layton Layton that's funny um you know the whole the whole social networking
8967680	8973800	thing though could be interesting I mean a lot of people really unleash their sexuality
8973800	8977940	when they're hiding behind a computer monitor and you might be able to find people that
8977940	8982320	are into the same freaky shit you might be into like for example let me think of a fetish
8982320	8985880	that not a lot of people are into that's not completely disgusting there's actually you
8985880	8992720	can actually um quote Patton Oswald on that huh talking about there's a magazine for that
8992720	8996040	you know for every fetish that you think is so dirty and awful there's a magazine about
8996040	9002240	it yeah piss drinkers oh god although I'm sure there's people into that so whatever
9002240	9005800	but I'm saying that that's like the perfect the perfect uh so that just reminded me I'm
9005800	9009160	trying to think of something that's not just like totally disgusting that I can use my
9009160	9015720	example okay here's one some people have a food fight fetish okay they want to have sex
9015720	9020600	after a food fight like getting like really dirty like just rubbing around and like yeah
9020600	9024920	I don't know like pies and and salads and stuff I don't know like we're gonna have a
9024920	9030480	food fight and then we're no one has a salad I've heard about this on the radio it's true
9030480	9033800	but here's the thing like if you have a food fight fetish or whatever like you could go
9033800	9039240	on to this like sex box console find somebody else with the same fetish as you and then
9039240	9046540	have some safe fun together that what's wrong with that as long as these consoles preach
9046540	9052420	safety and you know not things that are illegal like ripping parts off of dead people and
9052420	9058200	fucking them with them that's not legal but as long as this encourages save money legal
9058200	9063080	things within boundaries with consenting adults that have to prove that they are adults in
9063080	9072860	order to even be able to log into this service why not why not all right Leo Shannon chat
9072860	9076860	says Rob you should give angels feather a try it's basically a game with Final Fantasy

9095980	9106980	consequence of sex that's why you shower afterwards I don't know I'm just trying to think of something
9106980	9111800	that's not like drinking pee like Jamie suggested that's a bit much but if you're if that's
9111800	9116720	what you're into and both people consent then and your doctor says it's okay then have fun
9116720	9123040	it looks like that one of those dating sim type games there we go act-def people have

9211440	9217520	some key kooka right now just like uh had my first lighter my first heart cider um but
9217520	9222720	yeah i've just like been keeping up on what's been going on in packs especially the fact
9222720	9227620	that one of the one of the guys in xbox live you know had at the little quote unquote sermon
9227620	9232700	about the band hammer i actually caught on kataku earlier today i did not hear about
9232700	9238040	this tell us a little bit about it huh i didn't hear about this whole spiel what happened
9238040	9242640	there tell us a little bit about what happened i think it was basically one of the guys who
9242640	9247020	worked for microsoft or xbox live and his charter but maintaining order within there
9247020	9256020	and, you know, the one that wields a ban hammer, and he was basically just, basically, you know, giving a speech in the form of an actual, like, religious sermon,
9256020	9267020	and the way he was using, like, a lot of religious terms in terms of how he managed to wield the, you know, in other words, like, the name, like, the gamer tags,
9267020	9279020	and how, you know, they get banned, and then he's saying, like, but this guy is merciful, even though, you know, and he'll give you a second chance if you use any ban term in your gamer tag.
9279020	9286020	And then the other one, and then this other thing, hold on a sec, I already did it.
9286020	9287020	Oh, sure, we can hold.
9287020	9299020	But, yeah, he was basically saying stuff about, like, the, like, in Battlefield, where they were just, like, trying to, he was just preaching about how they were kicking certain other players.
9299020	9301020	It was basically some really, really religious stuff in PAX.
9301020	9309020	You know, PAX does manage to get some pretty kick-ass speeches, usually, and that is one thing I'm sad about missing in PAX this year.
9309020	9310020	All right.
9310020	9313020	All right, you gotta go, Zaku? You gotta get your hook on?
9313020	9314020	No, no, I'm still here.
9314020	9315020	Oh, okay.
9315020	9319020	No, no, I'm still here. I think we're about to head out, but I'm actually still good for talking.
9319020	9323020	All right, well, give us any final thoughts, quickly, because we do want to get some other calls.
9323020	9334020	Well, basically, I heard that the new WiiWare game, that Contra game, is, like, supposed to be really hard to tell, that you can't even, that you can't even get through.
9334020	9340020	I know it was already out in Japan earlier this year, but I figured that it might present a challenge to folks.
9340020	9342020	The original Contra was hard as hell.
9342020	9346020	Do you know anybody that can beat it without the up, up, down, down, left, right code?
9346020	9347020	Dan can.
9347020	9348020	Dan's a freak.
9348020	9354020	Basically, the way, I mean, from what I've seen, it's pretty much, it's a hard, I mean, it's pretty damn hard.
9354020	9363020	I mean, if you're going to be chugging away lives on Contra and the fact that it's, like, old-school classic Contra where you just, like, get your ass kicked after the first seconds without the code.
9363020	9376020	I mean, I'm already, I'm already talking right now with this other guy who's, like, really good in, like, you know, really deep in games and the fact that he managed to get Contra evolved a lot earlier than most of us did.
9376020	9378020	He got the Japanese version.
9378020	9386020	But even then, he's just, he's just chugging it off because he's, you know, he's pretty much a classic gamer in that sense.
9386020	9390020	So a challenge like that wouldn't be, it would be a no-brainer.
9390020	9394020	Weird that they haven't released that over here in the U.S. yet, though, but I guess soon enough.
9394020	9400020	I know, it's supposed to come out, actually, it's supposed to come out tomorrow, but it only came out in Europe.
9400020	9404020	I hope they dumbed it down for us Americans like they usually do.
9404020	9405020	What?
9405020	9410020	I said I hope they dumbed it down for the Americans like they usually do then and give us the 30 last words.
9410020	9416020	I heard the folks at Kotaku were complaining about the fact that it was, that it was pretty damn hard.
9416020	9417020	All right.
9417020	9420020	Well, Zaku, we gotta let you go. Have fun at the hookah bar.
9420020	9421020	All right.
9421020	9423020	Smoke one for us, all right?
9423020	9426020	Yes, I will. Have a good one. Have a good liberty.
9426020	9427020	All right.
9427020	9432020	See, you know what's interesting is I always tease Zaku for sounding like a stoner even though I don't really think he is.
9432020	9434020	I think he's told me like he's not.
9434020	9438020	But he actually, didn't he sound like really upbeat and happy tonight?
9438020	9441020	Like he didn't sound like so stoned calling us from the hookah bar.
9441020	9442020	I'm not surprised.
9442020	9443020	He sounded really happy and upbeat tonight.
9443020	9445020	Because he's at a hookah bar.
9445020	9446020	That's right. He's smoking up.
9446020	9448020	Light another one, dude.
9448020	9452020	Hookah bar does not get you high raw.
9452020	9453020	No, I know it doesn't.
9453020	9455020	However, it's really fun to blow smoke bubbles.
9455020	9457020	I know. I had hookah once.
9457020	9460020	Anyway, so back to the Data East collection here.
9460020	9462020	Some of the games are going to be included with it.
9462020	9472020	Magical Drop 3, Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, Burger Time, Caveman Ninja, Street Slam, and Secret Agent.
9472020	9474020	Too many ninjas as if there was such a thing.
9474020	9475020	Yeah.
9475020	9479020	So, I don't know. It's pretty awesome.
9479020	9481020	Alright, let's go to another call.
9481020	9483020	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9483020	9486020	Hey, I'm DS Master 25.
9486020	9489020	Hi, DS Master 25. What is on your mind?
9489020	9493020	Oh, I'm 26 because I aged.
9493020	9495020	But, oh well.
9495020	9502020	Basically, the whole, I've been playing a whole lot of old school titles.
9502020	9503020	Like what?
9503020	9504020	For the past few weeks now.
9504020	9513020	I've been trying my best at trying to beat Contra for the Super C.
9513020	9515020	For the Super NES.
9515020	9518020	And, I swear to you.
9518020	9519020	Hold on.
9519020	9520020	Hold on.
9520020	9523020	What is with all the Contra revival tonight?
9523020	9525020	Like, that's two Contra calls in a row.
9525020	9527020	That is some strange anomaly.
9527020	9528020	It's a rite of passage, Rob.
9528020	9529020	I don't understand.
9529020	9532020	For the life of any young gamer, the rite of passage is making it through Contra.
9532020	9536020	Don't get me wrong. Super C on the Super Nintendo was badass.
9536020	9539020	And, everybody should play it once. Those Mode 7 stages were pretty awesome.
9539020	9543020	But, I just find it very strange. We've had two calls about Contra back to back.
9543020	9546020	Is every caller going to ask about Contra tonight?
9546020	9547020	No, I don't know.
9547020	9549020	It's not just Contra I've been playing.
9549020	9560020	But, also, this homebrew version of DDR for the Nintendo DS I came across called DS DS Revolution.
9560020	9563020	Well, I would hope you don't dance on your DS. You might break it.
9563020	9566020	No, it's like...
9566020	9570020	Did you guys ever come across, like, the old Game Boy?
9570020	9575020	Yeah, I played the Game Boy Color ones. They were hideous.
9575020	9579020	It was just a way to memorize step charts on the go. That's really the only reason I have it.
9579020	9582020	Well, basically, okay.
9582020	9589020	The controls came to do multiple arrows and everything with using A and B for the up and right arrows.
9589020	9596020	Apparently, DS DS Revolution seems to do the same exact thing, which is weird.
9596020	9602020	And, of course, I got the new R4i so I can play my homebrew stuff on my DSi.
9602020	9608020	And, I'll say here, it sounds a whole lot better than it did on my DS Lite.
9608020	9616020	But, other than that, I've mostly been trying to play some of my old Genesis games.
9616020	9620020	My Genesis doesn't work anymore. Which sucks.
9620020	9622020	What was that on Genesis?
9622020	9626020	My Genesis does not work anymore. Period.
9626020	9633020	Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, get that freaking collection on the 360 or PS3. It's amazing. There's, like, tons of games on it.
9633020	9642020	No, but here's the cool thing, though. Because I found a really easy to use, easy to install emulator for the Nintendo DS,
9642020	9648020	I've been using that now. Because I also had the thought of trying to play Genesis games on the go.
9648020	9657020	And most of my collection was as follows. Outrun, King of Fighters, I had Monopoly, but the emulator does not run.
9657020	9664020	Look, I'm just saying, if you want to do it legitimately, the Mega collection's not a bad deal. But anyway, sorry.
9664020	9675020	Yeah, I mean, it, you know, even though, like, you know, granted, I'm 17, you know, and I was never around when these games originally came out,
9675020	9681020	but I'm like, you know, it's great every once in a while to, you know, have an old school jig every once in a while.
9681020	9688020	Wait, wait, wait. I have a very important question. You said at the top, you introduced yourself as DS Master 25,
9688020	9694020	and then said, no, wait, I'm DS Master 26 because I age. And now you just said you're 17. I'm totally lost.
9694020	9696020	How old are you?
9696020	9699020	Well, I'm 17.
9699020	9702020	Okay, so where's the 26 come from?
9702020	9708020	Well, because all the DS Master tells are taken up, and 25 is the only one available at the time.
9708020	9714020	So it took that, and so now it's 26.
9714020	9718020	Okay. All right, I had, no, this was important.
9718020	9719020	No, it wasn't.
9719020	9721020	This is very important.
9721020	9732020	Oh, and plus I have a review for a bit on a new DS, well, semi-new DS title that I came across, Chinatown Wars.
9732020	9735020	All right, make it quick, because we gotta get some more calls.
9735020	9744020	Basically, I gotta say here, it looks exactly like the old PlayStation 1 GTA renditions.
9744020	9748020	It actually runs quite well on the DS.
9748020	9757020	And then another quickie, which I give that one a five stars, and then my last quickie review, Quake Live.
9757020	9766020	Recommended, you have a pretty decent hardware, because I got, it was getting a little bit shaky when there was multiple explosions on the screen.
9766020	9776020	And don't try to play with a trackpad mouse on a laptop, because I'll tell you this, this says murder on my hands beyond belief.
9776020	9777020	Yeah.
9777020	9788020	I had my index finger and all the rest of my fingers up to the WSAD keys, my thumb all the way stretched down to the left mouse button to shoot, and used my right hand to try to aim.
9788020	9791020	I definitely don't play Quake Live on the netbook.
9791020	9795020	All right, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.
9795020	9796020	Peace out.
9796020	9798020	Later.
9798020	9803020	Well, you see, DS Master 1 through 24 was taken, so I just went for 25.
9803020	9807020	I'll have you know that someone linked me in chat to a listing on eBay.
9807020	9817020	Yes, for $235 plus shipping, we can own our own edible image, edible ink cake printer that will allow us to print emails and eat them.
9817020	9821020	For $235, that's not bad. I'm thinking about it. That would be good.
9821020	9824020	I do have a challenge, though, on a future show.
9824020	9828020	I would like to hear from DS Masters 1 through 23 at some point.
9828020	9832020	I just want to know where they are, 1 through 24.
9832020	9840020	I would love to hear from DS Master 2 or someone with a lot of seniority in the DS Master chain.
9840020	9847020	1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to hear your voice on our lovely radio program, Orange Lounge Radio.
9847020	9849020	I mean, while distracting Rob.
9849020	9851020	Oh, with people of Walmart.com?
9851020	9852020	With people of Walmart.com.
9852020	9855020	That site is hilarious, but I'm just worried it's going to get old in a month.
9855020	9857020	Just look at the fail.
9857020	9859020	It's pretty funny.
9859020	9863020	Our phone's not ringing. I guess we're not getting any other calls.
9863020	9867020	We sometimes have a quick delay, so I'll give it another moment for calls.
9867020	9869020	One more story, Logan?
9869020	9875020	Crazy Kart Racing comes to the iPhone App Store, apparently, last week.
9875020	9883020	For $8, it's a Konami racing game featuring a cool roster of characters, including Pyramid Head, Robby the Rabbit,
9883020	9891020	and, of course, characters from Rumble Roses, Frogger, Goemon.
9891020	9899020	They even have Taco from Parodius, it looks like.
9899020	9901020	So that's interesting.
9901020	9903020	They even have Pyramid Head in the shot. It's kind of funny.
9903020	9905020	Phone's ringing.
9905020	9908020	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9908020	9910020	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9910020	9912020	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind?
9912020	9915020	Oh, you know, a couple things.
9915020	9925020	Yeah, I just got one of your little stories about an adults-only console that's about to come out.
9925020	9928020	And what are your thoughts on the adults-only console?
9928020	9940020	It's kind of Fe. I would have to get some more information about it before I fully form an opinion one way or the other.
9940020	9951020	But at least for the moment, the question is, even though the game's going to be adults-only, are they going to be actually any good?
9951020	9961020	I mean, you can always draw a parallel to a lot of the mature titles that came out at least last generation.
9961020	9974020	Like, for example, if you want to compare them to, like, the Grand Theft Auto games to, like, BMX Triple X or the Rumble Roll.
9974020	9980020	BMX Triple X was awesome. Awesomely bad, but in a so-bad-it-was-good kind of way.
9980020	9982020	You could carry a hose around on your bike.
9982020	9991020	I got to derail this conversation for a minute, Spazinator, because I have a topic I need to hear about from you, because we just had DS Master on the show talking about where his name comes from.
9991020	9994020	I need to know where Spazinator comes from.
9994020	10001020	It's kind of a weird story. I assume you're familiar with the American pie movies, right?
10001020	10003020	Yes.
10003020	10011020	Yeah, you know how there's a character on here that goes by the name of the Shervenator?
10011020	10012020	Yes.
10012020	10019020	Well, when I mean Spazinator, this is back in the PS2 days.
10019020	10033020	I literally just got down watching the first American pie movie, and I also had those kinds of network adapters and SoCon 2.
10033020	10043020	I went to create a screen name, and I thought, there's a Shervenator. I like the American pie movies.
10043020	10052020	I changed the name up a little bit, and the first thing I paid the money was Spazinator.
10052020	10066020	Eventually, the name kind of stuck. I started using the screen name on all the games. It's just really a little consistent, so it kind of stuck.
10066020	10071020	I'm so glad I asked. Okay, that's cool.
10071020	10078020	What else do I want to ask you about? I don't know. Tell us one more thing that's on your mind, and then we're going to take another call.
10078020	10091020	Yeah, right at the top of the show, F.B. got off the pole with Bobby. You mentioned during your gaming week that you picked up the pinball game.
10091020	10093020	Yes.
10093020	10104020	Yeah, I actually just got there a couple days ago, and by looking at it, I figured out what table it's on, and I actually beat one of your scores so far.
10104020	10110020	Well, I haven't played it enough, so give me a little credit. I barely, barely touched the game yet.
10110020	10116020	All right, Spazinator, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much. Take care, okay?
10116020	10117020	All right, have a good one.
10117020	10120020	Later.
10120020	10125020	Excuse me. What's wrong? You all right over there?
10125020	10126020	I'm crying for other reasons.
10126020	10129020	Why? Did a Sim die on you or something?
10129020	10130020	No.
10130020	10133020	Okay. Did a part of your soul die?
10133020	10135020	She's playing Sims 3.
10135020	10138020	Part of my soul died just in the last...
10138020	10145020	1877 Game O.L.R., if you'd like to give us a call, or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype.
10145020	10149020	Loki, did you have some more last minute stories? Oh, never mind. We're getting another call. Let's take the call.
10149020	10152020	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
10152020	10154020	This is Deathwishing.
10154020	10155020	Woohoo!
10155020	10156020	Hi, Deathwishing. Hey.
10156020	10159020	I'm sorry I tore apart your grammar earlier.
10159020	10163020	You got to talk loud so I can barely hear you.
10163020	10167020	Okay, I will talk loud.
10167020	10175020	Deathwishing, I don't care why you called tonight. I have a question for you.
10175020	10176020	About my name?
10176020	10181020	Yes, where does your name come from? I must know.
10181020	10185020	Counter-Strike.
10185020	10189020	Actually, I died a lot.
10189020	10194020	Why can't everybody have a story like that?
10194020	10197020	Where did your name come from? You're a mom.
10197020	10204020	Alright, fine. Since your story was so short, what did you want to call in about tonight?
10204020	10220020	My name is Deathwishing, the sex box. It's kind of stupid in a way. One, it's kind of a rip-off of Internet meme name stuff. Do we really need a porn game console?
10220020	10225020	It's not a lolcat console. It's not a Two Girls One Cup console.
10225020	10231020	It probably has a lolcat fetish, so it probably will be a lolcat console.
10231020	10239020	There's something I hadn't thought of. Would you be interested in meeting people on the Internet with a lolcat fetish, Deathwishing?
10239020	10242020	No, I have a girlfriend, so I don't mean it.
10242020	10248020	I can has fucking? Is there any lolcat cosplay is what I want to know?
10248020	10256020	I should do that. I'll just walk around in cat ears with a sign that says, I can has, and then insert random items.
10256020	10257020	It has to have been done.
10257020	10259020	Yes, it has been done.
10259020	10260020	I'm sorry.
10260020	10264020	We had someone go around as a lolcat.
10264020	10267020	Yes, your thoughts on the sex box, sir?
10267020	10272020	You guys were following PAX coverage, right?
10272020	10275020	Yeah, a little bit. We had Bobby calling in from PAX.
10275020	10282020	Well, apparently there's Street Fighter 6 they have for sale there, like limited edition for PAX only.
10282020	10283020	That's pretty cool.
10283020	10284020	Yeah, the girl one.
10284020	10285020	Nice.
10285020	10289020	And, well, you gave one away for free.
10289020	10290020	Lucky.
10290020	10293020	Oh, they didn't get a thousand viewers.
10293020	10300020	Oh, yeah, I heard something like some people were streaming it live on the Internet, like all of PAX.
10300020	10304020	And they did give one away, or they didn't?
10304020	10309020	I'm not sure they might have. All I know is they gave away a lot of swag and stuff.
10309020	10314020	But they would only give it away if they got a thousand viewers, you said?
10314020	10319020	You know, they'd try to give it away anyway. I mean, the guy they heard about, they just went and bought two.
10319020	10322020	Because, I don't know, for some reason I thought for a minute about those whole, like,
10322020	10326020	we're only going to give something away when we get so many followers on Twitter or something like that.
10326020	10331020	Like, I hate those contests because obviously it's just a complete attention-horror grab, which, yeah, I understand that.
10331020	10338020	But at the same time, aren't you disrespecting the listeners you do have or the viewers or followers you do have by saying, well...
10338020	10340020	It's just a shameless promotion.
10340020	10342020	It is completely shameless.
10342020	10346020	Like, hey, you know what? We used to do Orange Laundrio for 12 people and loved it.
10346020	10351020	And so I don't understand this whole, like, we're not going to pay attention to you until we get 500.
10351020	10353020	I just think it's disrespectful to others.
10353020	10357020	I'm sorry, that was a tangent you probably weren't intending on, but you got it.
10357020	10362020	You know, I really think no one really even cared about the new track thing either.
10362020	10370020	I think someone said they posted the link to it on Chan.com and nothing happened.
10370020	10377020	I saw a user tell I was watching off to, like, from 197 to 200 and then went back down lower than before.
10377020	10379020	Maybe everybody was at PAX.
10379020	10383020	I don't know.
10383020	10386020	Death Wishing, is there a fight breaking out behind you?
10386020	10394020	Well, there's these people playing some game called, oh, well, they stopped playing Hero of New Earth, which is kind of like Dota.
10394020	10396020	And they're all playing Star Cry 2 now.
10396020	10397020	Oh, okay.
10397020	10402020	Alright, we're going to let you go Death Wishing so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
10402020	10403020	Bye bye.
10403020	10404020	Later.
10404020	10407020	I'm now shutting off the Skype line.
10407020	10409020	That's it. No more calls tonight.
10409020	10412020	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through.
10412020	10415020	Loki, did you have anything else for us before we close out shop tonight?
10415020	10416020	Yeah, real quick.
10416020	10419020	The ESRB has rated more games coming to the PlayStation Network.
10419020	10423020	These are PlayStation 1 download titles, including Blood Omen, Legacy of Kain,
10423020	10430020	Cool Borders 3, International Track and Field, Oddworld Ape's Exodus, and Oddworld Ape's Odyssey,
10430020	10434020	Pandemonium, Syphon Filter 2, and Umjammer Lammy.
10434020	10436020	Didn't some of those already come out this week?
10436020	10438020	I thought I heard some of those came out this week.
10438020	10450020	Um, well, Umjammer Lammy came out in Japan, and actually, Blood Omen and Pandemonium were rated before previously in March.
10450020	10453020	I don't think any of them actually came out this week, though.
10453020	10457020	But it's in need, I guess.
10457020	10463020	And we talked a little bit, I think, before about how Guitar Hero World Tour is going to have an option to,
10463020	10468020	or Guitar Hero 5 is going to have an option to import some tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.
10468020	10471020	However, it's actually quite pathetic.
10471020	10476020	Only 35 of World Tour's 86 tracks are actually going to be available to import,
10476020	10480020	and it's going to cost you $3.50 to do so.
10480020	10485020	And also, Smash Hits is only going to have a few tracks to import as well.
10485020	10494020	I believe they're going to have, oh, let's see here, 21 songs from Smash Hits available to import,
10494020	10498020	with an undisclosed price on that one, and that's coming out later this fall.
10498020	10503020	But it's still pathetic, if you ask me, since Rock Band, you can import everything except for three tracks.
10503020	10507020	Well, it depends what the songs are, too. Maybe they weren't willing to pony up the money, I don't know.
10507020	10509020	Whatever.
10509020	10519020	And then finally, apparently there's new versions of Bonk, Bomberman, and I think maybe some other games coming as well.
10519020	10522020	And these were discovered on Hudson's website.
10522020	10527020	Apparently there's a Bonk update coming, a Bomberman live sequel,
10527020	10534020	and a Wii and DS version of a game called Rooms the Main Building.
10534020	10538020	And apparently the Bonk game's called Brink of Extinction.
10538020	10541020	It's coming to WiiWare, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live.
10541020	10547020	It's going to be a 2.5D action platformer game with online co-op.
10547020	10550020	And apparently Bonk's going to have eight different transformations.
10550020	10558020	And also, it's supposed to be out spring 2010.
10558020	10562020	And I guess Bomberman Live Battle Fest coming to all three consoles as well.
10562020	10565020	And they've got new arenas, game types, and team play.
10565020	10573020	And I guess Rooms the Main Building, that's supposed to be a Wii or DS retail title.
10573020	10575020	Interesting.
10575020	10580020	And I guess now Bonk and Bomberman have been officially announced by Hudson with screenshots.
10580020	10584020	And it looks like Bonk and Bomberman.
10584020	10587020	So not much to report there.
10587020	10589020	That's it.
10589020	10591020	Alright.
10591020	10593020	Sounds awesome.
10593020	10597020	Bonk is one of those things that's a little better left in my memory, I think.
10597020	10599020	But I don't know, if they soup it up a little bit it might be cool.
10599020	10608020	It's going to be like a 3D remake of Hudson's Adventure Island and it was not very good, if I remember correctly.
10608020	10609020	Alright.
10609020	10613020	Well, let's go ahead and start to wrap up and get the hell out of here for the night.
10613020	10616020	And in order to do that we need to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10616020	10618020	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
10618020	10621020	Frozen yogurt.
10621020	10623020	My final thought is, sounds amazing.
10623020	10627020	And I thought this show would be shorter tonight, but it was actually kind of long tonight.
10627020	10628020	Go figure.
10628020	10631020	Sometimes you just never know how long the show is going to go.
10631020	10632020	Loki.
10632020	10634020	So, I have a toy for my cat.
10634020	10638020	It's a laser pointer, but the thing is the laser pointer is shaped like a cat.
10638020	10642020	So does that make it a laser cat?
10642020	10644020	Possibly.
10644020	10646020	Definitely.
10646020	10649020	Because it is a cat that fires a laser, so.
10649020	10651020	At least you don't have a laser cat fetish.
10651020	10654020	And on that note, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into Orange Laundry Video.
10654020	10656020	We really appreciate your support.
10656020	10660020	Hey, if you like what you've heard, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the station.
10660020	10663020	Because you know what, we don't have a big magazine promoting us.
10663020	10665020	We don't have zillions of followers on Twitter.
10665020	10669020	And we're never going to have a contest that we'll only do if so many people follow us or what have you.
10669020	10671020	You know, just help us get the word out.
10671020	10672020	That's all we ask.
10672020	10673020	However you can do it.
10673020	10675020	Through an iTunes review, through anything.
10675020	10679020	And we'll try to keep it free for you guys for another seven years, all right?
10679020	10680020	Have a good night everybody.
10680020	10681020	We'll see you next week.
10681020	10684020	We will be back next week with even more of the latest and greatest in video gaming.
10684020	10689020	And of course, we're starting to get to the start of that fourth quarter where we're just going to have games after games after games.
10689020	10695020	So our reviews and yours sitting around talking smack about what we love, video games.
10695020	10696020	I'm Rob Roberts.
10696020	10697020	She's DarkSakura.
10697020	10698020	He's Loki.
10698020	10700020	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
