14073	23665	Tonight, September 6, 2009, a Once Pay We channel goes free, a new racing game will be integrating Twitter and we recap and talk about the news from PAX 2009.
31721	36482	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week here of Orange Lounge Radio.
36502	42104	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42144	46726	We tape live every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.
46766	50467	A big thanks to our friends at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.
51027	52227	I'm here with you for the next three hours.
52267	53167	My name is Rob Roberts.
53247	58989	Joining me, as always, for the past seven and a half years, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
59349	60130	Nom, nom, nom.
60370	61010	Nom, nom, nom.
61050	61350	How are you?
62210	62530	Nomming.
62690	65173	Okay, quickly, Orange Lounge Foodio, what are you nomming on tonight?
65273	65633	Brains.
66374	66834	Shut up.
66934	67434	Pizza.
67595	67995	Pizza.
68015	69116	With extra garlic.
69216	72639	It's a cheese pizza, but I added garlic to it because garlic makes everything better.
72779	74380	It will keep the vampires away.
74820	75121	Awesome.
75521	77943	Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Loki.
77963	78744	Hello.
78924	80545	Loki, you look like you're listening to something else over there.
81046	83768	I'm trying to, but I hate these earbud headphones.
84869	85249	Any hints?
85449	86810	Is this a cage match for later?
86830	88531	Yeah, because I didn't pick anything.
88771	89051	I see.
89172	89712	Per usual.
90172	90432	All right.
90492	93234	And if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's because you've never tuned in live before.
93254	95476	We do a little special thing after the show.
95496	96497	You'll have to tune in live sometime.
96517	100539	I'm hoping, because it's Labor Day, maybe we get some people listening live that haven't listened before.
100619	103661	So a big hello to all of you that are new to...
104622	124357	us broadcasting live be sure to join our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com and we will read some comments from chat and comment from the Rob D in chat early this evening you know it's PAX weekend when Orange Lounge is talking old DDR and allgames.com is discussing condom reviews I guess the allgames chat is talking about condoms so
125658	126298	Way to be mature.
126438	130280	No, I'm just... Please, my guy should be judging on that part.
131321	132901	We're completely immature here on Orange Launch Radio.
132921	138364	But I'm glad that Rob D. brought up PAX because it is Penny Arcade Expo weekend.
138724	140985	Sadly, the three of us could not go this year.
141045	145027	We all went last year, but we kind of ate the money in the budget for E3.
145167	149269	But our dear friend Bobby Blackwolf is live at the show.
149569	153631	We're going to call him right now and talk to him about Penny Arcade Expo.
155780	164594	One ringy dingy dingy Ferret Exterminators Hi Bobby Hey Rob, what's up guys?
164835	165997	Not much, how are you doing?
169176	172637	All right, Bobby Blackwolf, of course.
172717	174158	I need to give you a proper introduction.
174198	179760	He is the man who takes the Bobby Blackwolf show live at 5 o'clock, right before we are live.
179940	186242	He sadly was not live tonight, but he did have a sneak peek of the rock band Beatles that he got a little early from Harmonix.
186302	187263	So props to you.
188337	193118	And by the way, it's the Beatles Rock Band They are very strict on that
208703	212005	I had fun, and I mean, I kind of did kind of what you guys did at E3.
212045	214326	We did not do any appointments.
214426	215807	We did not set any interviews.
215867	219609	So we were able to just kind of go around and spend as much or as little time as we wanted.
220850	227293	But for those of us who did go to E3, there's a lot here that was repeated and regurgitated.
227333	231155	A lot of the same E3 builds, the E3 demos were here on the show floor.
231595	232496	But it was nice to see...
233260	236703	Regular folk get a chance at the same things that we saw a couple months ago.
236803	239845	So it was a lot of fun to see their reactions, see what they thought about it.
239885	241927	Did you see anything interesting to you that you did not see at E3?
241947	242407	Some new things.
242427	243608	Well, one of them I saw was Star Trek Online.
263320	264220	Oh, snap.
264320	265561	You know I want the details on this.
267302	277085	So, you know, I played through one of their episodes, like they did any episode type of thing, where you start off in your ship and you kind of fly around and they say that you get a distress call.
277626	281007	So you go and you fight some Klingon birds of prey in the ship combat.
281427	285889	And then you beamed it down to the planet, which was kind of like the city on the edge of forever.
286729	289450	And the Klingons are trying to take over the forever.
290470	291771	And so you had to...
292527	292928	and so on.
315104	317825	I did.
318145	320746	Yes, and we'll be giving more details on that a little later on in the show.
320806	322686	I think that's one of our stories coming up a little later.
322767	325248	But my question about Star Trek Online, was it fun?
327448	329869	It was fun, the little bit that they showed.
329969	333591	But they even said that, you know, this was a very small episode.
333631	336512	What they're basically doing is their missions are scheduled to be
338184	341825	Star Trek writers.
343006	350310	They were basically just showing the combat portion, but they said there's going to be puzzles and other things to do that aren't just fight, fight, fight.
350510	352130	Here at PAX, they were just showing the fighting.
353351	354071	It was fun.
354091	355372	It was kind of a nice little taste.
355996	356396	DarkSakura.com
385024	412397	and it was kind of interesting watching like going through the line of people and basically in Heavy Rain it reminds me a lot of Shenmue like I really didn't understand or get what Heavy Rain was but it's basically you know quick time action sequences along with tank driving in terms of moving your character but it's basically there's a gunpoint heist in a grocery store or serve a quickie mark and basically you can actually
413430	442198	determine how it ends up and the guy before me actually convinced the guy to leave the store and I had to punch him in the face but it was very interesting mechanic and just interesting the way that it went down and it's not a game I haven't seen this kind of gameplay all that much in terms of a full game I've seen it in mini games like God of War and Shenmue and things like that but it's going to be kind of interesting to see how this game really turns out longer than a five minute demo
443132	443452	All right.
443792	446954	Well, we're monitoring our chat room at chat.orangelonsradio.com.
446974	448334	We're getting some questions for you, Bobby.
448735	450556	Actdeft wants to know about Scribblenauts.
450616	451936	Did you go to the Scribblenauts panel?
451976	452997	Was it there on the show floor?
454397	459320	I did not go to the panel, but they were once again on the corner of the show floor where they belong, apparently.
460120	463942	But they brought six kiosks, and the lines were long the entire time.
464482	465222	Of course.
467063	470665	But I actually did talk to them and even talked to some of the developers and said,
470965	497895	and for people who've listened to my show for a long time know that when I went to GDC in 2007 one of the student competition IGS winners I interviewed was a group that made a game called Toblo and during that interview I met up with the guy that I interviewed then and he said I was one of the three people that wanted to talk to them at GDC and they thought it was really cool and apparently I announced their first game, Drawn to Life
498530	505835	because he had talked about it on our show, gave us a rundown well before they had even done any kind of formal announcements or anything like that.
505875	510498	He didn't get in trouble, but it was kind of neat to hear him talk about it and how he remembered me.
511319	513420	It was kind of cool to talk to them.
513460	522586	I did get to play one level, just getting one of the stars, but that was about all I could do because it was near the end of the show and the lines were just so long the entire show.
522866	528050	Ryan, what a turnaround from E3 because we walked right up to the kiosk at E3, so apparently word of mouth is spreading.
529905	532326	They've been very happy with all the coverage and surprised.
532346	536127	They didn't think they would get the kind of coverage that they got.
536347	538787	And so they came a little bit more prepared this time.
538807	542728	Like WB, their little booth, they were showing Fear 2 and Scribblenauts.
542969	543609	And that's it.
543669	549410	And they had six Scribblenauts kiosks and two cave kiosks for Fear 2 or a Fear thing.
549630	551291	Yeah, why would they show Fear 2?
551551	552531	It's been out forever now.
554164	555685	I don't know, it was a fear something.
555865	557787	I didn't look at it because Scribblenauts was next to it.
557847	559268	Maybe it was a new platform.
559288	560769	Maybe a new expansion or something.
561609	563431	Bobby, what about other... Oh, go ahead.
564772	573698	No, there were some games that were already out, like Metroid Prime, the trilogy, was in Nintendo's booth, and it's already out in stores, but they were bribing people with t-shirts if they came up and played it.
574479	576200	There were some stuff that's already out.
577264	577925	Thank you for watching!
593871	600552	No, because I was able to get into a lot of the parties, a lot of the company parties, so I didn't really do any panels or anything.
602113	609154	But I mean, I'm very happy because I've been a fan of like Paul and Storm and Jonathan Colton for a long time, and you know they're coming to Rock Band this week.
609194	610174	That's the PAX pack.
610234	613074	And I've actually referenced Paul and Storm several times on the show.
613114	617455	Every time I reference myself as an opening band, that's the song that's going to be in Rock Band too.
617555	622556	So once again, we're showcasing artists that people are going to know very soon.
623320	624421	CCP People Are Freaky
643472	663890	that was probably the most hilarious one just because it's not my scene CCP bought White Wolf which is World of Darkness and they did usually at Dragon Con they do the Succubus Club which is at like this golf night club or whatever and you know just a lot of weird things happen from that scene I think we got an invite to something like that at E3 I saw pictures of that
665253	666734	Yeah, there's probably pictures of it.
667495	682967	I mean, we saw, like, when I was there, it was just, the comedy was great, where they had a guy doing, like, this whole routine with a lightsaber to techno music, and actually the techno music was actually going with, he was timing the lightsaber moves with the bass and stuff.
683728	691754	And, you know, seeing people use iPhones as glow sticks because they didn't have their own, you know, I mean... They have an app for that.
691814	693676	I know, yeah, the glow stick app's pretty funny.
694963	695804	No, they weren't even doing that.
695824	699186	They just had the screen on, the home screen on, and they were just waving them around.
699506	699787	Nice.
700107	700467	Very nice.
700827	710114	Well, Bobby, before we let you go, because I know you want to get a flight and all that fun stuff, I want to know what was the best thing about PAX and what was the worst thing about PAX?
712116	714718	The best thing about PAX is that it started, and the worst thing is that it ended.
716519	718440	That's a tricky response.
718460	719861	How did it compare to E3 this year?
723445	725205	Well, you can't really compare it to E3.
725225	728026	I mean, basically, I can actually compare PAX to last year.
729426	730846	There were 70,000 people here.
731066	732847	All the badges were sold out.
732907	734107	My girlfriend actually bought a badge.
734127	737628	She thought she was coming out, and she didn't, and she wound up being able to sell it for $170.
738008	740148	So I thought it was going to be very crowded.
740968	745729	I say I thought, but the difference between PAX with 70,000 people and, say, E3 2006 with 68,000 people is that PAX is spread out.
751264	755046	Not all 70,000 people are trying to be on the expo hall at the same time.
755426	761689	Whereas at E3, pretty much you could say 60,000 of the 68,000 were all trying to be in the exhibit hall so you couldn't move around.
762309	767331	Other than when they were throwing t-shirts and giving away raffles, I could still walk around just fine.
767391	772854	Now, the big games, I had to wait in line to play, but it was pretty manageable.
772974	775835	You didn't think that there were 70,000 people here this weekend.
776579	777039	Interesting.
777079	781522	I guess a lot go for the live gaming events, too, and I bet those rooms take away quite a few people.
782042	785604	And I think when they say 70,000, that's spread out through the three days.
786224	794248	PAX sells a lot of individual day badges, too, and it's never really, I think, accounted for just how many they're selling of those Friday, Saturday, Sunday badges.
795714	804981	Yeah, well, I mean, they have the numbers because the convention center actually let them sell 1,000 of the one-day passes for Saturday and Sunday at the last minute, and they were very surprised about that.
805201	805642	Oh, wow.
805702	812847	So, I mean, so people who did come up here hoping to get a badge were actually able to get badges at the last minute.
813008	814789	So, that was really nice.
814809	818712	But basically, the thing is, there's only two or three events at this convention center that
818993	820714	that take up the entire center.
820814	821674	Usually they double book.
821694	823175	They had a Jewish convention last year.
823195	824295	I don't know if you ever remember that.
824435	825075	Yeah, I do remember that.
825095	826036	Way up on the sixth floor.
826136	826356	Yep.
827216	834139	PAX actually had the entire building this time and they're like one of two events in the entire year that actually need the entire building.
834179	838421	And that's also why they're on Labor Day weekend because that's the only time they can schedule just one event.
838601	838821	Wow.
839704	840685	Red Dead Redemption
863908	869591	was Rockstar's big game that they were trying to show off here, and it's basically GTA meets Wild West.
869752	870712	I know, it looks awesome.
871853	886342	And if you thought Liberty City was big, or not Liberty, yeah, Liberty City, if you thought GTA 4 was big, this one is huge, open world, it's basically GTA Wild West, and it actually looked really good from the demo they showed.
886382	887862	So that shows that they can make a good demo.
888823	890464	So we'll see, eventually.
890604	893666	And the Split Seconds guys were there, people were playing Split Seconds,
894270	912954	and they say that's probably going to be in spring of 2010 or summer they say it's kind of been pushed back which means they have even more time to work on it from what we saw at E3 awesome well that was definitely one of the all stars at E3 so I'm hoping it got a lot of air time I guess you could say out there on the show floor sounds like a lot of fun stuff was DJ Hero playable there?
914592	934527	Activision was not here Activision apparently did an invite only event Thursday night and that's when they showed off some stuff but I was not invited to that so I didn't get to go to that but no, Activision themselves were not physically here at the show this year
935336	936117	Pax East, Pax West, Pax East
951756	952777	No, not really.
952857	955800	And even, like, the enforcers don't know if they're working Pax East.
955820	959664	Like, I was talking to the media guy, because I want to start doing broadcasting again.
959704	960585	They couldn't fit us in.
960605	965730	Like, the space that we were in last year for All Games Radio was taken up by other tables.
966651	972517	So, like, there was, like, tabletop gaming going on in that area, and that's why we couldn't have that area, and they didn't want to run the network all the way across.
973318	973539	But...
974511	977113	I asked him, I'm like, are you the new guy that's running the media?
977133	979915	He said, I asked him, are you running the media at Boston?
979955	981537	So we can go ahead and kind of start talking about that.
981577	982397	And he's like, I don't know.
983258	984059	Oh, wow.
984339	989423	Basically, here's the thing that he did tell me is that TaxEase has been outsourced to another company.
989483	991385	So it's not the same people running it.
991405	996349	So I don't know if that's going to change how it feels or not.
996369	1001413	Because, I mean, the guys that run tax are just a little bit too overwhelmed with this show.
1002805	1010473	So they've kind of had to farm it out and outsource it to another company while still having the reins on it, but we don't know if it's going to be...
1011212	1011973	The same as this.
1012053	1013194	It's going to be kind of interesting.
1036124	1037464	Yep, and I'll be up there too.
1037604	1042546	So this Friday we're actually going to be running a show on my TV show, Friday Night Gaming.
1042566	1045726	We're actually going to be running one of the games that's here that comes out this week.
1045746	1047767	I don't know if you've heard of Darkest of Days.
1048627	1051208	It is a time-traveling first-person shooter.
1052088	1055449	And it's actually by the same guys that make the Real Deal Casino game.
1055849	1056569	Yeah, it looked funny.
1056589	1057689	It's kind of funny.
1058649	1059990	But it was cool.
1060050	1064671	It's coming out on PC and 360, and we're going to be running it on fnglive.net this Friday.
1065435	1065755	No problem.
1065775	1068056	Thanks for interrupting your show flow to get me in.
1095205	1095849	Alright, thank you.
1095869	1096532	Alright, take care.
1097711	1100213	Bobby Blackwolf, live on Orange Lounge Radio, everybody.
1100233	1102875	He always gives us like five minutes on his show every week.
1103295	1105397	We can give him 15 on our show tonight.
1105517	1109500	And a lot of great... I had no idea that PAX East was being run by a different company.
1109540	1110821	That's huge news, in my opinion.
1111321	1115425	Well, I don't know if it's like huge news, but it's a huge interesting thing I didn't think about before.
1115485	1116245	That's very interesting.
1116465	1117946	That game Darkest of Days looks funny.
1118027	1123271	It's basically you can time travel to the past like the Civil War with giant weapons that you could totally hit everyone's ass with.
1123511	1123711	Nice.
1123771	1125672	It is intriguing, so I may have to try that.
1125832	1126193	Very nice.
1126553	1128474	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1128514	1128994	I shook my butt.
1129014	1131455	I played Parapara First Mix and played a lot of 2DX Distorted.
1131515	1133316	And what was that weird trippy-ass game that you told me?
1133336	1133716	Here, play!
1157008	1159531	DJ Max Technica, the new arcade game.
1159991	1160512	It was alright.
1161733	1162514	Not really my thing.
1162574	1164116	It's a little too K-pop.
1167611	1168192	Oh, that was pretty.
1168752	1169733	I did have a good time playing it.
1169793	1170654	It was just very K-pop.
1170954	1171134	Yeah.
1171735	1173697	It was like, wow, is this Andamiro?
1177160	1182084	Also, Dan played the new Hydro Thunder spiritual successor.
1182785	1183525	What was it called?
1183665	1185667	I don't remember the name, but it was a big machine.
1185928	1189631	It was Hydro something or Hydra something.
1190191	1191212	It was a cool little game.
1191753	1191973	Yeah.
1191993	1192894	Big, big machine.
1193134	1193614	But it's...
1194695	1197916	Dan was like, give me the card I want to play, give me the card I want to play, give me the card I want to play.
1198176	1200377	Oh yeah, and I played that punching bag game, which was stupid.
1201157	1202557	Because it was in the corner and I was bored.
1204398	1205738	And then I played lots of Sims 3.
1207218	1212020	And I played some Ragnarok Online before I got completely just fed up.
1212320	1212760	Fed up!
1213540	1216861	And I have a guilty admission.
1217401	1217741	What's that?
1218744	1223025	I'm downloading... Well, I downloaded... Shut up.
1223125	1223586	Not an addict.
1223626	1225006	I haven't touched it in two years.
1226186	1229027	Yeah, my last date of playing was October in 2007.
1229107	1230188	Why were you playing?
1230708	1231868	I haven't played it yet.
1232028	1234109	But you're going to play... I'm just downloading World of Warcraft.
1235296	1236256	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1258138	1259219	My gaming week was alright.
1259479	1263541	I'm having a love-hate relationship right now with Rockstar, unfortunately.
1264421	1268904	I love the new trailer for The Battle of the Gay Tony.
1268944	1273546	It's really making me excited for the next expansion they're going to have because it's now more over-the-top stuff.
1274484	1276226	I did play more Grand Theft Auto this week.
1276366	1286736	However, they did patch Grand Theft Auto so that we can't run our modded games anymore, which is very... We were completely depressed for the remainder of the week.
1288138	1288938	It's absolute crap.
1289279	1293183	However, I am not letting that stop me, and I will get by this one way or another.
1293203	1294764	They'll find a way around it eventually.
1294984	1297046	I'm already kind of working on a way, but...
1298007	1309999	So, yeah, it's kind of annoying, but I understand they did it for the greater good because there's assholes out there that like to ruin everybody's games by doing all these different cheat things and stuff and not exactly in the closed environments that we're playing in, but, hey, whatever.
1310139	1312982	Still, though, it sucks that, you know, some people have to ruin it for everybody else.
1313802	1321085	The other game I played, not that I got an early media copy, but I did get an early copy of The Beatles Rock Band.
1321545	1332870	And honestly, you know, I think one of the things you gotta consider when you're planning on buying The Beatles Rock Band is you better damn well be a Beatles fan, because if you're not, then you're not gonna enjoy it too much.
1333130	1335251	I'm okay with The Beatles.
1335291	1336271	I don't hate their music.
1337152	1339813	I like some of their songs, but it kind of lost...
1340816	1341657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1354227	1363638	I don't know, it's... So you're saying the presentation, as somebody who's not as into the Beatles, kind of the presentation and the new packaging of Rock Band kind of wore off on you really quick?
1363838	1364078	Yes.
1364859	1370605	You know, I don't... It's not a bad game by any means, it's just, you know, for me, I can't see myself playing this for a long time.
1371086	1371847	You know, if I could...
1372387	1374189	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1391400	1391941	Thanks for watching!
1417783	1444143	And I don't sing either A lot of reviews, I guess the embargo or whatever was lifted the other day Because all of a sudden there was just a ton of reviews that all hit the internet at once And I'm seeing a lot of positive about the presentation The way it looks, the way that it really feels like the Beatles It's kind of interesting, you're one of the first negative things I've heard Not so much negative, but just the fact that as someone who's not as into the Beatles It wore off on me Interesting
1444503	1446525	I mean, let me put it this way.
1446745	1451691	I'd be less satisfied with a Guitar Hero release that is basically just re-skinned.
1452692	1454494	They didn't put any effort into the presentation.
1454554	1456015	I still love the intro to the game.
1456135	1456736	It's awesome.
1457316	1458498	I haven't really played much of the story.
1458518	1460179	It's mainly been just the quick play stuff.
1460800	1461040	But...
1461841	1462221	I don't know.
1462401	1462902	It's neat.
1462982	1467444	It's just, for me, I wasn't, you know, I don't, like, listen to Beatles music that much.
1467504	1471466	I recognize their songs, but I don't really, like, go seek out Beatles music.
1472107	1473367	Let me ask you one more question.
1473427	1477410	If you were, let's say, imagine that you were, like, a hardcore Beatles fan.
1477530	1485554	How do you think this game would compare to other artists' solitary games, such as Guitar Hero Aerosmith or the ACDC expansion for Rock Band?
1485774	1487015	Oh yeah, this would be awesome.
1487055	1491056	I mean, they totally nailed the Beatles and just the whole feel of the game and everything.
1491136	1492057	I like that.
1492097	1492837	I really dig that.
1493497	1496879	But it's just, I'm not a huge fan of the Beatles.
1497399	1503422	But yeah, if they put that amount of effort into other artist games, yeah, then I would still be likely to check them out.
1503602	1510565	You know, because even though I'm not a big fan of the Beatles, I still bought a copy of it, you know, because it looked really cool.
1511286	1528148	and I don't think I wasted my money on it it's just I'm not going to enjoy it as much as Rock Band where if I don't like a track in it or whatever it doesn't really matter because I can just always get different artists and stuff later on whereas the Beatles stuff if I don't like the tracks in it I can't really buy more tracks because there's just more Beatles music
1529034	1531375	Go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1531415	1534056	Certainly a lot of comments going on about the Beatles rock band.
1534576	1541839	J-Rod in chat says, so because rock band Beatles has an opening cutscene, it's not a reskin version and, quote, better than the Guitar Hero Artist games.
1542199	1543940	Oh, God, my brain is raging so hard.
1544540	1548442	Well, let's not forget, this is not the first rock band artist-dedicated game.
1548643	1556487	There was an ACDC game that a lot of people forget came out last year that was, I mean, it was probably even worse than the Guitar Hero games, right?
1556527	1558629	Yeah, that was something they did for Walmart.
1558689	1559569	That was a cash-in.
1559729	1560970	Just straight-up cash-in.
1561290	1571997	So, you know, it's not like they've always done perfect releases, but to, I guess, kind of defend it a little bit, what do you think makes this a step above
1573038	1575040	Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Van Halen
1594960	1596001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1610373	1611994	Guitar Hero, Metallica, Van Halen, etc.
1628408	1630390	Yes, true.
1630650	1631411	Let's be fair.
1631731	1632332	Yeah, true.
1632352	1634434	Lego Rock Band is pretty much going to be the same thing.
1634454	1641920	The thing with Lego Rock Band, though, is it's also more like the other Telltale games where they have the little cut scenes there with the Lego characters and stuff.
1642641	1645343	All the Lego games kind of feel the same as far as that.
1645463	1647886	And they have a little bit of different elements into there.
1648126	1653571	But yeah, it's really not that much different than, say, Guitar Hero Van Halen or something like that.
1654191	1660277	They have gone a little bit further in the presentation, but not enough to where I'm going to say it's amazing or anything.
1660397	1661999	Yeah, see, I'm not feeling Lego Rock Band.
1662139	1667644	Even though I appreciate the Beatles, I'm all about Beatles Rock Band.
1667664	1671408	But I think the music games I'll probably buy this holiday season are the Beatles Rock Band and guitar.
1671408	1671688	Guitar Hero 5
1689225	1694288	But, um, I'm still more looking forward to rock band Beatles, you know, Beatles rock band myself.
1694808	1696589	Just because I am a fan.
1696649	1704393	I mean, not as big a fan as some people I know, but, you know, I'm a pretty, I love it and I'm actually looking forward to the overall experience of it, you know.
1705713	1706894	I'm not feeling it with Lego.
1707714	1709154	I don't know enough about Band Hero.
1709514	1713635	It seems like Band Hero is going to be a little bit... Band Hero should have marching band.
1715076	1718316	Band Hero is basically just the same thing as Lego Rock Band.
1718336	1720677	It's basically their E10 Plus game.
1721037	1722257	It's got a bunch of different artists.
1722277	1723518	You know who they have pimping it out?
1724458	1726679	I found out the last artist that they haven't announced yet.
1726799	1727159	What's that?
1727299	1727679	No doubt.
1728663	1729704	Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5
1755626	1761232	So, but, I don't know, like, I'm okay with the re-skinnings if the song lists are really, really good.
1761953	1764536	And it sounds like Band Hero might have a pretty good song list.
1764596	1764977	I don't know.
1765557	1765858	I don't know.
1766518	1766759	Alright.
1767139	1767519	Anyways.
1767720	1769261	Enough of the music game, blah blah blah.
1769341	1770743	So, anything else in your gaming week, Loki?
1771324	1771424	Um...
1774255	1774955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1792646	1798407	TheDanceManiacs manual first sent to me because I would like to know how to wire this thing up.
1800008	1802328	DanceManiacs sensors come in top and bottom.
1802788	1807730	The bottom have two sensors, one on top, one on bottom, I think, or two on the bottom, maybe.
1808330	1810050	But the top sensors only have one sensor.
1810910	1817752	And so I got two top sensors, unfortunately, and now I have to do something or create my own sensors or something.
1818312	1821073	Talk to the guy that sold them to me and see if he has any bottom sensors, but...
1821653	1822153	Thanks for watching!
1840546	1841547	Thanks for watching!
1854873	1862038	If there was a Guitar Hero No Doubt game, even if it was just a re-skinning or whatever, I'd probably buy it, because I really like No Doubt.
1862339	1864900	I bought that whole album and rock band and everything.
1865341	1865721	I don't know.
1866101	1867142	Call me a sucker, whatever.
1868743	1873227	I think a lot of people, if their favorite band came out in whatever game, would feel the same way.
1873567	1877910	So anyway, I don't want to get into too much more talking about music games.
1878050	1882313	Well, you heard that Lego Rock Band, the rumor is that you're going to import those tracks into...
1883314	1883694	Rock Band 2.
1883734	1884775	That's kind of cool.
1885416	1887278	I hope that's the case because I'm going to rent it.
1887298	1887798	Just rent it.
1888579	1889380	Import those tracks.
1890161	1891242	Shame on you.
1891542	1891782	Hey.
1892743	1893203	Do what I can.
1893584	1893904	All right.
1894304	1897427	Hey, Seg is in chat and wants to correct Loki.
1897487	1899710	Telltale Games does not make any of the Lego games.
1899750	1901832	I think you botched the company name when you were talking about that.
1902452	1904934	I'm sorry, I'm thinking of... It's Traveler or something.
1904954	1905614	Traveler's Tales.
1906014	1906515	I'm sorry.
1906535	1908216	Traveler's Tales.
1908336	1908636	It's T.T.
1908656	1910997	Close, close, but very different.
1911017	1912218	Sorry.
1912718	1913439	Traveler's Tales.
1913499	1913939	Whatever.
1913999	1915960	I mean, same initials.
1915980	1916381	That's why.
1916401	1918642	That's right.
1919543	1921124	Anyhow, at least we got that clarified.
1922143	1923324	Moving on, My Gaming Week.
1923384	1925744	Good lord, I played a lot of games this week, actually.
1925764	1931366	I want to talk about DJ Max Technica real quick, because I know DarkSakura was kind of eh about it, but I really enjoyed it.
1931827	1934187	It was like Elite Beat Agents, basically.
1934267	1939609	Imagine if Elite Beat Agents were an arcade game, where you tap the screen with your finger to hit the buttons.
1939649	1943211	Basically what happens, you see a bar going across the top, and then it goes back down to the bottom.
1943271	1945371	It's kind of like running a track around the screen.
1945672	1949473	And then as it passes these dots, you have to tap the dots to play the music.
1949793	1978978	or you can drag your finger for some of them and some dots you have to hit over and over again to hit with the beat of the music I really like the way it was set up I had a really good time playing the game, the only problem I had with the game the music was completely uninspiring and not memorable to me and I know that's going to piss a lot of people off that I said that, some of the music game fans especially if you like the Korean pop, but I'm sorry it just was not, like I didn't wasn't able to distinguish one song from another that I was playing, like I can't put my finger on it, like
1979638	1983459	2DX just has such a variety and such cool songs in it.
1983559	1986480	A lot of it is so memorable, at least in the past.
1986600	1990902	I would almost say the same is true about Beatmania 2DX now, ever since 13th style about there.
1991062	1994503	Too bad they don't have a Ubi machine there.
1995363	1997984	But the game itself I thought was a lot of fun.
1998004	1999204	I would play it again.
1999344	2001125	Maybe the music will grow on me.
2001425	2001985	I don't know.
2002365	2004766	But the game itself I had a lot of fun with.
2005859	2007340	and I'm seeing frowns in chat.
2007380	2008461	I'm sorry, guys.
2008841	2012403	I guess maybe it's a personal preference thing, but the game itself, pretty cool.
2013703	2015364	Also, some other stuff I played this week.
2015625	2017406	I played Zen Pinball.
2017466	2019407	It's a pinball game that's available on PlayStation 3.
2020507	2021748	Did you check this out yet?
2021908	2025090	Not yet, but I saw one of the games in action.
2025450	2026250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2046095	2068606	so unfortunately that makes the display a little difficult in a pinball game but you know they do the best job they can you have different view modes you can use in this game to look at the table from different angles it really reminds me of a lot of the pinball games I played on the PC in the 90s but obviously you know with the high def graphics and all that I hear there's multiplayer too but I haven't tested that mode out online so I can't really review that component of it yet
2068926	2070007	Things I'm Learning About Sony
2085977	2094679	and there's so much functionality in the PSP that I don't think Sony does a really good job at advertising because I was really surprised.
2095299	2108202	As I was looking at this, I was like, oh yeah, I think we've talked about this on this show but damn, I don't really hear about this a lot and it's actually a really cool feature of the PSP and that is that if you have a PSP, let's say I was here at Jamie's right now.
2108903	2114164	I could, if I connected to her internet, I could power on my PlayStation 3 from home
2114924	2118868	Go into my crossbar, see my crossbar on the PSP as I would see it on the PS3.
2119468	2128096	Go to like a movie that I have downloaded on the PS3 or even a data disk full of movies that's in my PS3 right now and I can play them.
2128296	2130238	Stream them over the internet to my PSP.
2131279	2132000	That's awesome.
2133308	2153677	and you know it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh yeah I think I remember hearing about this but damn they should be shoving this down my throat that's really cool functionality that's way better than anything the DS and the Wii could ever do that makes the PS3 PSP combo in my opinion that much more awesome it's not just the movies thing or the data disc thing sorry you can't do blu-rays or DVDs but um
2154037	2173546	you can do some of the games too like especially the PS1 classics and some of the I don't want to say arcade games but the PSN downloadable games you can also play on the PSP from anywhere by turning on your PS3 from somewhere else that's like kind of neat so that's remote play of course is the feature there they call that
2174827	2176949	Anyhow, let's see.
2176989	2177970	What else did I play this week?
2177990	2181253	I want to say there were more games, but I can't think of anything right now, honestly.
2181293	2186537	So I guess I will just leave it at that so we can continue on with the show because I know we want to get into some gaming news.
2186597	2188479	But first, we have some housekeeping news.
2189200	2190320	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
2190541	2194444	I do want to let you guys know I am going to be out in two weeks.
2194624	2196526	I'll be here next week, but I'll be out in two weeks.
2196986	2198748	So I don't know if there will be a show or not.
2199068	2200509	But we'll keep you posted.
2200549	2202070	But I'm going to be in LA, so I won't be here.
2202550	2203711	So I'm going on a personal trip.
2204171	2205492	So we'll see what happens in two weeks.
2205612	2206652	But we will be back next week.
2207032	2212976	As far as other housekeeping goes, you can always follow us on Twitter, www.twitter.com slash OLR.
2212996	2214957	We'll be getting into Twitter topics a little later in the show.
2215577	2218339	And, of course, you can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelounge.com.
2218579	2223362	Don't forget to join us on Facebook at the OL Army or on LiveJournal at username Orangelounge.
2223922	2225183	All right, how about some gaming news?
2225363	2227544	Loki, start us off tonight with some gaming news.
2227904	2229826	Yes, lots of gaming news this week.
2230807	2237014	Let's see, let's start off with the rumor, and this wasn't exactly a complete rumor, but we knew it was coming.
2237694	2243941	I didn't know if it was going to be coming this soon, but there are DSi only games coming this fall, apparently.
2245482	2250207	Now, of course, no official announcements have been made yet about...
2251215	2252596	DSi exclusive games will be out this fall
2279355	2279835	DSi Exclusive
2305578	2310122	I don't know, alternative reality, or I guess an alternative reality game or something like that.
2310262	2313044	Augmentive reality game, that's the word I'm thinking about.
2313585	2317368	Basically, you find monsters and then you collect them and put them against each other.
2317628	2319230	Kind of like Monster Rancher, but with a camera.
2319670	2322232	Actually, sort of like the barcode scanner games back when.
2322272	2323754	Yes, yes, very similar to that too.
2325515	2328878	So this is one of the first DSi-only games.
2329278	2330940	If I remember correctly, I think from...
2332146	2339189	I can't remember if those are DSi exclusive.
2339549	2342951	I know they do use the DSi, but I don't remember if they were exclusive or not.
2343751	2347353	They said they were, but the sell sheet said not.
2347793	2348173	I don't know.
2349173	2350354	There might be more coming.
2351147	2354330	So interesting that Nintendo is kind of letting the third parties do this first.
2354511	2355432	You know what I mean?
2356493	2357574	I'm kind of torn on this.
2357634	2365402	This is one of those things where I'm a little bit disappointed because I really didn't see the point in getting a DSi because the DS honestly has everything I want.
2365462	2367684	I don't really need the camera or any of that stuff.
2367885	2368125	I don't
2368425	2370366	Yeah, I don't think you need this game either.
2370426	2373427	I mean, it's just a lot of these games are going to be DSI only.
2373807	2376348	They're obviously going to be using the gimmicks of it, the camera.
2376408	2377148	That's basically it.
2377168	2377788	Here's the thing.
2377928	2380029	How long, Loki, and you know this is going to happen.
2380389	2381030	How long?
2381070	2382490	In fact, let's take bets here on the show.
2382910	2384711	How long until Nintendo puts out...
2385051	2386832	That's almost I think how they plan it.
2408280	2409141	I don't think they care.
2432320	2434603	I know they may not care, but here's the thing though.
2434663	2441792	Their audience, the people that buy Nintendo products, are a lot different than your normal consumer that buys any other console franchise.
2443354	2450782	For example, with the Wii and the DS owners, I think that they're pretty content with what they've got on the DS.
2451784	2462497	or the Wii and they're not gonna exactly like if the Wii HD comes out your normal mom and pop is not gonna upgrade to a Wii HD because they could care less because they have Wii Sports and they don't really care about upgrading to another system.
2462857	2463699	Same with the DSi.
2463979	2466522	Until Wii Sports 3 is Wii HD only.
2466762	2467423	It doesn't matter.
2467603	2468745	I mean, I think
2469989	2470830	Thanks for watching!
2485669	2492536	I don't see how they're going to convince people that they need to buy a DSi because, oh, this game uses a camera now.
2493357	2493858	Good for them.
2494198	2496681	Question from your distribution perspective.
2497181	2499103	Are the regular DSs being phased out?
2499323	2499424	No.
2500104	2500585	Interesting.
2501085	2501845	Thanks for watching!
2525689	2528350	Takeo Ray in chat says, That's why I never got the DSi.
2528410	2530251	My DS Lite is perfectly fine for me.
2530311	2531652	That's pretty much the same camp I'm in.
2531992	2533713	I rarely play the DS as it is.
2533773	2537115	If you've listened to the show before, you know kind of my little rant on handhelds.
2537155	2541276	Although I will say, the PSP is quickly gaining a lot of favor in my opinion.
2542017	2546499	Not necessarily as a gaming device, but as a multifunctional media device.
2546519	2549020	It is quickly gaining popularity with me.
2549080	2549720	Well, here's the thing.
2549781	2554503	I mean, I'm sorry, but if they come out with a new Zelda game or something that requires a camera...
2555143	2555763	I don't care.
2555883	2556604	I won't buy it.
2556844	2557684	Because you know what?
2558044	2560625	I'm not going to buy another system for one fucking game.
2560746	2561286	I'm sorry.
2561866	2567188	When your library plays on my system except for this one game, boo fucking hoo, I'm not buying it.
2567809	2568689	I will make do.
2570310	2570850	That's the problem.
2571050	2575492	You're expecting these hardcore players to go, okay, let me buy a new system for this game.
2575852	2580594	But the audience that buys the DS, they aren't really hardcore gamers.
2582195	2584376	It's just the wrong expectation for their market.
2586121	2586461	Why not?
2586481	2587342	Because you already have a DS.
2611064	2612365	I wanna play the new stuff that comes out.
2613125	2613966	I knew it was gonna happen.
2614106	2615027	Well, what if it sucks?
2615067	2616568	Well, here's another thing we have to remember.
2616588	2617088	What if I don't care?
2617108	2619610	Jamie's a little different, because she's a system collection whore.
2619910	2620310	That's true.
2620410	2621611	She's not your typical gamer.
2623072	2626014	Honestly, anything new that comes out, I pretty much want it.
2627135	2628596	And we pretty much end up getting it.
2628616	2631878	She owns some fucking Dreamcast game that came with a dish, for heaven's sake.
2631938	2633579	I mean, she's just a video game collector.
2634779	2640122	So, yeah, you're not exactly going to want my opinion on that because mine's going to be, well, why shouldn't it be in my collection?
2640402	2640963	All right, fine.
2641323	2645885	Well, let's move on to another story that maybe we will get your opinion on then, and that's about the iPhone.
2646246	2655211	You know what's interesting is that there's always been that rumor that's been going around probably as long as we've been podcasting that Apple's going to get into gaming.
2655891	2657193	Apple's gonna get into gaming.
2657213	2658114	They're gonna do something.
2658134	2659215	They're gonna get into gaming.
2659575	2660516	It's just a matter of time.
2661017	2665801	Apple kind of just got into gaming when everybody was kind of looking everywhere else.
2665982	2668965	Like, Apple is into gaming now.
2669565	2672689	And they have a lot of users using their games.
2673229	2674731	Of course, I'm talking about the iPhone.
2675151	2675851	Don't believe me?
2676232	2677592	Well, guess what they announced this week?
2677973	2680454	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.
2680874	2683115	Yes, the game that was the DS exclusive.
2683696	2685337	They were so excited about it at E3.
2685397	2688378	Remember, they came out and, ooh, GTA Chinatown Wars is coming out.
2688738	2689159	Guess what?
2689279	2691300	It's coming out on the iPhone.
2691840	2695283	And this is right after they announced that a PSP version was coming out as well.
2695303	2696544	Of course, that is on its way as well.
2696904	2700707	But it's also coming to the iPhone, and of course, that would mean the iPod Touch as well.
2700987	2709273	There's not a whole lot of other details at this time, but only just that they're calling it a perfect match for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
2709834	2715418	I'm kind of iffy on this because I don't think... Some games just don't run well on the iPhone and iPod Touch.
2715518	2716318	I don't think it's a very...
2717119	2717480	Peggle
2724640	2725882	or any PopCap game.
2725922	2729986	Certain games that are optimized for the iPhone and iPod Touch run pretty darn good.
2730146	2743339	The only thing I see the iPhone and iPod Touch basically the app store that they have it's just the most successful mobile gaming platform is basically it.
2743379	2747684	Other phones and stuff like that don't really work well with gaming whereas this
2748404	2753529	They built this phone around the apps that you can make in these programs, which is good.
2755730	2763376	As far as it being a gaming platform, yeah, sure, I guess it could be.
2763396	2769521	They can put lots of games on it, but you're not going to see the same functionality as some of these games that are on the DS and the PSP.
2770851	2771651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2793639	2800583	but I would just see that they could do something like that that would just add a lot of oomph to the iPhone and iPod Touch and make it that much more.
2800904	2803085	But don't you think it still is competition for the DS?
2803405	2804065	Oh yeah, definitely.
2804786	2805787	To an extent, the PSP?
2806147	2807167	Yeah, definitely.
2807187	2822477	It's always competition for them because their app store right now is definitely working a lot better than what they have for DSiWare or the PlayStation Network stuff and obviously the PlayStation Go is going to try to
2823277	2824799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2837512	2838593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2862532	2867715	Like one story that I don't think we are covering tonight, I think, but it was in the thread.
2867755	2868916	We just ran out of room tonight.
2869236	2874419	Yeah, there was a game on the iPhone that just came out this week that is like a PP simulation game.
2874479	2875560	I think that's what it's called.
2876020	2877521	IPP was the name of the game.
2877841	2879983	And you literally are like aiming at a urinal.
2880043	2880483	Come on.
2880863	2881544	It's funny.
2881644	2882764	See, that's awesome.
2882784	2883345	It's stupid.
2884218	2884898	It's just dumb.
2884938	2886159	It is stupid, but you know what?
2886179	2886639	Here's my point.
2886659	2889200	There's a lot of crap out there on the iPhone and iPod Touch.
2889760	2891781	But one person's trash is another person's treasure.
2891881	2892601	So you know what?
2893121	2899003	Well, then couldn't the same be said about whatever Sony's planning with their mini bar and the DSi to an extent?
2899343	2901204	Well, I don't have a problem with Sony's minis.
2901244	2907366	I do have a problem with the DSiware because it's a lot of calculators and clocks, which, you know, I don't know.
2907406	2910007	It just doesn't really add anything to the DSi.
2910067	2910687	That's the problem.
2913128	2915009	Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2915049	2918570	We'll get to release dates here in just a little bit, but first, over to DarkSakura.
2919650	2921111	Oh, you sound so enthusiastic.
2922731	2927273	But first, over to the one and only fabulous DarkSakura!
2928073	2933635	Well, you know, Splatterhouse was being developed by Bottle Rocket Entertainment.
2933915	2935855	Well, they don't exist anymore.
2936615	2941117	They clung to life as long as they could, but the plug was pulled.
2941197	2941817	So guess what?
2942949	2950592	Their house got splattered.
2950972	2958495	Actually, I really don't know what that means for Splatterhouse, except that it's not going to be coming out anytime soon unless someone else picks that up.
2959375	2960575	Just let it die.
2961096	2963116	It was a neat idea, but just let it die.
2963737	2964957	Might as well come out at this point.
2965453	2969595	They say that they're actually working on another company that they're going to start from the ground up.
2969855	2976198	I just think it's sad, though, that although it seems like there's a silver lining here that for every door closes, another opens, blah, blah, blah.
2976638	2977498	It's just kind of sad.
2977778	2988003	I seriously feel like this is, again, we had a lot of this at the end of the year last year, but this is like the fourth story I think we've had in the scope of two months about some studio closing down.
2988243	2990404	Well, it's because they're way behind in schedule.
2990424	2996647	That game was supposed to be out at the end of last year, and then they pushed it back to, you know, June, and then it still wasn't done.
2996768	2998568	So, yeah, time to close.
2999169	3002350	WhatUpG in our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com asked a question.
3002410	3004331	Didn't Namco take Splatterhouse internally?
3004612	3006192	I seem to remember hearing that at one point, too.
3006493	3006813	Yeah.
3007293	3014697	Well, actually, yeah, there's nothing about what exactly is going to happen with it, but Namco pulled the development of Splatterhouse back in.
3014717	3016598	That's right, but there hasn't been anything else said about it.
3017028	3018369	Hmm, interesting.
3019630	3027597	All right, well, hopefully those guys, you know, as much as we're making silly jokes about Splatter and House, you know, it does suck when people lose their jobs.
3027657	3031060	So I hope this whole starting a studio from the ground up works out for them.
3031461	3034643	But, you know, just try to get stuff out there as soon as you can.
3035865	3037266	Get the public experience.
3037426	3039368	It's a really tricky balance, isn't it?
3039408	3042811	You want to spend enough time on the products to have a quality product, but at the same time,
3043993	3049256	If you spend too much time on it, you go the way of Duke Nukem Forever and the guys behind that.
3051198	3054220	I am confident that that game will be super epic when it comes out.
3055000	3055621	Whatever you say.
3056221	3057902	I'm completely lying.
3058523	3059863	Don't get your expectations too high.
3060244	3062925	My expectations are incredibly low.
3063246	3063686	Your problem.
3065405	3066246	Oh, lo, then fine.
3066306	3067006	Okay, never mind then.
3067187	3067667	Yeah, yeah.
3067687	3068388	I mean, come on.
3068408	3069168	It's Duke Nukem.
3069208	3070209	That was like in the 90s.
3070710	3071550	I don't remember the 90s.
3072431	3073172	That was a long time ago.
3073872	3074833	Anyways.
3075914	3077776	So... Yes, it's when No Doubt was popular.
3078496	3078957	Exactly.
3080398	3083701	Speaking of something from a long time ago, God of War and God of War 2.
3085122	3088124	Actually, I guess that wasn't that long ago, but hey, it was a few years.
3088185	3089165	That's ancient.
3089666	3089826	But...
3091307	3092588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3112947	3118772	Remember how we were talking about backwards compatibility and how they probably could do it, but they're not?
3119192	3124297	Here's why they're not doing it, because now we can sell every game that we've made over again.
3127108	3128690	I'm okay with it, actually.
3128950	3131974	Because how is this different than what Nintendo's doing in Metroid Prime Trilogy?
3132014	3132835	It isn't different.
3133255	3133836	And you know what?
3134276	3144368	I don't... I think it's kind of cool, because then I can... You know, yeah, and why I'm okay with this, Loki, is because they're going back and they're making the games HD, they're giving them trophies.
3144909	3147351	Sure, they might be old games, but they're giving them new treatment.
3148209	3150351	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3167549	3168971	I guess it was still a trend before.
3169911	3174454	Go back to the PlayStation 1, you would see Super Nintendo games, the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger re-release.
3174915	3182680	It's not like this is anything new, but what I think makes this kind of special and kind of cool is that the games are being souped up a little bit to match the times.
3183561	3185783	I miss the God of War boat back on the PlayStation 2.
3186063	3187704	This actually really interests me.
3187844	3201268	Well, God of War 2 actually did output at 720p because there were a handful of games that were on the PlayStation 2 and on the Xbox that would both either output at 720p or they would do 1080i, which was kind of cool.
3201388	3208330	But God of War 2 was one of the ones that actually did the 720p, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch for them to do that.
3208350	3208890	I remember that now.
3208930	3210990	Wasn't there like a secret code or something you had to put in to do that?
3211010	3211490	Yeah, something like that.
3211510	3211910	That's so weird.
3213311	3213571	But hey...
3214570	3218814	Definitely a good way to get ramped up for the new game coming out, obviously, in March.
3219334	3220055	And true, that is the price.
3220235	3223417	If you're going to buy them both new right now on the PlayStation 2, that is the price that it would be.
3223457	3223557	It's $40.
3236187	3237808	So I think I'm going to wait a little bit for this.
3238048	3240328	Because again, I never played God of War 1 and 2.
3240488	3242949	Well, I played it at a friend's house for a little bit, but I never bought it myself.
3242969	3243869	I played through 1, never played through 2.
3245190	3247350	TigerClaw makes a comment about Metroid Prime.
3247870	3251271	Metroid Prime 3 in Metroid Prime Trilogy was censored a tad.
3251652	3256233	One of the cutscenes had a character say, damn, it was redubbed with a no.
3258049	3259209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3277276	3279018	So listen, I told you not to climb up there.
3279038	3287427	What the... And then it pauses and says, do you want him to say fuck or do you want him to not use any... Fudge!
3288287	3288668	Exactly.
3288688	3289369	What the fudge?
3289429	3291731	And then it just censors the rest of the game like that.
3291791	3294514	And I think that's kind of funny, the way that they give that option to you.
3294634	3295775	That's an interesting way to do it.
3296276	3296416	Hmm.
3298164	3316962	J-Rod in chat gives his quick reviews these are like twitter reviews of these games it's very short but maybe help you out Loki God of War 1 I think has a better story but God of War 2 was overall better yeah I really wish I had played God of War 2 but the thing with God of War 1 is I got so frustrated at the end of the game because the last boss was really hard oh
3317449	3329723	and the last boss glitched out so it didn't quite work right so I beat the crap out of them just over and over and over again even though I know what I was supposed to do in the game but it still wouldn't work because the game glitched out so I just got pissed off with it.
3331155	3331395	All right.
3331735	3333717	Well, let's go back over to the Nintendo Wii for a minute.
3333737	3335638	Of course, we were talking about Metroid Prime Trilogy.
3335778	3340041	One other thing you might be – which actually, by the way, the Metroid Prime games are pretty awesome.
3340101	3345805	So I'm even thinking – I have Metroid Prime 3, but I'm thinking about getting the trilogy because I never had Metroid Prime 1 or 2.
3346145	3346745	I know it's kind of weird.
3346986	3349387	My roommate had them around that time.
3349427	3360435	You know how you can't get, obviously, the Metroid game downloaded to your Game Boy Advance with Metroid Prime Trilogy, but you can get the costume.
3361395	3368298	That was in that game as well to kind of download to the Fusion costume or whatever in the game.
3368338	3369338	That unlocks.
3369758	3370179	Interesting.
3370679	3373320	I'm curious what other kind of synergy between the three games there is, if any.
3374080	3374580	I don't know.
3375201	3378282	Well, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, you know how they had a web browser?
3378322	3381943	They had their Nintendo Internet channel that you could download for a $5 fee?
3382283	3382744	Guess what?
3382824	3386165	Earlier this week in Japan and Europe, that fee went away.
3386585	3389788	and then just a couple days later it also went away in North America.
3390129	3392331	The internet channel is now free to download.
3392371	3395954	So if you have a Wii but you never got the internet channel, you can go ahead and download it.
3395994	3396414	It's free.
3396775	3399117	It used to cost 500 Wii points to download.
3399617	3401199	Actually, I should take a step back.
3401239	3406304	When it first came out, you might remember, if you were an early Wii owner like myself and I think the others in studio here,
3406824	3407905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3430098	3453063	and if you were one of the people that paid 500 Wii points for this sadly Nintendo isn't going to give you the 500 points back but what they are going to do is they're going to give you a 500 point credit towards a virtual console game so at least you get a little something although I don't know if I was one of the people that paid 500 points for it I might be a little sad but then again it's only 5 bucks I don't know 5 bucks is still a lot I guess
3455990	3456310	I don't know.
3456330	3469575	But then again, I'm also kind of like, as much as I think that's cool they're making it free again, unless this new remastered internet channel somehow made it a lot faster to browse the internet on the Wii, I don't think it's going to be that great.
3470855	3472856	Browsing the internet on the Wii is kind of slow.
3473156	3474276	Yeah.
3475977	3476297	I don't know.
3477077	3478938	And what did you do when you were only dial-up?
3479778	3480078	Hmm.
3481670	3482431	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3501246	3503347	or Phantasmagoria, which was on seven CDs.
3503368	3511013	I used to download overnight, and I used to have a download accelerator to basically queue up a bunch of stuff to download.
3511413	3512794	That was my thing.
3513795	3513995	Nice.
3514976	3519078	And some folks in chat want to clarify, X-Link says the credit was only for Japan.
3519218	3520619	Actually, no, it did open up.
3520740	3522000	Go check out Nintendo.com.
3522821	3523441	It is now.
3523521	3526964	There is just a NES virtual console download credit that you can get now.
3527444	3554441	and it's not 500 points clarifies Deke Bandit as a free NES game that's right it's basically a credit towards a free NES virtual console game which of course is 500 points but you can't like take the 500 points and apply it towards a Sega game or something else has to be an NES game so there you go alright let's move on with some more news it would help if my brain worked yes it would it's kind of required to do a show
3556386	3568614	Well, actually, you know that the new Halo 3 ODST is supposed to be coming out and it has a launch date of September 22nd for, of course, Xbox 360.
3569255	3579922	But there are people out there who are playing illegitimate copies, meaning they either have a burn of some kind or received a copy that they weren't supposed to receive.
3580882	3606973	and um so uh the uh big Microsoft enforcer dude went on Twitter and said and I quote I spy with my little eye some illegitimate ODST players no early play for you commencing permabans and except for those who actually have legit copies like early um you know actual true early copies for reviewers and that type of thing they're okay um
3607734	3612839	Or if you have an actual legit copy of the game that you happen to get early, then that's okay too apparently.
3615361	3619745	I don't understand why people are playing the one that's out there now because the leaked one that's out there is actually in French.
3620866	3621867	I'm kind of curious.
3621967	3623368	Some people know French.
3623489	3624049	Yeah, that's true.
3624730	3625610	I'm kind of curious.
3626071	3628853	I mean, we import Japanese games even though we can't read Japanese.
3628934	3629234	Come on.
3629854	3629934	Um...
3630885	3631706	I'm kind of curious, though.
3631846	3633527	How are they able to spot the difference?
3633667	3635488	Or is that some type of secret they're not saying?
3635828	3638170	They're claiming that's a secret.
3638250	3638970	I don't think they know.
3639370	3641152	I think they're just going after whomever.
3642172	3643253	But what if they get it wrong?
3645464	3646084	I think you're wrong.
3646124	3647625	I don't think that they know.
3647705	3649026	There's a way they can tell the difference.
3649066	3649846	No, that's what they're doing.
3649866	3652047	They're basically... Or is this a scare tactic?
3652167	3653388	I think it's a scare tactic.
3653468	3664354	And the other thing I think is, if you want to think the real conspiracy theory to it, is that people are thinking that this is actually a copy that they leaked out that's...
3665234	3671717	Modified in a way that they can flag people that have played it or something like that, which would be entrapment, but I don't see how they're doing that.
3672958	3687585	I'm guessing that it's because you're going to see a bunch of people all playing this French-English version of it, like in the United States or something like that, and people are going to be like, Huh, I'm pretty sure that they didn't buy that from wherever it was released at.
3687785	3690567	It's probably going to be a hacked version.
3691107	3692748	I need a weapon, I'm Mr. Chef
3719235	3719735	Master Chef.
3720456	3722357	Oh, he put Chef, but it's supposed to be Chief.
3722858	3723698	That's why I read Chef.
3724839	3729983	Although I would like a game called Master Chef to come out next to Cooking Mama.
3730763	3734946	Anyhow, Deekman in chat says it's the same way they tell if people are playing burn games on live.
3734986	3735427	They can't.
3735587	3739690	A lot of the new stuff that's out there now makes it very difficult for them to do that.
3740150	3741091	They're really stealth.
3742512	3747318	I would know, I played modified Grand Theft Auto 4's for like, what, how many months now?
3747838	3749721	Yeah, it's still risky, you know it's risky.
3750101	3750842	Yeah.
3751663	3756549	Alright, let's go around the globe and explore some upcoming release dates from around the globe.
3758197	3760479	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3774688	3775388	Darkest of Days, PC, Xbox 360
3797037	3797478	Cool.
3798058	3799440	That's what Bob was talking about earlier, right?
3799640	3801142	It's going to be awesome, seriously.
3802083	3804085	Trine coming to PC this week.
3805066	3807990	Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days on PSP.

3820166	3822827	You had another sports game collection.
3822867	3826188	Oh, this one has rooftop hockey, so I kind of had to think of a little bit of clerks there.
3826508	3827089	That was kind of funny.
3828309	3837372	Cubed, the Q Games collection coming to Xbox 360 with your resin Every Extend Extra Extreme.
3838493	3840274	Time of Shadows on PC.
3841914	3847419	Dirt 2 coming to PlayStation 3, DS, Xbox 360, and Wii.
3849280	3851121	And I thought PSP as well.
3852462	3854604	Imagine Detectives on DS.

3887718	3890099	LittleBigPlanet Game of the Year Edition coming out on PlayStation 3.
3890979	3901903	And of course the big one, the Beatles Rock Band coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, as well as the standalone instruments and your two different bundles that are available for that.
3902703	3907005	Finally, if you have little kids that want to learn to read, they have three different games for you for the DS.
3907065	3908706	My Virtual Tutor Reading K-1, Pre-K-K, and 1-2.
3908726	3910346	Also coming out...
3916479	3917079	Thanks for watching!
3935805	3938368	Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story Xbox 360 Elite
3958807	3963388	The Last Remnant, speaking of price reductions, is getting one this week on the 360, as is Fable 2.
3963488	3969410	Both of those games moving into the Platinum Collection, as well as Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, and Bioshock.
3969830	3974552	So I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft's doing a little push in Japan right now with all these recent price drops.
3974572	3975412	That's all happening on...
3975852	3976933	The 10th of this month.
3977293	3985758	Also happening on the 10th of this month, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, the Japanese localized version, is out on the PlayStation 3, so check that out.
3986118	3989900	As well as, of course, a price drop as well for Call of Duty 4 over there as well.
3990681	3993282	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.
3993743	3995824	Forever Blue 2 next week, but not this week.
3996204	3998707	also another House of the Dead game but we'll cover that next week.
3999108	4001631	PlayStation 2 nothing this week either.
4001851	4003834	It's all on the 17th of September.
4003854	4005596	There's not much coming out on PlayStation 2 right now.
4006024	4006684	The Engagement on Desert
4034431	4035911	That's what you got for Japanese releases this week.
4058069	4061452	Well, for the UK, we have some, I mean, pretty much the standard stuff.
4061892	4063274	On the 9th is Beatles Rock Band.
4063834	4077446	On the 11th, we have Championship Manager 2010, Colin McRae Dirt 2, yay, Guitar Hero 5, Mini Ninjas, NHL 2K10, and Section 8.
4078407	4080428	Also, Rob, there's something on the 15th that you might be interested in.
4081109	4081910	Zuma's Revenge.
4082729	4083430	I've heard about this.
4084010	4087193	I think this has a similar release date here in the US if it's not out already.
4087493	4088855	Yeah, it's kind of like a sequel to Zuma.
4089475	4091317	Not my favorite PopCap game.
4091357	4096101	My problem with Zuma is it's not something you can sit down and play quickly, like a game of Bejeweled or something.
4096401	4102006	Zuma takes a long time to get through a game because not only does it take a little while to beat each level, but then you have three lives.
4102627	4103948	So I'm not as big on Zuma.
4103968	4104688	Um...
4106038	4108859	But there are other PopCap games I really enjoy.
4109059	4112361	And I know I still got a copy of Bookworm Adventures 2 I need to play.
4112941	4113721	No, don't laugh.
4113761	4114622	I know, I know.
4114742	4116242	I'm laughing because I've played it.
4116582	4117103	It's fun.
4117323	4118043	It's a lot of fun.
4118083	4119584	It's Final Fantasy meets Boggle.
4119644	4120224	It's amazing.
4121064	4123025	So I do want to check out the sequel.
4123445	4127487	By the way, Rob, I have to say, I like your shirt and all of its Helvetica-ness.
4127915	4128275	Thank you.
4150413	4151754	You and your font hornus.
4151794	4153015	No, it's Helvetic, I swear.
4153115	4155317	Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
4155537	4155838	Alright.
4156538	4157159	Let's move on.
4157179	4159621	A couple more stories for you before we get to the classic game of the week.
4160816	4169602	Yes, this week we had the debut of the new trailer for the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4, The Ballad of Gay Tony.
4170323	4180810	And with that, it looks like it's going to be returning back to the over-the-top Grand Theft Auto fun that you can expect from the rest of the series.
4181771	4183552	Some new stuff to note in there.
4183892	4187255	There are some new weapons that they did kind of show off in the trailer.
4187635	4187855	A new...
4188976	4189476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4211212	4212733	Subway Car, which is kind of cool.
4213093	4218174	They had a golf cart in there as well, and some new sports cars.
4218874	4220274	So that's going to be kind of fun.
4220354	4221995	Did you notice what the song in the trailer was?
4222055	4222715	Yes, I did.
4222735	4231217	I thought that was quite... Those that listen to the Orange Laundry after birth that we only do live for a little bit after we tape live will understand why that's funny.
4231877	4234098	And then also they had...
4235205	4240907	Apparently there was some other stuff rumored that there's a FIB tank in the game.
4241927	4244108	Like their SWAT tank or something.
4245449	4245729	I don't know.
4245749	4246569	It's going to be awesome.
4246689	4249970	I'm looking forward to this because they ruined my modded games.
4252271	4255492	Right now, I'm seriously... It's like we're coming out of depression or something.
4256512	4259373	Going back to playing the normal game is just wrong.
4260074	4260254	But...
4261465	4265966	There are some pretty cool stuff coming for that.
4266226	4272408	Oh, also out of the trailer, though, of course they had a lot of different cutscenes in there and they recognized some of the characters.
4272868	4278130	One of them I was kind of interested by is Gracie, which was actually one of the missions in Grand Theft Auto IV.
4278150	4279870	You had to kidnap her, which is kind of funny.
4280350	4281831	But she's in there as well.
4283351	4284972	Overall, it looks awesome.
4285032	4287632	I'm not as big of a Grand Theft Auto IV player as you are.
4288052	4289113	Who is Gay Tony?
4289193	4289993	He's like a mom boss?
4290253	4291294	Yeah, he's a mob boss.
4291314	4293336	He's Tony Prince, is the guy.
4293436	4301802	He basically owns nightclubs, and he's a member of the Ancelotti Crime Syndicate.
4302643	4309849	And basically, he owns the biggest gay and straight nightclubs in Algonquin.
4310770	4311830	So that's who you play...
4312831	4322299	You don't play him, but you play a guy that kind of helps him out, Luis Fernando Lopez, which is like this Dominican guy that you play as.
4322339	4323400	He's his bodyguard.
4324181	4337111	And the games, all three episodes, including the main game, all kind of culminate around this diamond deal that goes down and goes wrong, and that's the Impossible Trinity is each one of their...
4338192	4347550	Rolls in this diamond deal And if I remember correctly, I think Louise comes in And actually breaks up the diamond deal And tries to steal the diamonds So that's definitely going to be part of the game
4348891	4363720	I got a weird question for you, but as kind of like the gay guy on the program, and who isn't as familiar with Grand Theft Auto 4, I'm kind of curious, not to get all glad on you, but I'm curious, like, is this like a step forward for gay rights, or is this going to be a bunch of stereotypes?
4363780	4367182	Like, does gay Tony go around going, that's super!
4367302	4369764	No, he didn't really do that.
4370264	4373346	There was a character, though, in Grand Theft Auto 4 that was like that.
4373886	4374287	Yeah.
4374927	4377548	I don't remember his name, but yeah, he was very flamboyant.
4377608	4379489	But he didn't seem flamboyant in the trailer.
4380409	4382990	Of course, he wasn't talking much, but I don't think he is.
4383610	4389952	Because, you know, I'm totally cool with it if it's like, you know, hey, you have a gay character who's like a cool mob boss and all this stuff, just like anybody else.
4390393	4394714	But, you know, if it's just going to be stereotype after stereotype, then I'm just going to facepalm.
4394914	4396615	Well, I don't think it's going to be.
4396875	4399436	I mean, they're usually pretty, you know...
4399929	4400249	Yeah, I know.
4400309	4402891	Rockstar's pretty good about that stuff, usually.
4403031	4404512	So I'm hopeful.
4405072	4407653	I'm just hoping they don't add any more full frontal penis again.
4407673	4409514	Because that was enough in the last game.
4409895	4411275	We don't need full frontal penis in this game.
4411295	4414837	But you wouldn't have any problem with full boobage and everything?
4414857	4416438	Yeah, because they haven't done that in this game.
4416478	4417179	And I'm surprised.
4417219	4421321	It being an emirated game and stuff, for nudity and that kind of stuff, there's no...
4421821	4423682	It's establishment of a double standard.
4423702	4425764	You don't want to see cock, but you don't want to see boobs.
4425804	4427064	No, I don't want to see more cock.
4427104	4428565	There already is cock in the game.
4428705	4433308	Now I want to see boobs that go along with the cock so we have an equal representation.
4433328	4436110	You want equal opportunity nudity.
4436190	4438311	I actually support his statement.
4438591	4440413	I can go for equal opportunity nudity.
4440833	4442114	I don't have a problem with it.
4442154	4444135	I'm just saying that they need to, like, you know...
4444693	4445354	I don't know, but whatever
4458695	4459175	It's a game.
4459215	4460055	What the hell do I care?
4460395	4462916	It's just characters.
4462956	4466557	But it's just funny how there's a lot of people out there that says, Oh, because it's gay Tony.
4466617	4468397	I hope we don't have to see more cock.
4468737	4472058	You know, I hope just for that you get beaver shot in this.
4472138	4473338	Just for that kind of ignorant comment.
4473358	4474099	It's going to be cool.
4474219	4475359	This game is going to be awesome.
4475599	4478620	And I'm just hoping, though, that they bring back the tank.
4478940	4480040	Because the tanks are awesome.
4480640	4483081	The minigun, the flamethrower, and the chainsaw.
4483881	4484421	And that's it.
4484841	4486322	But already I like where they're going with it.
4486462	4488202	So I can't wait to play it.
4490840	4494061	One more story for you guys, and then we're going to go to the classic game of the week.
4494101	4497922	And this story has to actually do with the 360, where this download content is.
4497982	4499543	By the way, random-ass question.
4500083	4504324	When they announced the Grand Theft Auto 4 exclusive content, it is never coming to the PlayStation 3.
4505224	4505784	Is that correct?
4505864	4506805	As far as we're aware.
4507605	4512146	But maybe someday they might say, okay, Windows over, we're going to release this disc now on PlayStation 3.
4512246	4512986	Let me put it this way.
4513506	4515767	It could be ported in a heartbeat.
4516147	4517790	Yeah, I can see that.
4517850	4519012	I'm just kind of curious.
4519092	4523318	I mean, since all the formats are basically the same, it's just recoding the textures and that's it.
4523479	4523699	Alright.
4524884	4525745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4548783	4550266	If the system is in HD mode.
4550506	4553812	And apparently anti-aliasing is also out.
4553872	4556878	Full screen anti-aliasing you do not have to do.
4557639	4557699	Um...
4559025	4560806	Those requirements are now out.
4561246	4580977	Now, Microsoft kind of was lenient on these rules before, and one very, very notable game that got around these rules is Halo 3, because you might remember, and I remember some stories on this when Halo 3 first came out, it's not running in true 720p, it's running at 1152 by 640, so it's 100 pixels short on either side.
4580997	4584279	Apparently Call of Duty 4 is also 600p also.
4584939	4585459	Interesting.
4585919	4586080	So...
4588944	4594605	I don't think this is a huge deal because I'm all about frame rate a little more than resolution.
4594985	4599926	I mean, granted, a great game should have both great resolution and good frame rate, something like Oblivion or whatever.
4600347	4605688	But some of the games that get really busy online, they have to scale back the resolution a little bit.
4606128	4608768	So why now, though?
4608928	4611869	I'm kind of wondering if they decided to get rid of this.
4612529	4622275	Is this because maybe 360 has enough penetration in the marketplace now so they don't need to be advertising all this HD, HD, HD?
4622956	4623316	I don't know.
4623376	4633722	Maybe there's a big game coming out that didn't have this or something and they figured that, hey, let's make this available so that it's fair for everybody.
4633942	4634263	I don't know.
4634283	4636184	Maybe it makes it easier to develop on the system.
4637000	4638521	Alpha Cananogram has an interesting thought.
4638561	4639922	Maybe it's for the indie games.
4640843	4643304	I don't know if the indie games were ever held to the same standard.
4643665	4644585	I don't think so either.
4644886	4645566	It's a good thought, though.
4646487	4649829	Yeah, because I don't think a lot of the indie games I've played have full-screen anti-aliasing.
4649849	4652571	I'm trying to think if that actually... Hmm.
4653471	4653692	Anyway.
4655769	4656510	Well, there it is.
4656670	4660871	The technical certifications are changing, so we'll see what games come of that a little later on.
4660891	4664432	But for now, let's go to a classic video game in a little segment.
4665092	4666933	We like to call it the classic video game of the week.
4666953	4675496	This is the part of the show where DarkSakura likes to browse the gaming vault and find a game that she says, you know what?
4676156	4680637	You kids should be playing this game this week, or at least check it out and show this game a little respect.
4680917	4682738	DarkSakura, what game did you pick for the kids this week?
4683582	4684143	Sonic Team Sonic Team
4700700	4702402	Alright, tell us a little bit about Choo Choo Rocket.
4702663	4706868	Just out of curiosity, does this have to do with the fact that it's 9-9 of 0-9 this week?
4707749	4715499	No, actually, it has to do with Dan fussing because I don't put in games he suggests, or I already have put in games that he suggested.
4717150	4742582	Cat Mania So yeah, I put in Choo Choo Rocket So this was one of the first of the online games that came on the Dreamcast And then they just started giving it away with the Dreamcast as an online demo And it was also given away free in Europe When you would order a copy Well, you could order your copy by connecting to the Dream Arena service
4743922	4752265	The whole point of the game is to get mice, as in choo-choo, because in Japanese that's the sound a mouse makes, it's choo.
4752785	4759487	You get them onto a rocket while avoiding the cats, or the kapu-kapu, that roam around the board.
4760888	4768070	You have to place down arrows to determine the path the mice are going to take, because they just keep going in a straight line until they run into a wall.
4768630	4769150	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4799997	4808823	and you can get special colored mice like a gold mouse will give you 50 extra mice a pink mouse gives you those events like we were talking about the cat mania, the mouse mania
4811713	4820439	But the single-player mode is actually, I think, my favorite because it's really... It's really... It gets super complex.
4820479	4830846	It really turns into a matter of figuring out how you're gonna get from point A to point B when you've got all these obstacles in your path and all you have is a limited number of arrows.
4831006	4832647	This game is fucking fast-paced, too.
4832747	4834408	I mean, that was my biggest problem with it.
4834428	4835909	It was too fast for me to keep up with.
4836409	4838331	They need, like, choo-choo slow...
4839946	4856386	Well, you also got a challenge mode where you have to get all the mice into rockets or get a cat to eat all the mice or put the cat into a guarded rocket or other stuff and you had a time limit on it and it had 25 levels.
4856426	4858308	You could do that actually one or two player or two.
4858829	4870273	There's a Game Boy Advance version that's really the same as the Dreamcast version, but you can actually play with one cartridge multiplayer.
4871714	4874855	Well, y'all said a level editor in it, too.
4876476	4879737	Actually, the Game Boy Advance version wasn't made by Sega.
4882515	4886836	Also in Sonic Battle, Tails has a choo-choo for his landmine.
4889798	4891278	So yeah, it's a pretty fun little game.
4892319	4895980	And it's just fun.
4896520	4896781	Play it.
4897901	4898181	Alright.
4898241	4898801	Get Dreamcast.
4899322	4900482	Choo-choo rocket.
4900502	4901202	Dreamcast.
4901462	4908345	Which Jamie swears has nothing to do with the 9909 or 99, whatever you want to call it, anniversary of the Dreamcast this week.
4908605	4909566	It's the classic game of the week.
4911206	4912067	Chew, chew.
4913007	4916831	Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4916931	4922695	We always like to take a break in the middle of the show to just kind of stretch, you know, refill our drinks or go to the restroom or what have you.
4923116	4931042	So we suggest taking an opportunity to do the same because there is plenty more to come in Part B of our show tonight, including Twitter topics, rapid fire news tonight, and more long discussion.
4931062	4933905	We're going to talk about Blur, which is a racing game I am really looking forward to.
4934105	4935186	It's Damon Auburn.
4936405	4936826	Blur!
4937066	4938227	Blur the racing game, silly.
4938587	4943370	We're going to talk about a brand new reality show coming to Sony, PlayStation Network.
4943430	4946092	It sounds kind of interesting would be the word for it.
4946672	4949134	And 3D, possibly on the PlayStation 3.
4949414	4950955	Some interesting developments with that this week.
4951515	4955217	So we're going to do all that right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4955258	4955698	Stay tuned!
4961667	4964990	Welcome back, everybody, to Part B of our podcast.
4965470	4967432	We're taping live on this Sunday evening, September 6, 2009.
4967952	4972837	Happy Labor Day to all of our American listeners who get tomorrow off of work.
4973837	4980363	Or, you know, if it's not America that you're from, then just have a happy Monday or happy week wherever you're at.
4980703	4986548	We're going to get into some more gaming news as we tape live on this Sunday evening at www.allgames.com.
4988220	4995789	And we have Bobby Blackwolf joining us earlier in the show, live from Seattle, where he had just wrapped up Penny Arcade Expo, which just came to a close earlier.
4996150	5000535	Any word on what the final game was in their little PAX... What do they call that?
5000555	5002437	The little PAX... Megathon, thank you.
5003218	5004520	Any word on what the final game was yet?
5005301	5006122	Has that hit the internet?
5006742	5009365	I don't think I've seen it on the internet, but I will look.
5026124	5026784	Props.
5027405	5028707	Mega props to you guys.
5028747	5029248	Oh my god.
5029808	5035716	No pressure or anything, but can you imagine the amount of pressure that it all comes down to skee-ball?
5036256	5039861	That reminds me, though, there was a pricing game on The Price is Right, because your shirt reminds me of this, too.
5039881	5041523	Loki's wearing a Price is Right shirt today, everybody.
5041543	5042043	You should see it.
5042664	5042744	Um...
5043605	5048189	There was a skee-ball game that, like, if you could hit the target on the skee-ball, you'd win, like, a new car.
5048449	5049910	Like, that's almost as much pressure.
5050371	5066544	Well, it's, like, okay, so the rounds as it went, the first round was Mario Kart Wii, the second round was Bookworm Adventures, round three was Halo 3 ODST, round four was the Beatles Rock Band, round five was Kinect 4, and then, of course, the final round being skee-ball.
5067265	5071628	Very interesting, because you have, like, some new games mixed with some board games...
5072449	5074109	Very good mix at the Omegathon this year.
5074789	5075110	Awesome.
5076470	5079550	Alright, we're going to get back into our show tonight.
5079570	5081291	We're going to start off with some Twitter topics.
5082471	5084911	Oh, we have theme song now for Twitter topics, don't we?
5085631	5086612	I totally forgot to queue it up.
5086912	5088232	I'm a bad host tonight.
5088892	5089252	Fired!
5091232	5092453	Hold on a minute, let me get the theme song here.
5092473	5093553	Only if we get to use fire.
5095533	5097154	Any exciting plans for Labor Day, you guys?
5098474	5099194	I'm going to sleep.
5101007	5103868	Rob, we have to do something tomorrow.
5104808	5105449	Maybe, we'll see.
5105489	5107029	I kind of want to just stay in and play WoW all day.
5107249	5108689	Well, I know what's going on tonight.
5109170	5109530	What's that?
5110190	5112470	Becky's going to come over tonight and we're going to watch My Fair Lady.
5112730	5113191	Fun!
5113571	5116151	Any reason why you were just deciding to get into old school musicals?
5116351	5116972	Just for the fun of it?
5118052	5120853	I really don't remember how to except that it was very random.
5120873	5122553	Nothing wrong with that.
5122613	5125494	But we're thinking about going to Yog-Yog after the show.
5127111	5127512	FNANDO
5156115	5157276	asked the very first question.
5157356	5159578	What if there was a mariachi band as a game?
5160659	5162620	It might sound a little like our background music.
5164061	5165262	I'd play a mariachi game.
5165362	5168104	I would totally play one, but I think the novelty would honestly wear off.
5168485	5169245	Let's be honest.
5169686	5171367	There was that tambourine game.
5171507	5177492	I don't know if you've ever seen this, but the makers of Samba de Amigo, at least in the arcade, also made a tambourine game.
5177532	5179093	And I forget the name of this game.
5179593	5182455	It is the gayest game I've ever played in my life.
5182515	5183977	And I use that term to mean...
5184597	5186078	Thank you for watching!
5208720	5213902	TigerClaw305 says, there's a story here he's linking us to.
5214222	5222186	The creator of Mobile Suit Gundam says that video games are evil and links us to a story that ran on Gamasutra earlier this week.
5222546	5232190	Apparently, Yoshiuki Tomino gave a keynote speech at the CEDEC game conference and said, quote, I think that video games are evil.
5233086	5239731	Gaming is not a type of activity that provides any support to our daily lives and all these consoles are just consuming electricity.
5240211	5244795	Let's say we have about 3 billion people on this planet wasting their time bringing no productivity at all.
5245175	5247997	Add 10 billion more people and what would happen to our planet?
5248277	5250659	Video games are assisting the death of our planet.
5251880	5252761	Okay, crazy man.
5252781	5254642	Way to bite the hand that feeds you, right?
5255883	5256163	I don't know.
5256183	5257304	Why would he say something like that?
5257844	5258245	I don't know.
5259005	5262388	Gundam is unlike every fucking game platform ever in Japan.
5267306	5272810	Redertainment wants us to talk about this topic.
5273251	5277034	Most people complain that early adopters are getting screwed over.
5277374	5280257	Does the PS3 Slim mean it the other way around?
5281357	5284000	That's kind of been true of Sony for a long time.
5285037	5285897	Thanks for watching!
5308445	5313932	But I do find the whole lack of even software emulation and the removal of Linux, I do find that odd.
5314313	5315334	Like the rest of it I get.
5315454	5316996	I get why they take out USB slots.
5317316	5318418	I get some of this other stuff.
5318478	5321081	I get that the Slim might have a slightly longer loading time.
5321421	5322763	The rest of this I don't think I get.
5323244	5323804	Does that make sense?
5324305	5324826	It makes sense.
5326055	5327456	I don't understand why they removed Linux.
5327696	5336822	I mean, I understand that maybe no one's using that function, but I don't see how that function really did anything unless people found a way to hack the PS3 through Linux.
5337503	5339084	Which, I don't know.
5339344	5340165	I haven't heard of that.
5340205	5342847	It actually would be fairly easy using Linux, I would think.
5343227	5345208	No, I think they keep everything separated.
5345809	5347190	But, I don't understand.
5348567	5348887	Whatever.
5378590	5381512	If you want more information, I urge you to follow them on Twitter.
5381892	5385914	They're at twitter.com slash fundarazor I just linked it in chat.
5386434	5392097	F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R They only have 10 followers right now.
5392137	5393017	It's for charity.
5393318	5394418	They should have 10,000.
5395079	5396019	Check out that event near you.
5396059	5397420	I'm going to try and go to the one in San Francisco.
5397440	5398640	In fact, I'm pretty sure I will be going.
5399841	5403883	Well, I kind of told Seg I would, so I'm going to go and then probably take the next day off work so I can go.
5404243	5405064	I'd like to go.
5405084	5405504	You want to go?
5405704	5405884	Sure.
5405924	5406965	We'll cover it for OLR.
5406985	5407465	It'll be fun.
5407805	5408565	DarkSakura.com
5437657	5448385	and once more fans on Facebook I don't think I'm following them on Facebook yet so I will go add them myself a little later in the show but again that's F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R and K.O.
5448405	5466318	Ray is reminding us about Extra Life which is the marathon that's also happening on October 17th that we talked about last week Extra Life SG is their Twitter so two great events one in October one in December do them both think of the children damn you and how crunchy they are shush
5467278	5473021	and Spazinator says PlayStation 3 firmware 3.0 unannounced or hidden feature.
5473661	5476923	The addition of print screen and screenshot to the web browser.
5477023	5477724	I was not aware.
5478224	5478984	It's going to be interesting.
5479845	5485208	I mean, nothing you can't already do on a PC, but I guess it's kind of nice to have that on the PlayStation.
5485248	5487609	You know that screenshotting is coming to home as well.
5488430	5491091	And they're going to do like a first person view so you can screenshot there.
5491211	5492752	So check that out.
5494557	5498463	Um, I think that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
5498984	5499745	Alright, I'll do one more.
5499785	5502810	TKL Ray says, uh, just beat Batman Arkham Asylum.
5502830	5503671	What do you guys think of it?
5503691	5505093	That game was beautiful.
5505594	5507617	And Dan was playing a lot of it while Misty was here.
5507938	5508138	Yeah.
5508338	5508779	And, um...
5509760	5513522	and of course, and who's also here right now, our other friend Mystique.
5513542	5517564	So we had Misty and Misty and me making commentary the entire time.
5517604	5522606	We were doing the MST3K version of Batman Arkham Asylum and it was pretty funny.
5523086	5525267	And then every time Harley came out, I was like, Harley!
5525588	5525968	So yeah.
5526508	5528349	Pretty good, but I wish it had more of an ending.
5528709	5530349	I know you're a fangirl of the comics.
5531149	5531390	I am.
5532870	5533710	And the comic series.
5534190	5534390	What?
5534611	5534991	I'm not.
5535051	5536111	I don't like DC Comics.
5536311	5537852	I thought you would like the show.
5537912	5539272	I'm sorry, I meant the comic book show.
5540292	5542833	I watch some of the animated series.
5542873	5544934	I'm not the world's biggest Batman fan.
5545394	5546174	Dan loves it.
5546294	5546974	Dan loves it.
5547255	5548015	I am not.
5548315	5549295	Mystique just came in.
5550075	5551176	Has Mystique ever been on the show?
5551556	5551756	No.
5551776	5551816	No.
5552556	5553177	Come here, Mystique.
5553197	5553757	Wait, come here, come here.
5553817	5554718	Let's end Twitter topics.
5554738	5555819	Let's talk to Mystique for a little bit.
5555839	5556539	Hi, Mystique.
5556579	5557040	How are you?
5557320	5557941	Hey, what's up?
5558261	5558641	Good.
5558721	5562784	Just talk loud and strong in that microphone because it's kind of sensitive.
5563004	5564145	You don't want me to be that loud.
5565586	5569109	You hold in your hand a bunch of DC, what is this, DVDs of movies?
5569569	5569870	Yes.
5570230	5574733	It is Superman, the animated series, and Justice League Unlimited.
5575074	5579717	Are you guys going to Mystery Science 3000, like the movie you were watching last week when I was here?
5580057	5580738	Possibly.
5580778	5581198	Possibly.
5581699	5581959	Lots of.
5584230	5586632	Oh, there might be fighting going on over the TV.
5587232	5588153	There's going to be a throwdown.
5588213	5589114	Oh, there's going to be a throwdown.
5589674	5591115	What do you think of Batman Arkham Asylum?
5591896	5600062	I cannot wait to play that game, even though I watched a lot of it with Dan, although I'm really upset that I can't play the Joker in the Xbox 360.
5600102	5601022	Oh, because he has the 360 version.
5601042	5601523	He has the 360 version.
5603669	5607770	He just had to tell me after I made a decision of which one I was gonna buy.
5607830	5610631	I'm like, hmm, both of them went down in price.
5610951	5615132	You know, I think I'm gonna get the 360 since I have Netflix and all that.
5615212	5619814	And then Dan had to go and tell me, you know, on the PS3, you can play the Joker.
5619954	5620934	I was like, you're a bastard.
5622844	5623645	We need to get a bigger room!
5648143	5649503	I think we need a bigger box.
5650104	5650364	All right.
5650724	5651844	It's time to get a bigger boat.
5652805	5653325	That's a shark.
5653645	5653905	All right.
5654325	5654965	Twitter topics.
5655045	5655966	We're done with that for tonight.
5656026	5658306	So thank you guys very much for contributing to Twitter topics.
5658386	5660907	Let's get back into some gaming news.
5660967	5662528	Actually, Rapid Fire News is up next.
5662868	5664829	So some quick gaming news starting from Loki.
5664949	5665149	Yes.
5665949	5671551	Uncharted 2, of course, is getting a collector's edition, which will be coming out with the game in October.
5672291	5675773	And with the collector's edition, you will be able to get a replica knife.
5676234	5679355	Yes, because that's what gamers need things to stab stuff with.
5679595	5680176	I want a knife.
5681437	5681677	Yes.
5682497	5683358	Now that's a knife.
5685499	5693764	Yes, it's the Fortune Hunter edition, and it does come with the replica of the game's mysterious ancient artifact.
5694464	5694644	And...
5697992	5698412	I don't know.
5698672	5703933	But yeah, it is going to be very limited, and I guess apparently only available through GameStop.
5704453	5707194	Which, you know, they get all the limited editions nowadays.
5707974	5708374	I don't know why.
5709814	5720517	Konami, in kind of a strange turn of events, is publishing the new 99 Nights game, 99 Nights 2, which, judging by the screenshot, looks way better than the first one.
5721357	5721497	And...
5723257	5723637	Guitar Hero 5
5739491	5741432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5763525	5777672	And the week after that, they're going to be getting the AFI Track Pack, which is going to include Beautiful Thieves, Girls Not Grey, and The Missing Frame, also available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft Points.
5778112	5782634	Or, of course, the Track Packs as a whole you can buy in a bundle for $5.49.
5782674	5783195	And then finally...
5786249	5789492	September 24th we'll be getting another track pack.
5790252	5801401	No name for this track pack, but apparently it includes the editors with Munich, Faint with Geeks Were Right, and the Yayayas with Dull Life.
5801822	5804864	Also available for $2 each or $5.49 for the pack.
5806025	5807006	And that's it.
5808407	5808927	Bit.Trip.Void
5833004	5833566	Thank you for watching!
5841564	5843285	The Bit.Trip games are actually a lot of fun.
5843305	5845687	I wonder if they'll release a compilation of this a little later on.
5845747	5846107	I don't know.
5846667	5847828	That could be a very fun game.
5848108	5850610	I don't think there is a release date yet announced for this.
5850630	5852231	They just say later this year.
5852331	5853691	By the way, it was playable at PAX.
5854292	5855993	So some folks already got to play it.
5856873	5861076	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Attack is coming to the Nintendo DS.
5862037	5863778	Apparently it's a brand new game.
5864238	5867720	It has the arcade style controls like you see in Turtles in Time.
5868260	5870162	And you are going up against Shredder.
5870823	5873321	by the way this was also shown at PAX
5874554	5876976	You lucky PAX attendees getting your hands on some early stuff.
5877396	5884020	Another game that's coming out onto Xbox Live Arcade, Puzzle Bobble Live coming out in Japan.
5884981	5894887	It will probably make its way over here as Bust a Move Live or something like that over here in America because there's that whole fact that Bust a Move over here is actually Puzzle Bobble.
5894907	5902932	Why they call it Bust a Move and then ruined the name of the actual Bust a Move game as Bust a Groove over here, I will never understand that.
5903012	5903753	I have an answer for that.
5904213	5906515	Why do they call Puzzle Bobble Bust a Move here?
5906535	5907296	Because they're stupid.
5907957	5908277	Oh, okay.
5908337	5909538	That makes perfect sense.
5909898	5915143	Anyway, the game's coming out in Japan on September 30th for 800 Microsoft points.
5915964	5919748	No comment yet on North America or Europe release dates.
5920428	5922249	I'm sure the games will be ported soon enough.
5922269	5924609	That's a pretty standard game.
5925610	5930271	Do you remember on the PlayStation 2, Bust a Move was one of the first games that came out for it?
5930651	5935413	And on the cover, it had a baby wearing sunglasses and had a big bubble that said Bust a Move.
5935533	5936153	It made no sense.
5936213	5937473	It made no sense at all.
5937493	5940374	That was Bust a Move 2 that had the baby, I think, on the cover.
5940394	5942035	Seriously, what the hell was that?
5943095	5947897	That just sums up in a nutshell the transition of Puzzle Bobble to Bust a Move.
5948117	5948997	I just never understand.
5950259	5950680	Never get it.
5952022	5953865	Bochikawa says it's copyright infringement.
5953885	5954727	Forget on what, though.
5955508	5955788	Really?
5957311	5957792	Whatever.
5958132	5959555	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5960208	5961109	I have some stuff.
5963530	5969813	Actually, some kind of interesting news in looking at almost an international point of view.
5969833	5977057	First of all, as in Japan, the PlayStation 3 sales have plummeted.
5977617	5978278	Woo!
5978758	5980779	With, you know, my bad sound effects.
5982720	5983441	That actually...
5985561	5989042	is going ahead of the PS3 Slim launch.
5993703	5998565	They've gone for the regular PS3.
5998845	6004946	It's only sold 1,040 units with last week.
6005206	6007027	However, the Xbox 360 rose to sell 7,254 units.
6007127	6008227	Of course...
6016463	6026968	There's a little bit of Nintendo sale drop but they're still pushing a lot of the DSi and DS Lite.
6029665	6043680	As far as other stuff going on, for some rock band news, there's a new PAX track that's going to be Freeze Pop, Jonathan Colton, MC Frontalot, and Paul and Storm.
6044681	6047224	And each song will be $1 a piece.
6048165	6049746	So you've got that.
6049786	6050527	A whole dollar?
6051228	6051368	Yep.
6051769	6055070	Yeah, but it's Freeze Pop and Jonathan Colton and other bands that are pretty cool.
6055110	6057571	I'm going to have both of those at least.
6058291	6059312	And then the last thing.
6059372	6062293	This gets the facepalm award of the night.
6063153	6068055	Other than those idiot people wanting to pull their children out of school so they can't see Obama's speech.
6068755	6069336	So stupid.
6070296	6078599	But yeah, there's a special function for the six axis in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
6079159	6081040	It's going to have six axis support.
6082253	6083134	You know what it's going to do?
6085636	6086156	No, what?
6086276	6086897	Boob jiggle.
6088058	6089699	You can control boob jiggle.
6089779	6091260	It is the next likely progression.
6093001	6093802	Whatever.
6094583	6097245	It's like I was telling Sauce earlier today.
6097285	6101908	I was like, yeah, I bet the developers are sitting around going, we should do something with the six axis.
6103290	6103650	I don't know.
6103690	6104270	What should we do?
6105271	6106572	We could wiggle their boobies.
6106892	6107753	Hey, that works.
6109134	6109474	That's it.
6109554	6111336	I bet the conversation went just like that, too.
6113166	6113456	Thanks for watching!
6114785	6115085	All right.
6116366	6116686	Funny.
6117147	6123291	Let's get back into some longer news that we'll talk a little more about, and then soon your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6123831	6136639	Now, I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy about this or not, and we know that with the new updates, especially coming in the fall, that they're going to be having some support for Facebook support and stuff like that.
6136679	6138320	I know with the Xbox 360.
6138901	6143604	Now, what's interesting, though, is apparently the game Blur coming out is going to have Twitter support.
6144224	6145726	I hope they can turn that off.
6159848	6161228	Yeah, you don't give it your login.
6161248	6162228	That's how you turn it off.
6162429	6163749	This sounds like a horrible idea.
6163869	6164429	I'm sorry.
6164469	6168630	This is a horrible, horrible idea that is just contributing to the problem.
6168690	6169710	And don't get me wrong.
6170310	6174231	I think Blur is an amazing-looking game, and I really enjoy the demo at E3.
6174271	6175011	It's one of my favorites.
6175391	6177871	That being said, the plug needs to be pulled on this immediately.
6178151	6181472	And if you spam this shit to your Twitter and I'm following you right now, you will be dropped.
6181852	6184893	Because unfortunately, and here's the problem with Twitter...
6187432	6188333	I hate Raptor!
6206890	6234790	and it's nothing personal I just you know here's the thing it is personal with me by the way there's a finite amount of tweets that my iPhone Apple download at a time it's 200 tweets and if 20 of those tweets are your fucking friend feed or something I'm sorry that's gonna piss me off because that's 20 things I could have read about somebody else you know that might be like actually about their day or something interesting you know I just I am not a fan of these auto tweets at all and kind of and think they're gonna destroy Twitter
6235550	6237111	Unless something is done about them very soon.
6237371	6239852	Because I know this is not going to be the first or last thing.
6240112	6241953	What, Activision destroy something?
6242153	6244634	Like, I don't know, a beloved guitar franchise?
6245735	6251977	This is just so strange, though, because, you know, usually Bizarre Creations is... We've had them on the show.
6252017	6253018	They're a great studio.
6253638	6257000	And I understand, you know, they're just trying to be on the cutting edge of technology.
6257020	6260001	You should do it really with Facebook.
6260201	6261762	Maybe we're misinterpreting this.
6262522	6275409	and I'll give credit there maybe we need clarification on how exactly this is going to work and I think it's pretty obvious to say if you don't give this game your Twitter login it can't do it so to some extent you're going to have to want it to post to Twitter for you but why?
6275929	6279371	that's the part I failed to see why is this useful?
6280212	6290497	and the other thing too is apparently it's going to feature like a faux social networking site like InnerTube I guess it's their bizarre version of YouTube or something
6292234	6295197	It will have real Twitter support as well.
6296499	6296919	I don't know.
6296959	6303286	I think it's fine if you have updates and stuff like that, but that's something more like Facebook because at least then you can filter it out.
6303386	6307890	But Twitter, I don't want to see updates about stuff like that.
6308271	6308611	I don't know.
6308891	6314277	Or maybe it gives you the option, like say you won first place and you get the option, do you want to tweet this or not?
6315420	6318484	That might be a little more tolerable depending on how often people do it.
6319906	6320907	I'm a little iffy on it, though.
6321848	6322669	I still say this.
6323831	6324572	Just don't do it.
6325213	6326654	Just don't bother with it.
6326715	6332121	If my Twitter gets filled up with blur race updates, then I can't read that so-and-so just took a big poop.
6333002	6334243	on Twitter, you know?
6334864	6338667	And isn't that what Twitter's really about is what you ate for breakfast this morning?
6338807	6342250	Exactly, with the new action or whatever.
6342610	6344892	I am actually starting to get really annoyed with Twitter.
6345192	6346573	It's a love-hate thing with Twitter.
6346653	6354059	There's a lot of dumb shit on Twitter, but at the same time, I found it to be really good for networking and getting the information out there.
6354079	6355300	It's been really good for the show.
6355440	6356761	That's what I use it for.
6358143	6359904	I use it for a lot of my networking now.
6360564	6362226	I use it for OLR Foodio.
6363888	6365209	Yeah, now there's a new hashtag.
6366329	6369952	Loki invented a new hashtag, and the thing is, people are using it that listen to this show.
6370052	6374955	It's not just me, but I saw three other people using the new OLR Foodio tweet.
6375555	6385141	And I'm somewhere torn between this is really funny, and I just think Twitter needs to take some cues from Facebook and give us better ways to filter content.
6385161	6386041	I think it's really what they need.
6386081	6388463	I've actually been using my Facebook a whole lot more than Twitter now.
6388863	6391345	I mean, simply because of a lot of the reasons that you just mentioned.
6391865	6391985	Mm-hmm.
6392952	6395673	So Bochikawa in chat makes a very good point.
6395733	6397613	Poop is greater than race win.
6398393	6398753	I agree.
6400073	6400373	All right.
6402454	6404274	So anyhow, Blur getting Twitter support.
6404994	6407695	We'll see exactly how that plays out a little later on.
6408275	6414756	Meantime, one game that's not going to have Twitter support, but it'll have support for your balance board is, of course, Wii Fit+.
6414816	6417137	And a release date has been announced for Wii Fit+.
6417477	6418817	It's coming out on October 4th.
6419717	6421659	Here's the great thing about Wii Fit Plus.
6421739	6425862	Remember how a lot of us were thinking that Nintendo's just going to price gouge on this?
6426182	6426362	Nope.
6426762	6427463	It's going to cost $20.
6427943	6430505	Wii Fit Plus is only going to set you back $20.
6430645	6434088	Now keep in mind that's if you already have a balance board.
6434408	6439952	So they figure if you have a balance board, then they got you once already with Wii Fit because they don't sell the balance board separately, do they?
6441634	6445657	And they're going to get rid of the SKU that is the Wii Fit...
6446517	6449899	The bad news, which you forgot to mention, was now they also raised the price of that bundle by $10.
6466426	6467106	Sorry about that.
6467146	6469407	Yes, and I'll be $99.99 for that bundle.
6469527	6477030	So if you didn't get in on the ground floor of Wii Fit, which I'm going to tell you this much, if you didn't get in on the ground floor of that, you're not missing out.
6477210	6477930	Seriously.
6478530	6485173	And if you're dumb enough to buy the game by itself, no offense, but it's almost the same game again.
6485533	6487093	I don't know why you'd buy the same game again.
6487113	6488614	Well, because there are some extra things in it.
6488674	6490714	Some of the little mini-games were kind of cute.
6491395	6494916	I mean, if you're going to buy that Wii Play or whatever...
6496400	6499842	You spend an extra $10 to get Wii Play and none of those games are good.
6501103	6501483	I don't know.
6503824	6504225	Whatever.
6504285	6507006	I'm not buying it.
6507446	6510108	I don't think the same way as you about Wii Fit.
6510208	6514310	I get the point behind Wii Fit and I actually kind of like it.
6515691	6523516	I think if you actually make it a point to play the game every day, some exercise is better than none.
6524380	6538602	you know granted it's not the best thing you could be doing you could be lifting weights or you could be running or jogging but you know if it's kind of a nice meet you in the middle type of thing and I think that's what Wii Fit's always been about right?
6539303	6553085	I guess it's trying to make exercising more fun for kids and non-kids who are just not as motivated they should just have you bench press the board and make it way more I'll have to put D cell batteries in it to make it a little heavier
6554681	6556043	No, just put in big old 9 volts.
6557285	6559367	I'm actually considering picking it.
6559407	6559728	It's only $20.
6559788	6561851	That's not that bad considering.
6562091	6566076	Is it supposed to have some internet stuff too where you're going to be able to compare with friends around the globe?
6566096	6567218	Just wait for the peer used.
6567278	6567939	I'm sure it will.
6569210	6569770	All right, fine.
6569790	6570391	Maybe I'll do that.
6570951	6571251	We'll see.
6571711	6576853	Takeo Ray in our chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com, says, My friend's aunt lost 40 pounds using Wii Fit.
6576873	6577734	She swears by it.
6578794	6581835	Loomies in chat says, It's all about your diet and how consistent you are.
6582095	6589839	You know, that's kind of true, too, is that you can't expect that you play Wii Fit by itself for like 10 minutes a day and that anything major is going to happen.
6590199	6592760	It kind of has to be part of a greater lifestyle adjustment.
6593860	6622049	and that's why and I also noticed that xlink in chat says I'll play my EA active you know one thing about EA active is that EA active kind of encourages you as well to be eating and doing other stuff you know doing exercises besides just EA active I don't think it implements it very well but at least it kind of makes it a point to emphasize that as a part of the game as well yeah because I mean it's you can't just do one or I mean you could do one or the other but they're more effective done together
6622662	6631744	I'll tell you what, I mean, to be honest, I think one website I think has been very good for this, you know, when I was kind of trying to lose weight and I still am to an extent.
6632324	6644206	One website I found that I really enjoyed was Spark People, which is actually a pretty good website where you can monitor your food intake and you monitor your exercise and how many glasses of water you drink a day and everything.
6644546	6646467	I just, I really liked the way Spark People was set up.
6646667	6650428	So I, and it has an iPhone app, which was the other big thing about that that was cool.
6650448	6651908	So I would definitely recommend that.
6652848	6653169	That's cool.
6653189	6654010	That makes sense.
6672870	6674010	No, that makes perfect sense.
6674130	6675831	I know a lot of people like that.
6676711	6677831	I'm kind of one of them.
6677871	6678851	I'll go out and run.
6678911	6680332	I'm not a gym person at all.
6681092	6684212	But I have a friend really, really trying to get me to go to the gym.
6684272	6685273	I'm kind of on the fence.
6685533	6687713	I don't know.
6687873	6691754	I don't mind going to the gym, but I usually hide myself in the weight room.
6692554	6696815	Which is sometimes kind of really nerve-wracking, especially when you have all the guys there.
6696835	6698755	Not that I have a problem with all the guys there or anything.
6699396	6701076	It's just that I don't like going out.
6702477	6703258	with all the guys there.
6703819	6707983	Yeah, and it's probably some people listen to us like, come on, you pussies.
6708304	6709765	But I can't explain it.
6709785	6717194	Well, if I'm the only girl there and there's like 10 guys that just got off the basketball court all pumping away, so I'm like, yeah, bye.
6718856	6719957	All right, let's move on with some more news.
6720117	6720858	No, I could take them.
6722571	6723031	Bench press them.
6747762	6748563	DarkSakura.com
6765996	6774230	So they can see who has the best mental, physical, their best knowledge too.
6774851	6780319	And then they get a job as a game tester with the PlayStation QA department in San Diego.
6781772	6782252	Here's the thing.
6782593	6784454	I feel completely different from Jamie.
6784554	6786535	I don't think all reality TV is trash.
6786655	6787375	You watch Big Brother.
6787436	6788656	I think some of it is trash.
6788956	6791998	Well, I like reality shows that are basically modern game shows.
6792399	6797402	Like, you know, in my opinion, Big Brother is a game show as is Survivor is a game show of sorts.
6797442	6799363	And I've always liked game shows of all different types.
6799763	6801584	So I'm not bothered by those shows.
6802025	6806387	And even to an extent, I can tolerate some of those like VH1 and Bravo shows.
6806407	6808488	Like Project Runway is pretty good too.
6808829	6809309	And some of that.
6809369	6810390	Project Runway though is...
6811030	6812331	More like a design contest.
6812391	6817173	Well, see, you can't say you hate reality shows and then say, but this one's okay.
6817473	6820294	Well, this to me, though, is like, what was the Trump one?
6821315	6821815	The Apprentice?
6822535	6823416	I hated that show.
6824736	6830399	See, The Apprentice is okay, but my biggest problem with it is that it basically came down to one dude's opinion.
6830479	6831980	And I think it would have been better if there was a board.
6832000	6834321	But anyway, I don't want to get into diagnosing all these reality shows.
6834621	6836522	What I don't like is like...
6838074	6840736	This VH1 is getting so saturated with these shows.
6840936	6844718	I turned on the other day, it was like the Terrell Owens reality show or something.
6844738	6845278	I'm like, really?
6846058	6846359	Really?
6847199	6847399	No.
6847759	6849980	And there's just a lot of these types of shows, like the dating shows.
6850040	6850841	I want unreality.
6850961	6851901	Too much, too much.
6852021	6853322	Give me back my unreality.
6853982	6855423	I want sitcoms.
6855623	6862967	Okay, here's the funniest part about this reality show, is we've known game testers, and it's not as glamorous as you would think.
6863167	6866049	That's what I actually wanted to get to, is that the prize here...
6866889	6868750	I hate to say it, is not very good.
6869870	6871951	And no offense to the game testers I know out there.
6871971	6874992	A lot of you work very hard for very little money.
6875493	6879994	And that's why I don't understand this whole glamorization of the gaming testing.
6880074	6885557	It's not that hard to get into, I don't think, either.
6885577	6888378	Don't be offended, but it's kind of an entry-level position.
6888418	6890258	It's how you get your foot in the door at gaming companies.
6890539	6893260	But a lot of people take that and work up to something a lot bigger.
6893680	6896501	Shouldn't a prize on a reality game show be something bigger?
6896681	6897142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6916828	6917769	You know what this is going to be?
6917809	6919410	This is just going to be a holiday tie-in.
6919450	6921251	It's going to be a free download on PlayStation Network.
6921271	6925714	This is going to be product placement after product placement of all these Sony upcoming games.
6926435	6927915	I don't think it's a terrible idea.
6928016	6929617	I mean, especially if it's a free show.
6929637	6930537	I'll enter.
6930757	6931158	How about that?
6931198	6931818	Why don't I enter?
6932278	6932899	You want to enter?
6933479	6936221	I can't quit my day job, but if you want to enter and move to San Diego...
6936946	6939167	I like San Diego, but I sure as hell don't want to live there
6958274	6962357	I don't think this show is really about giving someone a once-in-a-lifetime dream opportunity.
6962637	6967040	I think this show is going to be nothing but non-stop product placement for holiday Sony games.
6967100	6968841	But granted, it's a pretty clever way to do it.
6969201	6970182	Patty said something funny.
6970902	6973744	Yeah, that's what I was... Yeah, go ahead and read it.
6974625	6976886	I have a great suggestion for reality TV.
6977026	6977887	Life with my grandma.
6980188	6982209	I just don't know how compelling that would be.
6983590	6987573	Unless your grandma competes in the X Games, then I would watch a show like that.
6987921	6990026	or she was like a serial killer grandma.
6990266	6990447	Yes.
6991870	6995177	I would watch a show called Serial Killer Grandma.
6996620	6998424	Do they have that on Discovery Channel?
6998504	6998785	I don't know.
7000271	7008234	I will check out an episode of this and see if it's any good, but I just kind of have a feeling it's just going to be product placement and trailers I can download somewhere else on PlayStation Network.
7008674	7009214	But we'll see.
7010435	7017517	Something that this winner might be testing out is the brand new 3D support for the PlayStation 3.
7018438	7021179	Now, this is kind of...
7022990	7023430	I don't know.
7024811	7035397	It's neat, but at the same time, it's not that special because in order for you to be able to use it, you need one of those brand new TVs that can refresh at over 200 hertz.
7035417	7035457	So...
7039019	7066097	that is a problem and not a lot of people have those TVs right now but if you happen to do and you have the special stereoscopic glasses for that then you can actually play some of the games one of them of course Wipeout in 3D and that will be coming out in 2010 I know actually sooner than that they're going to be doing that with Avatar but once again you need that really high end TV and right now there's like maybe 5 different TVs out there that have that kind of feature for them
7069402	7097627	you think this might be the future of gaming though because when we see things like this I kind of go okay well maybe it's for a certain group of people right now but could it be the future of gaming it's cutting edge yes but it might be too cutting edge like you know it's too early because you know people aren't going to upgrade their TV just to get one of these TVs that does you know 200 hertz until they start coming out with like a lot of 3D movies and stuff and this stuff comes down in price but right now I mean I guess they can claim that they were the first to do this or something I don't know
7099878	7107263	But actually, they can't claim it as their first disc, because now that I think of it, because if Avatar is coming out on both the 360 and PS3, then they will be doing it at the same time.
7107984	7110566	Wasn't, like, Rad Racer on the NES in 3D?
7111747	7115189	Yeah, but that was, like, with those, you know, the red-blue glasses.
7115249	7116910	Wasn't the Virtual Boy in 3D?
7117831	7119092	The amazing migraine machine?
7120193	7126417	Yeah, see, that was actually true 3D, but this, though, yeah, I don't know.
7126738	7127138	It's a neat...
7127578	7130501	I kind of don't want to see gaming go all 3D like this.
7130601	7139711	I went and saw Up in 3D, which don't get me wrong, great movie, had a great time, but I kind of had a little bit of a headache after for watching that for like 90 minutes.
7140332	7145037	And even though they say you're supposed to take a break every hour when you play video games, you guys know that's not how it goes.
7145297	7146999	You'll sit there and play a video game for four hours.
7147299	7148480	Until you gotta pee.
7148620	7148981	Yeah.
7149421	7150702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7172973	7175034	You know, HD and all that stuff.
7175074	7178076	It's just because people... It's the progression that's going to go in.
7178116	7182178	I mean, that's what their push is for cinema right now is more 3D.
7182578	7184939	And, you know, eventually that's going to move to the home market.
7185579	7188641	So, it makes sense that games are going to go in that direction.
7188681	7193724	Especially since, you know, hey, 3D might come in handy when, like, Project Intel comes out.
7193824	7198966	Or, you know, these games are going to be using the, you know, Sony motion capture thing that they're going to have.
7199026	7201848	You know, you might need to see stuff in 3D space in that sense.
7201908	7202068	But...
7203345	7203685	I don't know.
7204346	7206347	It's not cheap right now, though.
7206507	7211670	If you want to buy a monitor for your PC and the stereoscopic glasses, it's going to set you back $500.
7213376	7216399	I mean, that's pretty cheap, you know, compared to an HDTV.
7216439	7218780	Yeah, but technology is going to come down in price eventually.
7218881	7219641	Exactly, it will.
7219661	7225086	It's just like, remember when HDTVDs, or sorry, I just, I can't talk anymore.
7225666	7231011	HDTVs, remember when those were like thousands of dollars to get an HDTV?
7231071	7233372	And now, like this Christmas, I think you're going to see those things.
7233392	7233633	No, the Vega.
7234229	7235509	Flying off the shelves, yeah.
7235690	7236390	Remember the big deal?
7236410	7237090	They were like $5,000.
7237510	7239351	Ooh, I have two DX and a Vega.
7239811	7240051	Yeah.
7240511	7242212	Well, a lot of that was faux HD, too.
7242232	7244013	A lot of those Vegas didn't even really do HD.
7244513	7248374	But, yeah, I mean, technology's going to come down in price.
7248414	7249415	It always does, right?
7251375	7251576	Yeah.
7253076	7253376	I don't know.
7253656	7256497	And if it doesn't, it kills the thing, too, you know?
7256817	7258638	That's right, because, you know, not everybody's rich.
7259338	7259559	Yeah.
7259659	7260599	Something to keep in mind.
7261494	7264817	I want to go back to our chat room, chat.orangelandreda.com and read some comments.
7264837	7269141	There was a comment on the last story about the whole reality television from Salacious Pop.
7269661	7270022	Hi there.
7270422	7275787	Says, if I recall correctly, the Penny Arcade guys were doing something reality based at Penny Arcade Expo.
7276147	7280271	I don't know if it's a mini doc for the DVD or a standalone thing or what.
7281031	7286436	Jamie, being a person that hates all reality television, would you hate a Penny Arcade documentary as well?
7287267	7290209	There's a difference between a reality TV show and a documentary.
7290409	7290770	Is there?
7291150	7291370	Yes.
7292451	7293171	What is the difference?
7294192	7297514	The documentary being that it's set for an informative purpose.
7297695	7300196	Its purpose is not necessarily entertainment.
7300757	7306661	It is to give you the information regarding a particular situation, a historical event, or an individual.
7306881	7308662	Couldn't a documentary be entertaining?
7309743	7313266	That's why I said not necessarily just for entertainment.
7313286	7313506	All right.
7313766	7318509	Reality TV is supposed to be, oh, here's your slice of how other people live.
7319509	7331216	For example, if you took a documentary to Somalia to see about the results of the war and their own little mafia thing going on there.
7331756	7341262	and you get unfiltered information or if it's filtered it's just to make it slightly more palatable but it's not scripted.
7341622	7343583	This is what's going on.
7343844	7345425	It's inquisitive.
7346085	7346926	It's editorial.
7347326	7349087	This is what is going on.
7349407	7352749	Whereas reality TV is in the end a manufactured reality.
7354710	7355251	Alright, fine.
7357172	7358172	I just was kind of curious.
7358913	7359974	I don't think that's a pretty...
7361567	7363188	Thanks for watching!
7377992	7394200	You know what that has me kind of thinking about, though, is that, you know, I bet there would be a lot of people that would be interested in watching something like that, kind of a behind-the-scenes thing at PAX, and even though, you know, it was commented that it's probably going to be for a DVD, wouldn't it be kind of neat if this was a downloadable exclusive on PlayStation Network or Xbox 360?
7394260	7395921	I know it's done a lot of work with Penny Arcade.
7396101	7396801	I think that'd be cool.
7396901	7399122	Or even, like, you know what might be a really cool tie-in?
7399502	7402144	Have it be something that's on Xbox 360 Netflix.
7402784	7406526	Put it on Netflix as an instant queue title, and then people could watch it.
7407548	7408589	That would be worthwhile.
7408609	7409309	That would be pretty cool.
7409430	7417394	See, I think that is something that if PlayStation Network is going to make up this reality show or whatever, that should also be an avenue that they should think about doing.
7417835	7419616	Or maybe Microsoft will beat them to the punch.
7419656	7420676	Who knows?
7421097	7429442	Creating these shows about behind-the-scenes development of games or fandom, I guess you could say in this case, or expos, whatever it is.
7429762	7430402	Kind of, you know...
7432304	7439311	It was like what I was watching today, Dan, because you know pretty much my favorite type of sports car is the Bugatti Veyron, right?
7439851	7451222	Well, Dan was showing me the video for Forza 2 about how they got the Bugatti license and were mapping out the car, how it was done, the meat of how they...
7453605	7456048	That type of stuff is always interesting to me.
7456128	7458151	I love behind the scenes stuff in movies.
7458632	7460956	I like watching the how they do that type thing.
7462338	7464561	I did love watching Ripley's Believe It or Not.
7466576	7467777	Unwrapped on the Food Network
7485924	7489166	I don't hate it, I just don't love it.
7489206	7494848	Especially when you've seen the same episode over and over and they start reusing some of their segments on other episodes.
7494868	7496008	I'll give you that, I'll give you that.
7496048	7496989	They do need to make some new stuff.
7497009	7499410	Like, this episode's the stuff that's packaged in plastic.
7499550	7501390	Oh, this episode's about baskets.
7501531	7503711	Oh, this episode's about Cheez Whiz.
7504272	7505972	It's like, I don't care.
7506012	7507573	There was an episode on Cheez Whiz?
7507633	7509414	No, there was not an episode on Cheez Whiz.
7509634	7512575	But there's been like three episodes about picnics and there's like...
7512995	7515399	You know, they show how they make picnic baskets.
7515540	7516962	I don't care, that has nothing to do with food.
7520216	7522077	What about those little, don't they call those picnics?
7522117	7524978	Those little potato fried things you can buy and then forget it?
7525438	7530080	You know what is a weird show that's kind of along the lines of Unwrapped?
7530200	7533261	It's how it's made or something like that.
7533401	7535642	And they have the most random stuff put together.
7535682	7544486	It's like, this episode you're going to learn how they make galvanized steel, doorknobs, bowling balls, and mayonnaise.
7544546	7546526	It's like, what the fuck is that?
7547147	7547627	It's like...
7548448	7549128	I like those.
7549208	7550069	It's so random.
7550129	7550850	It's like, ooh, steel.
7551131	7551851	Oh, doorknobs.
7552032	7552612	I'm sorry.
7553073	7559440	When I was just out of high school, there was a show that used to come on, and I don't think, I think this was before the day of the Food Network.
7559460	7564766	It used to come on where they would show you how to make snacks that you buy in the grocery store, like they showed how to make Twinkies.
7566567	7567608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7584786	7585366	It was great.
7585466	7586808	Better than Scat before it.
7586848	7595558	You have to remember, when our buddy Keith worked at Scandia, we ran that fucking joint when we wanted to do a tournament.
7595899	7597581	And we did the most random things.
7597701	7599623	I know the employees there must have hated us.
7600064	7601626	And so did all the customers, which is...
7601946	7603587	But we stayed and helped cleaned up.
7603687	7604247	We did.
7604287	7604567	We did.
7604608	7607269	No, we did a really awesome tournament there and probably brought up some new business.
7607569	7608890	But we did the most random stuff.
7609190	7614373	We turned the birthday party room into a station where you could buy fried Twinkies.
7614973	7615473	Yes, we did.
7615494	7616334	Deep fried Twinkies.
7616694	7618555	What the hell that has to do with video games?
7618575	7619436	That was Irene.
7619456	7620036	I don't know.
7620856	7621457	That was Irene.
7622267	7622507	I, I, I, I, I
7652523	7653744	We should just have RandomCon.
7654004	7657326	Loki presents the Baconator station or something.
7657807	7658447	I'm telling you.
7658467	7660048	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
7660448	7664451	We are seriously kicking around an idea of doing an all-bacon party for my birthday.
7664851	7666072	I'm serious.
7666092	7667292	Didn't your birthday already happen?
7667332	7668033	Oh, no, it's coming up.
7668113	7668773	Next Friday.
7669013	7670194	Oh, you should do it.
7670374	7671515	Well, we're thinking about it.
7672155	7673236	Have some bacon fried bacon.
7673836	7675197	We're not bacon frying bacon.
7675597	7676578	That's just redundant.
7677915	7678475	Alright, look, look.
7678715	7681677	I want to get to some more comments because we had some funny stuff on Unwrapped.
7681717	7683438	We had two fans of Unwrapped in chat.
7683678	7686079	Takeo Ray says, Unwrapped is the best show on Food Network.
7686199	7687620	Actdeft says, Unwrapped is awesome.
7688060	7692763	Salacious Pop says, that show makes me lull because I'm like, oh, go jump in some Gak Mark Summers.
7693383	7694704	He couldn't.
7695244	7696845	He's got that whole OCD thing going on.
7696865	7697445	That's right.
7697465	7698325	Did you see this documentary?
7698345	7699226	It's about Double Dare.
7699426	7700166	It scared him.
7700447	7706910	Well, yeah, because he's... What type of phobia is it where you're afraid of messes?
7708177	7708939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7716294	7720576	Alright, Ranma in chat simply says, fuck Unwrapped, Good Eats is better.
7721376	7722817	Alton Brown is pretty awesome.
7722837	7723237	Alright, look.
7723297	7724577	I do agree, Good Eats is better.
7724738	7727419	Enough food, let's get to emails.
7727779	7728879	You can't eat emails.
7729019	7732121	I'm sure if you could, DarkSakura would have eaten one by now.
7732341	7733061	Nope, nope, you're wrong.
7733081	7734041	I would have thrown them up.
7734261	7739964	You could print out emails on that paper that they use to print photos on a cake, then you could eat emails.
7741224	7742085	That's true!
7743956	7748060	We need to have a contest where we eat somebody's email one night live on air.
7748600	7750822	Have your email eaten by a castle.
7750842	7752383	We don't have the printer for that.
7752543	7753324	We'd have to take it out.
7753604	7754585	How much does that cost?
7755025	7755406	I don't know.
7755466	7756126	Not that much.
7759289	7760050	People are sick.
7761812	7762593	Mailbag!
7762873	7768079	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura, dive into the email bag and read us some emails.
7768580	7770142	Um, what?
7771123	7774767	Okay, the first one comes from DeathWishing, which is actually the last email I received.
7775889	7781656	I will have wrote, it's written, this message from a place called Howie's Game Shack.
7782156	7784798	Well, I went to Guitar Hero 5 and it is fucking amazing.
7785038	7787200	It's probably the best one in the franchise.
7787801	7788321	I know, right?
7788381	7790123	Weird, but seriously, you gotta try it out.
7790343	7797729	Just skip Smash Hits Van Halen and Metallica and any other weird, or weird, I should say, because he spelled it the same way twice.
7798529	7802613	Um, any other weird, weird tie in games, they will make.
7802673	7804074	That's what he said, weird tie.
7806436	7807877	Cyber Cafe loved Death Wishing.
7808097	7809878	I think he meant weird tie in game.
7810139	7810499	So, yeah.
7811200	7811280	Um,
7812273	7813795	Okay, thank you.
7826249	7834037	Hey OLR, I was looking on the net and I heard if you have a PSP Go and a PS3, you can pair up the PS3 controller with the PSP Go to have dual analog sticks.
7834097	7836639	A half-assed way to solve that problem, analog sticks.
7850718	7854061	and make you buy more stuff from them.
7854121	7854762	Problem solved.
7854842	7855222	P.S.
7855643	7865754	I recently bought a UMID AM1, a 4-inch netbook, and it can play high-def games.
7865854	7871159	Now, it looks stupid with the USB hub, external CD-ROM, and a controller sticking out of it, but it is a good thing to know.
7871199	7871380	Bye!
7871977	7872798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7896474	7904040	I was going to say, that feature isn't any good unless your PSP games actually support it, but I guess maybe it's a trend that'll be starting.
7904060	7905582	And if you have a PS3, and you're near your PS3.
7905682	7915310	Hey, but I was talking about earlier in the show, there's a lot of hidden functionality between the PS3 and the PSP that Sony does a really poor job at advertising that is very cool.
7915330	7923676	Like playing the PSP on your TV, like if you did that DualShock thing, you could put your Resistance game on your TV and play with the DualShock controller.
7923857	7924117	I know.
7925543	7928024	I noticed DarkSakura was looking at a little thing for Dissida.
7928324	7930724	I tried the download demo of that.
7930884	7932965	This is part of the soundtrack.
7933145	7933405	Is it?
7934685	7936206	I couldn't get a grasp on the game.
7936586	7938647	I just couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.
7938687	7939787	I just was button mashing.
7939827	7940567	Is that all the game is?
7940627	7941787	Button mashing with Final Fantasy characters?
7941807	7942368	No, not exactly.
7942548	7942808	Really?
7942868	7944288	I couldn't figure out the strategy behind it.
7944308	7945988	I don't think the demo was set up very well.
7946008	7947369	It needed a tutorial or something.
7947829	7948869	Or maybe I'm just stupid.
7948949	7949970	That's fine too.
7951170	7951450	Nah.
7952139	7952739	Alright, anyhow.
7952899	7953319	Next email.
7953519	7953919	Hi!
7954459	7954699	Hi.
7954920	7955860	This is from Dragon, by the way.
7956540	7961221	I have been listening to your podcast for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.
7961781	7965662	I wanted to say I don't know why so many people are complaining about the cost of the PSP Go.
7965762	7971603	I live in Toronto, Canada and a PSP 3000 costs $167 and a 16GB memory stick costs $139 so the PSP Go is a good deal for a new player.
7971623	7973103	Keep up the great work on your podcast.
7979508	7980969	A 6 gigabyte memory stick, he said?
7980989	7980969	16.
7981530	7984692	I don't know.
7984712	7985473	Dude, get the bundle.
7985533	7988275	I don't know how much it would cost Canadian, but it can't be much more than it is here.
7988775	7992798	I just got a bundle, because my old PSP was kind of dying, so I actually just picked up a PSP 3000 this week.
7993238	8008010	I bought a $199 bundle that came with the PSP 3000, a 4 gig memory stick, School of Rock little code you can use, which whatever, I don't really care for Jack Black, but I'll just download it because it was free, and then Rock Band Unplugged all came with it.
8008610	8011132	So, you know, that wasn't a bad deal at all for the PS3 3000.
8011992	8016255	The problem is, the PSP Go is, what, $50 cheaper than a PlayStation 3 is now?
8016755	8020477	And it's got, like, less features than a PSP 3000.
8021158	8023899	I don't... That's where the logic fails me.
8023919	8025380	If you're going to go PSP, go PSP 3000.
8025420	8025740	It's fine.
8025760	8027962	And to be honest, you can find memory sticks pretty cheap.
8028102	8029243	And here's the other thing, too.
8030764	8031024	I mean...
8032136	8034777	I don't know if you really need 16GB of storage.
8034857	8038338	Even if you're buying games on there, I mean, I don't think you need that.
8038358	8043639	I mean, hell, when I was putting ISOs on there, I didn't need that amount of space.
8044279	8049221	4GB at the most, maybe, and then... I mean, how many games do you plan on storing on there?
8049281	8056023	Yeah, they need 16GB on a PSP Go because that's all you can do is download stuff, but you're going to be playing a lot of your games off UMDs anyways.
8056503	8059744	There's really no reason to get the Go other than, ooh, look, it slides.
8061284	8065168	By the way, my comments on Final Fantasy Dissida kind of got the chatroom talking about that a little bit.
8065268	8068831	AlphaCananagram says, the demo doesn't do it justice, and he puts demo in caps.
8069412	8072334	Geovadea says, Dissida is fucking amazing, I heart it.
8072835	8079221	And AlphaCananagram wants you to know he is playing Dissida right now, a level 100 Onion Knight on hardcore play mode.
8079681	8081543	I guess maybe I'll have to check out the full game at some point.
8083137	8095858	Well, the last email, and I'm kind of not going to say who it's coming from, but he also didn't say who he got it from, but it's an email that was sent out to Disney cast members.
8096759	8097380	Huh, okay.
8100211	8120332	Marvel's business meshes perfectly with ours and what we've all been doing to maximize the value of Disney's creative properties across our business, media platforms, and geographical markets.
8120772	8123414	and then goes on to talk about Pixar.
8123734	8124795	But here's the other line.
8125156	8135263	The acquisition of Marvel offers us a similar opportunity to advance that strategy, meaning putting out things all over the world for using it for marketing purposes.
8137785	8153497	I'm sort of, maybe I'm reading a bit more into this, but since they've been talking about use of the Marvel brand and, you know, the consumer market, I have a feeling we're going to start seeing actual, especially since this was sent out to cast members, meaning I think it's the park.
8154938	8157859	That means that we might start seeing characters in the parks.
8159299	8162880	And, of course, that's also going to mean games.
8163360	8164821	It's going to mean movies.
8165101	8166261	It's going to mean more things.
8166421	8167441	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
8167662	8169362	Well, not tomorrow, but I'm saying down the line.
8169382	8170022	Let me put it this way.
8170922	8172763	Their licenses aren't going to run until 2015, 2017.
8172843	8173363	I mean, it's that long.
8177084	8185251	You know, and what else is interesting, and for some reason, the whole story about Disney buying Marvel didn't make tonight's show roll, but I'm sure everybody read about it somewhere on the internet.
8185272	8186112	You couldn't get away from it.
8186473	8199744	I thought what was very interesting about when that story hit is that you just saw all this, like, frickin' cross-fanboy wank all over the internet all at once about, like, OMG, there's gonna be Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters, and, like, just all this stuff that ain't happenin'.
8199864	8201765	Run my ass if Spider-Man was going to be in Toy Story 4.
8228738	8231059	We got a cool 3D thing at Disneyland.
8231319	8234541	And so maybe we'll get a cool Marvel ride at California Adventure or whatever.
8234561	8235942	Maybe they'll bring back the 7th Portal.
8236282	8237502	But it's going to be a while.
8237583	8239323	Doesn't Marvel have an agreement with other theme parks?
8239343	8240184	I know DC does.
8240884	8244866	DC is what you see all over Magic Mountain and the Six Flags.
8244926	8246587	I want to see the 7th Portal come back.
8247748	8248128	Oh, come on.
8248168	8250369	You went on that with me at Great America.
8251636	8259242	I just don't think Disney is going to mean that Marvel is going to run the same way Disney does.
8259262	8260843	I just think a lot of people are jumping to conclusions.
8260863	8262965	Ranma also said Darkwing Duck and the Avengers.
8263025	8263765	Disney, fund it.
8264926	8267108	And Actdeft says The Incredibles vs. Fantastic Four.
8268209	8269090	Oh, this is the best.
8269110	8269790	Salacious Pop.
8269990	8272252	I'd be on board for a Deadpool-Hannah-Montana crossover.
8273653	8275295	I would totally be down for that.
8275335	8275895	Come on.
8276075	8277176	Come on.
8278257	8279018	Not happening.
8280405	8281265	I would be so down for that.
8281325	8284746	Although, hey, the Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters is kind of a neat idea.
8285787	8287127	It's just not going to happen right away.
8287167	8290748	Well, hell, we don't even know when Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to happen, if anytime soon.
8293649	8298270	Ranma says, Rob Roberts, yeah, but Disney already pulled the old budget cuts on one of their publishing arms.
8298971	8299211	Well...
8300233	8300753	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8342793	8345094	We don't really have anything to inspire the FUs tonight.
8345134	8345894	I don't have a story.
8346274	8349635	But what about that guy that said that video games were poison or whatever?
8349695	8351316	We'll dedicate the FUs tonight to him.
8351656	8352496	The Gundam guy.
8352857	8354637	I had something, actually.
8354657	8355057	Go for it.
8355177	8355558	Already.
8356798	8362000	You know, they're supposed to be doing Obama's speech in public schools on the 8th.
8364810	8367231	I don't know how I feel about this whole political, but okay, go for it.
8367451	8370753	Well, it's really, it's an encouragement to stay in school.
8370953	8371753	That's what it is.
8371853	8375034	I think it's great that, you know, that this is going out.
8375114	8382037	It's a sign that, you know, our president does care about children instead of, you know, Bush going, how do you read?
8384698	8390041	But at the same time, what really pisses me off are all those people who say, oh, well...
8391281	8396304	This is going to interrupt my kids' school day, so I'm going to not let them go to school that day.
8399106	8400026	That makes no sense.
8400086	8403228	It makes my brain go, what?
8403949	8404329	Why?
8404809	8405130	What?
8405950	8410733	You know, especially when all the schools are making arrangements for parents who don't want their children to see the...
8415999	8418860	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8439969	8444350	My whole thing with the people just need to stop thinking in one extreme or the other.
8445031	8448372	I bet you when all is said and done, nobody is blue and nobody is red.
8448412	8449592	Everybody's a little bit purple.
8450152	8456954	And just the whole like taking kids out of school as some type of political statement or whatever is just too extreme.
8457154	8461476	They're saying that they're doing it not so that their education isn't interrupted.
8462458	8463219	Watch the speech.
8463239	8465841	Let your children watch the speech and then talk about it.
8466642	8467382	You know, be a fucking parent.
8490653	8492034	Part of being a parent, yeah, true.
8492374	8495657	You have to make sure that your child's not going to see anything harmful.
8496237	8500281	But at the same time, you can't protect them from every damn little thing that you don't want them to see.
8501562	8502623	That's what the real world is.
8504124	8507087	I've met people who've grown up sheltered, and they're frightening people.
8508047	8509869	I also think that...
8511872	8513453	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8536957	8544380	Fuck you Rockstar for getting rid of my modded Grand Theft Auto games and it's absolutely ruined the whole Grand Theft Auto experience for the two of us.
8545140	8545861	But you know what?
8546181	8548202	I will find a way around it like I always do.
8550062	8552463	I'm going to say something that's a total inside joke.
8552523	8555384	There's maybe like two or three people listening that would understand this.
8555745	8558946	But I'm just going to give a big F you this week to exclamation points.
8561247	8562147	That's all I'm going to say.
8562807	8563888	F you exclamation points.
8565097	8565757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8595235	8602459	and also the ability to sync up your voice with the player's mouth movements, so it actually makes it look like they're talking.
8603300	8607362	And, yeah, it's really, really cool.
8608502	8617207	Apparently, they do have an animation system, I guess that's intelligent enough to turn your audio stream into lip-syncing for the on-screen characters.
8618668	8619168	But, yeah.
8620700	8624101	I don't know, I guess it's neat that they're offering all these things.
8624201	8627142	I wonder if we will actually see a lot of Makima videos for this.
8628663	8632904	That's kind of interesting when gaming companies kind of really embrace the whole Makima thing, you know?
8633124	8634444	Yeah.
8634824	8641507	That's what I liked about this story was that they're really kind of showing that off and leaving it to people's creativity to make whatever they're going to make.
8642007	8644868	But it's really interesting how more and more gaming companies really embrace it.
8644908	8645648	But, you know, I mean...
8646604	8648526	XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation
8675748	8677309	That's right, Sexbox.
8677729	8686675	Because this company, they're going to be making a video game system that only plays interactive adult only rated video game titles.
8686775	8687176	Hell yes.
8688448	8689089	S, Actdeft, Drew,
8707859	8719646	By the way, as well as specializing in the adult-only games, the Sexbox will also give its owners access to adult-only content and entertainment in all sorts of other digital forms.
8720267	8723149	I'm assuming this means like streaming movies and video and all that.
8724249	8733775	Audio, video, HDTV, DVD, online, gaming, social networking, webcams, video on demand, downloading, movie rentals, purchases, etc., etc., etc.
8733955	8736257	Everything but real fucking games.
8737048	8741133	Only because the technology doesn't exist yet.
8742068	8742628	What do you think?
8742748	8744889	Loki, you seem to be a big advocate for this Xbox.
8744929	8747050	I mean, is this something legit or is this just teehee?
8747370	8760914	I think the way they're going to approach it is going to be teehee, but I'm all about a system that will allow publishers, assuming that they actually want to put out stuff on this system, the opportunity to put out games uncensored.
8761314	8769757	And yes, we're probably going to see a lot of porno games that are probably going to be crap, but at the same time, if they want to release a really fucking crazy version of Manhunt 2 or something like that,
8770217	8770858	They can do it.
8771098	8775283	And you know, I applaud that, but at the same time, I think it's going to be kind of lame.
8775703	8780689	However, that being said, assuming that the games on there look pretty decent, I will probably pick one of these up.
8781350	8782211	Because it will be funny.
8782251	8784053	I can go, hee hee, I have a sex box.
8787476	8788017	You know what?
8789499	8790159	I'm all for...
8791600	8794862	I've gotten into this rant a long time ago on this show.
8795003	8801087	I'm all for sexier video games and all this and just downloading porn on your PlayStation 3 and Xbox.
8801127	8805810	I understand why the companies don't want to open Pandora's Box and that whole thing, but why not?
8806010	8821100	I mean, it's just because we have this whole stigma in our society where the violence is okay, Manhunt 2 is okay, and a lot of these games and the Saw movies are fine, but heaven forbid we show a cock or some bush, and I'm not talking about a president,
8821660	8824621	On the television, you know, it's just, I'll never get it.
8825321	8829802	But granted, how can you make a serious game out of sex?
8829882	8835264	I mean, a lot of these AO games we've seen, like the Three Feel and stuff, those are all a little silly.
8835664	8840845	Well, they are a little silly, but also some of the games that do get an AO rating, it's really silly what they're getting it for.
8840965	8844346	And I would be fine with seeing legitimate games, just maybe push...
8845006	8845667	DarkSakura.com
8860303	8870887	I hope they put some real time and investment into making a serious game out of it to just really wow everybody instead of all these cheap games that just have titties and stuff.
8870947	8873668	Make an epic fuck quest or something like that.
8873728	8878569	Not necessarily with sex, but over-the-top violence.
8878609	8884931	Something absolutely crazy where you can just rip parts off of people and it's gruesomely detailed and stuff like that.
8885452	8886292	I don't want violence.
8886352	8888573	I want cock and titty.
8888753	8889373	I like violence.
8890515	8891916	I like, I want violence.
8892096	8897161	Fine, you'll play a cock and a titty that goes around ripping your limbs off of people.
8897241	8897741	There you go.
8897761	8901405	Or Deekman in chat says, rip parts off of people and fuck them with it.
8901825	8902746	Ew, you're dirty.
8903146	8903907	What is wrong with you?
8903927	8905148	Make a game called Naked Slayer.
8905548	8905768	Huh?
8905888	8906489	Naked Slayer.
8908130	8908771	Naked Slayer.
8908851	8910192	You can play either a guy or a girl.
8910853	8913435	You can choose, you know, whatever their orientation is.
8913515	8915297	And they run around naked, killing people.
8917265	8918127	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8928506	8935351	Salacious Pop in chat says, apparently they're still making Leisure Suit Larry games, though Sierra and the dude who originally made them have nothing to do with it, and they're terrible.
8935611	8936251	That's true.
8936912	8940815	In fact, that last one had an AO-rated version, and it was pretty bad.
8940855	8941935	And they are making still a new one.
8941955	8942456	There's a new one.
8942836	8946999	They had that Magna Cum Laude or whatever that was a little stupid, and they have a new one coming out, right?
8947259	8949021	I remember hearing a story on that earlier.
8949741	8952283	They had a new one that came out a while ago that was kind of eh.
8953604	8955325	I like that idea by Salacious Pop.
8956045	8957825	Professor Layton goes to Bonertown.
8960766	8961926	Professor Layton.
8962447	8963907	Layton, that's funny.
8965568	8969089	You know, the whole social networking thing, though, could be interesting.
8969589	8969869	I mean...
8971184	8975765	A lot of people really unleash their sexuality when they're hiding behind a computer monitor.
8976245	8980226	And you might be able to find people that are into the same freaky shit you might be into.
8980626	8984727	Like, for example, let me think of a fetish that not a lot of people are into that's not completely disgusting.
8984767	8988828	There's actually, you can actually quote Patton Oswalt on that.
8988948	8989168	Huh.
8989869	8996210	Talking about that there's a magazine for, you know, for every fetish that you think is so dirty and awful, there's a magazine about it.
8996370	8996590	Yeah.
8996810	8997471	Piss drinkers.
8997831	8998811	Oh, God, bleh.
8999712	9001916	Although I'm sure there's people into that, so whatever.
9002257	9009433	But I'm saying that's the perfect... I'm trying to think of something that's not totally disgusting that I can use as an example.
9009473	9010034	Okay, here's one.
9011149	9013530	Some people have a food fight fetish.
9014151	9016772	They want to have sex after a food fight.
9016952	9023435	Like getting really dirty, just rubbing around in pies and salads and stuff.
9023495	9024436	I don't know.
9024456	9025556	We're going to have a food fight.
9025936	9027697	No one has a salad food fight.
9027857	9029318	I've heard about this on the radio.
9029358	9029738	It's true.
9030659	9031239	But here's the thing.
9031419	9040604	If you have a food fight fetish or whatever, you could go onto this sex box console, find somebody else with the same fetish as you, and then have some safe fun together.
9043064	9044144	What's wrong with that?
9044724	9054269	As long as these consoles preach safety and not things that are illegal like ripping parts off of dead people and fucking them with them, that's not legal.
9055309	9066095	But as long as this encourages safe, legal things within boundaries with consenting adults that have to prove that they are adults in order to even be able to log into this service, why not?
9068556	9068856	Why not?
9072003	9075165	Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, you should give Angel's Feather a try.
9075225	9080048	It's basically a game with Final Fantasy type story and battles plus some porn on the side.
9080449	9081029	Sounds amazing.
9081930	9082951	I'll have to check this game out.
9083231	9083771	Yes, please do.
9083811	9085652	That again is called Angel's Feather.
9087173	9089215	Oh, it actually has anime too.
9091256	9091917	Alright, anyhow.
9092357	9097561	Salacious Poppet Chat says, I don't think ants should be a possible consequence of sex.
9100757	9102358	Actdeft, People Have Balloon Fetishes
9126179	9128920	Why isn't there any, like, Pie Pod fetishes?
9128940	9130900	Remember the Pie Pod from, like, Nickelodeon?
9132440	9133740	They should seriously have them.
9134121	9136701	It would be like, you know, the people that make those sex machines.
9137041	9140562	But it's the sex machine stuff with a food fetish in there as well.
9141062	9143522	That could be the interactive game on the sex box.
9143602	9144422	It's the Pie Pod.
9145182	9146003	There you go.
9150043	9152264	Oh, this show has just gone to shit tonight.
9152324	9153284	It's a yowie game.
9154096	9155137	Alright, is it a Yaoi game?
9155337	9155737	Looks like.
9156038	9157018	Good times, good times.
9157038	9157799	All male cast.
9157999	9164024	Skype line time, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9164084	9165385	Go ahead and feel free to give us a call.
9165785	9169128	In the meantime, we are going to go to Loki for some last minute stories.
9169368	9170189	I'm assuming he has some.
9170618	9173199	Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku
9197699	9199501	Nah, I'm just like at a hookah bar right now.
9199541	9201843	Just figured I'd drop in, just say what's up.
9202704	9204065	You at a hookah bar?
9204205	9205126	I would have never guessed.
9205166	9205926	I like hookah too.
9205966	9206587	Are you having fun?
9208349	9208849	Pretty much.
9208889	9213053	I mean, I've already, you know, I've already gotten in some cheap hookah right now.
9213133	9216115	Just like had my first cider, my first hard cider.
9217457	9221080	But yeah, just like been keeping up on what's been going on in PAX.
9221900	9229462	especially the fact that one of the guys in Xbox Live had this little quote-unquote sermon about the Banhammer.
9229482	9231743	I actually called on Kotaku earlier today.
9232063	9232843	I did not hear about this.
9232903	9233724	Tell us a little bit about it.
9235224	9235504	Huh?
9236244	9238225	I didn't hear about this whole spiel, what happened there.
9238285	9239505	Tell us a little bit about what happened.
9240386	9250949	I think it was basically one of the guys who works for Microsoft for Xbox Live who's in charge of maintaining order within there and the one that wields the Banhammer and he was basically just
9251670	9255731	Basically, you know, giving a speech in the form of an actual, like, religious sermon.
9256432	9279499	The way he's using, like, a lot of religious terms in terms of how he managed to wield the, you know, in other words, like, the name, like, the gamer tags, and how, you know, they get banned, and then he's saying, like, but this god is merciful, even though, you know, and he'll give you a second chance if you use any banned term in your gamer tags.
9280874	9283196	and then the other one, and then this other thing.
9283876	9284497	Hold on a sec.
9284637	9286578	I already did it.
9286658	9287619	Oh, sure, we can hold.
9289400	9292342	But yeah, he was basically saying stuff about, like, um, the...
9293482	9294042	I'm still here.
9294062	9296983	I think we're about to head out, but I'm actually still good for talking.
9319352	9323193	Alright, well, give us any final thoughts, quickly, because we do want to get some other calls.
9323453	9334037	Well, basically, I heard that the new WiiWare game, that Contra game, that's supposed to be really hard to tell, that you can't even get through.
9334077	9339979	I know it was already out in Japan earlier this year, but I figured that it might present a challenge to folks.
9340479	9342620	The original Contra was hard as hell.
9342700	9346321	Do you know anybody that can beat it without the up, up, down, down, left, right code?
9346561	9347001	Dan can.
9348171	9348811	Dan's a freak.
9376713	9378014	You got the Japanese version.
9379295	9386600	But even then, he's just shrugging it off because he's pretty much a classic gamer in that sense.
9386680	9390302	A challenge like that wouldn't be a no-brainer.
9390703	9392904	Weird that they haven't released that over here in the U.S.
9393004	9394625	yet, though, but I guess soon enough.
9394705	9394946	I know.
9394966	9398388	It's supposed to come out tomorrow.
9398768	9400469	It only came out in Europe.
9400649	9403992	I hope they dumb it down for us Americans like they usually do.
9406339	9409003	I hope they dumbed it down for the Americans like they usually do then.
9409524	9416293	I heard the folks in Kotaku were complaining about the fact that it was pretty damn hard.
9416313	9416954	Alright.
9417314	9418716	Well, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
9419097	9420419	Have fun at the hookah bar.
9421420	9422442	Smoke one for us, alright?
9423837	9424618	Yes, I will.
9424658	9425659	Have a good one.
9425679	9426079	Have a good day, Rudy.
9446881	9448062	Light another one, dude!
9448783	9452225	The hookah bar does not get you high, Rob.
9452285	9453326	No, I know it doesn't.
9453386	9455027	However, it's really fun to blow smoke bubbles.
9455768	9457008	I know, I had hookah once.
9457889	9460291	Anyway, so back to the Data East collection here.
9460831	9462192	Some of the games are going to be included with it.
9462272	9472239	Magical Drop 3, Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, Burger Time, Caveman Ninja, Street Slam, and Secret Agent.
9472519	9474281	Too many ninjas, as if there was such a thing.
9475120	9478482	I don't know, it's pretty awesome.
9480463	9481443	Alright, let's go to another call.
9481483	9482504	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9482524	9482884	Who's this?
9483544	9485525	Hey, I'm DSMaster25.
9485545	9487986	Hi, DSMaster25.
9488006	9488727	What is on your mind?
9490387	9491668	Oh, scratch that.
9491868	9491988	I'm 26.
9492388	9494349	Because I aged.
9495610	9502273	Basically, I've been playing a whole lot of old school titles.
9502833	9503253	Like what?
9503273	9504174	For the past few weeks now.
9505040	9514852	I've been trying my best at trying to beat Contra for the Super C, for the Super NES.
9517526	9518486	I swear to you.
9518686	9519007	Hold on.
9520067	9520387	Hold on.
9520567	9522948	What is with all the Contra revival tonight?
9522968	9524849	That's two Contra calls in a row.
9524869	9527009	That is some strange anomaly.
9527089	9528310	It's a rite of passage, Rob.
9529110	9529630	I don't understand.
9529910	9532912	For the life of any young gamer, the rite of passage is making it to Contra.
9532992	9533612	Don't get me wrong.
9533632	9537413	Super C on the Super Nintendo was badass, and everybody should play it once.
9537453	9540814	Those Mode 7 stages were pretty awesome, but I just find it very strange.
9540854	9542855	We've had two calls about Contra back-to-back.
9543115	9545016	Is every caller going to ask about Contra tonight?
9546212	9548294	It's not just Contra I've been playing.
9549355	9559963	Also, this homebrew version of DDR for the Nintendo DS I came across called DSDS Revolution.
9560264	9562145	Well, I would hope you don't dance on your DS.
9562185	9562866	You might break it.
9564067	9569811	No, it's like... Did you guys ever come across the old Game Boy...
9571075	9573837	Yeah, I played the Game Boy Color ones.
9573877	9574797	They were hideous.
9575038	9577579	It was just a way to memorize step charts on the go.
9577619	9579000	That's really the only reason I have it.
9580381	9589447	Well, basically, okay, the controls seem to do multiple arrows and everything with using A and B for the up and right arrows.
9590007	9596191	Apparently, DSDS Revolution seems to do the same exact thing, which is weird.
9597169	9621125	and of course I got the new R4i so I can play my homebrew stuff on my DSi and I'll say here it sounds a whole lot better than it did on my DS Lite but other than that I've mostly been trying to play some of my old Genesis games my Genesis doesn't work anymore which sucks what was that on Genesis?
9622864	9624626	My Genesis does not work anymore.
9625566	9626067	Period.
9626147	9626767	Sorry to hear that.
9626968	9630351	Well, get that freaking collection on the 360 or PS3.
9630391	9631051	It's amazing.
9631071	9632332	There's like tons of games on it.
9633634	9635215	No, but here's the cool thing, though.
9635495	9641601	Because I found a really easy to use, easy to install emulator for the Nintendo DS.
9643142	9644163	I've been using that now.
9644719	9647821	because I also had this thought of trying to play Genesis games on the go.
9648662	9651063	And most of my collection was as follows.
9651323	9662250	Outrun, King of Fighters, I had Monopoly, but... Look, I'm just saying if you want to do it legitimately, the Mega Collection's not a bad deal.
9662410	9663171	But anyway, sorry.
9664772	9667954	Yeah, I mean, it... You know, it...
9668334	9680797	Even though, like, you know, granted, I'm 17, you know, and I was never around when these games originally came out, but I'm like, you know, it's great every once in a while to, you know, have an old-school jig every once in a while.
9681057	9681777	Wait, wait, wait.
9681897	9683117	I have a very important question.
9684137	9691899	You said at the top, you introduced yourself as DSMaster25 and then said, no, wait, I'm DSMaster26 because I age, and now you just said you're 17.
9692639	9693739	I'm totally lost.
9694799	9695319	How old are you?
9695379	9697180	Well, I'm 17.
9699312	9701114	Okay, so where's the 26 come from?
9702375	9712543	Well, because all the DS Master Tales are tooken up, and 25 is the only one available at the time, so it took that, um, and so now it's 26.
9713965	9714585	Okay.
9714765	9717367	Alright, I had, no, I, this was important!
9718088	9718689	No, it wasn't.
9718769	9719769	It's very important!
9721031	9721611	Anything else?
9721691	9723533	Oh, and plus I have a review, um,
9724335	9731738	For a bit on a new DS, well, semi-new DS title that I came across, Chinatown Wars.
9731818	9733519	Alright, make it quick, because we've got to get some more calls.
9735080	9743024	Basically, I've got to say here, it looks exactly like the old PlayStation 1 GTA renditions.
9743444	9747146	It actually runs quite well on the DS.
9747786	9747906	And...
9749628	9752150	And then our quickie, which I give that one of five stars.
9752250	9755172	And then my last quickie review, Quake Live.
9756813	9765818	Recommended, you have a pretty decent hardware because it was getting a little bit shaky when there was multiple explosions on screen.
9766756	9775983	And don't try to play it with a trackpad mouse on a laptop, because I'll tell you this, this is murder on my hands beyond belief.
9776383	9787392	Because I had my index finger and all the rest of my fingers up to the WSAD keys, my thumb all the way stretched down to the left mouse button to shoot, and used my right hand to try to aim.
9788132	9790734	I definitely don't play Quake Live on the netbook.
9790814	9793036	Alright, DSMaster, thanks so much for the call.
9793076	9793536	Take care, buddy.
9794697	9795297	Peace out.
9795558	9795818	Later.
9797625	9802147	Well, you see, DS Master 1 through 24 was taken, so I just went for 25.
9802447	9806569	I'll have you know that someone linked me in chat to a listing on eBay.
9807449	9816973	Yes, for $235 plus shipping, we can own our own edible ink cake printer that will allow us to print emails and eat them.
9817253	9817693	for $235.
9817733	9818774	That's not bad.
9819395	9820155	I'm thinking about it.
9820175	9821616	That would be good.
9822016	9823998	I do have a challenge though on a future show.
9824358	9828161	I would like to hear from DS Masters 1 through 23 at some point.
9828241	9830322	I just want to know where they are.
9830342	9830743	Or 1 through 24.
9832004	9837908	I would love to hear from DS Master 2 or someone with a lot of seniority in the DS Master chain.
9840094	9840334	1-877-GAME-OLR
9861851	9862472	Thanks for watching!
9878246	9896510	Featuring a cool roster of characters including Pyramid Head, Robbie the Rabbit, and of course characters from Rumble Roses, Frogger, Goemon, they even have Taco from Parodius it looks like.
9899931	9901272	So that's interesting.
9901912	9903672	They even have Pyramid Head in this shot, it's kind of funny.
9903932	9904472	Phone's ringing.
9905313	9906693	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9908305	9909846	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9910166	9910846	Hi, Spazinator.
9910866	9911446	What's on your mind?
9911466	9914627	Um, you know, a couple things.
9915108	9925531	Um, yeah, I just caught one of your little stories about an adults-only console that's about to come out.
9925591	9927332	And what are your thoughts on the adults-only console?
9929073	9931694	It's kind of iffy.
9932054	9935395	I would have to get some more information, uh,
9936169	9950775	about before I fully form my opinion one way or the other, but, Mike, you know, at least for the moment, you know, the question is, even though the game's going to be adults only, you know, are they going to be actually any good?
9951155	9960800	I mean, you know, you can almost draw a parallel to a lot of the mature titles that came out at least last generation.
9962660	9964001	Like, for example, uh,
9970697	9975499	BMX XXX was awesome.
9976139	9979540	Awesomely bad, but in a so-bad-it-was-good kind of way.
9979560	9981140	You need to carry a hose around on your bike.
9981260	9982400	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
9982600	9987242	I've got to derail this conversation for a minute, Spazinator, because I have a topic I need to hear about from you.
9987642	9991022	Because we just had DS Master on the show talking about where his name comes from.
9991083	9992823	I need to know where Spazinator comes from.
9994651	9996432	Um, it's kind of a weird story.
9996732	10001273	Um, I assume you're familiar with, uh, the American Pie movies, right?
10001953	10002213	Yes.
10003793	10010635	Yeah, you know how there's, uh, the, you know, there's a character on there, you know, that goes by the name of the Shivernator?
10011275	10011575	Yes.
10012036	10021398	Well, yeah, well, you know, when I meet a Spazinator, I, you know, this is back in the PS2 days, I literally just got down watching, uh,
10022361	10025102	You know, the first American Pie movie.
10025903	10032686	And I also had those kinds of Network Adapter and, you know, and SOCOM 2.
10033726	10042331	And I went to create a screen name and I thought, there's a Sherman here, I like the American Pie movies.
10043031	10044912	Changed the name up a little bit.
10047093	10051515	And the first thing that came to mind was Batmanator, so...
10052348	10054449	and eventually the name kind of stuck.
10054509	10061331	I started using his name on all the games and, you know, just to be a little consistent.
10061391	10066592	So, yeah, it kind of stuck.
10066992	10067953	I'm so glad I asked.
10068693	10069993	Okay, that's cool.
10070913	10072634	So, what else do I want to ask you about?
10072714	10073074	I don't know.
10073914	10076535	Tell us one more thing that's on your mind, then we're going to take another call.
10078463	10091206	Yeah, you know, right at the top of the show, after you got off the pole with Bobby, you had mentioned during your gaming week that you picked up that Zen Pinball game.
10091566	10091826	Yes.
10093206	10103789	Yeah, I actually just got there a couple days ago, and by looking at it, I figured what table it's on by, and I actually beat one of your scores so far, so...
10104733	10105654	All right, here's a good one.
10105774	10105894	No.
10133683	10134644	She's playing Sims 3.
10135104	10143449	Part of my soul died just in the last... 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
10145270	10146631	Loki, did you have some more last minutes?
10146651	10147111	Oh, never mind.
10147131	10148112	We're getting another call.
10148332	10148872	Let's take the call.
10149733	10150714	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10150734	10151074	Who's this?
10153134	10155795	This is Deathwishing.
10156636	10158396	I'm sorry I tore apart your grammar earlier.
10158657	10161738	You're going to have to talk loud so I can barely hear you.
10161758	10162138	About my name, huh?
10162198	10162758	Counterstrike.
10184755	10185836	Let's just say I died a lot.
10185896	10186636	Shit, that's it.
10186696	10186976	All right.
10188597	10189538	See, we had to ask.
10189578	10191599	Why can't everybody have a story like that?
10194260	10195281	Where did your name come from?
10195301	10196301	Your mom.
10197122	10197362	All right.
10198363	10199003	All right, fine.
10199383	10202465	Since your story was so short, I'll let you... What did you want to call in about tonight?
10204686	10207328	The sex box and... Yeah.
10207708	10209829	That's pretty... It's kind of stupid in a way.
10210950	10211250	I mean...
10212888	10217729	One, it's kind of a rip-off of internet meme name stuff.
10218289	10219970	Do we really need a porn game console?
10220050	10222010	It's not a lolcat console.
10222150	10224551	It's not a two girls, one cup console.
10224711	10230332	It probably is a lolcat fetish, so it probably will be a lolcat console.
10230452	10231392	A lolcat fetish.
10231432	10233433	See, there's something I hadn't thought of.
10234633	10237954	Would you be interested in meeting people on the internet with a lolcat fetish, Deathwishing?
10239289	10241670	No, I have a girlfriend, so I don't need it.
10242671	10243552	I can has fucking.
10243652	10247314	Is there any low-cat cosplay is what I want to know.
10248334	10249055	I should do that.
10250215	10255979	I'll just walk around in cat ears with a sign that says, I can has, and then insert random items.
10256039	10256959	It has to have been done.
10257480	10259140	Yes, it has been done.
10259421	10259841	I'm sorry.
10261462	10263103	We had someone go around as low-cat.
10265004	10266084	Yes, your thoughts on the sex box, sir.
10268466	10271568	You guys were following PAX coverage, right?
10272328	10273049	Yeah, a little bit.
10273149	10275111	We had Bobby calling in for PAX.
10275791	10281015	Well, apparently there was a Street Fighter 6 they had for sale there, like limited edition for PAX only.
10282476	10283137	That's pretty cool.
10283177	10283957	Yeah, the girl one.
10284518	10284878	Nice.
10285658	10287880	And, well, you, Frank, gave one away for free.
10289421	10289741	Lucky.
10289922	10291523	Unless they didn't get a thousand viewers.
10293231	10298896	I'm not sure they might have, all I know is they gave away a lot of swag and stuff But they would only give it away if they got a thousand viewers, you said?
10314060	10315321	You know, they try to give away anyway.
10315341	10318142	I mean, God, they heard about the sticks off and they just want to buy two.
10318202	10319522	It's just a shameless promotion.
10319582	10320383	It is completely shameless.
10320403	10320563	I hate...
10342492	10342953	You know what?
10343233	10345896	We used to do Orange Laundry for 12 people and loved it.
10346376	10350080	And so I don't understand this whole, like, we're not going to pay attention to you until we get 500.
10350260	10352262	I just think it's disrespectful to others.
10352842	10353203	I'm sorry.
10353403	10355685	That was a tangent you probably weren't intending on, but you got it.
10356826	10361911	You know, I really think no one really cared about the new track thing either.
10361971	10364094	I think so and so they posted the link to it on...
10365681	10369323	and Chan.com and nothing happened.
10370204	10376948	I saw a user tell I was watching up to like from 197 to 200 and then went back down lower than before.
10377628	10378989	Maybe everybody was at PAX.
10381991	10383332	I don't know.
10383812	10385693	Deathwishing, is there a fight breaking out behind you?
10387795	10391557	Well, there's these people playing some game called... Oh, well, they stopped playing...
10392338	10396000	Hero of New Earth, which is kind of like Dota, and they're all playing Star Cry 2 now.
10396380	10396600	Okay.
10397060	10397240	All right.
10397560	10400922	We're going to let you go, Deathwishing, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
10402383	10402903	Bye-bye.
10403003	10403283	Later.
10404283	10405584	I'm now shutting off the skyline.
10407245	10407585	That's it.
10407685	10408505	No more calls tonight.
10408885	10410266	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through.
10412027	10414488	Loki, did you have anything else for us before we close out shop tonight?
10414656	10415257	Yeah, real quick.
10416037	10418820	The ESRB has rated more games coming to the PlayStation Network.
10418840	10433415	These are PlayStation 1 download titles, including Blood Omen, Legacy of Kain, Cool Boarders 3, International Track and Field, Oddworld Apes Exodus, and Oddworld Apes Odyssey, Pandemonium, Syphon Filter 2, and Um Jammer Lammy.
10433675	10435497	Didn't some of those already come out this week?
10435677	10437259	I thought I heard some of those came out this week.
10438508	10449420	Um, well, Um, Jimmerlammy came out, um, in Japan, and actually, um, Blood Omen and Pandemonium were rated before previously in March.
10449740	10451602	I don't think any of them actually came out this week, though.
10453204	10454986	But, it's neat, I guess.
10455847	10455927	Um...
10457449	10477596	and we talked a little bit I think before about how Guitar Hero World Tour is going to have an option to or Guitar Hero 5 is going to have an option to import some tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour however it's actually quite pathetic only 35 of World Tour's 86 tracks are actually going to be available to import and it's going to cost you $3.50 to do so
10480723	10506762	and also Smash Hits is only going to have a few tracks to import as well I believe they're going to have oh let's see here 21 songs from Smash Hits available to import and with an undisclosed price on that one and that's coming out later this fall but it's still pathetic if you ask me since Rock Band you can import everything except for three tracks well it depends what the songs are too maybe they weren't willing to pony up the money I don't know
10507706	10518971	And then finally, apparently there's new versions of Bonk, Bomberman, and I think maybe some other games coming as well.
10519451	10521892	And these were discovered on Hudson's website.
10521932	10533197	Apparently there's a Bonk update coming, a Bomberman live sequel, and a Wii and DS version of a game called Rooms the Main Building.
10534269	10536091	Bunk Brink of Extinction 2.5D Action Platformer
10555100	10558063	Bobberman Live Battlefest New Arenas, Game Types, Team Play
10574187	10598910	interesting and I guess now I guess Bonk and Barman have been officially announced by Hudson with screenshots and it looks like Bonk and Barman so not much to report there that's it alright sounds awesome Bonk is though one of those things that's a little better left in my memory I think but I don't know if they soup it up a little bit it might be cool
10599478	10600279	Frozen Yogurt
10621670	10623331	My final thought is, sounds amazing.
10623651	10627074	And I thought this show would be shorter tonight, but it was actually kind of long tonight.
10627394	10627914	Go figure.
10628795	10630836	Sometimes you just never know how long the show's gonna go.
10630896	10631196	Loki.
10631997	10633918	So, I have a toy for my cat.
10634519	10635539	It's a laser pointer.
10635639	10638381	But the thing is, the laser pointer is shaped like a cat.
10638481	10640062	So does that make it a laser cat?
10642324	10642904	Possibly.
10644806	10645286	Definitely.
10646867	10648668	It is a cat that fires a laser, so.
10649569	10650850	At least you don't have a laser cat fetish.
10651727	10654829	And on that note, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into Orange Launch Radio.
10654849	10656190	We really appreciate your support.
10656250	10660633	Hey, if you like what you've heard, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the station because you know what?
10660653	10663414	We don't have a big magazine promoting us.
10663474	10669998	We don't have zillions of followers on Twitter, and we're never going to have a contest that we'll only do if so many people follow us or what have you.
10670038	10671379	Just help us get the word out.
10671399	10672160	That's all we ask.
10672200	10678544	However, you can do it through an iTunes review, through anything, and we'll try to keep it free for you guys for another seven years, all right?
10679164	10680124	Have a good night, everybody.
10680224	10681165	We'll see you next week.
10681205	10684646	We will be back next week with even more of the latest and greatest in video gaming.
10684666	10687406	And of course, we're starting to get to the start of that fourth quarter.
10687426	10689467	We're just going to have games after games after games.
10689827	10695209	So our reviews and yours sitting around talking smack about what we love, video games.
10695769	10696529	I'm Rob Roberts.
10696769	10697549	She's DarkSakura.
