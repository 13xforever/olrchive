00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,760
Today, September 6th, 2009, a once-pay-wee channel goes free, a new racing game will

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,800
be integrating Twitter, and we recap and talk about the news from PAX 2009.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,160
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week here of

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,760
Orange Lounge Radio. We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming,

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,600
gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. We tape live every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,360
A big thanks to our friends at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm here with you for the next three hours. My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always,

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
for the past seven and a half years, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,120
Jamie Summers. Nom, nom, nom. Nom, nom, nom. How are you? Nomming. Okay, quickly,

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
Orange Lounge Fudio, what are you nomming on tonight? Brains. Shut up. Pizza. Pizza.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
With extra garlic. It's a cheese pizza, but I added garlic to it because garlic makes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,360
everything better. It will keep the vampires away. Awesome. Also, joining us tonight,

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,840
say hello to the one and only Loki. Hello. Loki, you look like you're listening to

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,640
something else over there. I'm trying to, but I hate these, like, earbud headphones.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,560
What are you, uh, any hints on what you, is this cage match for later, or what is it? Yeah,

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,080
because I didn't pick anything. I see. Per usual. All right, and if you don't know what

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm talking about, that's because you've never tuned in live before. We do a little,

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,960
little special thing after the show. You'll have to tune in live sometime. I'm hoping,

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
because it's Labor Day, maybe we get some people listening live that haven't listened before. So,

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,720
a big hello to all of you, uh, that are new to us broadcasting live. Be sure to join our chat room,

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,160
chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and we will read, uh, some comments from chat, and, uh, comment

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,000
from the Rob D in chat, uh, early this evening. You know it's PAX weekend when Orange Lounge is

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
talking old DDR, and AllGames.com is discussing condom reviews. I guess the AllGames chat is

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,160
talking about, uh, condoms. So, uh, way to be mature. No, I'm... Please, like, I should be

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,120
judging on that, uh, part. Um, we're completely immature here on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'm

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,360
glad the Rob D brought up PAX, because it is Penny Arcade Week, uh, Penny Arcade Expo Weekend.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,880
Sadly, the three of us could not go this year. We all went last year, but we kinda ate the money

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,040
in the budget for E3. But, our dear friend, Bobby Blackwolf, is live at the show. We're gonna call

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,360
him right now, and talk to him about Penny Arcade Expo. One ringy dingy dingy.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,280
Farid Exterminators.

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
Hi, Bobby.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,440
Hey, Bob. Hey, Rob. What's up, guys?

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
Not much. How are you doing?

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Doing good. It's, uh, been a long weekend, but I've had a lot of fun here.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright, Bobby Blackwolf, of course. I need to give you a proper introduction. He is the man who

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,560
takes the Bobby Blackwolf show live at five o'clock right before we are live. He sadly was

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,480
not live tonight, but he did have a sneak peek of the rock band Beatles that he got a little early

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,640
from Harmonix. So, uh, props to you, Blackwolf.

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
And, by the way, it's the Beatles rock band. They are very strict on that.

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
Oh. Oh, well, I am sorry. The Beatles rock band. I'm sorry. Beatles first. How dare I?

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Of course, the Beatles always first. Alright, well, Bobby, let's talk about it. If they want to hear

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,480
Beatles rock band, they can download that show. Bobby, let's talk about PAX. How was it? Did you have fun?

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,240
I had fun. And, I mean, I kind of did kind of what you guys did at E3. We did not do any appointments.

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,400
We did not set any interviews. So, we were able to just kind of go around and spend as much or as

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,520
little time as we wanted. And, but, for those of us who did go to E3, there's a lot here that was

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,360
repeated and regurgitated. A lot of the same E3 builds, the E3 demos were here on the show floor.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
But, it was nice to see regular folk get a chance at the same things that we saw a couple months ago.

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,920
So, it was a lot of fun to see their reactions, see what they thought about it.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
You know, I kind of had a feeling that what happened is that you'd see at Penny Arcade Expo

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
kind of a lot of the same stuff that you saw at E3. And, let's not forget Blizzcon because, you know,

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,320
Blizzard showed up at PAX. They didn't go to E3, but brought mini Blizzcon with them a little bit.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,920
What was, did you see anything interesting to you that you did not see at E3? Some new things?

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,320
Well, one of them I saw was Star Trek Online.

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Oh snap. You know I want the details on this.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,920
So, you know, I played through one of their episodes, like they did any episode type of thing

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,960
where you start off in your ship and you kind of fly around and they say you get a distress call.

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,560
So, you go and you fight some Klingon birds of prey in the ship combat, and then you beam down

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
to the planet, which was kind of like the city on the edge of forever, and the Klingons are trying

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,440
to take over the forever. And so, you had to defend it and then talk to it, and that was kind

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
of the end of the mission. But, it kind of showed, you know, the combat and stuff, and it's another

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,200
one of those MMOs where, you know, you press one to do this attack and two to do this attack.

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,080
But, they really captured the Star Trek feel, especially in the HUD a lot.

63
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,200
So, I'm looking forward to it. There is a closed beta that you can sign up for on their website.

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,120
You didn't have to be just attacked to get it. So, I encourage people to go to their website

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
and sign up for that closed beta if they're interested in it.

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,920
I did.

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes, and we'll be giving more details on that a little later on in the show. I think that's one

68
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,120
of our stories coming up a little later. But, my question about Star Trek Online, was it fun?

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,840
It was fun, the little bit that they showed, but they even said that, you know, this was a very

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,760
small episode. What they're basically doing, their missions are scheduled to be kind of like 45

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,760
minutes to an hour, and they're calling them episodes. They're hiring Star Trek writers.

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,480
Oh, nice.

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,000
So, they were basically just showing the combat portion, but they said there's going to be

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,880
puzzles and other things to do that aren't, you know, just fight, fight, fight. But, here at PAX,

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
they were just showing the fighting. But, it was fun. It was kind of a nice little taste.

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,320
But, they said it's going to be in 45 minutes to one hour chunks, just like an episode instance

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,840
for up to five people. So, it could be a lot of fun.

78
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,680
It's interesting. It sounds like they borrowed some ideas from WoW, which I guess are kind of

79
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,920
general MMO things anyway, but the whole like, you know, one, two, three combat and the instances of

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,800
five people. Kind of interesting. Anything else on the show floor that caught your attention that

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
didn't catch at E3?

82
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,160
Well, I actually got to play Heavy Rain this time around, which I missed at E3. And, it was kind of

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,200
interesting watching, like, going through the line of people and basically Heavy Rain. It reminds me

84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,520
a lot of Shenmue. Like, I really didn't understand or get what Heavy Rain was, but it's basically,

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,240
you know, quick time action sequences along with tank driving in terms of moving your character.

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:50,880
But, it's basically, there's a gunpoint heist in a grocery store or a quickie mark. And, basically,

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,160
you can actually determine how it ends up. And, the guy before me actually convinced the guy to

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,640
leave the store. And, I had to punch him in the face. But, it was a very interesting mechanic and

89
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,240
just interesting the way that it went down. And, it's not a game. I, you know, I haven't seen this

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
kind of gameplay all that much in terms of a whole game. I've seen it in, like, minigames and, like,

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,480
God of War and, you know, and Shenmue and things like that. But, it's going to be kind of interesting

92
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,160
to see how this game really turns out longer than a five-minute demo.

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,360
All right. Well, we're monitoring our chat room at chat.orangeontrader.com. We're getting some

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,600
questions for you, Bobby. Act Def wants to know about Scribblenauts. Did you go to the Scribblenauts

95
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,800
panel? Was it there on the show floor? I did not go to the panel, but they were once again on the

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,600
corner of the show floor where they belong, apparently. But, they brought this kiosk and

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,520
the lines were long the entire time. But, I actually did talk to them and even talked to some

98
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,880
of the developers. And, for people who've listened to my show for a long time, know that when I went

99
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,840
to GDC in 2007, one of the student competition IGF winners I interviewed with a group that made

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,880
a game called Toblo. And, during that interview, I was apparently, I met up with the guy that I

101
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,520
interviewed then. He said I was one of the three people that wanted to talk to them at GDC.

102
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,120
And, they thought it was really cool. And, apparently, I announced their first game,

103
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Drawn to Life, because he had talked about it on our show, gave us a rundown,

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
well before they had even done any kind of formal announcements or anything like that.

105
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,040
And, he didn't get in trouble. But, it was kind of neat to hear him talk about it and how he

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,960
remembered me. And, it was kind of cool to talk to them. And, I did get to play one level, just

107
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,640
getting one of the stars. But, that was about all I could do because it was near the end of the show

108
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
and the lines were just so long the entire show. Right. What a turnaround from E3 because we walked

109
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,240
right up to the kiosk at E3. So, apparently, word of mouth is spreading. Yeah. Well, they've been

110
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
very happy with all the coverage and surprised. They didn't think they would get the kind of

111
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,360
coverage that they got. And so, they came a little bit more prepared this time, like WB,

112
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
their little booth. They were showing Fear II and Scribblenauts. And, that's it. And, they had

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,680
six Scribblenauts kiosks and two K kiosks for Fear II or a Fear thing or something. Fear II or what.

114
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,200
Yeah. Why would they show Fear II? It's been out forever now. I don't know. Well, it was a Fear

115
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
something. I didn't look at it because Scribblenauts was next to it. Maybe it was a new platform.

116
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
There might be a new expansion or something. Yeah. Bobby, what about others? Oh, go ahead.

117
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,440
No. There were some games that were already out, like Metroid Prime, the trilogy was in Nintendo's

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
booth. And, it's already out in stores. But, they were bribing people with t-shirts if they came up

119
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,640
and played it. So, there was some stuff that's already out. Bobby, let me ask you about other

120
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,560
live events going on at the show, like panels, concerts. I don't know if you got to do any of

121
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,400
those. I know last year when we all went, we didn't do a whole lot of those because we were

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,800
broadcasting, but since you didn't have that this year, did you get to experience a lot outside of

123
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,960
the show for any of the events? No, because I was able to get into a lot of the parties,

124
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,080
a lot of the company parties. So, I didn't really get into any of the panels or anything. But,

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,120
I mean, I'm very happy because I've been a fan of Paul and Storm and Jonathan Colton for a long

126
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,280
time. And, you know, they're coming to Rock Band this week. That's the PAX Pack. And, I've actually

127
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,640
referenced Paul and Storm several times on the show. Every time I reference myself as an opening

128
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,160
band, that's the song that's going to be in Rock Band 2. So, once again, we're showcasing

129
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
artists that people are going to know very soon. Very cool. And, you know, it's interesting. I

130
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,360
heard at the Rock Band panel, they actually were putting together one of Jonathan Colton's songs

131
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
in the new indie development, the Rock Band Network, which I guess is a pretty cool thing

132
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,920
to experience. So, well, okay then, if you went to parties, what can you tell us about some of

133
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,120
the parties that were going on? CPP people are freaky. That was probably the most hilarious one,

134
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
just because it's not my scene. CPP bought White Wolf, which is World of Darkness,

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
and they did, usually at Dragon Con, they do the Succubus Club, which is at like this

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,800
golf night club or whatever. And, you know, just a lot of weird things happen from that scene.

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,840
I think we got an invite to something like that in E3. Let's have pictures of that.

138
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,760
Yeah, there's probably pictures of it. I mean, we saw, like, when I was there, it was just,

139
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
the comedy was great, where they had a guy doing, like, this whole routine with a lightsaber,

140
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,000
techno music, and actually the techno music was actually going with, he was timing the

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,960
lightsaber moves with the bass and stuff. And, you know, seeing people use iPhones as glow sticks,

142
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,680
because they didn't have the wrong, you know, I mean, the glow stick app's pretty funny.

143
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah, they weren't even doing that. They just had, like, the screen on, the home screen on,

144
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
and they were just waving them around. Nice. Very nice. Well, Bobby, before we let you go,

145
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
because I know you want to get a flight and all that fun stuff, I want to know, like,

146
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,080
what was the best thing about PAX, and what was the worst thing about PAX?

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
The best thing about PAX is that it started, and the worst thing is that it ended.

148
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,600
That's a tricky response. All right, how did it compare to E3 this year?

149
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,960
Well, see, you can't really compare it to E3. I mean, basically, I can actually compare

150
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,720
PAX to last year. There were 70,000 people here. All the badges were sold out. You know,

151
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
my girlfriend actually bought a badge. She thought she was coming out, and she didn't,

152
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
and she wound up being able to sell it for 170 bucks. So I thought it was going to be very

153
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,440
crowded. I say I thought, but the difference between PAX with 70,000 people and, say, E3

154
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,520
2006 with 68,000 people is that PAX is spread out. Not all 70,000 people are trying to be on

155
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,200
the expo hall at the same time, whereas E3, pretty much you could say 60,000 of the 68,000

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,880
were all trying to be in the exhibit hall, so you couldn't move around. Other than when they

157
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,160
were throwing T-shirts and giving away raffles, I could still walk around just fine. Now, the big

158
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,920
games I had to wait in line to play, but it was pretty manageable. You didn't think that there

159
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,280
were 70,000 people here this weekend. Interesting. I guess a lot go for the live gaming events,

160
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,280
too, and I bet those rooms take away quite a few people. And I think when they say 70,000,

161
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,320
they also, you know, that's spread out through the three days. PAX sells a lot of individual day

162
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,560
badges, too, and it's never really, I think, accounted for just how many they're selling

163
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,440
of those Friday, Saturday, Sunday badges. Well, they have the numbers because the convention

164
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,360
center actually let them sell 1,000 of the one-day PAX for Saturday and Sunday at the last minute,

165
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,400
and they were very surprised about that. Oh, wow. So, I mean, so people who did come up here

166
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,480
hoping to get a badge were actually able to get badges at the last minute, so that was really

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
nice. But basically, the thing is, there's only two or three events at this convention center

168
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
that take up the entire center. Usually, they double book. They had a Jewish convention

169
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,520
last year. I don't know if you ever remember that. Yeah, I do remember that. Way up on the sixth floor.

170
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,520
PAX actually had the entire building this time, and they're like one of two events in the entire

171
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,160
year that actually need the entire building, and that's also why they're on Labor Day weekend,

172
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,640
because that's the only time they can schedule just one event. Wow. Yeah, I heard SoccerCon,

173
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,240
I think, is the other event, if I remember right, which is a big anime thing they do up there, so.

174
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,960
I still want to go. Busy, busy, busy. Well, Bobby, before we let you go, anything else you want to

175
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,720
us to share about your experiences at PAX, or any plugs you want to give, or what have you?

176
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Not really. I mean, I walked in, and I wanted to bring up one other game that I saw a demo of that

177
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,840
I didn't see at E3, and that's Red Dead Redemption was Rockstar's big game that they were trying to

178
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,400
show off here, and it's basically GTA meets Wild West. I know, it looks awesome. And if you thought

179
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,520
Liberty City was big, or not Liberty, yeah Liberty City, if you thought GTA 4 was big, this one is

180
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,840
huge, open world, it's basically GTA Wild West, and it actually looked really good from the demo

181
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,880
they showed, so that shows that they can make a good demo, so we'll see, eventually. And the

182
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,680
Flipsecond guys were there, people were playing Flipsecond, and they say that's probably going to

183
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
be in spring of 2010 or summer, they say it's kind of been pushed back, which means they have

184
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,080
even more time to work on it from what we saw at E3. Awesome, well that was definitely one of the

185
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,120
all-stars at E3, so I'm hoping they got a lot of air time, I guess you could say, out there on the

186
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,880
show floor, so sounds like a lot of fun stuff. Did you, was DJ Hero playable there? Activision

187
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,840
was not here. Ah, they suck. Blizzard was, though, that's interesting. Blizzard was here.

188
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,680
Interesting. But Activision apparently did like an invite-only event Thursday night, and that's

189
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,200
when they showed off some stuff, but I was not invited to that, so I didn't get to go to that,

190
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,480
but no, Activision themselves were not physically here at the show this year.

191
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,880
I did think of one more question I have for you, Bobby, because it just sprung to mind,

192
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,560
because unfortunately none of us were able to go to PAX West this year, or PAX Prime,

193
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
I guess as they're calling it. What about PAX East? Was there any kind of clues or hints or

194
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,400
promos going on for PAX East, an idea what to expect?

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,680
No, not really, and even like the enforcers don't know if they're working PAX East,

196
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
like I was talking to the media guy, because I want to start doing broadcasting again. They

197
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,200
couldn't fit us in, like the space that we were in last year for All Games Radio

198
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,040
was taken up by other tables, so like there was like tabletop gaming going on in that area,

199
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
and that's why we couldn't have that area, and they didn't want to run the network all the way

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,360
across, but I asked them, I'm like, are you the new guy that's running the media? He said,

201
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,880
I asked them, are you running the media at Boston? So we can go ahead and kind of start

202
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,920
talking about that, and he's like, I don't know. So basically, here's the thing that he did tell

203
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,800
me, is that PAX East has been outsourced to another company, so it's not the same people

204
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,720
running it. So I don't know if that's going to change how it feels or not, because I mean,

205
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,200
the guys that run PAX are just a little bit too overwhelmed with this show. So they've kind of

206
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,000
had to farm it out and outsource it to another company while still having the reins on it, but

207
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,360
we don't know if it's going to be the same as this. It's going to be kind of interesting.

208
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,400
That is very interesting news. I'm very curious to see how PAX East develops, but I know,

209
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,920
excuse me, I know I'm heading out there one way or another. I've always wanted to go to Boston.

210
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
I have some friends out there. I want to go to the con. We have a lot of OR listeners on the East

211
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,560
Coast. I definitely want to go, and hopefully Dark Soccer or Loki can swing it, but if they can't,

212
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,160
then that's fine. We'll have Orange Lawns Radio one way or another coming from PAX East.

213
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Yep, and I'll be up there too. So this Friday, we're actually going to be running a show on my TV

214
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,120
show Friday Night Gaming. We're actually going to be running one of the games that's here that comes

215
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,320
out this week. I don't know if you've heard of Darkest of Dates. It is a time-traveling first

216
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,680
person shooter, and it's actually by the same guys that make the real deal casino game.

217
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,480
Yeah, it looked funny.

218
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,600
It's kind of funny. But it was cool. They're coming out on PC and 360,

219
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,640
and we're going to be running it on fnglive.net this Friday.

220
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,480
All right. So Bobby Blackwell coming to us. That's all right. Bobby Blackwell coming to us live from

221
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Penny Arcade Expo. If you want to hear more Bobby, he has two shows he hosts. He's a busy guy,

222
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Friday Night Gaming, fnglive.net, as you just heard about, and of course, the Bobby Blackwell

223
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,840
show right before us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights. Bobby, thank you so much for

224
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
taking the time out to talk to us tonight.

225
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
No problem. Thanks for interrupting your show flow to get me in.

226
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,720
No problem. Anytime for you, Bobby. You always have us on your show every week.

227
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Have a very safe flight home, okay?

228
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,840
All right. Thank you.

229
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,800
All right. Take care. Bobby Blackwell live on Orange Lawn's radio, everybody. He always gives

230
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,920
us like five minutes on his show every week. We can give him 15 on our show tonight, and a lot

231
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,160
of great... I had no idea that Paxis was being run by a different company. That's huge news,

232
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
in my opinion. Well, I don't know if it's huge news, but it's a huge interesting thing I didn't

233
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,640
think about before. That's very interesting. That game Darkest of Days looks funny. It's basically,

234
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,240
you can time travel to the past like the Civil War with giant weapons that you could totally

235
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
hick everyone's ass with. Nice.

236
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,320
It is intriguing, so I may have to try that. Very nice. All right. Well, hey, even though that was

237
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,640
the start of our show tonight, we always like to start off the show normally with our gaming week,

238
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
so we're gonna get right back into Orange Lawn's radio. We have plenty to talk about,

239
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,920
not just stuff from Pax, other news, and of course, how we always start off our gaming week.

240
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

241
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,720
I shook my butt. I played Para Para First Mix and played a lot of 2DX Distorted,

242
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,480
and what was that weird trippy ass game that you told me, here, play?

243
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
DJ Max Technica, a new arcade game.

244
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,080
It was all right. Not really my thing. It's a little too K-pop.

245
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,800
Although it was pretty. I did have a good time playing it. It was just very K-pop.

246
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah.

247
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It was like, wow, is this Andamiro?

248
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,520
Also, Dan played the new Hydro Thunder spiritual successor. What was it called?

249
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,280
I don't remember the name, but it was a big machine. That was a cool thing. It was

250
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,720
Hydro something or Hydra, Hydro something. It was a cool little game. Big, big machine.

251
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,520
Dan was like, give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card I wanna play. Give me the card

252
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
I wanna play. Oh yeah, and I played that punching bag game, which was stupid because it was in the

253
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:10,000
corner and I was bored. And then I played lots of Sims 3, and I played some Ragnarok online

254
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,720
before I got completely just fed up, fed up. And I have a guilty admission.

255
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,680
What's that?

256
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm downloading. Well, I downloaded. Shut up. I'm not an addict. I haven't touched it in two years.

257
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Yeah, my last date of playing was October of 2007.

258
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
What were you playing?

259
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
I haven't played it yet. I'm just downloading it.

260
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,280
But you're going to play?

261
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
World of Warcraft.

262
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
That's okay. I reactivated my account this week too.

263
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
Ha, you're the addict.

264
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Hey, shut up. Shut it. Shut it. You're just as bad.

265
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,560
But not really. I did check, and the last time I played was in October 2007.

266
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,080
Geez. You should've let me cast a Scroll of Resurrection on you. I would've got a free month.

267
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
Someone else did.

268
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,960
Ah, cursed them. Alright. Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

269
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,880
My gaming week was alright. I'm having a love-hate relationship right now with Rockstar,

270
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,680
unfortunately. I love the new trailer for The Ballad of the Gay Tony. It's really making me

271
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,200
excited of the next expansion they're going to have, because it's now more kind of over-the-top

272
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,400
stuff. I did play more Grand Theft Auto this week. However, they did patch Grand Theft Auto

273
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,360
so that we can't run our modded games anymore, which is very... We were completely depressed

274
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,040
for the remainder of the week. It's absolute crap. However, I am not letting that stop me,

275
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,120
and I will get by this one way or another.

276
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
They'll find a way around it eventually.

277
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm already kind of working on a way. So yeah, it's kind of annoying, but I understand they did

278
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
it for the greater good, because there's assholes out there that like to ruin everybody's games by

279
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,000
doing all these different cheat things and stuff, and not exactly in the closed environments that

280
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
we're playing in. But hey, whatever. Still, though, it sucks that some people have to

281
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,520
ruin it for everybody else. The other game I played, not that I got an early media copy,

282
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,480
but I did get an early copy of The Beatles' Rock Band. And honestly, I think one of the things you

283
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,280
got to consider when you're planning on buying The Beatles' Rock Band is you better damn well

284
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
be a Beatles fan, because if you're not, then you're not going to enjoy it too much.

285
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm okay with The Beatles. I don't hate their music. I like some of their songs, but it kind

286
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,480
of lost, after playing it for a little bit, it kind of lost its appeal. It's just like,

287
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
oh yeah, that's really cool, amazing, all these dreamscapes and stuff, and now I've seen them,

288
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,480
and it's just Rock Band. I don't know.

289
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,280
So you're saying the presentation is somebody who is not as into The Beatles. Kind of the

290
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,760
presentation and the new packaging of Rock Band kind of wore off on you really quick?

291
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes. It's not a bad game by any means. It's just, for me, I can't see myself playing this for a

292
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,560
long time. If I could have imported my songs or imported these songs into Rock Band 2 or something,

293
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,040
maybe I would have gotten more life out of it. But I don't know, it looks fun. I think it might

294
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,040
be fun to bring out parties or something, but I couldn't see myself actually playing this for an

295
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,880
extended period of time. But it's neat, given that, but I don't know. I think going forward,

296
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,600
if there's any single band games or single artist games that they're going to be coming out with,

297
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,800
I'll have to really evaluate whether I like that artist a lot or not. You know, if they did like

298
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,360
a Michael Jackson game or something like that, I might be tempted. But The Beatles, it's pretty

299
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,360
good. If you like The Beatles, you'll definitely like this game, and other than that, I mean,

300
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,920
it's just basically Rock Band with three-part harmonies. Although I don't have three microphones,

301
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,080
so, you know. And I don't sing either. A lot of reviews, I guess the embargo or whatever was

302
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,800
lifted the other day, because all of a sudden there was just a ton of reviews that all hit

303
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:52,160
the internet at once. And I'm seeing a lot of positive about the presentation, the way it looks,

304
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,640
the way that it really feels like The Beatles. It's kind of interesting. You're one of the first

305
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,120
negative things I've heard. Not so much negative, but just the fact that, as someone who's not as

306
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,120
into The Beatles, it wore off on me. Interesting. I mean, let me put it this way, I'd be less

307
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,200
satisfied with a Guitar Hero release that is basically just reskinned. They didn't put any

308
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,360
effort into the presentation. I still love the intro to the game, and it's awesome. I haven't

309
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,240
really played much of the story. It's mainly been just the quick play stuff. But, I don't know,

310
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,800
it's neat. For me, I don't listen to Beatles music that much. I recognize their songs, but I don't

311
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,200
really go seek out Beatles music. Let me ask you one more question. If you were, let's say, imagine

312
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,040
that you were a hardcore Beatles fan, how do you think this game would compare to other artists'

313
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,160
solitary games, such as Guitar Hero, Aerosmith, or the ACDC expansion for Rock Band? Oh, yeah,

314
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,560
this would be awesome. I mean, they totally nailed The Beatles and just the whole feel of the game

315
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:57,200
and everything. I like that. I really dig that. But, it's just, I'm not a huge fan of The Beatles.

316
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,320
But, yeah, if they put that amount of effort into other artists' games, then I would still be

317
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,080
likely to check them out. Even though I'm not a big fan of The Beatles, I still bought a copy of

318
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,680
it because it looked really cool. I don't think I wasted my money on it. I'm not going to enjoy it

319
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,240
as much as Rock Band, where if I don't like a track in it or whatever, it doesn't really matter

320
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,920
because I can just always get different artists and stuff later on. Whereas, The Beatles stuff,

321
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,760
if I don't like the tracks in it, I can't really buy more tracks because they're just more Beatles

322
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,640
music. Going to our chat room, chat.orangelawnsradio.com, certainly a lot of comments going

323
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,520
on about The Beatles' Rock Band. J-Rod in chat says, so because Rock Band Beatles has an opening

324
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,000
cut scene, it's not a reskinned version and, quote, better than the Guitar Hero artist games.

325
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,040
Oh, God, my brain is raging so hard. Well, let's not forget, this is not the first Rock Band

326
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,480
artist-dedicated game. There was an ACDC game that a lot of people forget came out last year that was,

327
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
I mean, it was probably even worse than the Guitar Hero games, right?

328
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,560
Well, yeah, that was something that they did for Walmart.

329
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,520
That was a cash-in, just straight-up cash-in. So, you know, it's not like they've always done

330
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,800
perfect releases, but to, I guess, kind of defend it a little bit, what do you think makes this

331
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,880
a step above Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Van Halen, if you do feel it is a step above?

332
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,240
I think the step above is they went beyond just putting the artists in the game and just putting,

333
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,440
like, you know, their tracks and stuff like that. They actually made it very much feel like, you

334
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,640
know, the vibe of the Beatles, just the whole stylized version of the game. Everything is,

335
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,320
like, catered to, you know, their kind of acid, trippy backgrounds that they have going on,

336
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,200
the different songs, just the different styles of, you know, depending on when, you know,

337
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,520
the songs came out, what decade and whatnot. It just really set it apart, I think. Whereas,

338
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,520
like, you know, Guitar Hero Rock Band, or not, Guitar Hero, you know, like, Metallica or Van

339
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Halen or something like that, I mean, those are pretty much all interchangeable. I mean,

340
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,800
they haven't really done anything with the interface other than, you know, replace the logo

341
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,560
in it, and they changed, you know, the models so that it's, like, you know. Which is essentially

342
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,200
what Lego Rock Band is going to be. Yes. True. I mean, let's be fair. Yeah, true. Lego Rock Band's

343
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
pretty much going to be the same thing. But the thing with Lego Rock Band, though, is it's also

344
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
more like the other Telltale games where they have the little, like, cutscenes there with the

345
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Lego characters and stuff. All the Lego games kind of feel the same as far as that, and they

346
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
have a little bit of, like, different elements into there. But yeah, it's really not that much

347
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,640
different than, say, you know, Guitar Hero, Van Halen or something like that. I mean, they have

348
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,560
gone a little bit further in the presentation, but, you know, not enough to where I'm going to

349
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,560
say it's, like, amazing or anything. Yeah, see, I'm not feeling Lego Rock Band. Like, I'm totally,

350
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,120
like, even though I'm, like, just... Yeah, I appreciate the Beatles. I'm all about Beatles

351
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
Rock Band, but I think the music games I'll probably buy this holiday season are the

352
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,840
Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5. What about... And a lot of that boils down to the song list,

353
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,080
because I think Guitar Hero 5 has a great song list for me, especially compared to World Tour.

354
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,640
Like, I really want Guitar Hero 5. Well, we discussed that we were probably going to get

355
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,360
Guitar Hero 5 so we could get the Van Halen, even though I don't... I'm a big fan of Van Hagar and

356
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,680
not, you know, but I'm still more looking forward to Rock Band Beatles, you know, Beatles Rock Band

357
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,360
myself, just because I am a fan. I mean, not as big fan as some people I know, but, you know,

358
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,920
I'm a pretty... I love it, and I'm actually looking forward to the overall experience of it,

359
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,640
you know. Yeah, and I'm just not... I'm not feeling it with Lego or... I don't know enough about Band

360
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,800
Hero. I just... It seems like Band Hero is going to be a little bit... Band Hero should have, like,

361
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,680
marching band moves and stuff. Okay, well, Band Hero is basically just the same thing as Lego

362
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,240
Rock Band. I mean, it's basically their E10 Plus game. It's got a bunch of different artists. You

363
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,000
know who they have pimping it out? Huh. Well, I found out the last artist that they haven't

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,240
announced yet. What's that? No Doubt. Well, that's kind of cool, though. I like No Doubt. Yeah,

365
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,920
they have No Doubt's going to be pimping that game out, too. Band Hero? That might... Yeah,

366
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,040
and Band Hero. Okay, I don't... Band Hero might be kind of cool, actually. I don't know. It's

367
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,120
really at this point, especially when you're doing, you know, when the... Well, you know,

368
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,880
you can't really say that for Guitar Hero 5, because Guitar Hero 5 is not a reskinning. They

369
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,040
have gone back and reinvented the game. Now you can play all the instruments. You can't say that.

370
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,840
So, you know, that's another reason why... But Band Hero is a reskinning of Guitar Hero 5. Well,

371
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,600
of Guitar Hero 5. Yeah. So... But I don't know, like, I'm okay with the reskinnings if the song

372
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,560
lists are really, really good. And it sounds like Band Hero might have a pretty good song list. I

373
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,440
don't know. I don't know. Well, all right. Anyways, enough of the music game, blah, blah, blah. So

374
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:38,720
anything else you're giving me, Louie? Not really, but I'm still waiting for my cabinet to come in.

375
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,800
I got more Dance Mania... I have two Dance Maniac sensors now, which I was hoping to actually create

376
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:50,240
a real Dance Mania setup to go with my Dance Mania System 573 board. But the problem is,

377
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,840
and I was unaware of this because I actually got the Dance Maniac's manual first sent to me because

378
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,840
I, you know, I would like to know how to wire this thing up. Dance Maniac sensors come in top and

379
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,280
bottom. The bottom have two sensors, one on top, one on bottom, I think, or two on the bottom,

380
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:13,440
maybe. But the top sensors only have one sensor. And so I got two top sensors, unfortunately,

381
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,200
and now I have to do something or create my own sensors or something. Talk to the guy that sold

382
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
them to me to see if he has any bottom sensors, but he hasn't gotten back to me. He doesn't speak

383
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,120
much English either. I'm looking at chat.orangeonstrader.com and Lumi's in chat says,

384
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,440
didn't Rob see No Doubt Paramore concert a few weeks ago? We actually just call that the No Doubt

385
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,960
concert because I didn't care about the other bands on the ticket. But, well, actually the

386
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,360
sounds were pretty freaking awesome as far as that other band, yeah. But No Doubt, like, I'm not

387
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,440
going to lie. I love No Doubt. Okay. I graduated high school in 1996. That was like the year of

388
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,960
No Doubt. You know what? That's like the anthem of high school and everything for me. So you know

389
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,200
what? Like if there was a Guitar Hero No Doubt game, even if it was just like a re-skinning or

390
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,920
whatever, I'd probably buy it because I really like No Doubt. I bought that whole album and rock

391
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,440
band and everything. And yeah, I don't know. Call me a sucker, whatever. But I think a lot of people,

392
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,000
if their favorite band came out in whatever game, would feel the same way. So anyway, I don't want

393
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,760
to get into too much more talking about music games. Well, you heard that Lego Rock Band,

394
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,640
the rumor is that you're going to import those tracks into Rock Band 2. That's kind of cool.

395
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,280
I hope that's the case because I'm going to rent it. Just rent it. Import those tracks.

396
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,520
Shame on you. Hey, do what I can. All right. Hey, Saig is in chat and wants to correct Loki. Tell

397
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,200
Tale Games does not make any of the Lego games. I think you botched the company name when you were

398
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,080
talking about that. I'm sorry. I'm thinking of Traveler or something. Traveler's Tales. I'm

399
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,360
sorry. Traveler's Tales. It's TT. I mean, close, but very different. Sorry. Traveler's Tales.

400
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,240
Whatever. I mean, same initials. That's what I remember. That's right. Anyhow, at least we got

401
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,600
that clarified. Moving on, My Gaming Week. Good lord, I played a lot of games this week, actually.

402
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,000
I want to talk about DJ Max Technica real quick because I know Dark Sakura is kind of about it,

403
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,360
but I really enjoyed it. It was like Elite Beat Agents, basically. Imagine if Elite Beat Agents

404
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,840
were an arcade game where you tap the screen with your finger to hit the buttons. Basically,

405
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,360
what happens, you see a bar going across the top and then it goes back down to the bottom. It's

406
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,080
kind of like running a track around the screen. Then as it passes these dots, you have to tap the

407
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,400
dots to play the music. Or you can drag your finger for some of them and some dots you have

408
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,120
to hit over and over again to hit with a beat of the music. I really like the way it was set up.

409
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,480
I had a really good time playing the game. The only problem I had with the game, the music was

410
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,440
completely uninspiring and not memorable to me. I know that's going to piss a lot of people off

411
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,120
that I said that. Some of the music game fans, especially if you like the Korean pop, but I'm

412
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,160
sorry. It just was not... I wasn't able to distinguish one song from another that I was

413
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,440
playing. I can't put my finger on it. 2DX just has such a variety and such cool songs in it.

414
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
A lot of it is so memorable, at least in the past. I would almost say the same is true about

415
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,240
BeatMania 2DX now, ever since 13th Style about there. Too bad they don't have a Ubi machine

416
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,240
there. But the game itself, I thought was a lot of fun. I would play it again. Maybe the musical

417
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,800
grow on me. I don't know. But the game itself I had a lot of fun with. And I'm seeing frowns

418
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,840
in chat. I'm sorry guys. I guess maybe it's a personal preference thing. But the game itself,

419
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,000
pretty cool. Also, some of the stuff I played this week. I played Zen Pinball. It's a pinball

420
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,320
game that's available on PlayStation 3. Did you check this out yet? Not yet, but I saw one of the

421
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,480
games in action. You know what? They have a Street Fighter 2 table that I actually downloaded as

422
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,160
well. Yeah, it's cool. It's a fun little pinball simulator. The only tricky thing about pinball

423
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,240
is that pinball is not really meant for a wide screen TV because the unfortunate thing about

424
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,640
pinball is that you know how a pinball field looks. It's like a wide screen the other way.

425
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,800
And it's not like you're going to turn your television on its side. So unfortunately,

426
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,360
that makes the display a little difficult in a pinball game. But they do the best job they can.

427
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,200
You have different view modes you can use in this game to look at the table from different angles.

428
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,320
It really reminds me of a lot of the pinball games I played on the PC in the 90s. But obviously,

429
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,080
you know, with the high def graphics and all that. I hear there's multiplayer too,

430
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,560
but I haven't tested that mode out online. So I can't really review that component of it yet.

431
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,560
On the PSP this week, I played Rock Band Unplugged, which basically is frequency or

432
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,720
amplitude, but it's the rock band music. It's pretty much what you would expect,

433
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,520
but I had fun with it. But you know what else I had fun with on the PSP?

434
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,360
The things I'm learning about Sony is, and there's so much functionality in the PSP

435
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,560
that I don't think Sony does a really good job at advertising because I was really surprised.

436
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,240
You know, as I was looking at this, you know, I was like, oh yeah, I think we've talked about

437
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,960
this on this show, but damn, I don't really hear about this a lot. And it's actually a really cool

438
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,000
feature of the PSP. And that is that if you have a PSP, like let's say I was here at Jamie's right

439
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,080
now, I could, if I connected to her internet, I could power on my PlayStation 3 from home,

440
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,280
go into my crossbar, see my crossbar on the PSP as I would see it on the PS3,

441
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,760
go to like a movie that I have downloaded on the PS3 or even a data disc full of movies that's

442
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,160
in my PS3 right now. And I can play them, stream them over the internet to my PSP.

443
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,720
That's awesome. Yet, and you know, and it's kind of one of those things where it's like,

444
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,480
oh yeah, I think I remember hearing about this, but damn, they should be shoving this down my

445
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,720
throat. That's really cool functionality. That's way better than anything the DS and the Wii could

446
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,480
ever do. That makes the, that makes the PS3 PSP combo, in my opinion, that much more awesome is

447
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,120
not just the movies thing or the data, this thing, sorry, you can't do Blu-rays or DVDs,

448
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,400
but, um, you can do some of the games too, like especially the PS1 classics and some of the, um,

449
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,880
I don't want to say arcade games, but the PSN downloadable games, you can also play on the PSP

450
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,360
from anywhere by turning on your PS3 from somewhere else. That's like kind of neat. So

451
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:16,800
that's a remote play, of course, is the feature there that they call that. Anyhow, um, let's see,

452
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
what else did I play this week? I want to say there were more games, but I, I can't think of

453
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,920
anything right now, honestly. So I guess I will just leave it at that so we can continue on with

454
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,080
the show because I know we want to get into some gaming news, but first we have some housekeeping

455
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,000
news. Um, not a whole lot of new stuff. I do want to let you guys know I am going to be out in two

456
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,240
weeks. I'll be here next week, but I'll be out in two weeks. So I don't know if there will be a show

457
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,960
or not, but we'll keep you posted, but I'm going to be in LA so I won't be here. So I'm going on

458
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,200
a personal trip. So we'll see what happens in two weeks, but we will be back next week. As far as

459
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,040
other housekeeping goes, uh, you can always follow us on Twitter, www.twitter.com slash O L R. We'll

460
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,720
be getting into Twitter topics a little later in the show. And of course you can always send us

461
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,640

462
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,160
army or on life journal username orange lounge. All right. How about some gaming news? Loki

463
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,200
start us off tonight with some gaming news. Yes. Lots of gaming news this week. Um, let's see,

464
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,480
let's start off with, um, the rumor and this wasn't exactly a complete rumor, but we knew

465
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,920
it was coming just, I didn't know if it was gonna be coming this soon, but, uh, there are DSI only

466
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,880
games coming this fall apparently. Um, now of course no, you know, official announcements have

467
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,480
been made yet about, you know, actual DSI only games coming in, but apparently a retail source

468
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,800
that spoke with Kotaku said the new, um, DSI exclusive games will be out this fall and they're

469
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,280
actually going to have a little bit of, um, differences to them, distinguishing them from

470
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,480
the other DS games. The cases are going to be white and also they're going to have like a,

471
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,400
you know, only plays on DSI, um, little sticker on them as well to let people know that you can't

472
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,040
buy this for the DS. Now you may be wondering, well, what games are going to be DSI exclusive?

473
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,360
Um, one of them that they have found is a game called Monster Finder. And apparently, um, this

474
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,640
is sort of like, I think it was called, um, sort of similar to Invisimals, which is going to be on

475
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:23,040
the PSP. I think it basically uses the DSI camera to find monsters, kind of like, uh, I guess, a,

476
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,080
um, I don't know, alternative route or I guess an alternative reality game or something like that.

477
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,640
Augmented reality game, that's the word I'm thinking about. Um, basically you find monsters

478
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,560
and then you collect them and put them against each other, like kind of like Monster Rancher,

479
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,480
but with a camera. It's just sort of like the barcode scanner games back, back when. Yes,

480
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,480
yes, very similar to that too. And, um, so this will be the, this is one of the first DSI only

481
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,400
games. If I remember correctly, I think from looking at Ubisoft, I think there are two more

482
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,360
coming from them, their Style Lab series. I can't remember if those are DSI exclusive.

483
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,000
I know they do use the DSI, but I don't remember if they were exclusive or not because they said

484
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,320
they were, but then the sell sheet said not, but I don't know. Um, but there might be more coming.

485
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,640
So interesting that Nintendo is kind of letting the third parties do this first. You know what

486
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,880
I mean? Like, you know, I'm kind of torn on this. This is one of those things where I'm a little

487
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,320
bit disappointed because I really didn't see the point in getting a DSI because the DS honestly

488
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,640
has everything I want. I don't really need the camera or any of that stuff. I don't, yeah,

489
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,560
I don't think you need this game either. I mean, it's just a lot of these games are going to be

490
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,040
DSI only. They're obviously going to be using the gimmicks of it, the camera. That's basically it.

491
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,280
Here's the thing. How long, Loki? And you know this is going to happen. How long, in fact,

492
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,560
let's take bets here on the show. How long until Nintendo puts out the Zelda game that's going to

493
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,360
need barcodes or the Mario game that's going to require the camera for something? I mean,

494
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,960
or the, you know, the WarioWare, one of their first party titles, you know,

495
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,840
WarioWare is a given or something that's going to require these peripherals. And then suddenly

496
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,240
it's going to be at just this landslide where now all the games go DSI only. I mean,

497
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,080
That's almost, I think, how they plan it.

498
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,440
They would like that if they, if they're making money off the systems and yeah,

499
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,200
of course they're going to like that. Doesn't this happen all the time too? I mean,

500
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,200
you can go all the way back to the original Game Boy. Remember how Game Boy Color games

501
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,760
would still play in the Game Boy, but then after a certain amount of time, finally it was, oh,

502
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,240
they're a color exclusive. You can only play these on a Game Boy Color. The problem is though,

503
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
is if they go that route, that's going to piss off a lot of people and they're,

504
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,000
well, I know they may not care, but here's the thing though, their audience, the people that

505
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,240
buy Nintendo products are a lot different than your normal consumer that buys, you know, any

506
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:48,000
other console franchise. Like for example, you know, with the Wii and the DS, the DS owners,

507
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,560
I think that they're pretty content with what they've got on DS or the Wii. And they're not

508
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,040
going to exactly like if the Wii HD comes out, your normal mom and pop is not going to upgrade

509
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,960
to a Wii HD because they could care less because they have Wii Sports and they don't really care

510
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,560
about upgrading to another system. Same with the DSi. Until Wii Sports 3 is Wii HD only.

511
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,800
It doesn't matter. I mean, I think right now, you know, with the DS, I mean, there's so many

512
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,880
people that have the DS if they, unless, I mean, the DSi is not that much different than the DS.

513
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,440
I mean, they were supposed to be put together so they can, you know, compete on the same market

514
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
or whatever, but I don't see why, how they're going to convince people that they need to buy

515
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,920
a DSi because, oh, this game uses a camera now. Good for them. Question from your distribution

516
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,160
perspective, are the regular DS's being phased out? No. Interesting. Not necessarily being phased

517
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,560
out, but there's not really new colors coming out for them. There's new colors for the DSi.

518
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,160
But I mean, if you think about it, I guess, you know, there's four different colors for the DS

519
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,800
right now, and now there's going to be four different colors for the DSi, so... They haven't,

520
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,880
like, stopped production. No, they haven't stopped production. Okay. I mean, sales have certainly

521
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,880
slowed down a bit, but, you know, not necessarily stopped production.

522
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,160
Takeo Ray in chat says, that's why I never got the DSi. My DS Lite is perfectly fine for me.

523
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,320
That's pretty much the same camp I'm in. I rarely play the DS as it is. If you've listened to this

524
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,520
show before, you know kind of my little rant on handhelds, although I will say the PSP is quickly

525
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,320
gaining a lot of favor, in my opinion, not necessarily as a gaming device, but as a

526
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,080
multi-functional media device, is quickly gaining popularity with me. Well, here's the thing. I mean,

527
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm sorry, but if they come out with a new, like, Zelda game or something that requires a camera,

528
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,680
I don't care. I won't buy it, because, you know what? I'm not going to buy another system for

529
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,800
one fucking game. I'm sorry. You know, when your library plays on my system, except for this one

530
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,880
game, boo-fucking-hoo, I'm not buying it. You know, I will make do. I mean, people, that's the problem.

531
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,680
You're expecting these hardcore players, you know, to go, okay, let me buy a new system for this game,

532
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,880
but the audience that buys the DS, they aren't really hardcore gamers. It's just the wrong

533
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,880
expectation for their market. Well, we'll see. I don't know. I'm betting this time next year,

534
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,400
we're looking in the face of a Mario or Zelda game on the DS that's only on the DSi. Mario

535
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,200
goes to Barcode Island or something like that. For the record, I'm probably going to have a DSi.

536
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,800
Why? I mean, I'm not asking that in an accusatory way. I'm asking it as a

537
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,520
why do you want that when you already have a DS? Why not? Because you already have a DS.

538
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,160
I want to play the new stuff that comes out. I knew it was going to happen. Well,

539
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,080
what if it sucks? Well, here's another thing. What if I don't care? Jamie's a little different,

540
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,520
because she's a system collection whore. That's true. She's not your typical gamer.

541
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,480
Honestly, anything new that comes out, I pretty much want it, and we pretty much end up getting

542
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,080
it. She owns some fucking Dreamcast game that came with a dish, for heaven's sake. I mean,

543
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,200
she's just a video game collector. So, yeah, you're not exactly going to want my opinion on

544
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,640
that, because mine's going to be, well, why shouldn't it be in my collection? All right,

545
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,240
fine. Well, let's move on to another story that maybe we will get your opinion on then,

546
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,280
and that's about the iPhone. You know what's interesting is that there's always been that

547
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,320
rumor that's been going around probably as long as we've been podcasting that Apple's going to

548
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,400
get into gaming. Apple's going to get into gaming. They're going to do something. They're going to

549
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,320
get into gaming. It's just a matter of time. Apple kind of just got into gaming when everybody was

550
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:31,760
kind of looking everywhere else. Like, Apple is into gaming now, and they have a lot of users

551
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,240
using their games. Of course, I'm talking about the iPhone. Don't believe me? Well,

552
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,920
guess what they announced this week? Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Yes, the game that was the

553
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,520
DS exclusive last, they were so excited about E3. Remember, they came out and, oh, GTA Chinatown

554
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Wars is coming out. Guess what? It's coming out on the iPhone. And this is right after they

555
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,720
announced that a PSP version was coming out as well. Of course, that is on its way as well.

556
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,800
But it's also coming to the iPhone, and of course, that would mean the iPod Touch as well.

557
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,080
There's not a whole lot of other details at this time, but only just that they're calling it a

558
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,600
perfect match for the iPhone and iPod Touch. I'm kind of iffy on this because I don't think,

559
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
some games just don't run well on the iPhone and iPod Touch. I don't think it's a very

560
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,400
powerful gaming system, but some of the games they have on there aren't bad at all.

561
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,320
PEGL or any PopCap game. You know, certain games that are optimized for the iPhone and iPod Touch

562
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,640
run pretty darn good. I mean, the only thing I see the iPhone and the iPod Touch,

563
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,160
basically the app store that they have, it's just the most successful mobile gaming platform is

564
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,000
basically it. Because, you know, if you try to, I mean, other phones and stuff like that don't

565
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,040
really work well with gaming. Whereas this, you know, they built this phone around the apps that

566
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,560
you can make and these programs, which is good. But, you know, as far as it being like a gaming

567
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,000
platform, yeah, sure, I guess it could be. You know, as far as, you know, they can put lots of

568
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,920
games on it, but you're not going to see the same functionality as some of these games that are on

569
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,280
the DS and, you know, the PSP. But that's mainly because they don't have any sort of like control

570
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,200
pad or anything. They mainly are stuck to the touch screen, so it doesn't work out that well.

571
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,360
I just, I don't know why, just someday I could see them putting out a little thing that snaps

572
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,920
in the bottom of the iPhone that's a little gaming thing with buttons on it and maybe that adds a

573
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,080
little extra oomph to the, I don't know what they could do, like an independent card of some sort.

574
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,640
Maybe, you know, I don't know enough about how hardware works, but I would just see that they

575
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,960
could do something like that that would just add a lot of oomph to the iPhone and iPod touch and

576
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,200
make it, you know, that much more. But don't you think it still is competition for the DS?

577
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,040
Oh yeah, definitely. To an extent the PSP? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's always competition for

578
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,320
them because, you know, their, you know, App Store right now is definitely working a lot better than,

579
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,160
you know, what they have for DSiWare or, you know, the PlayStation Network stuff and obviously,

580
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,440
you know, the PlayStation Go is going to try to kind of copy the App Store and I don't think it's

581
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,680
going to even get close to what, you know, they're doing on the App Store. Well, I think it'll be

582
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,040
great for PSP 3000 owners. It's not really, okay, well here's the, yeah, exactly. It's not even

583
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,760
really necessary, they already have the infrastructure in PlayStation, they don't have

584
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,560
the content on there and that's the problem. It's like same with the DSiWare stuff. They don't have,

585
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,520
like, independent developers can't just throw stuff on there and, you know, have it, you know,

586
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,600
be available. Whereas the App Store, you know, there's just lots of content quickly, you know,

587
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,720
some of it may not be good, some of it is really good, but there's a lot of content on there and

588
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,400
the process to get it up was pretty quick. Yeah, but to be fair, the iPhone also has a lot of crap.

589
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,760
Like, one story that I don't think we are covering tonight, I think, but it was in the thread, we

590
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,160
just ran out of room tonight. Yeah, there was a game on the iPhone that just came out this week

591
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,120
that is, like, a PP simulation game. I think that's what it's called. IPP was the name of the

592
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:02,800
game and you literally are, like, aiming at a urinal. Come on. It's funny, see, that's awesome.

593
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,040
It's stupid. It's just dumb. It is stupid, but you know what? Here's my point, there's a lot of

594
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,760
crap out there on the iPhone and iPod Touch. But one person's trash is another person's treasure,

595
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,000
so you know what? Well, then couldn't the same be said about whatever Sony's planning with their

596
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,440
mini bar and the DSI to an extent? Well, I don't have a problem with Sony's minis. I do have a

597
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,120
problem with the DSIware because it's a lot of calculators and clocks, which, you know, I don't

598
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:33,360
know, it just doesn't really add anything to the DSI. That's the problem. All right. Well, let's

599
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,600
move on with some more gaming news. We'll get to release dates here in just a little bit, but first

600
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:46,080
over to Dark Sakura. Oh, you sound so enthusiastic. But first, over to the one and only fabulous Dark

601
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:54,080
Sakura. Well, you know Splatterhouse was being developed by Bottle Rocket Entertainment? Well,

602
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:01,040
they don't exist anymore. They clung to life as long as they could, but the plug was pulled,

603
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:13,200
so guess what? They got splattered. Their house got splattered. And so that means that... Actually,

604
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,440
I really don't know what that means for Splatterhouse, except that it's not going

605
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,320
to be coming out anytime soon unless someone else picks that up. Just let it die. I mean,

606
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:26,000
it was a neat idea, but just let it die. Might as well come out at this point. They say that they're

607
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,480
actually working on another company that they're going to start from the ground up. I just think

608
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,560
it's sad, though, that although it seems like there's a silver lining here that forever door

609
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,800
closes and other opens, blah, blah, blah, it's just kind of sad. I seriously feel like this is,

610
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,680
again, we had a lot of this at the end of the year last year, but this is the fourth

611
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,320
story I think we've had in the scope of two months about some studio closing down. Well,

612
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,160
it's because they're way behind in schedule. That game was supposed to be out at the end of last

613
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,000
year, and then they pushed it back to near June, and then it still wasn't done. So yeah, time to

614
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,480
close. WhatupG in our chatroom at chat.orangelandstrategy.com asked me a question. Didn't

615
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,400
Namco take Splatterhouse internally? I seem to remember hearing that at one point, too.

616
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,280
Yeah. Well, actually, yeah, there's nothing about what exactly is going to happen with it,

617
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,960
but Namco pulled the development of Splatterhouse back in. That's right,

618
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,480
but there hasn't been anything else said about it. Interesting. All right. Well,

619
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,480
hopefully those guys, as much as we're making silly jokes about Splatterhouse, it does suck

620
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,640
when people lose their jobs, so I hope this whole starting a studio from the ground up works out

621
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:36,480
for them. But, you know, just try to get stuff out there as soon as you can. Get the public

622
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,720
experience. It's a really tricky balance, isn't it? You want to spend enough time on the products,

623
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,200
you have a quality product, but at the same time, if you spend too much time on it,

624
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,200
you go the way of Duke Nukem Forever and the guys behind that.

625
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,080
I am confident that the game will be super epic when it comes out.

626
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
Whatever you say. We'll see.

627
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,760
I'm completely lying.

628
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,080
That's... don't get your expectations too high.

629
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,120
My expectations are incredibly low, okay?

630
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,600
Your problem.

631
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,040
Oh, low, then fine, okay, never mind then.

632
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on, Duke Nukem, that was like in the 90s. I don't remember the 90s.

633
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,920
That was a long time ago. Anyways, so...

634
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,680
Yes, it's when no doubt was popular.

635
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Exactly. Speaking of something from a long time ago,

636
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,040
God of War and God of War 2. Actually, I guess that wasn't that long ago, but

637
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,040
hey, it was a few years. That's ancient.

638
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,520
They are now coming out on a brand new collection coming to the PS3,

639
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,120
the God of War collection as its name, coming this holiday.

640
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,920
They're going to be both displayed at 60 frames per second and at 720p,

641
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:50,000
and it's going to cost somewhere around $40 retail, which is kind of cool.

642
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,800
They're going to be... I don't know.

643
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,840
Remember how we were talking about backwards compatibility,

644
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,040
and how that they probably could do it, but they're not?

645
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,240
Here's why they're not doing it, because now we can sell every game that we've made over again.

646
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,800
I'm okay with it, actually,

647
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,920
because how is this different than what Nintendo's doing Metroid Prime trilogy?

648
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,800
It isn't different, and you know what? I don't...

649
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
I think it's kind of cool, because then I can...

650
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,240
You know, yeah, and why I'm okay with this, Loki, is because

651
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,960
they're going back and they're making the games HD,

652
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
they're giving them trophies.

653
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,240
Sure, they might be old games, but they're giving them new treatment, you know?

654
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,960
And this Katamari Damacy game that a lot of people are excited about is very similar,

655
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,920
if you think about it.

656
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,120
It might not be the two games that were out before, per se,

657
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,280
but they took a piece here and a piece there,

658
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,680
and then added some new effects and a couple new levels,

659
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,400
and that's this new Katamari game we have coming out in a few weeks.

660
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,960
You know, this seems to be kind of a trend.

661
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,880
Well, I guess it was still a trend before.

662
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,560
I mean, go back to the PlayStation 1, you would see Super Nintendo games,

663
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,480
the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger re-release.

664
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,160
You know, it's not like this is anything new,

665
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,880
but what I think makes this kind of special and kind of cool

666
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,800
is that the games are being souped up a little bit to match the times.

667
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,360
Yeah, and...

668
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,920
I missed the God of War boat back on the PlayStation 2.

669
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
This actually really interests me.

670
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,720
Well, God of War 2 actually did output at 720p,

671
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,360
because there were a handful of games that were on the PlayStation 2 and on the Xbox

672
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,160
that would both either output at 720p or they would do 1080i,

673
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,280
which was kind of cool,

674
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,080
but God of War 2 was one of the ones that actually did the 720p,

675
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,440
so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.

676
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,720
That's right, I remember that now.

677
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,320
Wasn't there like a secret code or something you had to put in to do that?

678
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,200
Yeah, something like that.

679
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,840
That's so weird.

680
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:39,040
But hey, definitely a good way to get ramped up for the new game coming out, obviously, in March.

681
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,520
Reading some comments from chat.orangelandradio.com,

682
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,320
Deakman says,

683
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,360
I'm okay with it because it's only $40, 720p, 60 frames a second, and trophies.

684
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,000
Sign me up.

685
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,200
And true, that is the price.

686
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,040
If you're gonna buy them both new right now on the PlayStation 2,

687
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,480
that is the price that it would be.

688
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,360
It's $40, so...

689
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,840
So I think I'm gonna wait a little bit for this.

690
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,160
We'll see.

691
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,320
Because again, I never played God of War 1 and 2.

692
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,160
Well, I played it like at a friend's house for a little bit,

693
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,120
but I never played through one.

694
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,000
Never played through two.

695
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,680
Tigerclaw makes a comment about Metroid Prime.

696
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,440
Metroid Prime 3 in Metroid Prime Trilogy was censored a tad.

697
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,520
One of the cutscenes had a character say,

698
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,000
damn, it was redubbed with a no.

699
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,880
That's kind of a weird change, especially if it was different before.

700
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,920
You want to hear something funny and this is off the topic of Metroid,

701
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,160
but I was reading on some of the stuff that they're going to do for Brutal Legend.

702
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:34,640
They have an option where you can actually take out a lot of the cussing in the game.

703
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,680
So there's one scene, it's like, you know, so listen,

704
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,360
I told you not to climb up there.

705
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,160
What the eff?

706
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,920
And then it pauses and says, okay, do you want him to say fuck?

707
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,880
Or do you want him to like, you know, not use any, you know...

708
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,280
Fudge!

709
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:48,640
Exactly.

710
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,280
What the fudge?

711
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,600
And then it just, you know, sensors the rest of the game like that.

712
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,480
And I think that's kind of funny, the way that they give that option to you.

713
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,760
That's an interesting way to do it.

714
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,080
Jayrod in chat gives his quick reviews.

715
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,920
Like, these are like Twitter reviews of these games.

716
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,160
It's very short, but maybe help you out, Loki.

717
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,840
God of War 1, I think, has a better story, but God of War 2 was overall better.

718
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,200
Yeah, I really wish I had played God of War 2, but the thing with God of War 1 is I got

719
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,640
so frustrated at the end of the game because the last boss was really hard.

720
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,720
Oh, and the last boss glitched out, so it didn't quite work right.

721
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,280
So I beat the crap out of him just over and over and over again,

722
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,040
even though I know what I was supposed to do in the game.

723
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,000
But it still wouldn't work because the game glitched out.

724
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,680
So I just got pissed off with it.

725
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,520
All right.

726
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,600
Well, let's go back over to the Nintendo Wii for a minute.

727
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,600
Of course, we were talking about Metroid Prime trilogy.

728
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,800
One other thing you might be...

729
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,000
Which actually, by the way, the Metroid Prime games are pretty awesome.

730
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,360
So, you know, I'm even thinking...

731
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,160
I have Metroid Prime 3, but I'm thinking about getting the trilogy

732
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,000
because I never had Metroid Prime 1 or 2.

733
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,880
I know it's kind of weird.

734
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,760
My roommate had them.

735
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,920
So around that time, the roommate had...

736
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,560
You know how you can't get, obviously, the Metroid or Metroid game downloaded

737
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,440
to your Game Boy Advance with the Metroid Prime trilogy,

738
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,120
but you can get the costume that was in that game as well

739
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,240
to kind of download to the Fusion costume or whatever in the game.

740
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,600
That unlocks.

741
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,160
Interesting.

742
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,480
Yeah.

743
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,760
I'm curious what other kind of synergy between the three games there is, if any.

744
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,480
I don't know.

745
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,040
I don't know.

746
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,160
Well, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, you know how they had a web browser.

747
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,160
They had their Nintendo internet channel that you could download for a $5 fee.

748
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,640
Guess what?

749
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,400
Earlier this week in Japan and Europe, that fee went away.

750
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,920
And then just a couple days later, it also went away in North America.

751
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,240
The internet channel is now free to download.

752
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,800
So if you have a Wii but you never got the internet channel,

753
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,920
you can go ahead and download it.

754
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,560
It's free.

755
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,440
It used to cost 500 Wii points to download.

756
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,120
Actually, I should take a step back.

757
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,960
When it first came out, you might remember,

758
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,640
if you were an early Wii owner like myself and I think the others in the studio here,

759
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,280
we were able to get the internet channel really early on

760
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,680
because they had it free for about three months or so.

761
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,440
And then it went to being 500 Wii points when they released the full version.

762
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,160
Well, now they've decided to remove the cost again.

763
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,720
And they also did some little upgrades to the browser.

764
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,200
It's now, instead of Flash 7, it's Flash Lite 3.1,

765
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,440
which I know doesn't sound like an upgrade, but it is.

766
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,840
It's going to let more Flash apps actually be able to play.

767
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,520
And if you were one of the people that paid 500 Wii points for this,

768
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,560
sadly, Nintendo isn't going to give you the 500 points back.

769
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,600
But what they are going to do is they're going to give you a 500 point credit

770
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,520
towards a virtual console game.

771
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,680
So at least you get a little something.

772
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,440
Although, I don't know.

773
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,080
If I was one of the people that paid 500 points for it, I might be a little sad.

774
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,800
But then again, it's only five bucks.

775
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,680
I don't know.

776
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,040
Five bucks is still a lot, I guess.

777
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,160
So I don't know.

778
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,440
But then again, I'm also kind of like, you know, as much as I think that's cool,

779
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,640
they're making it free again.

780
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,400
Unless this new remastered internet channel somehow made it a lot faster

781
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,160
to browse the internet on the Wii,

782
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,520
I don't think it's going to be that great.

783
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,040
Like browsing the internet on the Wii is kind of slow.

784
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,840
Yeah.

785
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,240
You know, I don't know.

786
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,880
And what did you do when you were only dial-up?

787
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,400
Hmm.

788
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,640
I lived in an age where I only expected things to come in at a dial-up rate.

789
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,560
The games I was downloading were much smaller and would fit on a three and a half inch disc.

790
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,120
Remember that?

791
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,560
I had a download-

792
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,880
I remember having Descent spread across 14 of them.

793
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,360
Yeah.

794
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,520
Remember when an epic game, you knew it was epic like King's Quest 6

795
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
because it had seven discs that it came on?

796
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah.

797
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,360
Or Phantasmagoria, which was on seven CDs.

798
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,800
I used to download overnight and I used to have a download accelerator

799
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,280
to basically queue up a bunch of stuff to download.

800
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
That was my thing.

801
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,680
Yeah.

802
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,000
Nice.

803
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,040
And some folks in chat want to clarify,

804
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,120
X-Link says the credit was only for Japan.

805
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,560
Actually, no, it did open up.

806
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,920
Go check out Nintendo.com.

807
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,280
It is now, there is just a NES virtual console download credit that you can get now

808
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,200
and it's not 500 points clarifies.

809
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,920
Deep Bandit is a free NES game. That's right. It's basically a credit towards a free

810
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,880
NES virtual console game, which of course is 500 points,

811
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,560
but you can't like take the 500 points and apply it towards a Sega game or something else.

812
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,000
Has to be an NES game.

813
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,600
So there you go.

814
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,560
All right.

815
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,480
Let's move on with some more news.

816
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,280
It would help if my brain worked.

817
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,040
Yes, it would.

818
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,480
It's kind of required to do a show.

819
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:23,040
Well, actually, you know, the new Halo, the Halo 3 ODST is supposed to be coming out

820
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,600
and it has a launch date of September 22nd from, of course, Xbox 360.

821
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,240
But there are people out there who are playing illegitimate copies,

822
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,400
meaning they either have a burn of some kind or received a copy that they weren't supposed to receive.

823
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:47,040
And so the big Microsoft enforcer dude went on Twitter and said, and I quote,

824
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,560
I spy with my little eye, some illegitimate ODST players.

825
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,880
No early play for you commencing perma-bands.

826
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,160
And except for those who actually have legit copies, like early, you know,

827
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,600
actual true early copies for reviewers and that type of thing, they're okay.

828
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,440
Or if you have an actual legit copy of the game that you happen to get early,

829
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,040
then that's okay too, apparently.

830
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
I don't understand why people are playing the one that's out there now,

831
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,840
because the leaked one that's out there is actually in French.

832
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,840
I'm kind of curious.

833
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,360
Some people know French.

834
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,080
Yeah, that's true.

835
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,680
I'm kind of curious.

836
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,720
I mean, we import Japanese games, even though we can't read Japanese.

837
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,280
Come on.

838
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,520
I'm kind of curious, though.

839
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,440
How are they able to spot the difference?

840
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,800
Well, I mean, I'm not sure.

841
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,520
I'm kind of curious, though, how are they able to spot the difference?

842
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,760
Or is that some type of secret they're not saying?

843
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
There's no word on it.

844
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,160
They're claiming that's a secret.

845
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,200
I don't think they know.

846
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,120
I think they're just going after whomever.

847
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,280
But what if they get it wrong?

848
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,000
I think you're wrong.

849
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,600
I mean, there's got to be a way that they know.

850
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,120
There's a way they can tell the difference.

851
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,760
That's what they're doing.

852
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,880
They're basically...

853
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,080
Or is this a scare tactic?

854
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,360
I think it's a scare tactic.

855
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:58,400
And the other thing I think is, you know, if you want to think, you know,

856
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,280
the real conspiracy theory to it is that people are thinking that this is actually a copy

857
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,320
that they leaked out that's modified in a way that they can flag people that have played

858
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,280
it or something like that, which would be entrapment, but I don't see how they were

859
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:11,680
doing that.

860
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,480
I'm guessing that it's because you're going to see a bunch of people from, you know, all

861
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,880
playing this French-English version of it, like in the United States or something like

862
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,200
that, and people are going to be like, huh, I'm pretty sure that they didn't buy that

863
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,600
from, you know, wherever it was released at.

864
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,480
It's probably going to be a hacked, you know, console that's playing it.

865
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,000
Whereas, you know, if they actually are playing, you know, the U.S. version or something in

866
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,240
U.S., then that might be different.

867
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,640
They're just going to look at regions is basically what it is.

868
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,320
Because no one's going to import...

869
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,680
First off, the game's not even readily available there yet, I don't think.

870
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,880
And also, no one's really going to import a game.

871
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,800
It's going to be very rare if that happens.

872
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,280
I like Act F's comments in chat right now at chat.orangetheonsready.com.

873
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,160
Je n'est-ce si d'une weapon, je suis MasterChef.

874
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,680
MasterChef...

875
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,720
Oh, he put Chef, but it's supposed to be Chief.

876
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,600
That's why I read Chef.

877
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,920
Although I would like a game called MasterChef to come out next to Cooking Mama.

878
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,400
Anyhow, Dekeman in chat says it's the same way they tell if people are playing burn games

879
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,880
online.

880
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,360
They can't.

881
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:20,000
A lot of the new stuff that's out there now makes it very difficult for them to do that.

882
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,040
They're really stealth.

883
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,960
I would know, I played modified Grand Theft Auto IV's for like, what, how many months

884
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,680
now?

885
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,800
Yeah, it's still risky.

886
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,720
You know, it's risky to get into.

887
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,240
All right.

888
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,560
Let's go around the globe and explore some upcoming release dates from around the globe.

889
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,800
All right.

890
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,320
Well, in the US, there's actually quite a bit coming out this week.

891
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,560
It's kind of kicking off, not really the fourth quarter because it's a little early for that,

892
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,040
but you know, the major gaming season.

893
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,560
So starting off, we have Raiden IV.

894
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,600
The wonderful shooter game is coming to Xbox 360 this week.

895
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:06,000
Also, Mini Ninjas is going to be coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and DS.

896
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,160
Kind of a little family action game.

897
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,800
Darkness of Days is coming out on PC and Xbox 360.

898
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,080
It's a game where you can go back to the Civil War with a machine gun and blow everybody

899
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,400
away.

900
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,280
Cool.

901
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,440
That's what I was talking about earlier, right?

902
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,560
It's going to be awesome.

903
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,120
Seriously.

904
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Trine coming to PC this week.

905
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,840
This guy had two Dark Hero Days on PSP.

906
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,000
War Leader Clash of Nations on PC.

907
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,240
Also, Fallen Earth, Welcome to the Apocalypse on PC.

908
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,920
Go play City Sports on the Wii.

909
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,720
He had another sports game collection.

910
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,920
All this one has rooftop hockey, so I kind of have to think of a little bit of Clerks

911
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,320
there.

912
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,360
That was kind of funny.

913
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:57,280
Cubed, the Q games collection coming to Xbox 360 with your resin, every extend extra extreme.

914
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,400
Time of Shadows on PC.

915
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,360
Dirt 2 coming to PlayStation 3, DS, Xbox 360, and Wii.

916
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,960
And I thought PSP as well.

917
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,480
Imagine Detectives on DS.

918
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:25,120
Aisle 2, Sturmovik, Birds of Prey coming to Xbox 360, PS3, DS, and PSP.

919
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:33,520
Capcom Platinum Hits Triple Back, that wonderful collection of three games including Dead Rising,

920
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,760
Lost Planet, and Devil May Cry 4 coming to the 360 this week.

921
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:44,640
Ant Nation on the DS, kind of, I guess, your kids' first real-time strategy game.

922
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,440
Little Big Planet, Game of the Year edition coming out on PlayStation 3.

923
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,240
And of course the big one, the Beatles Rock Band coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

924
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,920
the Wii, as well as the standalone instruments and your two different bundles that are available

925
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,400
for that.

926
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,240
Finally, if you have little kids that want to learn to read, they have three different

927
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,680
games for you for the DS, my virtual tutor reading K through first, pre-K through K,

928
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,600
and first through second.

929
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:20,000
Also coming out, actually about a week from today, two new DSi colors, both white and

930
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,440
then pink, and then also a week from today, you're getting two more DS games.

931
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,160
Princess in Love and My Boyfriend, both kind of like dating sim games.

932
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:37,040
And then finally, you're going to be getting Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, which

933
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,000
is actually coming out a week from Monday.

934
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,840
And that's it.

935
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,000
Busy week, especially with Beatles Rock Band, of course, being the anchor for the week.

936
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,640
Yeah.

937
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,080
Hey, going to Japan and looking at the release dates over there.

938
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,080
There is a new Xbox 360 Elite, one of those new bundles coming out over in Japan.

939
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,200
I think that's a little bit of a price reduction for them, if I'm not mistaken.

940
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,520
The last remnant, speaking of price reductions, is getting one this week on the 360, as is

941
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,080
Fable 2, both of those games moving into the Platinum Collection, as well as Call of Duty

942
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,480
4 Modern Warfare and Bioshock.

943
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,920
So I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft's doing a little push in Japan right now with

944
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,360
all these recent price drops.

945
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,000
That's all happening on the 10th of this month.

946
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,480
Also happening on the 10th of this month, Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, the Japanese

947
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,720
localized version, is out on the PlayStation 3, so check that out.

948
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,120
As well as, of course, a price drop as well for Call of Duty 4 over there as well.

949
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,400
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

950
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,880
Forever Blue 2 next week, but not this week.

951
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,760
Also another House of the Dead game, but we'll cover that next week.

952
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,480
PlayStation 2, nothing this week either.

953
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
It's all on the 17th of September.

954
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,640
There's not much coming out on PlayStation 2 right now.

955
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,440
There's really not.

956
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,760
I think you're going to kind of see that phasing out slowly but surely.

957
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,640
Nintendo DS does have a new game called Arabians Lost that's coming out from Prototype over

958
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,840
in Japan this week.

959
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:59,920
That game looks to be, they are calling this an adventure game.

960
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,280
I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots from this to see what type of game it is.

961
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,280
Looks like it's just kind of a standard role playing-ish type of game, but it doesn't look

962
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,320
like it has battles.

963
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,640
But the subtitle of this game is called The Engagement on Desert.

964
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,200
I'm guessing it's just kind of like an interactive manga type of game with hit points and stuff.

965
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,400
That's what that is.

966
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,360
Let's see if there's anything on the PSP to mention this week.

967
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,840
Yes, there's a portable Navi 3, which I think is just one of those Navigator programs that

968
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,440
they have available on PSP.

969
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,000
If you want to change your PSP into a GPS, which really will probably only help you if

970
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,360
you live in Japan.

971
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,000
But there you go.

972
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,240
That's what you got for Japanese releases this week.

973
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,160
Well, for the UK, we have some, I mean, pretty much the standard stuff.

974
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,000
On the 9th is Beatles Rock Band.

975
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,360
On the 11th, we have Championship Manager 2010, Colin McRae Dirt 2, yay, Guitar Hero

976
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:56,720
5, Mini Ninjas, NHL 2K10, and Section 8.

977
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,880
Also, Rob, there's something on the 15th that you might be interested in, Zuma's Revenge.

978
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,560
Ah, I've heard about this.

979
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,160
I think this has a similar release date here in the US if it's not out already.

980
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, it's kind of like a sequel to Zuma.

981
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,080
Not my favorite PopCap game.

982
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,760
My problem with Zuma is it's not something you can sit down and play quickly, like a

983
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,960
game of Bejeweled or something.

984
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,280
Zuma takes a long time to get through a game because not only does it take a long time

985
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,640
to beat each level, but then you have three lives.

986
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,120
So I'm not as big on Zuma, but there are other PopCap games I really enjoy.

987
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,400
And I know, I still got a copy of Bookworm Adventures 2 I need to play.

988
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,400
No, don't laugh.

989
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
It's an awesome game.

990
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,400
I know, I know.

991
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,400
I'm laughing because I've played it.

992
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
It's fun.

993
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,400
It's a lot of fun.

994
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,680
It's Final Fantasy meets Boggle.

995
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,080
It's amazing.

996
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,440
So I do want to check out the sequel.

997
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,040
By the way, Rob, I have to say, I like your shirt and all of its Helvetica-ness.

998
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,040
Thank you.

999
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,720
And for those, maybe Jamie will take a picture of it, but for those at home, because we are

1000
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,040
a radio show and not a TV show, I'm wearing a shirt and I guess Jamie is going to put

1001
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,920
a picture on our website right now in the picture gallery at www.orangetonsradio.com,

1002
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,160
but it says Ms. Scarlet in the hall with a revolver, and it has a little picture of a

1003
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,160
gun.

1004
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,160
And as said in Helvetica.

1005
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,160
Yes.

1006
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,560
You and your font wholeness.

1007
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,160
No, it's Helvetica, I swear.

1008
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,680
Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

1009
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
All right.

1010
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,440
So let's move on, a couple more stories for you before we get to the classic game of the

1011
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,440
week.

1012
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Yes.

1013
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,920
This week, we had the debut of the new trailer for the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto

1014
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,440
4, The Ballad of Gay Tony.

1015
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,920
And with that, there is actually, it looks like that's going to be returning back to

1016
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,440
kind of the over-the-top Grand Theft Auto fun that you can expect from the rest of the

1017
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,880
series.

1018
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,920
Some new stuff to note in there, there are some new weapons that they did kind of show

1019
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,240
off in the trailer, a new machine gun that they had in there, I'm not really sure what

1020
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,240
that was.

1021
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,520
I did spot a P90 though, because I have that, it's one of my first Airsoft guns.

1022
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,800
So there is a P90 in the game.

1023
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,400
Some new helicopters, apparently it's going to focus a lot on aerial combat, they did

1024
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,320
show off a new helicopter that fired rockets, as well as another one that was a kind of

1025
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:13,120
a cargo helicopter picking up a subway car, which is kind of cool.

1026
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,920
They had a golf cart in there as well, and some new sports cars.

1027
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,400
So that's going to be kind of fun.

1028
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,080
Did you notice what the song in the trailer was?

1029
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,480
Yes I did.

1030
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,480
I thought that was quite...

1031
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,080
Those that listen to the Orange Laundry after birth that we only do live for a little bit

1032
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,940
after we tape live will understand why that's funny.

1033
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:37,940
And then also, they had, apparently there was some other stuff rumored that there's

1034
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:44,080
a FIB tank in the game, like their SWAT tank or something.

1035
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,600
And I don't know, it's going to be awesome.

1036
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,760
I'm looking forward to this because they ruined my modded game.

1037
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,640
So right now, I'm seriously, it's like we're coming out of depression or something.

1038
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,520
Going back to playing the normal game is just wrong.

1039
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,760
There are some pretty cool stuff coming for that.

1040
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Also out of the trailer though, of course they had a lot of different cut scenes in

1041
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,860
there and they recognized some of the characters.

1042
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:17,400
One of them I was kind of interested by is Gracie, which was actually one of the missions

1043
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,400
in Grand Theft Auto IV.

1044
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
You have to kidnap her, which is kind of funny.

1045
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,560
But she's in there as well.

1046
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,240
And overall looks awesome.

1047
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:29,200
Okay, because I'm not as big of a Grand Theft Auto IV player as you are, who is Gay Tony?

1048
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
He's like a mob boss?

1049
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,560
Yeah, he's a mob boss.

1050
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,400
He's Tony Prince is the guy.

1051
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:42,720
He basically owns nightclubs and he's a member of the Ancelotti Crime Syndicate.

1052
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:50,780
And basically, he owns the biggest gay and straight nightclubs in Algonquin.

1053
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,960
So that's who you play.

1054
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,160
You don't play him, but you play a guy that kind of helps him out, Luis Fernando Lopez.

1055
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,400
Which is like this Dominican guy that you play as.

1056
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,320
He's his bodyguard.

1057
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:11,200
And the games, all three episodes, including the main game, all kind of culminate around

1058
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,000
this diamond deal that goes down and goes wrong.

1059
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And that's the Impossible Trinity is each one of their roles in this diamond deal.

1060
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And if I remember correctly, I think Luis comes in and actually breaks up the diamond

1061
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,040
deal and tries to steal the diamonds.

1062
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,440
So that's definitely going to be part of the game.

1063
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,080
I got a weird question for you, but as the gay guy on the program and who isn't as familiar

1064
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,660
with Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm kind of curious, not to get all glad on you, but I'm curious,

1065
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:44,400
is this a step forward for gay rights or is this going to be a bunch of stereotypes?

1066
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,880
Does gay Tony go around going, that's super!

1067
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,320
No, he didn't really do that.

1068
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,880
There was a character, though, in Grand Theft Auto IV that was like that.

1069
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,720
I don't remember his name, but yeah, he was very flamboyant.

1070
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,480
But he didn't seem flamboyant in the trailer, of course he wasn't talking much, but I don't

1071
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,480
think he is.

1072
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,600
Because, you know, I'm totally cool with it if it's like, you know, hey, you have a gay

1073
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,540
character who's like a cool mob boss and all this stuff just like anybody else.

1074
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:14,300
But if it's just going to be stereotype after stereotype, then I'm just going to have face

1075
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,300
palm.

1076
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,840
Well, I don't think it's going to be.

1077
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,400
I mean, they're usually pretty, you know...

1078
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah, I know, Rockstar's pretty good about that stuff usually, so I'm hopeful, but you

1079
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
know.

1080
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,480
I don't want that anymore Full Frontal Penis again, because that was enough in the last

1081
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
game.

1082
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
We don't need Full Frontal Penis in this game.

1083
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,720
But you wouldn't have any problem with full boobage and everything.

1084
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, because they haven't done that in this game, and I'm surprised, it being an emirated

1085
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,960
game and stuff, you know, for nudity and that kind of stuff.

1086
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,960
There's no...

1087
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,160
It's establishment of a double standard, you don't want to see cock, but you don't mind

1088
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,160
seeing boobs.

1089
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,160
No, I don't want to see more cock.

1090
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,720
There already is cock in the game.

1091
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:53,560
Now I want to see boobs that go along with the cock so we have an equal representation.

1092
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,560
Equal representation.

1093
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,120
Equal opportunity nudity.

1094
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,000
I actually support his statement.

1095
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm just saying...

1096
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,740
I can go for equal opportunity nudity.

1097
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,920
I don't have a problem with it, I'm just saying that they need to like, you know, I think

1098
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,760
the stripper should be nude in the games, you know, that's only...

1099
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,760
It's a strip club.

1100
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,880
They're supposed to be stripping.

1101
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,720
Well, if they sell alcohol, then they can't get naked, can they?

1102
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,760
Well, that's the only thing only in California, I don't know, but whatever.

1103
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,760
It's a game.

1104
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,760
What the hell do I care?

1105
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,480
It's just characters.

1106
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,600
I just want... but it's just funny how there's a lot of people out there that says, oh, because

1107
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,840
it's gay Tony, I hope we don't have to see more cock.

1108
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,440
You know, I hope just for that, you get beaver shot in this, just for that kind of ignorant

1109
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,440
comment.

1110
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,440
It's going to be cool.

1111
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,760
This game's going to be awesome, and I'm just hoping though that they bring back the tank,

1112
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,240
because the tanks are awesome, the minigun, the flamethrower, and the chainsaw.

1113
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,240
That's it.

1114
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,840
But already I like where they're going with it, so I can't wait to play it.

1115
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,000
One more story for you guys, and then we're going to go to the classic game of the week,

1116
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,960
and this story has to actually do with the 360, where this download content is.

1117
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,160
By the way, random-ass question.

1118
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,800
When they announce the Grand Theft Auto IV exclusive content, it is never coming to the

1119
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,200
PlayStation 3.

1120
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,200
Is that correct?

1121
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,680
As far as we're aware.

1122
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,400
But maybe someday they might say, okay, window's over, we're going to release this disc now

1123
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
on PlayStation 3.

1124
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,400
Let me put it this way.

1125
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,760
It could be ported in a heartbeat.

1126
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
Yeah, I can see that.

1127
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,080
I'm just kind of curious.

1128
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,720
I mean, since all the formats are basically the same, it's just recoding the textures

1129
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,720
and that's it.

1130
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,720
All right.

1131
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,320
Well, going back to the 360 a little bit, something changed in their technical certification

1132
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:34,420
requirements this week that is a little bit interesting, and the word comes from develop.

1133
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,400
It was the technical director David Jeffries, who works for BlackRock Studio.

1134
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:45,040
He actually mentioned that Microsoft actually removed the fact that 360s must run at a minimum

1135
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,760
of 1280 by 720, which you know as 720p.

1136
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:55,000
If the system is in HD mode, and apparently anti-aliasing is also out, full screen anti-aliasing

1137
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,120
you do not have to do.

1138
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,240
Those requirements are now out.

1139
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:07,460
Now Microsoft kind of was lenient on these rules before, and one very, very notable game

1140
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,640
that got around these rules is Halo 3, because you might remember, and I remember some stories

1141
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,080
on this when Halo 3 first came out, it's not running in true 720p.

1142
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,280
It's running at 1152 by 640, so it's 100 pixels short on either side.

1143
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,680
Apparently Call of Duty 4 is also 600p also.

1144
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,680
Interesting.

1145
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:33,720
I don't think this is a huge deal, because I'm all about frame rate a little more than

1146
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,720
resolution.

1147
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,960
Granted, a great game should have both great resolution and good frame rate, something

1148
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,640
like Oblivion or whatever, but some of the games that get really busy online they have

1149
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,080
to scale back the resolution a little bit.

1150
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,560
Why now though, I'm kind of wondering, that they decided to get rid of this?

1151
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,600
Is this because maybe 360 has enough penetration in the marketplace now, so they don't need

1152
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:03,560
to be advertising all this HD HD HD?

1153
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:09,960
Maybe there's a big game coming out that didn't have this or something, and they figured that

1154
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,880
hey, let's make this available so that it's fair for everybody.

1155
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,920
I don't know, maybe it makes it easier to develop on the system.

1156
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,800
Alpha Kinanagram has an interesting thought.

1157
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,840
Maybe it's for the indie games.

1158
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,080
I don't know if the indie games were ever held to the same standard.

1159
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
I don't think so.

1160
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
I don't think so either.

1161
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,080
There's no way.

1162
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
It's a good thought though.

1163
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,880
Yeah, because I don't think a lot of the indie games I've played have full screen anti-aliasing.

1164
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:35,920
I'm trying to think if that actually, hmm, anyway.

1165
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,400
Well there it is, the technical certifications are changing so we'll see what games come

1166
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,360
of that a little later on, but for now, let's go to a classic video game in a little segment.

1167
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,440
We'd like to call it the classic video game of the week.

1168
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:53,880
This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer likes to browse the gaming vault and find

1169
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,240
a game that she says, you know what?

1170
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,660
You kids should be playing this game this week, or at least check it out and show this

1171
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,660
game a little respect.

1172
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,440
Dark Soccer, what game did you pick for the kids this week?

1173
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:08,840
I think Chew Chew Rocket, but we have to hear the very beginning of the clip though because

1174
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,880
it's important.

1175
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,200
Fair enough, it's loading right now.

1176
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,760
That was what was important.

1177
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Why?

1178
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
Because it's Sonic Team.

1179
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,480
Alright, tell us a little bit about Chew Chew Rocket.

1180
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,120
Just out of curiosity, does this have to do with the fact that 99 of 09 is this week?

1181
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:32,680
No, actually, it has to do with Dan Fussing because I don't put in games he suggests,

1182
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,720
or I already have put in games that he suggested.

1183
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,720
So Catmania.

1184
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,760
So yeah, I put in Chew Chew Rocket.

1185
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:48,600
So this was one of the first of the online games that came on the Dreamcast, and then

1186
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:54,240
they just started giving it away with the Dreamcast as an online demo, and it was also

1187
01:18:54,240 --> 01:19:00,380
given away free in Europe when you would order a copy, well you could order your copy by

1188
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:06,240
connecting to the Dream Arena service, but the whole point of the game is to get mice,

1189
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:12,840
as in Chew Chew, because in Japanese that's the sound a mouse makes, it's Chew.

1190
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:19,080
You get them onto a rocket while avoiding the cats, or the kapu kapu, that roam around

1191
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,960
the board.

1192
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,360
You have to place down arrows to determine the path the mice are going to take, because

1193
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:30,240
they just keep going in a straight line until they run into a wall, so you have to point

1194
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,500
them in the direction that they're supposed to go.

1195
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:39,960
And you can do it up to four player multiplayer, and you can put the arrows everywhere, so

1196
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,840
you can direct other people's mice away, you can direct yours forward, and like you were

1197
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:51,480
saying with the Catmania, there's different obstacles, like Catmania means you have all

1198
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,080
cats running around and you have to get them away from your ship, because if a cat hits

1199
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:00,040
your ship, then it damages your ship.

1200
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,160
And you can get special colored mice, like a gold mouse will give you 50 extra mice,

1201
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:11,840
a pink mouse gives you those events like we were talking about, the Catmania, the Mousemania.

1202
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:19,080
But the single player mode is actually I think my favorite, because it's really, it's really,

1203
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,320
it gets super complex, it really turns into a matter of figuring out how you're going

1204
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,720
to get from point A to point B when you've got all these obstacles in your path and all

1205
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,040
you have is a limited number of arrows.

1206
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,520
This game is fucking fast paced too, I mean that was my biggest problem with it, it was

1207
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,160
too fast for me to keep up with.

1208
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,960
They need to like, chew chew slow.

1209
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:46,000
Well you also got a challenge mode where you have to get all the mice into rockets or get

1210
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,320
a cat to eat all the mice, or put the cat into a guarded rocket or other stuff and you

1211
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:58,800
had a time limit on it and it had 25 levels, you could do that actually one or two player

1212
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
or two.

1213
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:07,080
There's a Game Boy Advance version that's really the same as the Dreamcast version but

1214
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,120
you can actually play with one cartridge multiplayer.

1215
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,320
So multiple people, well you also had a level editor in it too.

1216
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:22,680
And actually the Game Boy Advance version wasn't made by Sega.

1217
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,800
Also in Sonic Battle, Tails has a choo-choo for his landmine.

1218
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:37,400
So yeah, it's a pretty fun little game, and it's just fun, play it.

1219
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,400
Alright.

1220
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,400
Get Dreamcast!

1221
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:46,440
The choo-choo rocket, which Jamie swears has nothing to do with the 9-9-0-0-9 or 99 whatever

1222
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,440
you want to call it.

1223
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,440
The anniversary of the Dreamcast this week.

1224
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,440
It's the classic game of the week.

1225
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,440
Choo.

1226
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,440
Choo.

1227
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,440
Alright.

1228
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,960
We're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1229
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,160
We always like to take a break in the middle of the show to just kind of stretch, you know,

1230
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,160
refill our drinks or go to the restroom or what have you.

1231
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,000
So we suggest you take an opportunity to do the same because there is plenty more to come

1232
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,240
in Part B of our show tonight, including Twitter topics, rapid fire news tonight, and more

1233
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,240
long discussion.

1234
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,120
We're going to talk about Blur, which is a racing game I am really looking forward to.

1235
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,080
It's Damon Allburn.

1236
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,080
Not that.

1237
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,080
Blur.

1238
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,080
Blur the racing game, silly.

1239
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,440
We're going to talk about a brand new reality show coming to Sony, PlayStation Network,

1240
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,200
it sounds kind of interesting would be the word for it, and 3D, possibly on the PlayStation

1241
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,200
3.

1242
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,560
Some interesting developments with that this week.

1243
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,320
So we're going to do all that right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1244
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,720
Stay tuned.

1245
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:45,560
Welcome back everybody to Part B of our podcast.

1246
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,200
We're taping live on this Sunday evening, September 6, 2009.

1247
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,360
Happy Labor Day to all of our American listeners who will get tomorrow off of work or, you

1248
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:59,640
know, if it's not America that you're from, then just have a happy Monday or happy week

1249
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,640
wherever you're at.

1250
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:05,680
We're going to get into some more gaming news as we tape live on this Sunday evening at

1251
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,360
www.allgames.com.

1252
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,280
And we have Bobby Blackwolf joining us earlier in the show live from Seattle where he had

1253
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,260
just wrapped up Penny Arcade Expo, which just came to a close earlier.

1254
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:20,600
Any word on what the final game was and their little PAX, what do they call that?

1255
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,600
The little PAX?

1256
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
Omega-thon.

1257
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
Omega-thon.

1258
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Thank you.

1259
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Any word on what the final game was yet?

1260
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,720
Does that hit the internet?

1261
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,640
I don't think I've seen it on the internet, but I will look.

1262
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,000
All right, yeah, check that out because I'm curious.

1263
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I'm sure somebody in chat.

1264
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,600
The lovely thing about having a chat room during the show is that they are there to

1265
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,420
yell things out when...

1266
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,560
And the final Omega-thon was skee-ball.

1267
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,920
Skee-ball.

1268
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,920
That's rad.

1269
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,920
They actually wheeled out a machine and...

1270
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,920
Yes, they did.

1271
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,320
Oh, that's awesome.

1272
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,640
Props.

1273
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,840
Mega-props to you guys.

1274
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:49,840
Oh, my God.

1275
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,860
No pressure or anything, but can you imagine the amount of pressure that it all comes down

1276
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,360
to skee-ball?

1277
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,960
That reminds me, though, there was a pricing game on The Price is Right, you know, because

1278
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,960
your shirt reminds me of this, too.

1279
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,560
Loki's wearing a Price is Right shirt today, everybody.

1280
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,720
You should see it.

1281
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,400
There was a skee-ball game that, like, if you could hit the target on the skee-ball,

1282
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
you'd win, like, a new car.

1283
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,160
Like, there's almost as much pressure.

1284
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,000
Well, it's like, okay, so the rounds as it went...

1285
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,860
The first round was Mario Kart Wii.

1286
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,600
The second round was Bookworm Adventures.

1287
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,760
Round three was Halo 3 ODST.

1288
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,760
Round four was the Beatles Rock Band.

1289
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,480
Round five was Connect Four, and then, of course, the final round being skee-ball.

1290
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,600
Very interesting, because you have, like, some new games mixed with some board games.

1291
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,840
Very good mix at the Omega-thon this year.

1292
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,840
Awesome.

1293
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,840
All right.

1294
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,480
We're going to get back into our show tonight.

1295
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,680
We're going to start off with some Twitter topics.

1296
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,600
Oh, we have theme song now for Twitter topics, don't we?

1297
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,840
I totally forgot to queue it up.

1298
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,040
I'm a bad host tonight.

1299
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,040
Fired!

1300
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,760
Hold on a minute.

1301
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,760
Let me get the theme song here.

1302
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,620
Only if we get to use fire.

1303
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:58,440
Any exciting plans for Labor Day, you guys?

1304
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,440
I'm going to sleep.

1305
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,440
Yeah?

1306
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
Rob.

1307
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
What?

1308
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,440
We have to do something tomorrow.

1309
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Maybe.

1310
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,440
We'll see.

1311
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,440
I kind of want to just stay in and play WoW all day.

1312
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,320
Well, I know what's going on tonight.

1313
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,320
What's that?

1314
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,000
Becky's going to come over tonight, and we're going to watch My Fair Lady.

1315
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Fun!

1316
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,800
Any reason why you were just deciding to get into old-school musicals, just for the fun

1317
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,960
of it?

1318
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,880
I really don't remember how to, except that it was very random.

1319
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,760
Nothing wrong with that.

1320
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,040
We're thinking about going to yoga after the show.

1321
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,040
You should come with us.

1322
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,000
I'll go to yoga, but I'm probably not going to stay for the movie.

1323
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, come on.

1324
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I got other stuff I want to do at home.

1325
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
What, like sleep?

1326
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Yeah, actually.

1327
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,520
All right, I found the music.

1328
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,960
Let's get into the chatters and the listeners of Orange Islands Radio, showing us their

1329
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,640
tweets.

1330
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,160
We can't read them all tonight, guys.

1331
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,400
We got a lot.

1332
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,400
We got a lot tonight.

1333
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,400
We can't read them all.

1334
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,240
I'm going to be offended if we get yours.

1335
01:25:54,240 --> 01:26:00,680
Fernando asked the very first question, what if there was a mariachi band as a game?

1336
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,880
It might sound a little like our background music.

1337
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,280
Let's play a mariachi game.

1338
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,600
I would totally play one, but I think the novelty would honestly wear off.

1339
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,760
Let's be honest.

1340
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,440
There was that tambourine game.

1341
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,880
I don't know if you've ever seen this, but the makers of Samba de Amigo, at least in

1342
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,600
the arcade, also made a tambourine game, and I forget the name of this game.

1343
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,840
It is the gayest game I've ever played in my life, and I use that term to mean really

1344
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,520
homosexual, like this would sleep with other tambourine games of the same gender, okay?

1345
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:36,220
This was, wow, like gayer than Stevie Nicks, but it was a lot of fun, actually, and it's

1346
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:39,540
the closest thing I think I've played to an actual mariachi band.

1347
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,540
So there you go.

1348
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,240
Not that I'm saying mariachi's gay, but just, you know, I don't know why the tambourine music

1349
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,320
and the whole Samba thing kind of reminds me.

1350
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,760
It's like the closest that we've had.

1351
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,240
Tigerclaw305 says, there's a story here he's linking us to.

1352
01:26:54,240 --> 01:27:00,060
The creator of Mobile Suit Gundam says that video games are evil, and links us to a story

1353
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,560
that ran on Gamasutra earlier this week.

1354
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:10,280
Apparently Yoshiyuki Tomino gave a keynote speech at the CEDEC Game Conference and said,

1355
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,340
quote, I think that video games are evil.

1356
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:17,680
Gaming is not a type of activity that provides any support to our daily lives, and all these

1357
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,320
consoles are just consuming electricity.

1358
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,760
Let's say we have about 3 billion people on this planet wasting their time bringing no

1359
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,240
productivity at all.

1360
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,440
Add 10 billion more people, and what would happen to our planet?

1361
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,000
Video games are assisting the death of our planet.

1362
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,800
Okay crazy man, way to bite the hand that feeds you, right?

1363
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,680
I don't know, why would he say something like that?

1364
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,000
I don't know.

1365
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,720
Gundam is on like every fucking game platform ever in Japan.

1366
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,700
Way to be a sellout.

1367
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:50,840
Maybe the speech was like irony and we just don't get it, I don't know.

1368
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,440
Retertainment wants us to talk about this topic.

1369
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:58,800
Most people complain that early adopters are getting screwed over, does the PS3 Slim mean

1370
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,480
it the other way around?

1371
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:07,280
That's kind of been true of Sony for a long time, well at least in this generation.

1372
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,040
If you didn't buy a PlayStation 3 when they first came out, you didn't get backwards compatibility.

1373
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:16,280
Or you didn't get the extra USB slots were on there for a while, then there were some

1374
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,500
other on-board ports, right?

1375
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,640
So it's not like the Slim is anything new for Sony this generation, but if you didn't

1376
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:28,480
want the machine to cost $600, they had to cut corners somewhere.

1377
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,360
But I do find the whole lack of even software emulation and the removal of Linux, I do find

1378
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,360
that odd.

1379
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,360
Like the rest of it I get.

1380
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,360
I get why they take out USB slots, I get some of this other stuff.

1381
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,400
I get that the Slim might have a slightly longer loading time.

1382
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,960
The rest of this I don't think I get.

1383
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,960
Does that make sense?

1384
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,960
It makes sense.

1385
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,560
I don't understand why they removed Linux, I mean I understand that maybe no one's used

1386
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,520
in that function, but I don't see how that function really did anything, unless people

1387
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:59,240
found a way to hack the PS3 through Linux, which I don't know.

1388
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,240
I haven't heard of that.

1389
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,960
It actually would be fairly easy using Linux I would think.

1390
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:08,120
No, I think they keep everything separated, but I don't understand.

1391
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,120
Whatever.

1392
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,240
All right, well, we're also going to move on to another Twitter topic.

1393
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:18,320
This comes from a friend of mine, The Segg, on Twitter, and he actually wants us to name

1394
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,680
drop something he's going to be working with in the next couple months, and he's already

1395
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,840
working on it now, FundaRazor.

1396
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,200
That of course is a nice fancy way of saying fundraiser, which is a fundraiser for the

1397
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:34,320
Child's Play charity, and it's a national event that's going to be happening this December.

1398
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,600
San Francisco, Austin, New York City, Portland, Denver.

1399
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,960
If you want more information, I urge you to follow them on Twitter.

1400
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,880
They're at Twitter.com slash FundaRazor.

1401
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,440
I just linked it in chat.

1402
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,440
F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.

1403
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,160
They only have 10 followers right now.

1404
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,160
It's for charity.

1405
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,160
They should have 10,000.

1406
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,160
Check out that event near you.

1407
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,280
I'm going to try and go to the one in San Francisco.

1408
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,720
In fact, I'm pretty sure I will be going.

1409
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,960
Well, I kind of told Segg I would, so I'm going to go, and then probably take the next

1410
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,960
day off work so I can go.

1411
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,960
I'd like to go.

1412
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,960
You want to go?

1413
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,960
Sure.

1414
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,960
We'll cover it for OLR.

1415
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:08,960
That sounds great.

1416
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,120
Maybe we can get some swanky press access or something.

1417
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,920
I'll have to talk and see if we can get a hookup.

1418
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:13,920
That'll be fun.

1419
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,920
That would be.

1420
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:15,920
But you know what?

1421
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:16,920
It's not about that.

1422
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:17,920
It's about a good cause.

1423
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,880
And you know, between the marathon we talked about last week that unfortunately I got so

1424
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,640
busy this week I couldn't follow up on that, but there's the marathon we're going to do

1425
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,600
October 17th.

1426
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,600
I will hopefully have all the details on that next week.

1427
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,420
There's a lot of great stuff coming this holiday season.

1428
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:37,760
As I understand it, FundaRazor is also on Facebook.

1429
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,200
And wants some more fans on Facebook.

1430
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:43,040
I don't think I'm following them on Facebook yet, so I will go add them myself a little

1431
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
later in the show.

1432
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:48,000
But again, that's F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R.

1433
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
And K.O.

1434
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,200
Ray is reminding us about Extra Life, which is the marathon that's also happening on October

1435
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,440
17th that we talked about last week.

1436
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,400
Extra Life SG is their Twitter.

1437
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,400
So two great events, one in October, one in December.

1438
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,400
Do them both.

1439
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,680
Think of the children, damn you.

1440
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,200
And how crunchy they are.

1441
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,200
Shush.

1442
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:13,680
Spazinator says, PlayStation 3 firmware 3.0 unannounced or hidden feature.

1443
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,960
The addition of print screen and screenshot to the web browser.

1444
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,960
I was not aware.

1445
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,960
That's kind of interesting.

1446
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,280
I mean, nothing you can't already do on a PC, but I guess it's kind of nice to have

1447
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,280
that on the PlayStation.

1448
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,500
You know that screenshotting is coming to home as well.

1449
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,280
And they're going to do like a first person view so you can screenshot there.

1450
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:35,160
So check that out.

1451
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,240
I think that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1452
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,840
All right, I'll do one more.

1453
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,840
K.O.

1454
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,880
Ray says, just beat Batman Arkham Asylum.

1455
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:43,880
What do you guys think of it?

1456
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:44,880
That game was beautiful.

1457
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,400
And Dan was playing a lot of it while Misty was here.

1458
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:53,560
And of course, and who's also here right now, our other friend Mystique.

1459
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:57,600
So we had Misty and Misty and me making commentary the entire time.

1460
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,160
We were doing the MST3K version of Batman Arkham Asylum and it was pretty funny.

1461
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,640
And then every time Harley came out, I was like, Harley.

1462
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,640
So yeah, pretty good.

1463
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,600
But I wish it had more of an ending.

1464
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:14,320
I know you're a fan girl of the comics, so how in the series?

1465
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,320
What I'm not.

1466
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,320
I don't like DC Comics.

1467
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,960
I thought you were like the show, not the I'm sorry, I'm at the comic book show.

1468
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,840
You know, I watch some of the animated series.

1469
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,480
I'm not the world's biggest Batman fan.

1470
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,480
I just like that.

1471
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,480
Dan loves it.

1472
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,480
Dan loves it.

1473
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,480
I am not.

1474
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,120
Mystique just came in and let's see.

1475
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,600
Has Mystique ever been on the show?

1476
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,600
No.

1477
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,600
Come here, Mystique.

1478
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,600
Wait, come here, come here.

1479
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,600
Let's end Twitter topics.

1480
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,600
Let's talk to Mystique for a little bit.

1481
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,600
Hi, Mystique.

1482
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,600
How are you?

1483
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,600
Hey, what's up?

1484
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,600
Good.

1485
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,600
Just be, just be, talk loud and strong in that microphone because it's kind of sensitive.

1486
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,600
You don't want me to be loud.

1487
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,600
All right.

1488
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,600
You don't want me to be that loud.

1489
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:49,440
What do you, uh, you hold in your hand a bunch of DC, what is this DVDs of movies?

1490
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,440
Yes.

1491
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,440
Yeah.

1492
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,080
It is Superman, the animated series and Justice League Unlimited.

1493
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,020
Are you guys going to a Mystery Science 3000 that like the movie you were watching last

1494
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,020
week when I was here?

1495
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,020
Possibly.

1496
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,020
Possibly.

1497
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:06,720
Uh, oh, there might be, there might be a fighting going on over the TV.

1498
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,120
There's going to be a throw down.

1499
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,120
Oh, there's going to be a throw down.

1500
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,800
Uh, what do you think of Batman Arkham Asylum?

1501
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,840
I cannot wait to play that game, even though I watched a lot of it with Dan, although I'm

1502
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,400
really upset that I can't play the Joker and the Xbox 360.

1503
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,440
Oh, because he has the 360 version.

1504
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:27,240
And he just, he just had to tell me after I made a decision of which one I was going

1505
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,240
to buy.

1506
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,240
I'm like, hmm.

1507
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,980
Both of them went down in price.

1508
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:35,160
You know, I think I'm going to get the 360 since I have an, I have Netflix and all that.

1509
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:39,900
And then Dan had to go and tell me, you know, on the PS3 you can play the Joker.

1510
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,000
I was like, you're a bastard.

1511
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,760
Only in one mode.

1512
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,760
I don't care.

1513
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,760
It's only a little piece of the game.

1514
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,640
By the way, I'm loving the purple hair matching glasses, matching the top.

1515
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,640
That is perfect today.

1516
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,640
It's my signature color.

1517
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,640
That's right.

1518
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,640
All right.

1519
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,960
Well thank you Mystique for being on the show and have fun with your movies.

1520
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,960
Okay.

1521
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,960
New problem.

1522
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,960
All right.

1523
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,960
We like having new people.

1524
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:57,960
Better play the death hill when Becky comes over because we are totally watching My Fair

1525
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:58,960
Lady.

1526
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:06,560
So we, we have not had guests a lot in the studio dark room's freaking small, very small

1527
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,560
space.

1528
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,640
Dan, I think we need a bigger box.

1529
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,640
All right.

1530
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,120
It's time to get a bigger boat.

1531
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,120
Salsa shark.

1532
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,120
All right.

1533
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,120
Twitter topics.

1534
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,120
We're done with that for tonight.

1535
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,560
So thank you guys very much for contributing to Twitter topics.

1536
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,160
Let's get back into some gaming news.

1537
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,940
Actually rapid fire news is up next.

1538
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,160
So some quick gaming news starting from Loki.

1539
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,160
Yes.

1540
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:30,560
The card too, of course, is getting a collector's edition, which will be coming out with the

1541
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,400
game in October.

1542
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,080
And with the collector's edition, you will be able to get a replica knife.

1543
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,080
Yes.

1544
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,520
Because that's what gamers need things to stab stuff with.

1545
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,520
I want a knife.

1546
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,520
Yes.

1547
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,520
Now that's a knife.

1548
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,920
Yes.

1549
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:52,200
It's the Fortune Hunter edition and it does come with the replica of the game's mystery,

1550
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,640
mysterious ancient artifact.

1551
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:58,760
And I don't know.

1552
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,160
But yeah, it is going to be very limited and I guess apparently only available through

1553
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:07,720
GameStop, which, you know, they get all the limited editions nowadays.

1554
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,920
I don't know why.

1555
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:16,480
Konami in kind of a strange turn of events is publishing the new 99 Nights game, 99 Nights

1556
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,560
2, which judging by the screenshot looks way better than the first one.

1557
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,560
And yeah, it's pretty awesome.

1558
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,800
But right now it's scheduled to come out in Japan soon.

1559
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,960
No word on when it's coming out over here, but you better believe it'll be coming out

1560
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,960
over here at some point.

1561
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,360
Probably next year, because that's when all the games are coming out.

1562
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:42,880
And then finally, Guitar Hero 5 has a lot of download content coming its way for the

1563
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,480
month of September.

1564
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:48,660
Starting things off next week on September 10th, you're going to be getting the Street

1565
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:55,920
Sweeper Social Club Track Pack, which includes 100 Little Curses, Fight Smash Win, and Somewhere

1566
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:02,640
in the World It's Midnight, all available for $2 or 160 Microsoft Points or 200 Wii

1567
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,640
Points.

1568
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:09,280
And the week after that, they're going to be getting the AFI Track Pack, which is going

1569
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,800
to include Beautiful Thieves, Girls Not Gray, and The Missing Frame, also available for

1570
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,160
$2 each or 160 Microsoft Points.

1571
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:24,720
Or of course, the track packs as a whole you can buy in a bundle for $5.49.

1572
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:30,280
And then finally, September 24th, we'll be getting another track pack.

1573
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:36,840
No name for this track pack, but apparently it includes The Editors with Munich, Faint

1574
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:43,000
with Geeks Were Right, and the Yaya Yas with Dull Life, and also available for $2 each

1575
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,120
or $5.49 for the pack.

1576
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,560
And that's it.

1577
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,200
All right, moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

1578
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,000
A new WiiWare game has been announced.

1579
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,520
It's Bit.Trip Void, if that sounds familiar.

1580
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,720
It's because you probably played Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Chord, I'm sorry, Bit.Trip

1581
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,720
Core.

1582
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,640
Void is coming out, of course, in the Bit.Trip fashion.

1583
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,840
It kind of looks like the Atari 2600, but with chiptunes, and it looks like it's going

1584
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,840
to be pretty cool.

1585
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,860
I'm looking at a trailer here in studio.

1586
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:15,120
The trailer, it makes it look like Ikaruga, because you have to collect black dots in

1587
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,120
your Void conspiracy.

1588
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,960
Oh, and you kind of avoid the white ones.

1589
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,560
That actually looks like fun.

1590
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,280
The Bit.Trip games are actually a lot of fun.

1591
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,720
I wonder if they'll release a compilation of this a little later on.

1592
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,720
I don't know.

1593
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,840
That could be a very fun game.

1594
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,680
I don't think there is a release date yet announced for this.

1595
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,360
They just say later this year.

1596
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,960
By the way, it was playable at PAX, so some folks already got to play it.

1597
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,340
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Attack is coming to the Nintendo DS.

1598
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,260
Apparently it's a brand new game.

1599
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,720
It has the arcade style controls like you see in Turtles in Time.

1600
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,840
You are going up against Shredder.

1601
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,620
By the way, this was also shown at PAX.

1602
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:57,560
You lucky PAX attendees getting your hands on some early stuff.

1603
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,440
Another game that's coming out onto Xbox Live Arcade, Puzzle Bobble Live, coming out in

1604
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,960
Japan.

1605
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,940
It will probably make its way over here as Bust-A-Move Live or something like that over

1606
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:13,200
here in America, because you know there's that whole fact that Bust-A-Move over here

1607
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,960
is actually Puzzle Bobble.

1608
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:20,300
Why they call it Bust-A-Move and then ruined the name of the actual Bust-A-Move game is

1609
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,520
Bust-A-Groove over here?

1610
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,520
I will never understand that.

1611
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,260
Oh, I have an answer for that.

1612
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:26,640
Why do they call Puzzle Bobble Bust-A-Move here?

1613
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,640
Because they're stupid.

1614
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,640
Oh, okay.

1615
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,640
That makes perfect sense.

1616
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:36,000
Anyway, the game's coming out in Japan on September 30th for 800 Microsoft Points.

1617
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,220
No comment yet on North America or Europe release dates, but I'm sure the games will

1618
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,380
be ported soon enough.

1619
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,640
Those are... That's a pretty standard game.

1620
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:50,240
Do you remember on the PlayStation 2, Bust-A-Move was one of the first games that came out for

1621
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:55,040
it, and on the cover it had a baby wearing sunglasses and had a big bubble that said

1622
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,040
Bust-

1623
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,040
It made no sense.

1624
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,040
It made no sense at all.

1625
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,760
That was Bust-A-Move 2 that had the baby, I think, on the cover.

1626
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,240
Seriously, what the hell was that?

1627
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,880
That just sums up in a nutshell the transition of Puzzle Bobble to Bust-A-Move.

1628
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,360
I'll just never understand.

1629
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,040
Never get it.

1630
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,920
Kochikawa says it's copyright infringement.

1631
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,920
Forget on what, though.

1632
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,920
Really?

1633
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,920
Whatever.

1634
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,920
Young MC.

1635
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,080
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1636
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,520
I have some stuff.

1637
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:29,720
Actually, some kind of interesting news in looking at almost an international point of

1638
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,720
view.

1639
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,000
First of all, I was in Japan.

1640
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:42,800
The PlayStation 3 sales have plummeted with my bad sound effects.

1641
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:49,840
That actually is going ahead of the PS3 Slim launch.

1642
01:39:49,840 --> 01:40:05,560
They've gone, for the regular PS3, it's only sold 1,040 units with the last week, and however

1643
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:13,960
the Xbox 360 rose to sell 7,254 units.

1644
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:21,040
Of course, there's a little bit of Nintendo sale drop, but they're still pushing a lot

1645
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:29,680
of the DSi and DS Lite.

1646
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:39,200
As far as other stuff going on, for some rock band news, there's a new PAX track that's

1647
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:44,840
going to be Freeze Pop, Jonathan Colton, MC Frontalot, and Paul and Storm.

1648
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,240
And each song will be $1 apiece.

1649
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,680
So you've got that.

1650
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,680
A whole dollar?

1651
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,680
Yep.

1652
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:54,920
Yeah, but it's Freeze Pop and Jonathan Colton and other bands that are pretty cool.

1653
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,360
You know, I'm going to have both of those at least.

1654
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:04,240
And then the last thing, this gets the Face Palm award of the night, other than those

1655
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:08,360
idiot people wanting to pull their children out of school so they can't see Obama's speech.

1656
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,360
So stupid.

1657
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:19,240
But yeah, there's a special, a special function for the 6-axis in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

1658
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,360
It's going to have 6-axis support.

1659
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,240
You know what it's going to do?

1660
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,240
No.

1661
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,240
What?

1662
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,240
Boob jiggle.

1663
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,240
Awesome.

1664
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,800
You can control boob jiggle.

1665
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,200
It is the next likely progression.

1666
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Whatever.

1667
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:38,880
It's like I was telling Sauce earlier today, I was like, yeah, I bet the developers are

1668
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,520
sitting around going, we should do something with the 6-axis.

1669
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,880
I don't know, what should we do?

1670
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,800
We could wiggle their boobies.

1671
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,800
Hey, that works.

1672
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,800
And that's it.

1673
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,240
I bet the conversation went just like that too.

1674
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,400
All right.

1675
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
Funny.

1676
01:41:55,400 --> 01:42:00,400
Let's get back into some longer news that we'll talk a little more about, and then soon

1677
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,880
your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1678
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,160
Now I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy about this or not.

1679
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,720
And we know that with the new updates, especially coming in the fall, that they're going to

1680
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:16,640
be having some support for Facebook support and stuff like that.

1681
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,920
I know with the Xbox 360.

1682
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,640
Now what's interesting though is apparently the game Blur coming out is going to have

1683
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,040
Twitter support.

1684
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:28,280
Yes, it will apparently tweet when you do different things.

1685
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:33,920
And for one example, one of the tweets, I guess, might be like, I just won first place

1686
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,440
and blah, blah, blah.

1687
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:39,520
I hope they can turn that off.

1688
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,520
I don't know.

1689
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,520
Yeah, you don't give it your login.

1690
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,520
That's how you turn it off.

1691
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,840
This sounds like a horrible idea.

1692
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:44,840
I'm sorry.

1693
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:45,840
I don't know.

1694
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,760
It's a horrible, horrible idea that is just contributing to the problem.

1695
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,560
And don't get me wrong, I think Blur is an amazing looking game, and I really enjoy the

1696
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,560
demo at E3.

1697
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,560
It's one of my favorites.

1698
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,240
That being said, the plug needs to be pulled on this immediately.

1699
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,960
And if you spam this shit to your Twitter and I'm following you right now, you will

1700
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,080
be dropped.

1701
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:09,200
Because unfortunately, and here's the problem with Twitter, is that you cannot filter posts

1702
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,600
like you can on Facebook.

1703
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,980
I would be okay with it if you could click a little button and then like filter all posts

1704
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:16,400
made by Blur because I would have done that with Blur.

1705
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,600
I would have done that with that friend feed or whatever.

1706
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:26,960
And I would do that with Raptor because I seriously drop people for all those things.

1707
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,160
And it's nothing personal.

1708
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,040
I just, you know, here's the thing.

1709
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,280
It is personal with me, by the way.

1710
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,440
There's a finite amount of tweets that my iPhone app will download at a time.

1711
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,840
It's 200 tweets.

1712
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,160
And if 20 of those tweets are your fucking friend feed or something, I'm sorry.

1713
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,120
That's going to piss me off because that's 20 things I could have read about somebody

1714
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,360
else, you know, that might be like actually about their day or something interesting.

1715
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:53,680
You know, I just, I am not a fan of these auto tweets at all and kind of, and think

1716
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,560
they're going to destroy Twitter unless something is done about them very soon.

1717
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,280
Because I know this is not going to be the first or last thing.

1718
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:05,860
What Activision destroy something like, I don't know, beloved guitar franchise.

1719
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:11,320
This is just so strange though, because you know, usually bizarre creations is, is we've

1720
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,320
had them on the show.

1721
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,320
They're a great studio.

1722
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,120
Uh, and I understand, you know, they're just trying to be on the cutting edge of technology,

1723
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,740
but this, I just, and I'm really, you should do it really with Facebook and maybe we're

1724
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:23,840
misinterpreting this and I'll give credit there.

1725
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,240
Maybe we need clarification on how exactly this is going to work.

1726
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,000
And I think it's pretty obvious to say if you don't give this game your Twitter login,

1727
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,100
it can't do it.

1728
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:34,760
So to some extent you're going to have to want it to post to Twitter for you.

1729
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,600
But why that's, that's the part I failed to see.

1730
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
Why is this useful?

1731
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,960
And the other thing too is apparently it's going to feature like a faux social networking

1732
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:52,280
site like inner tube, I guess it's their bizarre version of YouTube or something, but yeah,

1733
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:56,480
it will have real, um, Twitter support as well.

1734
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,480
I don't know.

1735
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,220
I think it's fine if they want to, you know, if you have updates or something like that,

1736
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:03,520
but that's something more like Facebook because at least then you can filter it out.

1737
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:08,240
But Twitter, I don't want to see updates about, you know, stuff like that.

1738
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,240
I don't know.

1739
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,840
Or maybe it gives you the option like say you want first place and you get the option,

1740
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,560
do you want to tweet this or not?

1741
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,800
That might be a little more tolerable depending on how often people do it.

1742
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,200
You know, I, I, I just, I'm a little iffy on it though.

1743
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,200
Yeah.

1744
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,960
I just want to say this.

1745
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,320
Just don't do it.

1746
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:26,760
Just don't bother with it.

1747
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:31,120
If my Twitter gets filled up with blur race updates, then I can't read that so and so

1748
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:36,580
just took a big poop on Twitter, you know, and isn't that what Twitter's really about

1749
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,960
is what you ate for breakfast this morning?

1750
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,960
Exactly.

1751
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,520
With the new, uh, was it the new, um, action or whatever?

1752
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,840
I am actually starting to get really annoyed with Twitter.

1753
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,800
Like it's a love hate thing with Twitter.

1754
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,660
There's a lot of dumb shit on Twitter, but at the same time I found it to be really good

1755
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:54,000
for networking and getting the information out there.

1756
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,600
Like it's been really good for the show.

1757
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,040
That's what I use it for.

1758
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,520
As I use it for a lot of my networking now.

1759
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,920
I use it for O.L.R.

1760
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:02,920
Foodio.

1761
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:03,920
Yeah.

1762
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,520
Now there's a new hashtag.

1763
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,600
Loki invented a new hashtag and the thing is people are using it that listen to this

1764
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,600
show.

1765
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,240
Like it's not just me, but like I saw like three other people using the new O.L.R.

1766
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:19,560
Foodio tweet and I'm somewhere torn between this is really funny and you know, I just

1767
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:24,640
think Twitter needs to take some cues from Facebook and give us better ways to filter

1768
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,640
content.

1769
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:26,640
I think it's really what they need.

1770
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,640
I've actually been using my Facebook a whole lot more than Twitter now.

1771
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,920
I mean, simply because of a lot of the reasons that you just mentioned.

1772
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,720
So, uh, Bochi Kawa in chat makes a very good point.

1773
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:38,280
Poop is greater than waste race win.

1774
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,280
I agree.

1775
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,520
All right.

1776
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:47,160
So anyhow, Blur getting Twitter support, uh, we'll see exactly how that plays out a little

1777
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,160
later on.

1778
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,520
Meantime, one game that's not going to have Twitter support, but it will have support

1779
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,160
for your balance board is of course, Wii Fit Plus and a release date has been announced

1780
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,560
for Wii Fit Plus.

1781
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,840
It's coming out on October 4th.

1782
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,040
Here's the great thing about Wii Fit Plus.

1783
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:05,440
Remember how a lot of us were thinking that on Nintendo's just going to price gouge on

1784
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,440
this and that?

1785
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:07,440
Nope.

1786
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,320
It's going to cost $20 Wii Fit Plus is only going to set you back $20.

1787
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,480
Now keep in mind that's if you already have a balance board.

1788
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,960
So they figure if you have a balance board, then they got to once already with Wii Fit

1789
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,680
because they don't sell a balance board separately.

1790
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,680
Do they?

1791
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:26,560
So, but so they're, and they're going to get rid of the skew that is the Wii Fit with the

1792
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,560
balance board.

1793
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:31,200
Now you will only be able to buy Wii Fit Plus with the balance board, but I guess the good

1794
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,160
news, the silver lining is that, you know, for those of you that just want to upgrade

1795
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,560
because there are some new games, there are some new things with this, it's only going

1796
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,120
to cost you $20.

1797
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,120
Good news.

1798
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,120
Bad news.

1799
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,120
Loki.

1800
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,380
The bad news, which you forgot to mention was now they also raised the price of that

1801
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:46,480
bundle by $10.

1802
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,480
Sorry about that.

1803
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,560
And that'll be $99.99 for that bundle.

1804
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,800
So if you didn't get in on the ground floor of Wii Fit, which I'm going to tell you this

1805
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,720
much, if you didn't get in on the ground floor of that, you're not missing out.

1806
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:58,720
Seriously.

1807
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:03,860
And you know, if you're dumb enough to buy the game by itself, no offense, but like it's

1808
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:05,400
almost the same game again.

1809
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,360
I don't know why you'd buy the same game again.

1810
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,320
Because there are some extra things that some of the little mini games were kind of cute.

1811
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:17,000
I mean, you know, if you're going to buy that Wii Play or whatever, you know, you spend

1812
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,120
an extra $10 to get Wii Play and none of those games are good.

1813
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,120
Right?

1814
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,120
I don't know.

1815
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,120
Whatever.

1816
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:30,000
I mean, I don't know, see, I don't think the same way issue about Wii Fit.

1817
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,560
Like I get the point behind Wii Fit and I actually kind of like it.

1818
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,880
I think if you actually make it a point to play the game every day and you know, some

1819
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,400
exercise is better than none.

1820
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,600
You know, granted, it's not the best thing you could be doing.

1821
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:53,920
You could be lifting weights or you could be running or jogging, but you know, if it's

1822
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,080
kind of a nice meet you in the middle type of thing and I think that's what Wii Fit's

1823
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,080
always been about.

1824
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,080
Right?

1825
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,080
I guess.

1826
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:06,000
It's trying to make exercising more fun for kids and non-kids who are just not as motivated.

1827
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,720
They should just have you bench press the board and make it way more...

1828
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:14,760
I'll have to put D cell batteries in it to make it a little heavier.

1829
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,160
No, just put in big ol' 9 volts.

1830
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,160
I don't know.

1831
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,480
I'm actually considering picking out...

1832
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,760
It's only $20.

1833
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,160
That's not that bad considering...

1834
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:25,280
Is this supposed to have some internet stuff too where you're gonna be able to pair with

1835
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,280
friends around the globe?

1836
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,280
Just wait for the peer use.

1837
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,280
I'm sure it will.

1838
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,280
All right.

1839
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,280
Fine.

1840
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:31,280
Maybe I'll do that.

1841
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,280
We'll see.

1842
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:36,380
Takeo Ray in our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, my friend's aunt lost 40 pounds using

1843
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,380
Wii Fit.

1844
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,880
She was just by it.

1845
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,980
Lumi's in chat says, it's all about your diet and how consistent you are.

1846
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:47,160
That's kind of true too is that you can't expect that you play Wii Fit by itself for

1847
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,260
like 10 minutes a day and that anything major is gonna happen.

1848
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,960
It kind of has to be part of a greater lifestyle adjustment.

1849
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:54,960
And that's why...

1850
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,800
And I also noticed that xlink in chat says, I'll play my EA Active.

1851
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,040
One thing about EA Active is that EA Active kind of encourages you as well to be eating

1852
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,440
and doing other stuff.

1853
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:13,160
Any exercises besides just EA Active, I don't think it implements it very well, but at least

1854
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:16,560
it kind of makes it a point to emphasize that as a part of the game as well.

1855
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:17,560
Yeah.

1856
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:20,800
Cause I mean, it's, you can't just do one or I mean, you could do one or the other,

1857
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,640
but they're more effective done together.

1858
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:27,040
I'll tell you what I mean, to be honest, I think one website I think has been very good

1859
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,420
for this.

1860
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:32,740
You know, when I was kind of trying to lose weight and I still am to an extent, one website

1861
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:37,000
I found that I really enjoyed was Spark People, which is actually a pretty good website where

1862
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,080
you can monitor your food intake and you monitor your exercise and how many glasses of water

1863
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,080
you drink a day.

1864
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,080
The day does that too.

1865
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,080
And everything.

1866
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,760
I just, I really liked the way Spark People was set up.

1867
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:50,520
So I, and it has an iPhone app, which was the other big thing about that that was cool.

1868
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:55,840
So I would definitely recommend that as a part of your diet if you're going to start

1869
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,180
Wii Fit or what have you, because you can actually enter in, Hey, I did 40 minutes of

1870
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:01,700
Wii Fit and it'll count that as calories burned.

1871
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:04,480
So it's a really nice way to incorporate something like that into your diet.

1872
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,480
That's cool.

1873
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,500
I think Wii Fit may be great for people who don't like to exercise in public.

1874
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,680
I think for some people don't like to do that.

1875
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,680
That makes sense.

1876
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,080
No, that makes perfect sense.

1877
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,680
I know a lot of people like that.

1878
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:17,800
I'm kind of one of them.

1879
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,800
Like I'll go out and run.

1880
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:23,400
I'm not a gym person at all, but I know I have a, I have a friend really, really trying

1881
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:24,400
to get me to go to the gym.

1882
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,400
I'm kind of on the fence.

1883
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,400
I'm like, I don't know.

1884
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:31,520
I don't mind going to the gym, but I usually hide myself in the weight room and, and you

1885
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:36,000
know, which is sometimes kind of really nerve wracking, especially when you have all the

1886
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
guys there.

1887
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,520
Not that I have a problem with all the guys there or anything.

1888
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,880
It's just that I don't like going, you know, with, with all the guys there.

1889
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,880
Not ever.

1890
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,880
Yeah.

1891
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,480
And it's probably there's some people that listen to us like, come on you pussies.

1892
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,760
But I, I can't explain it.

1893
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,760
It's just.

1894
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,520
Well, if I'm the only girl there and there's like 10 guys that just got off the basketball

1895
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,440
court all pumping away, so I'm like, uh, yeah, bye.

1896
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,440
All right.

1897
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,120
Let's move on with some more news.

1898
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,680
Y'all I could take them.

1899
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,680
Bench press them.

1900
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:04,680
They'll cry.

1901
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,680
Um, Sony has a stupid idea.

1902
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,880
They've had a lot of stupid ideas.

1903
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,880
This is really stupid.

1904
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,480
And by stupid, I mean stupid.

1905
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:18,600
Um, they're doing a reality TV show.

1906
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,600
Yeah.

1907
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,680
I laughed when I saw this.

1908
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,240
Isn't that kind of all the rage right now?

1909
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:24,240
I mean.

1910
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:25,240
That's stupid.

1911
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,920
Reality TV is ass.

1912
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:35,160
Um, so basically it's got a gaming related reality TV show called the tester.

1913
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:42,080
That's going to be a PSN later in the year where the, uh, people in it can, uh, play

1914
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:48,960
some different, um, elimination challenges so, uh, they can see, you know, who has the

1915
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:54,960
best mental, you know, physical, their best, uh, knowledge too.

1916
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:59,760
And then, um, they get a job as a game tester with, um, the PlayStation QA department in

1917
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,840
San Diego.

1918
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:02,840
Here's the thing.

1919
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,440
I am feel completely different from Jamie.

1920
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,640
I don't think all reality TV is trash.

1921
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:07,640
You watch big brother.

1922
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,760
I think some of it is trash.

1923
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:12,080
Well, I like reality shows that are basically modern game shows.

1924
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,920
Like, you know, in my opinion, big brother is a game show as is survivor is a game show

1925
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:17,920
of sorts.

1926
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,800
And I've always liked game shows of all different types.

1927
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,080
So I, I'm not bothered by those shows.

1928
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:26,840
And even to an extent I can tolerate some of those like VH1 and Bravo shows like project

1929
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,840
runway is pretty good too.

1930
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,200
And some of that project runway though is more like a design contest.

1931
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,120
Well, see, but now you see, you can't, you can't say you hate reality shows and then

1932
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,320
say, but, but this one's okay.

1933
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:40,640
Well, this to me though is like, what was the Trump one?

1934
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:44,120
Um, the apprentice, I hated that show.

1935
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:48,240
See, the apprentice is okay, but my biggest problem with it is that it basically came

1936
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:51,600
down to one dude's opinion, you know, and I think it would have been better if there

1937
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,600
was a board.

1938
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,680
But anyway, I don't want to get into diagnosing all these reality shows.

1939
01:53:54,680 --> 01:54:00,820
What I don't like is like this VH1 is getting so saturated with these shows.

1940
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:04,920
Like I turned on the other day, it was like the Terrell Owens reality show or something.

1941
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,840
I'm like, really, really no.

1942
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,120
And there's just a lot of these types of shows, like the dating shows too much, too much.

1943
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,880
Give me back my own reality.

1944
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,520
I want, I want sitcoms.

1945
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,520
Okay.

1946
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:21,440
Here's the funniest part about this reality show is we've known game testers and it's

1947
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,360
not as glamorous as you would think.

1948
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:28,080
That's what I actually wanted to get to is that the prize here, I hate to say it is not

1949
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:29,080
very good.

1950
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:33,720
Like, and no offense to the game testers I know out there, a lot of you work very hard

1951
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,600
for very little money.

1952
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:40,120
And that's why I don't understand this whole glamorization of the gaming testing.

1953
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:44,120
Like it's this really like gaming testing again, it's not that hard to get into.

1954
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:47,660
I don't think here's what's going to have to be offended, but it's kind of an entry

1955
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:48,660
level position.

1956
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,640
It's how you get your foot in the door at gaming companies.

1957
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:53,840
But a lot of people take that and work up to something a lot bigger.

1958
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,520
Shouldn't a prize on a reality game show be something bigger?

1959
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,440
See, here's what I think is going to happen is that the person's going to play all these

1960
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,520
really cool challenge things that come out and, oh yeah.

1961
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,520
Which are all Sony games.

1962
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,840
But they're going to be all like, yeah, I'm into it.

1963
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,840
Yeah, this is fun.

1964
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,240
Yeah, I win.

1965
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:10,200
I have to work.

1966
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
I have to show up for my job.

1967
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:16,920
You want me to test a cow milking game?

1968
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,920
You know what this is going to be?

1969
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,400
This is just going to be a holiday tie in.

1970
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,240
It's going to be a free download on PlayStation Network.

1971
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:25,600
This is going to be product placement after product placement of all these Sony upcoming

1972
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,600
games.

1973
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:27,760
I don't think it's a terrible idea.

1974
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,640
I mean, especially if it's a free show.

1975
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,640
Hey.

1976
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,640
I'll enter.

1977
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,640
How about that?

1978
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,640
Why don't I enter?

1979
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,640
You want to enter?

1980
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:37,400
I can't quit my day job, but if you want to enter and move to San Diego, good luck with

1981
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,400
that.

1982
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,400
No, thanks.

1983
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:42,400
I don't want to move to San Diego to test games for like eight bucks an hour.

1984
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,400
I like San Diego, but I sure as hell don't want to live there.

1985
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:48,040
I hope somebody from OLR wins it.

1986
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:52,840
If you want to do it, it might be a pretty awesome way to get exposure, but I don't know.

1987
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,840
Yeah.

1988
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,840
I'm kind of with Loki.

1989
01:55:54,840 --> 01:56:00,560
The prize is not that awesome, but I don't think this show is really about giving someone

1990
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,480
a once in a lifetime dream opportunity.

1991
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:05,960
I think the show is going to be nothing but nonstop product placement for holiday Sony

1992
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:09,200
games, but granted, it's a pretty clever way to do it.

1993
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,200
Patty said something funny.

1994
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,200
Uh, Giovedea in chat.

1995
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:12,200
Yeah.

1996
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,200
That's what I was...

1997
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,200
Yeah.

1998
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:15,200
Go ahead and read it.

1999
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,200
Oh.

2000
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:20,520
I'm on reality TV, life with my grandma.

2001
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:23,600
I just don't know how compelling that would be.

2002
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:27,920
Unless your grandma like competes in the X games, then I would watch a show like that.

2003
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,320
Or she was like a serial killer grandma.

2004
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,320
Yes.

2005
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,320
All right.

2006
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:33,320
So...

2007
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,520
I would watch a show called Serial Killer Grandma.

2008
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,240
Do they have that on Discovery Channel?

2009
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,960
I don't know.

2010
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,820
I will check out an episode of this and see if it's any good, but I just kind of have

2011
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:47,280
a feeling it's just going to be product placement and trailers I can download somewhere else

2012
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,760
on PlayStation Network.

2013
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,680
But we'll see.

2014
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:57,480
Something that this winner might be testing out is the brand new 3D support for the PlayStation

2015
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,480
3.

2016
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:02,920
Now, this is kind of...

2017
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
I don't know.

2018
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:09,920
It's neat, but at the same time, it's not that special because in order for you to be

2019
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:16,920
able to use it, you need one of those brand new TVs that can refresh at over 200 hertz.

2020
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:22,220
So that is a problem, and not a lot of people have those TVs right now.

2021
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:27,720
But if you happen to do, and you have the special stereoscopic glasses for that, then

2022
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,760
you can actually play some of the games.

2023
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:34,320
One of them, of course, Wipeout in 3D, and that'll be coming out in 2010.

2024
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,360
I know, actually, sooner than that, they're going to be doing that with Avatar.

2025
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:43,280
But once again, you need that really high-end TV, and right now, there's maybe five different

2026
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:49,440
TVs out there that have that kind of feature for them.

2027
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,280
You think this might be the future of gaming, though?

2028
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,840
Because when we see things like this, I kind of go, okay, well, maybe it's for a certain

2029
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,360
group of people right now, but could it be the future of gaming?

2030
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,560
It's cutting edge, yes, but it might be too cutting edge.

2031
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,940
It's too early because people aren't going to upgrade their TV just to get one of these

2032
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:09,480
TVs that does 200Hz until they start coming out with a lot of 3D movies and stuff, and

2033
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,360
this stuff comes out at a price.

2034
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:17,200
But right now, I guess they can claim that they were the first to do this, or something.

2035
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,920
I don't know.

2036
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,360
But actually, they can't claim they were the first to do this, because now that I think

2037
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:27,040
of it, because if Avatar's coming out on both the 360 and PS3, then they will be doing it

2038
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,040
at the same time.

2039
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:31,120
Wasn't like Rad Racer on the NES in 3D?

2040
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:35,440
Yeah, but that was with those red-blue glasses.

2041
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,840
Wasn't the Virtual Boy in 3D?

2042
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,440
The amazing migraine machine?

2043
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:46,800
Yeah, see, that was actually true 3D, but this, though, yeah, I don't know.

2044
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,000
It's a neat thing, but it's-

2045
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,600
I kind of don't want to see gaming go all 3D like this.

2046
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:55,280
Like, I went and saw Up in 3D, which, don't get me wrong, great movie, had a great time,

2047
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:00,400
but I kind of had a little bit of a headache after it for watching that for like 90 minutes.

2048
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,200
And even though they say you're supposed to take a break every hour when you play video

2049
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,120
games, you guys know that's not how it goes.

2050
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:06,120
No.

2051
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,120
You'll sit there and play a video game for four hours.

2052
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,120
Okay, like-

2053
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,120
Until you gotta pee.

2054
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,680
Yeah, or I need to eat.

2055
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:14,280
But if I sit there with those 3D glasses on playing, like, I don't know, I think I saw

2056
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:19,540
some demo online, like Wipeout HD was being presented in 3D glasses, I bet that looks

2057
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:22,880
fucking awesome, because Wipeout HD already looks fucking awesome.

2058
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,880
It's just-

2059
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,120
But I would have a headache after four hours.

2060
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:28,160
Well, it's just, you know, they're gonna be starting to support more of this stuff.

2061
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,920
It's just like why games now are 5-1 Dolby, you know?

2062
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,680
And HD and all that stuff, it's just because people, it's the progression that's gonna

2063
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:38,680
go in.

2064
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:43,320
I mean, that's what their push is for cinema right now is more 3D, and, you know, eventually

2065
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,640
that's gonna move to the home market.

2066
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:50,120
So it makes sense that games are gonna go in that direction, especially since, you know,

2067
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:54,720
hey, 3D might come in handy when like Project Intel comes out, or, you know, these games

2068
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:59,480
are gonna be using the Sony motion capture thing that they're gonna have, you know?

2069
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:05,520
You might need to see stuff in 3D space in that sense, but I don't know, it's not cheap

2070
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,520
right now, though.

2071
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:10,760
Like, if you wanna buy a monitor for your PC and, you know, the stereoscopic glasses,

2072
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:13,280
it's gonna set you back $500.

2073
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:16,480
I mean, that's pretty cheap, you know, compared to an HGTV.

2074
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,720
Yeah, but technology's gonna come down in price eventually.

2075
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,720
Exactly, it will.

2076
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:26,960
You know, remember when HGTVDs, or sorry, H, I just, I can't talk anymore, HGTVs, remember

2077
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:32,520
when those were like thousands of dollars to get an HGTV, and now, like, this Christmas,

2078
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:35,920
I think you're gonna see those flying off the shelves, yeah.

2079
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,920
Remember the big deal?

2080
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:37,920
They were like $5,000.

2081
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,920
Ooh, I have 2DX and a WEGA.

2082
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:40,920
Yeah.

2083
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,200
Well, a lot of that was faux HD, too.

2084
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:47,720
A lot of those WEGAs didn't even really do HD, but yeah, I mean, technology's gonna come

2085
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,720
down in price.

2086
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:49,720
It just does, right?

2087
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:50,720
Yeah.

2088
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:51,720
I don't know, but...

2089
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:56,960
And if it doesn't, it kills the thing, too, you know.

2090
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,840
That's right, because, you know, not everybody's rich.

2091
02:00:58,840 --> 02:00:59,840
Yeah.

2092
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,240
Something to keep in mind.

2093
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,720
I wanna go back to our chatroom, chat.orangelandrader.com, and read some comments.

2094
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:08,720
There was a comment on the last story about the whole reality television from Salacious

2095
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:09,720
Pop.

2096
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,720
Hi there.

2097
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:14,880
Says, if I recall correctly, the Penny Arcade guys were doing something reality-based at

2098
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,960
Penny Arcade Expo.

2099
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:20,760
I don't know if it's a mini-doc for the DVD or a standalone thing or what.

2100
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:25,360
Jamie, being a person that hates all reality television, would you hate a Penny Arcade

2101
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,400
documentary as well?

2102
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,420
There's a difference between a reality TV show and a documentary.

2103
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:31,420
Is there?

2104
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:32,560
Yes.

2105
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,200
What is the difference?

2106
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:37,780
The documentary being that it's set for an informative purpose.

2107
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:40,760
Its purpose is not necessarily entertainment.

2108
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:45,840
It is to give you the information regarding a particular situation, a historical event,

2109
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,840
for an individual.

2110
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,000
Couldn't a documentary be entertaining?

2111
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,440
Like, depending on where you are.

2112
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:54,160
That's why I said, not necessarily just for entertainment.

2113
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:58,600
Reality TV is supposed to be, oh, here's your slice of how other people live.

2114
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:04,560
You know, like, for example, if you took a documentary to Somalia to see about, you know,

2115
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:13,680
the results of the war and their own little mafia thing going on there, and you get unfiltered

2116
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:20,000
information, or if it's filtered, it's just to make it, you know, slightly more palatable,

2117
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,780
but it's not scripted.

2118
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,940
This is what's going on.

2119
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:26,160
It's inquisitive.

2120
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,480
It's editorial.

2121
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,520
This is what is going on.

2122
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:33,400
Whereas reality TV is, in the end, a manufactured reality.

2123
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:37,080
All right, fine.

2124
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,720
I just was kind of curious.

2125
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:45,440
I don't think that's a pretty, pretty definite, you know, definition.

2126
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:50,760
It's the purpose between having, this is actually what's happening versus, well, this is what

2127
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,160
we want you to see happening.

2128
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,520
This is a made up reality.

2129
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:58,080
These people auditioned to be in our version of real life.

2130
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,720
You know what that has me kind of thinking about, though, is that, you know, I bet there

2131
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,640
would be a lot of people that would be interested in watching something like that, kind of a

2132
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:07,440
behind the scenes thing at PAX, and even though, you know, it was commented that it's probably

2133
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:12,080
going to be for a DVD, wouldn't it be kind of neat if this was a downloadable exclusive

2134
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:16,080
on PlayStation Network or Xbox 360, I know has done a lot of work with Penny Arcade?

2135
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,080
I think that'd be cool.

2136
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:19,680
Or even like, you know what might be a really cool tie in?

2137
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,900
Have it be something that's on Xbox 360 Netflix.

2138
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:26,840
Put it on Netflix as an instant queue title, and then people could watch it.

2139
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:28,720
I think that would be worthwhile.

2140
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:29,720
That'd be pretty cool.

2141
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,960
See, like, I think that is something that if PlayStation Network is going to make up

2142
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:36,660
this reality show or whatever, that should also be an avenue that they should think about

2143
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:41,040
doing is, you know, maybe, or maybe Microsoft will beat them to the punch, who knows, is

2144
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:47,020
creating these shows about, like, behind the scenes development of games or fandom, I guess

2145
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:51,600
you could say in this case, or, you know, Expos, whatever it is, kind of, you know,

2146
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,600
gamer documentaries.

2147
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:56,480
Well, it was like what I was watching today, Dan, because, you know, my, pretty much my

2148
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:59,480
favorite type of sports car is the Bugatti Veyron, right?

2149
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:05,080
Well, Dan was showing me the video for Forza 2 about how they got the Bugatti license,

2150
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:12,440
and, you know, were mapping out the car, how it was done, the meat of how they, you know,

2151
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:14,560
put the car in the game.

2152
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,160
That type of stuff is always interesting to me.

2153
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:18,560
Like, I love behind the scenes stuff in movies.

2154
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,040
I like watching the how they do that type thing, you know.

2155
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:25,080
I did love watching Ripley's Believe It or Not.

2156
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,600
You know what I love?

2157
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,880
Unwrapped on the Food Network.

2158
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:29,200
Now, that's a documentary.

2159
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,200
I don't have Food Network.

2160
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,760
Hosted by the one and only Mark Summers.

2161
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,040
Loki, am I right or am I right?

2162
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,040
It is a documentary.

2163
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:41,080
I don't know if it's like, oh my god, awesome, but, you know, it's interesting.

2164
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:44,280
It's what we watch to kill time for something else to watch.

2165
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,280
Haters.

2166
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,200
Hey, I don't hate it.

2167
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:48,560
I just don't love it.

2168
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:52,380
Like, especially when you've seen, like, the same episode over and over, they start reusing

2169
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:54,680
some of their, you know, segments on other episodes.

2170
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:55,680
I'll give you that.

2171
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,680
I'll give you that.

2172
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,680
They do need to make some new stuff.

2173
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:59,360
Like, this episode's the stuff that's packaged in plastic.

2174
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,200
Oh, this episode's about baskets.

2175
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,320
So, this episode's about Cheez Whiz.

2176
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,680
It's like, I don't care.

2177
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,480
No, there was an episode on Cheez Whiz?

2178
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,680
No, there was not an episode on Cheez Whiz.

2179
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:13,800
But there's been, like, three episodes about picnics and there's, like, you know, they

2180
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,440
show how they make picnic baskets.

2181
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,440
I don't care.

2182
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,440
It has nothing to do with food.

2183
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:20,280
A picnic basket?

2184
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:23,760
What about those little, don't they call those picnics, those little potato fried things

2185
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,480
you can buy in the, forget it?

2186
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:32,040
You know what is a weird show that's kind of along the lines of Unwrapped is how it's

2187
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,480
made or something like that?

2188
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,760
And they have, like, the most random stuff, like, put together.

2189
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,720
It's like, this episode you're gonna learn how they make galvanized steel, doorknobs,

2190
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:44,600
that's great, bowling balls, and mayonnaise.

2191
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,680
It's like, what the fuck is that?

2192
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:49,480
I mean, it's like, it's so random.

2193
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,120
It's like, ooh, steel!

2194
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,120
Oh, doorknobs.

2195
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,120
I'm sorry.

2196
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:56,920
When I was just out of high school, though, there was a show that they used to come on,

2197
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:00,000
and I don't think, I think this was, you know, before the day of the Food Network, they used

2198
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,720
to come on where they would show you how to make snacks that you buy in the grocery store,

2199
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:06,560
like, they showed how to make Twinkies.

2200
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:12,840
Twinkies will always and forever make me think about the tournament we did, the DDR and Beat

2201
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:15,160
Mania 2DX tournament we did at Scandia.

2202
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:19,120
It was called the Sacramento Hosts Another Fabulous Tournament, or we called it Behind

2203
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:20,840
the Scenes Another Fucking Tournament.

2204
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,720
It was SHAFT for short.

2205
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,920
And it was great, but it was better than SCAT before it.

2206
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:33,440
You have to remember, when our buddy Keith worked at Scandia, we could, we ran that fucking

2207
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:37,560
joint when we wanted to do a tournament, and we did the most random things.

2208
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:41,880
I know the employees there must have hated us, and so did all the customers, which is

2209
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:42,880
part of the reason why that worked.

2210
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:43,880
But we stayed and helped clean up.

2211
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:44,880
We did.

2212
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,880
We did.

2213
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,640
No, we did a really awesome tournament there and probably brought up some new business,

2214
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,220
but we did the most random stuff.

2215
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:54,120
We turned the birthday party room into a station where you could buy fried Twinkies.

2216
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,360
Yes, we did.

2217
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,800
Deep fried Twinkies.

2218
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,200
What the hell that has to do with the OBS?

2219
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,920
I don't know.

2220
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,920
That was Irene.

2221
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:02,920
Yeah, I know.

2222
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:07,400
That was Irene and Justin B., who now does all these remixes that are popular on YouTube.

2223
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:08,400
Who knew?

2224
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,720
And all this stuff.

2225
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:16,840
Keep in mind, though, that we also had, the tournament before that had a cosplay event.

2226
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:19,320
It was Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

2227
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,320
Yeah, SCAT.

2228
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,320
Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament.

2229
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,320
I remember that.

2230
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,320
It was SCAT.

2231
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:24,400
It was awesome.

2232
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,400
We need to...

2233
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,880
See, if we were to have like an OLR con or something, it just needs to be like fucking

2234
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,960
random like that, where we have a fried Twinkie station.

2235
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,080
We should just have random con.

2236
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:37,800
Loki presents the Baconator station or something.

2237
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,480
I'm telling you, listen, hold on, hold on.

2238
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:44,680
We are seriously kicking around an idea of doing an all-bacon party for my birthday.

2239
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,680
I'm serious.

2240
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,160
Didn't your birthday already happen?

2241
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:48,160
I don't know.

2242
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,160
It's coming up.

2243
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,160
Next Friday.

2244
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:51,160
Oh, you should do it.

2245
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:52,160
Well, we're thinking about it.

2246
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:53,400
Have some bacon fried bacon.

2247
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,360
We're not bacon frying bacon.

2248
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,640
That's just redundant.

2249
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,640
All right.

2250
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:58,640
Look, look.

2251
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:01,760
I want to get to some more comments because we had some funny stuff on Unwrapped.

2252
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,720
We had two fans of Unwrapped in chat.

2253
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:06,280
Takeo Ray says, Unwrapped is the best show on Food Network.

2254
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,120
Act Def says, Unwrapped is awesome.

2255
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:12,080
Salacious Pop says, That show makes me lol because I'm like, oh, go jump in some Gak

2256
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:13,400
Mark summers.

2257
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,400
He couldn't.

2258
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,040
He would have a, he's got that whole OCD thing going on.

2259
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,040
That's right.

2260
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:19,440
Did you see those documentaries about double dairy?

2261
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,440
It scared him.

2262
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:26,120
Well, yeah, because, because he, he's, um, what, what type of phobia is it where you're

2263
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,400
afraid of messes?

2264
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:33,200
I thought it was a type of OCD that he had like a, like a clean cleanliness OCD.

2265
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:34,200
Something like that.

2266
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,880
Either that or he had like an actual phobia.

2267
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,880
All right.

2268
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:39,880
Rama in chat simply says, Fuck Unwrapped.

2269
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:40,880
Good eats is better.

2270
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,720
Alton Brown is, is pretty awesome.

2271
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,720
All right.

2272
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:44,720
I agree.

2273
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,720
Good eats is better.

2274
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,720
Enough food.

2275
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:47,800
Let's get to emails.

2276
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:48,960
You can't eat emails.

2277
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,240
I'm sure if you could, Dark Sakura would have eaten one by now.

2278
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,240
Nope.

2279
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,240
Nope.

2280
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,240
You're wrong.

2281
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,240
I would have thrown them up.

2282
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:59,200
You could print out emails on that paper that they use to print photos on a cake, then you

2283
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,200
could eat emails.

2284
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,960
That's true!

2285
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,720
We need to have a contest where we eat somebody's email one night, live on air.

2286
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,760
Have your email eaten by a cast member.

2287
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,600
We don't have the printer for that.

2288
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:13,600
We'd have to take it out.

2289
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,600
How much does that cost?

2290
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:15,600
I don't know.

2291
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,600
Not that much.

2292
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:17,600
Hm.

2293
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,600
Haha.

2294
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,600
Ugh.

2295
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,600
You people are sick.

2296
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,600
Mailbag!

2297
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:25,600
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2298
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:28,600
Dark Sakura, dive into the email bag and read us an email.

2299
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:30,240
Um, what?

2300
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,240
Okay.

2301
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:35,720
The first one comes from Deathwishing, which is actually the last email I received.

2302
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:41,680
I will have wrote, it's written, this message from a place called Howie's Game Shack.

2303
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,120
Well, I went to Guitar Hero 5 and it is fucking amazing.

2304
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:47,680
It's probably the best one in the franchise.

2305
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,680
I know, right?

2306
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:49,680
Weird.

2307
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:50,680
But seriously, you gotta try it out.

2308
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:53,720
Just skip Smash Hits Van Halen and Metallica and any other...

2309
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,720
Whereid.

2310
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,480
Or weird, I should say.

2311
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,160
Cause he spelled it the same way twice.

2312
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:00,000
Um, any other weird...

2313
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,560
Whereid tie in games they will make.

2314
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:03,560
Haha.

2315
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:04,560
What is it?

2316
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:05,560
Whereid tie.

2317
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,560
Haha.

2318
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,020
Cyber Cafe Love Deathwishing.

2319
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:10,200
I think he meant weird tie in game.

2320
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,200
So yeah.

2321
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,200
Um.

2322
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:13,200
Okay.

2323
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:16,360
Thank you.

2324
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,360
This comes from...

2325
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,200
I think I've been to that place.

2326
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,720
I was trying to look at Howie's Cyber...

2327
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:22,320
I think I've been there.

2328
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,560
I think I used the computers there once one time too.

2329
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,560
That's kind of funny.

2330
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:27,560
Um, this comes from...

2331
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:28,560
One.

2332
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,560
Yeah, we did use one of the Cyber Cafes on Hollywood Boulevard.

2333
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:34,720
There was one in Koreatown that I think was it.

2334
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:35,720
Anyway, sorry.

2335
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,720
Sorry.

2336
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:37,720
Hey, O.L.R.

2337
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:40,480
I was looking on the net and I heard if you have a PSP Go and a PS3 you can pair up the

2338
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:45,040
PS3 controller with a PSP Go to have dual analog sticks.

2339
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:54,360
A half assed way to solve that problem analog nub and make you buy more stuff from them.

2340
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,360
Problem Solved.

2341
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,360
P.S.

2342
02:10:56,360 --> 02:11:05,640
I recently bought a UMD M1, oh a Umid A M1, a 4 inch netbook and it can play high def

2343
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,640
games.

2344
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:10,200
Now it looks stupid with the USB hub, external CD-ROM and a controller sticking out of it

2345
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,640
but it is a good thing to know.

2346
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:12,640
Bye.

2347
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,940
Clearly that email was written on a PSP as well.

2348
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:19,640
You can actually do that on a PSP, well any PSP actually right now because you can do

2349
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:25,500
that with like I know Resistance Retribution that links up with the PS3 and you can use

2350
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:32,360
your PSP Dual Shock or 6-axis to use dual analogs.

2351
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:35,200
That's interesting because how many games really support that?

2352
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:36,200
One.

2353
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,200
One?

2354
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:42,480
Well that feature isn't any good unless your PSP games actually support it but I guess

2355
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,720
maybe it's a trend that will be starting.

2356
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,720
And if you have a PS3 and you're near your PS3.

2357
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:49,360
Hey but I was talking about earlier in the show there's a lot of hidden functionality

2358
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:55,000
between the PS3 and the PSP that Sony does a really poor job at advertising that is very

2359
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
cool.

2360
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,640
They play in the PSP on your TV like if you did that dual shock thing you could put your

2361
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:05,520
resistance game on your TV and then play with the dual shock controller.

2362
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,280
I noticed Dark Sockers looking at a little thing for Diss it up.

2363
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,040
I tried the download demo with that.

2364
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,200
This is part of the soundtrack.

2365
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,200
Is it?

2366
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:15,200
Yeah.

2367
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:16,640
I couldn't get a grasp on the game.

2368
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,680
Like I just couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.

2369
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,860
I just was button mashing.

2370
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:20,860
Is that all the game is?

2371
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:21,860
Button mashing with Final Fantasy characters?

2372
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:22,860
No not exactly.

2373
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:23,860
Really?

2374
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:24,860
I couldn't figure out the strategy behind it.

2375
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:26,000
I think the demo was set up very well.

2376
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,880
It needed like a tutorial or something.

2377
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:29,480
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

2378
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:30,480
That's fine too.

2379
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,480
Nah.

2380
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,480
Alright anyhow.

2381
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:33,480
Next email.

2382
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:34,480
Hi!

2383
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:35,480
Hi.

2384
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,480
My name is Megan by the way.

2385
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:41,520
I have been listening to your podcast for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.

2386
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:45,360
I wanted to say I don't know why so many people are complaining about the cost of the PSP

2387
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,360
Go.

2388
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:53,160
I live in Toronto Canada and a PSP 3000 costs $167 and a 16 gigabyte memory stick costs

2389
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:57,680
$139 so the PSP Go is a good deal for a new player.

2390
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,440
Keep up the great work on your podcast.

2391
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:02,000
A 6 gigabyte memory stick you said?

2392
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
16.

2393
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,720
I don't know.

2394
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:05,720
You'd get the bundle.

2395
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:08,560
I don't know how much it would cost Canadian but it can't be much more than it is here.

2396
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,480
I just got a bundle because my old PSP was kind of dying so I actually just picked up

2397
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:13,840
a PSP 3000 this week.

2398
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:20,600
I bought a $199 bundle that came with the PSP 3000, a 4 gig memory stick, School of

2399
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:24,800
Rock little codes you can use which whatever I don't really care for Jack Black but I'll

2400
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,700
just download it because it was free and then Rock Band Unplugged all came with it.

2401
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:32,040
So you know that wasn't a bad deal at all for the PSP 3000.

2402
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:38,960
The problem is the PSP Go is what $50 cheaper than a PlayStation 3 is now and it's got less

2403
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,960
features than a PSP 3000.

2404
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:43,960
That's where the logic fails me.

2405
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:45,640
If you're going to go PSP, go PSP 3000.

2406
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:52,120
To be honest you can find memory sticks pretty cheap and here's the other thing too.

2407
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:55,040
I don't know if you really need 16 gigabytes of storage.

2408
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:59,040
Even if you're buying games on there, I don't think you need that.

2409
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:03,880
When I was putting ISO's on there I didn't need that amount of space.

2410
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:09,400
4 gigs at the most maybe and then how many games do you plan on storing on there?

2411
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:13,640
Yeah they need 16 gigabytes on a PSP Go because that's all you can do is download stuff but

2412
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:16,660
you're going to be playing a lot of your games off UMDs anyways.

2413
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:21,340
There's really no reason to get the Go other than ooh look it slides.

2414
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:24,720
By the way my comments on Final Fantasy Dissida kind of got the chat room talking about that

2415
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:25,720
a little bit.

2416
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:29,240
AlphaCananagram says the demo doesn't do it justice and he puts demo in caps.

2417
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:34,160
GioVedeo says Dissida is fucking amazing I heart it and AlphaCananagram wants you to

2418
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:39,160
know he is playing Dissida right now a level 100 onion knight on hardcore play mode.

2419
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:43,440
I guess maybe I'll have to check out the full game at some point.

2420
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:49,420
The last email and I'm kind of not going to say who it's coming from but he also didn't

2421
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:52,080
say who he got it from.

2422
02:14:52,080 --> 02:15:00,480
It's an email that was sent out to Disney cast members about the acquisition of Marvel

2423
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:09,240
Entertainment and just looking this over they're actually talking about here's what really

2424
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,240
got me.

2425
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:14,960
Marvel's business meshes perfectly with ours and what we've all been doing to maximize

2426
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:19,840
the value of Disney's creative properties across our business media platforms and geographical

2427
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:25,200
markets and then goes on to talk about Pixar and but here's the other line.

2428
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:30,680
The acquisition of Marvel offers us a similar opportunity to advance that strategy meaning

2429
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:35,400
putting out things all over the world for using it for marketing purposes.

2430
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:42,520
So I am sort of maybe I'm reading a bit more into this but since they've been talking about

2431
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:48,180
use of the Marvel brand and you know the consumer market I have a feeling we're going to start

2432
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:55,040
seeing actual this was sent out to cast members meaning I think it's the park.

2433
02:15:55,040 --> 02:16:01,320
That means that we might start seeing characters in the parks and of course you know that's

2434
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,400
also going to mean games.

2435
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,160
It's going to mean movies.

2436
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:07,920
It's going to mean more things that happen tomorrow.

2437
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,960
Not tomorrow but I'm saying down the line let me put it this way that their licenses

2438
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:17,120
are going to run into like 2015 2017 I mean it's that long.

2439
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:21,280
You know what else is interesting in for some reason that the whole story about Disney buying

2440
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,920
Marvel didn't make tonight show role but I'm sure everybody read about it somewhere on

2441
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,920
the Internet.

2442
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,920
You couldn't get away from it.

2443
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:30,200
I thought it was very interesting about when that story hit is that you just saw all this

2444
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:35,760
like freaking cross fanboy wank all over the Internet all at once about like OMG there's

2445
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,800
going to be Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters and like all this stuff that ain't happening

2446
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:42,160
as if Spider-Man was going to be in Toy Story 4.

2447
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,160
No it's not.

2448
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:47,280
I see that and I realize some of you might be making a joke but like seriously I heard

2449
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:51,460
those jokes like 500 times this week all the that type of stuff and I don't think anything's

2450
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:52,460
going to change overnight.

2451
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:57,300
I mean I I kind of go back to Disney buying the Muppets like I realize it's a little different

2452
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,280
because the Muppets were the Muppets a company.

2453
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:03,040
I guess they were of some sort Jim Henson productions.

2454
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,360
I guess it's a little different at the same time.

2455
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:07,500
What changed with the Muppets.

2456
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,760
Not a lot.

2457
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:11,360
We got a cool 3D thing at Disneyland.

2458
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:14,520
And so maybe we'll get a cool Marvel ride at California Adventure or whatever.

2459
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:16,320
Maybe they'll bring back the 7th portal.

2460
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,640
But it's going to be a while.

2461
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,320
Doesn't Marvel have an agreement with other theme parks.

2462
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:20,880
I know DC does.

2463
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:24,840
DC is what you see all over Magic Mountain and the Six Flags.

2464
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:26,800
I want to see the 7th portal come back.

2465
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:31,400
Oh come on you went on that with me at Great America.

2466
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:36,560
I just I just don't think it's going to be like I don't think Disney is going to mean

2467
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:39,240
that Marvel is going to run the same way Disney does.

2468
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,920
I just think a lot of people are jumping to conclusions.

2469
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:45,000
Ronma also said Darkwing Duck and the Avengers Disney fund it.

2470
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,680
And act up says the Incredibles versus Fantastic Four.

2471
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:49,920
Oh this is the best salacious pop.

2472
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:53,400
I'd be on board for a Deadpool Hannah Montana crossover.

2473
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,600
See I would totally be down for that.

2474
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:56,600
Come on.

2475
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:58,480
Come on.

2476
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:00,200
Not happening.

2477
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,520
I would be so down for that.

2478
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:05,880
Although hey the Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters is kind of a neat idea.

2479
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:07,280
It's just not going to happen right away.

2480
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:11,400
Well hell we don't even know when Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to happen if anytime soon.

2481
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:17,320
So Ronma says Rob Roberts yeah but Disney already pulled the old budget cuts on one

2482
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:19,160
of their publishing arms.

2483
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:23,240
Well I hate to say it but that's kind of what happens sometimes when you know the businesses

2484
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:24,240
consolidate.

2485
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,200
But I don't know we'll see.

2486
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:29,280
We'll see if the creativity is stifled at all.

2487
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,680
I just I just think a lot of people are doom and glooming a little early.

2488
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:33,680
We'll see.

2489
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:36,280
Anyhow let's get into the FUs of the week.

2490
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:40,320
It's a segment here on the show where we get a little ranty a little angsty.

2491
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:43,120
We have some sand in places that we need to have removed.

2492
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,040
So we do a little ranting here on the show.

2493
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,640
It's something it's tradition we've done ever since episode one.

2494
02:18:47,640 --> 02:19:02,880
Don't ask just rant.

2495
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:05,160
We don't really have anything to inspire the FUs tonight.

2496
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:09,360
I don't have a story but what about that guy that said that video games were poison or

2497
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:10,360
whatever.

2498
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:11,680
We'll dedicate the FUs tonight to him.

2499
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,680
The Gundam guy.

2500
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:14,680
I had something actually.

2501
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,680
Go for it.

2502
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,680
Already.

2503
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:24,760
You know they're supposed to be doing Obama's speech in public schools on the 8th.

2504
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:27,600
I don't know how I feel about this whole political but okay go for it.

2505
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:31,360
Well it's really it's an encouragement to stay in school.

2506
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:32,360
That's what it is.

2507
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:35,120
I think it's great that you know that this is going out.

2508
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,640
It's a sign that you know our president does care about children instead of you know Bush

2509
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:44,840
going how do you read.

2510
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:51,320
But at the same time what really pisses me off are all those people who say oh well this

2511
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:56,080
is going to interrupt my kids school day so I'm going to not let them go to school that

2512
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:59,120
day.

2513
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,120
That makes no sense.

2514
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,960
It makes makes my brain go what.

2515
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:05,960
Why what.

2516
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:09,520
You know especially when all the schools are making arrangements for children who don't

2517
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:17,920
want for parents who don't want their children to see the the the speech that the schools

2518
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:21,760
are making arrangements for children who aren't going to be allowed to see it.

2519
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:28,860
So I mean if you don't want to interrupt their education then why are you interrupting a

2520
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:34,640
full day of education as opposed to seven hours of education I mean that that makes

2521
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,120
no sense to me.

2522
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:39,940
You people make no sense.

2523
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:44,880
My whole thing with the people just need to stop thinking in one extreme or the other.

2524
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:49,000
I bet you when all is said and done nobody is blue and nobody is red everybody's a little

2525
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,600
bit purple and just I'm the whole like taking kids out of school as some type of political

2526
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:57,200
statement or whatever is just too extreme.

2527
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:02,480
They're saying that they're doing it not so that their education isn't interrupted but

2528
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:05,440
they're interrupting their children's education that day.

2529
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:09,400
It's just you need to have a better argument just come right out and say I'm a fucking

2530
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:15,960
racist or I you know my brain's too thick and my children I don't want them to have

2531
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:17,020
an open mind.

2532
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:19,840
Why not encourage disagreeing with the president.

2533
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:20,840
That's what this company is.

2534
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,640
If you disagree with the speech encourage your children to watch the speech let your

2535
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:30,080
children watch the speech and then talk about it you know be a fucking parent.

2536
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:34,120
You know part of being a parent yeah true you have to make sure that your child's not

2537
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:38,820
going to see anything harmful but at the same time you can't protect them from every damn

2538
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:41,680
little thing that you don't want them to see.

2539
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:46,360
That's what the real world is you know I've met people who've grown up sheltered and they're

2540
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:48,360
frightening people.

2541
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:55,640
I also think that these same people if it had been a different president would be calling

2542
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:58,880
the same acts that they are doing right now an American.

2543
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,880
You know what I mean?

2544
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:03,100
Like I just have a bad feeling there's a lot of hypocrites out there.

2545
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:05,840
So anyway let's get into the F.U.'s of the week.

2546
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:06,840
So Dark Sakura.

2547
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:07,840
That was my F.U.

2548
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:08,840
That was your F.U.

2549
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:09,840
All right there you go.

2550
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,160
I just thought it was my F.U.

2551
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:13,240
I thought that was the story that inspires the F.U.

2552
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:15,680
That inspired my F.U. and it was my F.U.

2553
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:16,680
Fair enough.

2554
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:21,680
Thank you Rockstar for getting rid of my modded Grand Theft Auto games and it's absolutely

2555
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:25,240
ruined the whole Grand Theft Auto experience to us.

2556
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:26,240
But you know what?

2557
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:29,960
I will find a way around it like I always do.

2558
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:32,600
I'm going to say something that's a total inside joke.

2559
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:35,760
There's maybe like two or three people that listening that would understand this.

2560
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:41,360
But I'm just going to give a big F.U. this week to exclamation points.

2561
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,880
That's all I'm going to say F.U.

2562
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,160
Exclamation points.

2563
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:50,920
Let's move on with a couple more gaming stories and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2564
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:56,680
Well people like making a lot of fan videos for different games and Makima is pretty popular.

2565
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:02,360
Well Naughty Dog has decided to show off what they've done to aid in that for Uncharted

2566
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,640
2.

2567
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:10,080
There's a lot of Makima tools available for you including the ability to actually green

2568
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:13,960
screen the backgrounds with your characters in there so you can actually edit different

2569
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,320
things in there.

2570
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:21,320
And also the ability to sync up your voice with the player's mouth movements so it actually

2571
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:23,400
makes it look like they're talking.

2572
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:28,480
And yeah it's really really cool.

2573
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:32,280
Apparently they do have an animation system I guess that's intelligent enough to turn

2574
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:38,760
your audio stream into lip syncing for the on screen characters.

2575
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:44,080
But I don't know I guess it's neat that they're offering all these things.

2576
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:48,720
I wonder if we will actually see a lot of Makima videos for this.

2577
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:52,480
That's kind of interesting when gaming companies kind of really embrace the whole Makima thing

2578
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:53,480
you know.

2579
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:54,480
Yeah.

2580
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:57,800
That's what I liked about this story was that you know they're really kind of showing that

2581
02:23:57,800 --> 02:24:02,040
off and you know leaving it to people's creativity to make whatever they're going to make.

2582
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:04,920
But it's really interesting how more and more gaming companies really embrace it.

2583
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:08,880
But you know I mean obviously a lot of that stuff is just free promotion for the game

2584
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:09,880
right.

2585
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:10,880
Yeah exactly.

2586
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:12,340
Well there you go.

2587
02:24:12,340 --> 02:24:15,840
One more story for you guys and then your phone calls.

2588
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:20,320
There is a company that will be making a brand new console.

2589
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:27,540
It's a company called Xtal Corporation or maybe Shtal Corporation I don't know X-T-A-L.

2590
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:31,640
Actually their full name is Silicon Xtal Corporation.

2591
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:35,880
They filed a trademark recently for the term sex box.

2592
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:41,040
That's right sex box because this company they're going to be making a video game system

2593
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:46,800
that only plays interactive adult only rated video game titles.

2594
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,320
Hell yes.

2595
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:53,960
By the way just so you know only about 20 adult only titles even exist right now.

2596
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:58,200
One of them being Grand Theft Auto 4 after the whole debacle of hot coffee.

2597
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:01,840
But most of them are just dumpy little PC games that happen to involve a lot of sex.

2598
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,840
You mean Sandra's?

2599
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,840
Yeah I'm sorry Sandra's.

2600
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,880
Yeah that's what I meant sorry.

2601
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:14,320
By the way as well as specializing in the adult only games the sex box will also give

2602
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:19,440
its owners access to adult only content and entertainment and all sorts of other digital

2603
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:20,440
forms.

2604
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:24,440
I'm assuming this means like streaming movies and video and all that.

2605
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:30,680
Video video HDTV DVD online gaming social networking webcams video on demand downloading

2606
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:38,760
movie rentals purchases etc etc etc everything but real fucking will be included on this

2607
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:39,760
sex box.

2608
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,140
Only because the technology doesn't exist yet.

2609
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:43,140
What do you think?

2610
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:44,880
Loki you seem to be a big advocate for the sex box.

2611
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,260
I mean is this something legit or is this TEEHEE?

2612
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:50,520
I think the way they're going to approach it is going to be TEEHEE.

2613
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:56,240
But I'm all about a system that will allow publishers assuming that they actually want

2614
02:25:56,240 --> 02:26:01,360
to put out stuff on this system the opportunity to put out games uncensored.

2615
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:04,000
And yes we're probably going to see a lot of porno games that are probably going to

2616
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,220
be crap but at the same time if they want to release a really fucking crazy version

2617
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:11,160
of Manhunt 2 or something like that they can do it.

2618
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:16,000
And you know I applaud that but at the same time I think it's going to be kind of lame.

2619
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,740
However that being said assuming that the games on there look pretty decent I will probably

2620
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:27,480
pick one of these up because it will be funny I can go hee hee I have a sex box.

2621
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:34,680
You know what I'm all for I've gotten into this rant a long long time ago on this show

2622
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:40,360
I'm all for sexier video games and all this and just downloading porn on your Playstation

2623
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:41,360
3 and Xbox.

2624
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:44,240
I understand why the companies don't want to open Pandora's box and that whole thing

2625
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,880
but why not?

2626
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:50,720
I mean it's just because we have this whole stigma in our society where the violence is

2627
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:56,480
okay Manhunt 2 is okay in a lot of these games and the Saw movies are fine but heaven

2628
02:26:56,480 --> 02:27:02,640
forbid we show a cock or some bush and I'm not talking about a president on the television

2629
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:05,400
you know it's just I'll never get it.

2630
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:09,840
But granted how can you make a serious game out of sex?

2631
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:14,080
I mean a lot of these AO games we've seen like the what the three feel and stuff those

2632
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:15,720
were all a little silly.

2633
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:19,360
Well they are a little silly but also some of the games do get an AO rating it's really

2634
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:24,000
silly what they're getting it for and I would be fine to see legitimate games and just maybe

2635
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,280
push they just you know push the boundaries a bit but at the same time I think a lot of

2636
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:32,400
it's just gonna be like hey look now that we can do adult only content let's just put

2637
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:36,960
boobs and tits everywhere and you know just like make lots of fucking everywhere and that's

2638
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:40,800
it it's gonna be kind of gimmicky.

2639
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:46,200
I hope they put some real time and investment into making like a serious game out of it

2640
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:50,160
to just really wow everybody instead of all these cheap games that just have titties and

2641
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:53,760
stuff like make like an epic fuck quest or something like that.

2642
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:58,840
Not necessarily you know with you know sex but like over the top violence you know something

2643
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:03,520
like absolutely crazy where you can just rip parts off of people and it's you know gruesomely

2644
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,360
detailed and stuff like that.

2645
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:08,560
I don't want violence I want cock and titty.

2646
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:10,400
I like violence.

2647
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,920
I like I want violence.

2648
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:17,080
Fine you'll play a cock and a titty that goes around ripping you know limbs off of people

2649
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:21,440
there you go or deke man in chat says rip parts off of people and fuck them with it

2650
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:27,980
you know you're dirty make what is wrong with you a game called naked slayer huh naked slayer

2651
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:32,480
you can play slayer you can play either a guy or girl you can choose you know whatever

2652
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:38,000
their orientation is and they run around naked killing people that's like American Psycho

2653
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,960
pretty much that's like seeing through a two or just golden golden axe was almost there

2654
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:48,840
I mean those costumes golden axe didn't leave much to the imagination you know so um salacious

2655
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:52,400
pop and chat says apparently they're still making leisure suit Larry games though Sierra

2656
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:55,560
and the dude who originally made them have nothing to do with that and they're terrible

2657
02:28:55,560 --> 02:29:00,800
that's true uh in fact that last one was had an AO rated version and it was pretty bad

2658
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,920
and they are making still a new one there's a new one right they have that magna cum laude

2659
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,640
or whatever that was a little stupid and they have a new one coming out right I think I

2660
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:11,520
remember hearing a story on that earlier they had a new one that came out a while ago that

2661
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:21,120
was kind of eh I like that idea by salacious pop uh professor Layton goes to boner town

2662
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:27,680
professor Layton Layton that's funny um you know the whole the whole social networking

2663
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,800
thing though could be interesting I mean a lot of people really unleash their sexuality

2664
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:37,940
when they're hiding behind a computer monitor and you might be able to find people that

2665
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:42,320
are into the same freaky shit you might be into like for example let me think of a fetish

2666
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:45,880
that not a lot of people are into that's not completely disgusting there's actually you

2667
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:52,720
can actually um quote Patton Oswald on that huh talking about there's a magazine for that

2668
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:56,040
you know for every fetish that you think is so dirty and awful there's a magazine about

2669
02:29:56,040 --> 02:30:02,240
it yeah piss drinkers oh god although I'm sure there's people into that so whatever

2670
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:05,800
but I'm saying that that's like the perfect the perfect uh so that just reminded me I'm

2671
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:09,160
trying to think of something that's not just like totally disgusting that I can use my

2672
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:15,720
example okay here's one some people have a food fight fetish okay they want to have sex

2673
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:20,600
after a food fight like getting like really dirty like just rubbing around and like yeah

2674
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:24,920
I don't know like pies and and salads and stuff I don't know like we're gonna have a

2675
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:30,480
food fight and then we're no one has a salad I've heard about this on the radio it's true

2676
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:33,800
but here's the thing like if you have a food fight fetish or whatever like you could go

2677
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:39,240
on to this like sex box console find somebody else with the same fetish as you and then

2678
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:46,540
have some safe fun together that what's wrong with that as long as these consoles preach

2679
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:52,420
safety and you know not things that are illegal like ripping parts off of dead people and

2680
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:58,200
fucking them with them that's not legal but as long as this encourages save money legal

2681
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:03,080
things within boundaries with consenting adults that have to prove that they are adults in

2682
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:12,860
order to even be able to log into this service why not why not all right Leo Shannon chat

2687
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:46,980
consequence of sex that's why you shower afterwards I don't know I'm just trying to think of something

2688
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:51,800
that's not like drinking pee like Jamie suggested that's a bit much but if you're if that's

what you're into and both people consent then and your doctor says it's okay then have fun

some key kooka right now just like uh had my first lighter my first heart cider um but

2707
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:42,720
yeah i've just like been keeping up on what's been going on in packs especially the fact

2708
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:47,620
that one of the one of the guys in xbox live you know had at the little quote unquote sermon

2709
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:52,700
about the band hammer i actually caught on kataku earlier today i did not hear about

2710
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:58,040
this tell us a little bit about it huh i didn't hear about this whole spiel what happened

2711
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:02,640
there tell us a little bit about what happened i think it was basically one of the guys who

2712
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:07,020
worked for microsoft or xbox live and his charter but maintaining order within there

2713
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:16,020
and, you know, the one that wields a ban hammer, and he was basically just, basically, you know, giving a speech in the form of an actual, like, religious sermon,

2714
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:27,020
and the way he was using, like, a lot of religious terms in terms of how he managed to wield the, you know, in other words, like, the name, like, the gamer tags,

2715
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:39,020
and how, you know, they get banned, and then he's saying, like, but this guy is merciful, even though, you know, and he'll give you a second chance if you use any ban term in your gamer tag.

2716
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:46,020
And then the other one, and then this other thing, hold on a sec, I already did it.

2717
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:47,020
Oh, sure, we can hold.

2718
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:59,020
But, yeah, he was basically saying stuff about, like, the, like, in Battlefield, where they were just, like, trying to, he was just preaching about how they were kicking certain other players.

2719
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:01,020
It was basically some really, really religious stuff in PAX.

2720
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:09,020
You know, PAX does manage to get some pretty kick-ass speeches, usually, and that is one thing I'm sad about missing in PAX this year.

2721
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:10,020
All right.

2722
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:13,020
All right, you gotta go, Zaku? You gotta get your hook on?

2723
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:14,020
No, no, I'm still here.

2724
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,020
Oh, okay.

2725
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:19,020
No, no, I'm still here. I think we're about to head out, but I'm actually still good for talking.

2726
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:23,020
All right, well, give us any final thoughts, quickly, because we do want to get some other calls.

2727
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:34,020
Well, basically, I heard that the new WiiWare game, that Contra game, is, like, supposed to be really hard to tell, that you can't even, that you can't even get through.

2728
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:40,020
I know it was already out in Japan earlier this year, but I figured that it might present a challenge to folks.

2729
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:42,020
The original Contra was hard as hell.

2730
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:46,020
Do you know anybody that can beat it without the up, up, down, down, left, right code?

2731
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:47,020
Dan can.

2732
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,020
Dan's a freak.

2733
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:54,020
Basically, the way, I mean, from what I've seen, it's pretty much, it's a hard, I mean, it's pretty damn hard.

2734
02:35:54,020 --> 02:36:03,020
I mean, if you're going to be chugging away lives on Contra and the fact that it's, like, old-school classic Contra where you just, like, get your ass kicked after the first seconds without the code.

2735
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:16,020
I mean, I'm already, I'm already talking right now with this other guy who's, like, really good in, like, you know, really deep in games and the fact that he managed to get Contra evolved a lot earlier than most of us did.

2736
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:18,020
He got the Japanese version.

2737
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:26,020
But even then, he's just, he's just chugging it off because he's, you know, he's pretty much a classic gamer in that sense.

2738
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:30,020
So a challenge like that wouldn't be, it would be a no-brainer.

2739
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:34,020
Weird that they haven't released that over here in the U.S. yet, though, but I guess soon enough.

2740
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:40,020
I know, it's supposed to come out, actually, it's supposed to come out tomorrow, but it only came out in Europe.

2741
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:44,020
I hope they dumbed it down for us Americans like they usually do.

2742
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:45,020
What?

2743
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:50,020
I said I hope they dumbed it down for the Americans like they usually do then and give us the 30 last words.

2744
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:56,020
I heard the folks at Kotaku were complaining about the fact that it was, that it was pretty damn hard.

2745
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:57,020
All right.

2746
02:36:57,020 --> 02:37:00,020
Well, Zaku, we gotta let you go. Have fun at the hookah bar.

2747
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:01,020
All right.

2748
02:37:01,020 --> 02:37:03,020
Smoke one for us, all right?

2749
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:06,020
Yes, I will. Have a good one. Have a good liberty.

2750
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:07,020
All right.

2751
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:12,020
See, you know what's interesting is I always tease Zaku for sounding like a stoner even though I don't really think he is.

2752
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:14,020
I think he's told me like he's not.

2753
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:18,020
But he actually, didn't he sound like really upbeat and happy tonight?

2754
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:21,020
Like he didn't sound like so stoned calling us from the hookah bar.

2755
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:22,020
I'm not surprised.

2756
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:23,020
He sounded really happy and upbeat tonight.

2757
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:25,020
Because he's at a hookah bar.

2758
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:26,020
That's right. He's smoking up.

2759
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:28,020
Light another one, dude.

2760
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:32,020
Hookah bar does not get you high raw.

2761
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:33,020
No, I know it doesn't.

2762
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:35,020
However, it's really fun to blow smoke bubbles.

2763
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:37,020
I know. I had hookah once.

2764
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:40,020
Anyway, so back to the Data East collection here.

2765
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:42,020
Some of the games are going to be included with it.

2766
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:52,020
Magical Drop 3, Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, Burger Time, Caveman Ninja, Street Slam, and Secret Agent.

2767
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:54,020
Too many ninjas as if there was such a thing.

2768
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:55,020
Yeah.

2769
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:59,020
So, I don't know. It's pretty awesome.

2770
02:37:59,020 --> 02:38:01,020
Alright, let's go to another call.

2771
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:03,020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2772
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:06,020
Hey, I'm DS Master 25.

2773
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:09,020
Hi, DS Master 25. What is on your mind?

2774
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:13,020
Oh, I'm 26 because I aged.

2775
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:15,020
But, oh well.

2776
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:22,020
Basically, the whole, I've been playing a whole lot of old school titles.

2777
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:23,020
Like what?

2778
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:24,020
For the past few weeks now.

2779
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:33,020
I've been trying my best at trying to beat Contra for the Super C.

2780
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,020
For the Super NES.

2781
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:38,020
And, I swear to you.

2782
02:38:38,020 --> 02:38:39,020
Hold on.

2783
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:40,020
Hold on.

2784
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:43,020
What is with all the Contra revival tonight?

2785
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:45,020
Like, that's two Contra calls in a row.

2786
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:47,020
That is some strange anomaly.

2787
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:48,020
It's a rite of passage, Rob.

2788
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:49,020
I don't understand.

2789
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:52,020
For the life of any young gamer, the rite of passage is making it through Contra.

2790
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:56,020
Don't get me wrong. Super C on the Super Nintendo was badass.

2791
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:59,020
And, everybody should play it once. Those Mode 7 stages were pretty awesome.

2792
02:38:59,020 --> 02:39:03,020
But, I just find it very strange. We've had two calls about Contra back to back.

2793
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:06,020
Is every caller going to ask about Contra tonight?

2794
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:07,020
No, I don't know.

2795
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:09,020
It's not just Contra I've been playing.

2796
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:20,020
But, also, this homebrew version of DDR for the Nintendo DS I came across called DS DS Revolution.

2797
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:23,020
Well, I would hope you don't dance on your DS. You might break it.

2798
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:26,020
No, it's like...

2799
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:30,020
Did you guys ever come across, like, the old Game Boy?

2800
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:35,020
Yeah, I played the Game Boy Color ones. They were hideous.

2801
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:39,020
It was just a way to memorize step charts on the go. That's really the only reason I have it.

2802
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:42,020
Well, basically, okay.

2803
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:49,020
The controls came to do multiple arrows and everything with using A and B for the up and right arrows.

2804
02:39:49,020 --> 02:39:56,020
Apparently, DS DS Revolution seems to do the same exact thing, which is weird.

2805
02:39:56,020 --> 02:40:02,020
And, of course, I got the new R4i so I can play my homebrew stuff on my DSi.

2806
02:40:02,020 --> 02:40:08,020
And, I'll say here, it sounds a whole lot better than it did on my DS Lite.

2807
02:40:08,020 --> 02:40:16,020
But, other than that, I've mostly been trying to play some of my old Genesis games.

2808
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:20,020
My Genesis doesn't work anymore. Which sucks.

2809
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:22,020
What was that on Genesis?

2810
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:26,020
My Genesis does not work anymore. Period.

2811
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:33,020
Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, get that freaking collection on the 360 or PS3. It's amazing. There's, like, tons of games on it.

2812
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:42,020
No, but here's the cool thing, though. Because I found a really easy to use, easy to install emulator for the Nintendo DS,

2813
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:48,020
I've been using that now. Because I also had the thought of trying to play Genesis games on the go.

2814
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:57,020
And most of my collection was as follows. Outrun, King of Fighters, I had Monopoly, but the emulator does not run.

2815
02:40:57,020 --> 02:41:04,020
Look, I'm just saying, if you want to do it legitimately, the Mega collection's not a bad deal. But anyway, sorry.

2816
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:15,020
Yeah, I mean, it, you know, even though, like, you know, granted, I'm 17, you know, and I was never around when these games originally came out,

2817
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:21,020
but I'm like, you know, it's great every once in a while to, you know, have an old school jig every once in a while.

2818
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:28,020
Wait, wait, wait. I have a very important question. You said at the top, you introduced yourself as DS Master 25,

2819
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:34,020
and then said, no, wait, I'm DS Master 26 because I age. And now you just said you're 17. I'm totally lost.

2820
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:36,020
How old are you?

2821
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:39,020
Well, I'm 17.

2822
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:42,020
Okay, so where's the 26 come from?

2823
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:48,020
Well, because all the DS Master tells are taken up, and 25 is the only one available at the time.

2824
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:54,020
So it took that, and so now it's 26.

2825
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:58,020
Okay. All right, I had, no, this was important.

2826
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,020
No, it wasn't.

2827
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:01,020
This is very important.

2828
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:12,020
Oh, and plus I have a review for a bit on a new DS, well, semi-new DS title that I came across, Chinatown Wars.

2829
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:15,020
All right, make it quick, because we gotta get some more calls.

2830
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:24,020
Basically, I gotta say here, it looks exactly like the old PlayStation 1 GTA renditions.

2831
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:28,020
It actually runs quite well on the DS.

2832
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:37,020
And then another quickie, which I give that one a five stars, and then my last quickie review, Quake Live.

2833
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:46,020
Recommended, you have a pretty decent hardware, because I got, it was getting a little bit shaky when there was multiple explosions on the screen.

2834
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:56,020
And don't try to play with a trackpad mouse on a laptop, because I'll tell you this, this says murder on my hands beyond belief.

2835
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:57,020
Yeah.

2836
02:42:57,020 --> 02:43:08,020
I had my index finger and all the rest of my fingers up to the WSAD keys, my thumb all the way stretched down to the left mouse button to shoot, and used my right hand to try to aim.

2837
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:11,020
I definitely don't play Quake Live on the netbook.

2838
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:15,020
All right, DS Master, thanks so much for the call. Take care, buddy.

2839
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:16,020
Peace out.

2840
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:18,020
Later.

2841
02:43:18,020 --> 02:43:23,020
Well, you see, DS Master 1 through 24 was taken, so I just went for 25.

2842
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:27,020
I'll have you know that someone linked me in chat to a listing on eBay.

2843
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:37,020
Yes, for $235 plus shipping, we can own our own edible image, edible ink cake printer that will allow us to print emails and eat them.

2844
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:41,020
For $235, that's not bad. I'm thinking about it. That would be good.

2845
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:44,020
I do have a challenge, though, on a future show.

2846
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:48,020
I would like to hear from DS Masters 1 through 23 at some point.

2847
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:52,020
I just want to know where they are, 1 through 24.

2848
02:43:52,020 --> 02:44:00,020
I would love to hear from DS Master 2 or someone with a lot of seniority in the DS Master chain.

2849
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:07,020
1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to hear your voice on our lovely radio program, Orange Lounge Radio.

2850
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:09,020
I mean, while distracting Rob.

2851
02:44:09,020 --> 02:44:11,020
Oh, with people of Walmart.com?

2852
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:12,020
With people of Walmart.com.

2853
02:44:12,020 --> 02:44:15,020
That site is hilarious, but I'm just worried it's going to get old in a month.

2854
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:17,020
Just look at the fail.

2855
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:19,020
It's pretty funny.

2856
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:23,020
Our phone's not ringing. I guess we're not getting any other calls.

2857
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:27,020
We sometimes have a quick delay, so I'll give it another moment for calls.

2858
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:29,020
One more story, Logan?

2859
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:35,020
Crazy Kart Racing comes to the iPhone App Store, apparently, last week.

2860
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:43,020
For $8, it's a Konami racing game featuring a cool roster of characters, including Pyramid Head, Robby the Rabbit,

2861
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:51,020
and, of course, characters from Rumble Roses, Frogger, Goemon.

2862
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:59,020
They even have Taco from Parodius, it looks like.

2863
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:01,020
So that's interesting.

2864
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:03,020
They even have Pyramid Head in the shot. It's kind of funny.

2865
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:05,020
Phone's ringing.

2866
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:08,020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2867
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:10,020
Hi, this is Spazinator.

2868
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:12,020
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind?

2869
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:15,020
Oh, you know, a couple things.

2870
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:25,020
Yeah, I just got one of your little stories about an adults-only console that's about to come out.

2871
02:45:25,020 --> 02:45:28,020
And what are your thoughts on the adults-only console?

2872
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:40,020
It's kind of Fe. I would have to get some more information about it before I fully form an opinion one way or the other.

2873
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:51,020
But at least for the moment, the question is, even though the game's going to be adults-only, are they going to be actually any good?

2874
02:45:51,020 --> 02:46:01,020
I mean, you can always draw a parallel to a lot of the mature titles that came out at least last generation.

2875
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:14,020
Like, for example, if you want to compare them to, like, the Grand Theft Auto games to, like, BMX Triple X or the Rumble Roll.

2876
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:20,020
BMX Triple X was awesome. Awesomely bad, but in a so-bad-it-was-good kind of way.

2877
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:22,020
You could carry a hose around on your bike.

2878
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:31,020
I got to derail this conversation for a minute, Spazinator, because I have a topic I need to hear about from you, because we just had DS Master on the show talking about where his name comes from.

2879
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:34,020
I need to know where Spazinator comes from.

2880
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:41,020
It's kind of a weird story. I assume you're familiar with the American pie movies, right?

2881
02:46:41,020 --> 02:46:43,020
Yes.

2882
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:51,020
Yeah, you know how there's a character on here that goes by the name of the Shervenator?

2883
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:52,020
Yes.

2884
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:59,020
Well, when I mean Spazinator, this is back in the PS2 days.

2885
02:46:59,020 --> 02:47:13,020
I literally just got down watching the first American pie movie, and I also had those kinds of network adapters and SoCon 2.

2886
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:23,020
I went to create a screen name, and I thought, there's a Shervenator. I like the American pie movies.

2887
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:32,020
I changed the name up a little bit, and the first thing I paid the money was Spazinator.

2888
02:47:32,020 --> 02:47:46,020
Eventually, the name kind of stuck. I started using the screen name on all the games. It's just really a little consistent, so it kind of stuck.

2889
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:51,020
I'm so glad I asked. Okay, that's cool.

2890
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:58,020
What else do I want to ask you about? I don't know. Tell us one more thing that's on your mind, and then we're going to take another call.

2891
02:47:58,020 --> 02:48:11,020
Yeah, right at the top of the show, F.B. got off the pole with Bobby. You mentioned during your gaming week that you picked up the pinball game.

2892
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:13,020
Yes.

2893
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:24,020
Yeah, I actually just got there a couple days ago, and by looking at it, I figured out what table it's on, and I actually beat one of your scores so far.

2894
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:30,020
Well, I haven't played it enough, so give me a little credit. I barely, barely touched the game yet.

2895
02:48:30,020 --> 02:48:36,020
All right, Spazinator, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much. Take care, okay?

2896
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:37,020
All right, have a good one.

2897
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:40,020
Later.

2898
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:45,020
Excuse me. What's wrong? You all right over there?

2899
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:46,020
I'm crying for other reasons.

2900
02:48:46,020 --> 02:48:49,020
Why? Did a Sim die on you or something?

2901
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:50,020
No.

2902
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:53,020
Okay. Did a part of your soul die?

2903
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:55,020
She's playing Sims 3.

2904
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:58,020
Part of my soul died just in the last...

2905
02:48:58,020 --> 02:49:05,020
1877 Game O.L.R., if you'd like to give us a call, or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype.

2906
02:49:05,020 --> 02:49:09,020
Loki, did you have some more last minute stories? Oh, never mind. We're getting another call. Let's take the call.

2907
02:49:09,020 --> 02:49:12,020
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

2908
02:49:12,020 --> 02:49:14,020
This is Deathwishing.

2909
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:15,020
Woohoo!

2910
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:16,020
Hi, Deathwishing. Hey.

2911
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:19,020
I'm sorry I tore apart your grammar earlier.

2912
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:23,020
You got to talk loud so I can barely hear you.

2913
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:27,020
Okay, I will talk loud.

2914
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:35,020
Deathwishing, I don't care why you called tonight. I have a question for you.

2915
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:36,020
About my name?

2916
02:49:36,020 --> 02:49:41,020
Yes, where does your name come from? I must know.

2917
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:45,020
Counter-Strike.

2918
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:49,020
Actually, I died a lot.

2919
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:54,020
Why can't everybody have a story like that?

2920
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:57,020
Where did your name come from? You're a mom.

2921
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:04,020
Alright, fine. Since your story was so short, what did you want to call in about tonight?

2922
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:20,020
My name is Deathwishing, the sex box. It's kind of stupid in a way. One, it's kind of a rip-off of Internet meme name stuff. Do we really need a porn game console?

2923
02:50:20,020 --> 02:50:25,020
It's not a lolcat console. It's not a Two Girls One Cup console.

2924
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:31,020
It probably has a lolcat fetish, so it probably will be a lolcat console.

2925
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:39,020
There's something I hadn't thought of. Would you be interested in meeting people on the Internet with a lolcat fetish, Deathwishing?

2926
02:50:39,020 --> 02:50:42,020
No, I have a girlfriend, so I don't mean it.

2927
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:48,020
I can has fucking? Is there any lolcat cosplay is what I want to know?

2928
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:56,020
I should do that. I'll just walk around in cat ears with a sign that says, I can has, and then insert random items.

2929
02:50:56,020 --> 02:50:57,020
It has to have been done.

2930
02:50:57,020 --> 02:50:59,020
Yes, it has been done.

2931
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:00,020
I'm sorry.

2932
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:04,020
We had someone go around as a lolcat.

2933
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:07,020
Yes, your thoughts on the sex box, sir?

2934
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:12,020
You guys were following PAX coverage, right?

2935
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:15,020
Yeah, a little bit. We had Bobby calling in from PAX.

2936
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:22,020
Well, apparently there's Street Fighter 6 they have for sale there, like limited edition for PAX only.

2937
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:23,020
That's pretty cool.

2938
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:24,020
Yeah, the girl one.

2939
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:25,020
Nice.

2940
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:29,020
And, well, you gave one away for free.

2941
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:30,020
Lucky.

2942
02:51:30,020 --> 02:51:33,020
Oh, they didn't get a thousand viewers.

2943
02:51:33,020 --> 02:51:40,020
Oh, yeah, I heard something like some people were streaming it live on the Internet, like all of PAX.

2944
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:44,020
And they did give one away, or they didn't?

2945
02:51:44,020 --> 02:51:49,020
I'm not sure they might have. All I know is they gave away a lot of swag and stuff.

2946
02:51:49,020 --> 02:51:54,020
But they would only give it away if they got a thousand viewers, you said?

2947
02:51:54,020 --> 02:51:59,020
You know, they'd try to give it away anyway. I mean, the guy they heard about, they just went and bought two.

2948
02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:02,020
Because, I don't know, for some reason I thought for a minute about those whole, like,

2949
02:52:02,020 --> 02:52:06,020
we're only going to give something away when we get so many followers on Twitter or something like that.

2950
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:11,020
Like, I hate those contests because obviously it's just a complete attention-horror grab, which, yeah, I understand that.

2951
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:18,020
But at the same time, aren't you disrespecting the listeners you do have or the viewers or followers you do have by saying, well...

2952
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:20,020
It's just a shameless promotion.

2953
02:52:20,020 --> 02:52:22,020
It is completely shameless.

2954
02:52:22,020 --> 02:52:26,020
Like, hey, you know what? We used to do Orange Laundrio for 12 people and loved it.

2955
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:31,020
And so I don't understand this whole, like, we're not going to pay attention to you until we get 500.

2956
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:33,020
I just think it's disrespectful to others.

2957
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:37,020
I'm sorry, that was a tangent you probably weren't intending on, but you got it.

2958
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:42,020
You know, I really think no one really even cared about the new track thing either.

2959
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:50,020
I think someone said they posted the link to it on Chan.com and nothing happened.

2960
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:57,020
I saw a user tell I was watching off to, like, from 197 to 200 and then went back down lower than before.

2961
02:52:57,020 --> 02:52:59,020
Maybe everybody was at PAX.

2962
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:03,020
I don't know.

2963
02:53:03,020 --> 02:53:06,020
Death Wishing, is there a fight breaking out behind you?

2964
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:14,020
Well, there's these people playing some game called, oh, well, they stopped playing Hero of New Earth, which is kind of like Dota.

2965
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:16,020
And they're all playing Star Cry 2 now.

2966
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:17,020
Oh, okay.

2967
02:53:17,020 --> 02:53:22,020
Alright, we're going to let you go Death Wishing so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

2968
02:53:22,020 --> 02:53:23,020
Bye bye.

2969
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:24,020
Later.

2970
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:27,020
I'm now shutting off the Skype line.

2971
02:53:27,020 --> 02:53:29,020
That's it. No more calls tonight.

2972
02:53:29,020 --> 02:53:32,020
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

2973
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:35,020
Loki, did you have anything else for us before we close out shop tonight?

2974
02:53:35,020 --> 02:53:36,020
Yeah, real quick.

2975
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:39,020
The ESRB has rated more games coming to the PlayStation Network.

2976
02:53:39,020 --> 02:53:43,020
These are PlayStation 1 download titles, including Blood Omen, Legacy of Kain,

2977
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:50,020
Cool Borders 3, International Track and Field, Oddworld Ape's Exodus, and Oddworld Ape's Odyssey,

2978
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:54,020
Pandemonium, Syphon Filter 2, and Umjammer Lammy.

2979
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:56,020
Didn't some of those already come out this week?

2980
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:58,020
I thought I heard some of those came out this week.

2981
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:10,020
Um, well, Umjammer Lammy came out in Japan, and actually, Blood Omen and Pandemonium were rated before previously in March.

2982
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:13,020
I don't think any of them actually came out this week, though.

2983
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:17,020
But it's in need, I guess.

2984
02:54:17,020 --> 02:54:23,020
And we talked a little bit, I think, before about how Guitar Hero World Tour is going to have an option to,

2985
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:28,020
or Guitar Hero 5 is going to have an option to import some tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour.

2986
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:31,020
However, it's actually quite pathetic.

2987
02:54:31,020 --> 02:54:36,020
Only 35 of World Tour's 86 tracks are actually going to be available to import,

2988
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:40,020
and it's going to cost you $3.50 to do so.

2989
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:45,020
And also, Smash Hits is only going to have a few tracks to import as well.

2990
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:54,020
I believe they're going to have, oh, let's see here, 21 songs from Smash Hits available to import,

2991
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:58,020
with an undisclosed price on that one, and that's coming out later this fall.

2992
02:54:58,020 --> 02:55:03,020
But it's still pathetic, if you ask me, since Rock Band, you can import everything except for three tracks.

2993
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:07,020
Well, it depends what the songs are, too. Maybe they weren't willing to pony up the money, I don't know.

2994
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:09,020
Whatever.

2995
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:19,020
And then finally, apparently there's new versions of Bonk, Bomberman, and I think maybe some other games coming as well.

2996
02:55:19,020 --> 02:55:22,020
And these were discovered on Hudson's website.

2997
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:27,020
Apparently there's a Bonk update coming, a Bomberman live sequel,

2998
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:34,020
and a Wii and DS version of a game called Rooms the Main Building.

2999
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:38,020
And apparently the Bonk game's called Brink of Extinction.

3000
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:41,020
It's coming to WiiWare, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live.

3001
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:47,020
It's going to be a 2.5D action platformer game with online co-op.

3002
02:55:47,020 --> 02:55:50,020
And apparently Bonk's going to have eight different transformations.

3003
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:58,020
And also, it's supposed to be out spring 2010.

3004
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:02,020
And I guess Bomberman Live Battle Fest coming to all three consoles as well.

3005
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:05,020
And they've got new arenas, game types, and team play.

3006
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:13,020
And I guess Rooms the Main Building, that's supposed to be a Wii or DS retail title.

3007
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:15,020
Interesting.

3008
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:20,020
And I guess now Bonk and Bomberman have been officially announced by Hudson with screenshots.

3009
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:24,020
And it looks like Bonk and Bomberman.

3010
02:56:24,020 --> 02:56:27,020
So not much to report there.

3011
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:29,020
That's it.

3012
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:31,020
Alright.

3013
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:33,020
Sounds awesome.

3014
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:37,020
Bonk is one of those things that's a little better left in my memory, I think.

3015
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:39,020
But I don't know, if they soup it up a little bit it might be cool.

3016
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:48,020
It's going to be like a 3D remake of Hudson's Adventure Island and it was not very good, if I remember correctly.

3017
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:49,020
Alright.

3018
02:56:49,020 --> 02:56:53,020
Well, let's go ahead and start to wrap up and get the hell out of here for the night.

3019
02:56:53,020 --> 02:56:56,020
And in order to do that we need to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3020
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:58,020
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

3021
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:01,020
Frozen yogurt.

3022
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:03,020
My final thought is, sounds amazing.

3023
02:57:03,020 --> 02:57:07,020
And I thought this show would be shorter tonight, but it was actually kind of long tonight.

3024
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:08,020
Go figure.

3025
02:57:08,020 --> 02:57:11,020
Sometimes you just never know how long the show is going to go.

3026
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:12,020
Loki.

3027
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:14,020
So, I have a toy for my cat.

3028
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:18,020
It's a laser pointer, but the thing is the laser pointer is shaped like a cat.

3029
02:57:18,020 --> 02:57:22,020
So does that make it a laser cat?

3030
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:24,020
Possibly.

3031
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:26,020
Definitely.

3032
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:29,020
Because it is a cat that fires a laser, so.

3033
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:31,020
At least you don't have a laser cat fetish.

3034
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:34,020
And on that note, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into Orange Laundry Video.

3035
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:36,020
We really appreciate your support.

3036
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:40,020
Hey, if you like what you've heard, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the station.

3037
02:57:40,020 --> 02:57:43,020
Because you know what, we don't have a big magazine promoting us.

3038
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:45,020
We don't have zillions of followers on Twitter.

3039
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:49,020
And we're never going to have a contest that we'll only do if so many people follow us or what have you.

3040
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:51,020
You know, just help us get the word out.

3041
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:52,020
That's all we ask.

3042
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:53,020
However you can do it.

3043
02:57:53,020 --> 02:57:55,020
Through an iTunes review, through anything.

3044
02:57:55,020 --> 02:57:59,020
And we'll try to keep it free for you guys for another seven years, all right?

3045
02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:00,020
Have a good night everybody.

3046
02:58:00,020 --> 02:58:01,020
We'll see you next week.

3047
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:04,020
We will be back next week with even more of the latest and greatest in video gaming.

3048
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:09,020
And of course, we're starting to get to the start of that fourth quarter where we're just going to have games after games after games.

3049
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:15,020
So our reviews and yours sitting around talking smack about what we love, video games.

3050
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:16,020
I'm Rob Roberts.

3051
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:17,020
She's DarkSakura.

3052
02:58:17,020 --> 02:58:18,020
He's Loki.

3053
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:20,020
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3054
02:58:20,020 --> 02:58:23,020
