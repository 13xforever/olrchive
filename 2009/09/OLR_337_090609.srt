00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:23,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, September 6, 2009, a Once Pay We channel goes free, a new racing game will be integrating Twitter and we recap and talk about the news from PAX 2009.

2
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week here of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:42,104
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: We tape live every Sunday night at www.allgames.com.

5
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:50,467
[SPEAKER_04]: A big thanks to our friends at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

6
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:52,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with you for the next three hours.

7
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me, as always, for the past seven and a half years, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:00,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Nom, nom, nom.

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Nom, nom, nom.

11
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,350
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Nomming.

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, quickly, Orange Lounge Foodio, what are you nomming on tonight?

14
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:05,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Brains.

15
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:06,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

16
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:07,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Pizza.

17
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:07,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Pizza.

18
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,116
[SPEAKER_06]: With extra garlic.

19
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:12,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cheese pizza, but I added garlic to it because garlic makes everything better.

20
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It will keep the vampires away.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

22
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Loki.

23
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:18,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

24
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:20,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you look like you're listening to something else over there.

25
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to, but I hate these earbud headphones.

26
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:25,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Any hints?

27
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a cage match for later?

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I didn't pick anything.

29
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:29,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:29,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Per usual.

31
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:30,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

32
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's because you've never tuned in live before.

33
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:35,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a little special thing after the show.

34
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to tune in live sometime.

35
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:40,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping, because it's Labor Day, maybe we get some people listening live that haven't listened before.

36
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So a big hello to all of you that are new to...

37
00:01:44,622 --> 00:02:04,357
[SPEAKER_04]: us broadcasting live be sure to join our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com and we will read some comments from chat and comment from the Rob D in chat early this evening you know it's PAX weekend when Orange Lounge is talking old DDR and allgames.com is discussing condom reviews I guess the allgames chat is talking about condoms so

38
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to be mature.

39
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just... Please, my guy should be judging on that part.

40
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We're completely immature here on Orange Launch Radio.

41
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:18,364
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm glad that Rob D. brought up PAX because it is Penny Arcade Expo weekend.

42
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, the three of us could not go this year.

43
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:25,027
[SPEAKER_04]: We all went last year, but we kind of ate the money in the budget for E3.

44
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:29,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But our dear friend Bobby Blackwolf is live at the show.

45
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,631
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to call him right now and talk to him about Penny Arcade Expo.

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,594
[SPEAKER_04]: One ringy dingy dingy Ferret Exterminators Hi Bobby Hey Rob, what's up guys?

47
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:45,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much, how are you doing?

48
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:52,637
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Bobby Blackwolf, of course.

49
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to give you a proper introduction.

50
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:59,760
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the man who takes the Bobby Blackwolf show live at 5 o'clock, right before we are live.

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: He sadly was not live tonight, but he did have a sneak peek of the rock band Beatles that he got a little early from Harmonix.

52
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:07,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So props to you.

53
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:13,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, it's the Beatles Rock Band They are very strict on that

54
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:32,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I had fun, and I mean, I kind of did kind of what you guys did at E3.

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,326
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not do any appointments.

56
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not set any interviews.

57
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were able to just kind of go around and spend as much or as little time as we wanted.

58
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,293
[SPEAKER_08]: But for those of us who did go to E3, there's a lot here that was repeated and regurgitated.

59
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,155
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the same E3 builds, the E3 demos were here on the show floor.

60
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:52,496
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was nice to see...

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Regular folk get a chance at the same things that we saw a couple months ago.

62
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a lot of fun to see their reactions, see what they thought about it.

63
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see anything interesting to you that you did not see at E3?

64
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:02,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new things.

65
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of them I saw was Star Trek Online.

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,561
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I want the details on this.

68
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:37,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I played through one of their episodes, like they did any episode type of thing, where you start off in your ship and you kind of fly around and they say that you get a distress call.

69
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:41,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So you go and you fight some Klingon birds of prey in the ship combat.

70
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:45,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you beamed it down to the planet, which was kind of like the city on the edge of forever.

71
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Klingons are trying to take over the forever.

72
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you had to...

73
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:52,928
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

74
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:17,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

75
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and we'll be giving more details on that a little later on in the show.

76
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of our stories coming up a little later.

77
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question about Star Trek Online, was it fun?

78
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun, the little bit that they showed.

79
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,591
[SPEAKER_08]: But they even said that, you know, this was a very small episode.

80
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:36,512
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're basically doing is their missions are scheduled to be

81
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:41,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Trek writers.

82
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:50,310
[SPEAKER_08]: They were basically just showing the combat portion, but they said there's going to be puzzles and other things to do that aren't just fight, fight, fight.

83
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Here at PAX, they were just showing the fighting.

84
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,071
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

85
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:55,372
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of a nice little taste.

86
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:56,396
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

87
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:52,397
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was kind of interesting watching like going through the line of people and basically in Heavy Rain it reminds me a lot of Shenmue like I really didn't understand or get what Heavy Rain was but it's basically you know quick time action sequences along with tank driving in terms of moving your character but it's basically there's a gunpoint heist in a grocery store or serve a quickie mark and basically you can actually

88
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:22,198
[SPEAKER_08]: determine how it ends up and the guy before me actually convinced the guy to leave the store and I had to punch him in the face but it was very interesting mechanic and just interesting the way that it went down and it's not a game I haven't seen this kind of gameplay all that much in terms of a full game I've seen it in mini games like God of War and Shenmue and things like that but it's going to be kind of interesting to see how this game really turns out longer than a five minute demo

89
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:23,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

90
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're monitoring our chat room at chat.orangelonsradio.com.

91
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,334
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting some questions for you, Bobby.

92
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wants to know about Scribblenauts.

93
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go to the Scribblenauts panel?

94
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:32,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it there on the show floor?

95
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not go to the panel, but they were once again on the corner of the show floor where they belong, apparently.

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But they brought six kiosks, and the lines were long the entire time.

97
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

98
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:50,665
[SPEAKER_08]: But I actually did talk to them and even talked to some of the developers and said,

99
00:07:50,965 --> 00:08:17,895
[SPEAKER_08]: and for people who've listened to my show for a long time know that when I went to GDC in 2007 one of the student competition IGS winners I interviewed was a group that made a game called Toblo and during that interview I met up with the guy that I interviewed then and he said I was one of the three people that wanted to talk to them at GDC and they thought it was really cool and apparently I announced their first game, Drawn to Life

100
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:25,835
[SPEAKER_08]: because he had talked about it on our show, gave us a rundown well before they had even done any kind of formal announcements or anything like that.

101
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:30,498
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't get in trouble, but it was kind of neat to hear him talk about it and how he remembered me.

102
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of cool to talk to them.

103
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:42,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get to play one level, just getting one of the stars, but that was about all I could do because it was near the end of the show and the lines were just so long the entire show.

104
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, what a turnaround from E3 because we walked right up to the kiosk at E3, so apparently word of mouth is spreading.

105
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,326
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been very happy with all the coverage and surprised.

106
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:56,127
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't think they would get the kind of coverage that they got.

107
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:58,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they came a little bit more prepared this time.

108
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Like WB, their little booth, they were showing Fear 2 and Scribblenauts.

109
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:03,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

110
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:09,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had six Scribblenauts kiosks and two cave kiosks for Fear 2 or a Fear thing.

111
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why would they show Fear 2?

112
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been out forever now.

113
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:15,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it was a fear something.

114
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't look at it because Scribblenauts was next to it.

115
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was a new platform.

116
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a new expansion or something.

117
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby, what about other... Oh, go ahead.

118
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:33,698
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there were some games that were already out, like Metroid Prime, the trilogy, was in Nintendo's booth, and it's already out in stores, but they were bribing people with t-shirts if they came up and played it.

119
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,200
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some stuff that's already out.

120
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:37,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

121
00:09:53,871 --> 00:10:00,552
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because I was able to get into a lot of the parties, a lot of the company parties, so I didn't really do any panels or anything.

122
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:09,154
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, I'm very happy because I've been a fan of like Paul and Storm and Jonathan Colton for a long time, and you know they're coming to Rock Band this week.

123
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,174
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the PAX pack.

124
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've actually referenced Paul and Storm several times on the show.

125
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:17,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time I reference myself as an opening band, that's the song that's going to be in Rock Band too.

126
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:22,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, we're showcasing artists that people are going to know very soon.

127
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,421
[SPEAKER_04]: CCP People Are Freaky

128
00:10:43,472 --> 00:11:03,890
[SPEAKER_08]: that was probably the most hilarious one just because it's not my scene CCP bought White Wolf which is World of Darkness and they did usually at Dragon Con they do the Succubus Club which is at like this golf night club or whatever and you know just a lot of weird things happen from that scene I think we got an invite to something like that at E3 I saw pictures of that

129
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's probably pictures of it.

130
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:22,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we saw, like, when I was there, it was just, the comedy was great, where they had a guy doing, like, this whole routine with a lightsaber to techno music, and actually the techno music was actually going with, he was timing the lightsaber moves with the bass and stuff.

131
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:31,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, seeing people use iPhones as glow sticks because they didn't have their own, you know, I mean... They have an app for that.

132
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:33,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, yeah, the glow stick app's pretty funny.

133
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they weren't even doing that.

134
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:39,186
[SPEAKER_08]: They just had the screen on, the home screen on, and they were just waving them around.

135
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:39,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

136
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:40,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

137
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:50,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Bobby, before we let you go, because I know you want to get a flight and all that fun stuff, I want to know what was the best thing about PAX and what was the worst thing about PAX?

138
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The best thing about PAX is that it started, and the worst thing is that it ended.

139
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,440
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tricky response.

140
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,861
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it compare to E3 this year?

141
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can't really compare it to E3.

142
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, basically, I can actually compare PAX to last year.

143
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,846
[SPEAKER_08]: There were 70,000 people here.

144
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,847
[SPEAKER_08]: All the badges were sold out.

145
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,107
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend actually bought a badge.

146
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:17,628
[SPEAKER_08]: She thought she was coming out, and she didn't, and she wound up being able to sell it for $170.

147
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:20,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought it was going to be very crowded.

148
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:25,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I say I thought, but the difference between PAX with 70,000 people and, say, E3 2006 with 68,000 people is that PAX is spread out.

149
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:35,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all 70,000 people are trying to be on the expo hall at the same time.

150
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:41,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas at E3, pretty much you could say 60,000 of the 68,000 were all trying to be in the exhibit hall so you couldn't move around.

151
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:47,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than when they were throwing t-shirts and giving away raffles, I could still walk around just fine.

152
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:52,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the big games, I had to wait in line to play, but it was pretty manageable.

153
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't think that there were 70,000 people here this weekend.

154
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

155
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess a lot go for the live gaming events, too, and I bet those rooms take away quite a few people.

156
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:05,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think when they say 70,000, that's spread out through the three days.

157
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:14,248
[SPEAKER_04]: PAX sells a lot of individual day badges, too, and it's never really, I think, accounted for just how many they're selling of those Friday, Saturday, Sunday badges.

158
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, I mean, they have the numbers because the convention center actually let them sell 1,000 of the one-day passes for Saturday and Sunday at the last minute, and they were very surprised about that.

159
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:25,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

160
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:32,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, so people who did come up here hoping to get a badge were actually able to get badges at the last minute.

161
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:34,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that was really nice.

162
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,712
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically, the thing is, there's only two or three events at this convention center that

163
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,714
[SPEAKER_08]: that take up the entire center.

164
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:41,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually they double book.

165
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,175
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a Jewish convention last year.

166
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you ever remember that.

167
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:45,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do remember that.

168
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Way up on the sixth floor.

169
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:46,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

170
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:54,139
[SPEAKER_08]: PAX actually had the entire building this time and they're like one of two events in the entire year that actually need the entire building.

171
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's also why they're on Labor Day weekend because that's the only time they can schedule just one event.

172
00:13:58,601 --> 00:13:58,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

173
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Dead Redemption

174
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:29,591
[SPEAKER_08]: was Rockstar's big game that they were trying to show off here, and it's basically GTA meets Wild West.

175
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:30,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it looks awesome.

176
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:46,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you thought Liberty City was big, or not Liberty, yeah, Liberty City, if you thought GTA 4 was big, this one is huge, open world, it's basically GTA Wild West, and it actually looked really good from the demo they showed.

177
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:47,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So that shows that they can make a good demo.

178
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see, eventually.

179
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:53,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Split Seconds guys were there, people were playing Split Seconds,

180
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: and they say that's probably going to be in spring of 2010 or summer they say it's kind of been pushed back which means they have even more time to work on it from what we saw at E3 awesome well that was definitely one of the all stars at E3 so I'm hoping it got a lot of air time I guess you could say out there on the show floor sounds like a lot of fun stuff was DJ Hero playable there?

181
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:34,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Activision was not here Activision apparently did an invite only event Thursday night and that's when they showed off some stuff but I was not invited to that so I didn't get to go to that but no, Activision themselves were not physically here at the show this year

182
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Pax East, Pax West, Pax East

183
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:52,777
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

184
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:55,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And even, like, the enforcers don't know if they're working Pax East.

185
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I was talking to the media guy, because I want to start doing broadcasting again.

186
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:00,585
[SPEAKER_08]: They couldn't fit us in.

187
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:05,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the space that we were in last year for All Games Radio was taken up by other tables.

188
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:12,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, there was, like, tabletop gaming going on in that area, and that's why we couldn't have that area, and they didn't want to run the network all the way across.

189
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:13,539
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

190
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him, I'm like, are you the new guy that's running the media?

191
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,915
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I asked him, are you running the media at Boston?

192
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can go ahead and kind of start talking about that.

193
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:22,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, I don't know.

194
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

195
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, here's the thing that he did tell me is that TaxEase has been outsourced to another company.

196
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not the same people running it.

197
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:36,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that's going to change how it feels or not.

198
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:41,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, the guys that run tax are just a little bit too overwhelmed with this show.

199
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:50,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've kind of had to farm it out and outsource it to another company while still having the reins on it, but we don't know if it's going to be...

200
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:51,973
[SPEAKER_08]: The same as this.

201
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,194
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be kind of interesting.

202
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and I'll be up there too.

203
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:22,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So this Friday we're actually going to be running a show on my TV show, Friday Night Gaming.

204
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:25,726
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually going to be running one of the games that's here that comes out this week.

205
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've heard of Darkest of Days.

206
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a time-traveling first-person shooter.

207
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:35,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's actually by the same guys that make the Real Deal Casino game.

208
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:36,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looked funny.

209
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of funny.

210
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:39,990
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was cool.

211
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out on PC and 360, and we're going to be running it on fnglive.net this Friday.

212
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:45,755
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

213
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for interrupting your show flow to get me in.

214
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:15,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you.

215
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:16,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care.

216
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf, live on Orange Lounge Radio, everybody.

217
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,875
[SPEAKER_04]: He always gives us like five minutes on his show every week.

218
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We can give him 15 on our show tonight.

219
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:29,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of great... I had no idea that PAX East was being run by a different company.

220
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That's huge news, in my opinion.

221
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know if it's like huge news, but it's a huge interesting thing I didn't think about before.

222
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very interesting.

223
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,946
[SPEAKER_02]: That game Darkest of Days looks funny.

224
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically you can time travel to the past like the Civil War with giant weapons that you could totally hit everyone's ass with.

225
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:43,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

226
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It is intriguing, so I may have to try that.

227
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:46,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

228
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,474
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

229
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:48,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I shook my butt.

230
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:51,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Parapara First Mix and played a lot of 2DX Distorted.

231
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was that weird trippy-ass game that you told me?

232
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:53,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, play!

233
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,531
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Max Technica, the new arcade game.

234
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:20,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It was alright.

235
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really my thing.

236
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little too K-pop.

237
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:28,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was pretty.

238
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a good time playing it.

239
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,654
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just very K-pop.

240
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:31,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

241
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, wow, is this Andamiro?

242
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Dan played the new Hydro Thunder spiritual successor.

243
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:43,525
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it called?

244
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the name, but it was a big machine.

245
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:49,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Hydro something or Hydra something.

246
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a cool little game.

247
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:51,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

248
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:52,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big machine.

249
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:53,614
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's...

250
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was like, give me the card I want to play, give me the card I want to play, give me the card I want to play.

251
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and I played that punching bag game, which was stupid.

252
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:02,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was in the corner and I was bored.

253
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played lots of Sims 3.

254
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:12,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played some Ragnarok Online before I got completely just fed up.

255
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Fed up!

256
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a guilty admission.

257
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:17,741
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

258
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:23,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm downloading... Well, I downloaded... Shut up.

259
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:23,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Not an addict.

260
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't touched it in two years.

261
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:29,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my last date of playing was October in 2007.

262
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were you playing?

263
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet.

264
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:34,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to play... I'm just downloading World of Warcraft.

265
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

266
00:20:58,138 --> 00:20:59,219
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was alright.

267
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a love-hate relationship right now with Rockstar, unfortunately.

268
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the new trailer for The Battle of the Gay Tony.

269
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:13,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really making me excited for the next expansion they're going to have because it's now more over-the-top stuff.

270
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:16,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play more Grand Theft Auto this week.

271
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:26,736
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they did patch Grand Theft Auto so that we can't run our modded games anymore, which is very... We were completely depressed for the remainder of the week.

272
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:28,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolute crap.

273
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,183
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I am not letting that stop me, and I will get by this one way or another.

274
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll find a way around it eventually.

275
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:37,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already kind of working on a way, but...

276
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:49,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's kind of annoying, but I understand they did it for the greater good because there's assholes out there that like to ruin everybody's games by doing all these different cheat things and stuff and not exactly in the closed environments that we're playing in, but, hey, whatever.

277
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, though, it sucks that, you know, some people have to ruin it for everybody else.

278
00:21:53,802 --> 00:22:01,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I played, not that I got an early media copy, but I did get an early copy of The Beatles Rock Band.

279
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:12,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, you know, I think one of the things you gotta consider when you're planning on buying The Beatles Rock Band is you better damn well be a Beatles fan, because if you're not, then you're not gonna enjoy it too much.

280
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with The Beatles.

281
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate their music.

282
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I like some of their songs, but it kind of lost...

283
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:43,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's... So you're saying the presentation, as somebody who's not as into the Beatles, kind of the presentation and the new packaging of Rock Band kind of wore off on you really quick?

285
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:44,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

286
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:50,605
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't... It's not a bad game by any means, it's just, you know, for me, I can't see myself playing this for a long time.

287
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:51,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I could...

288
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,189
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

289
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

290
00:23:37,783 --> 00:24:04,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't sing either A lot of reviews, I guess the embargo or whatever was lifted the other day Because all of a sudden there was just a ton of reviews that all hit the internet at once And I'm seeing a lot of positive about the presentation The way it looks, the way that it really feels like the Beatles It's kind of interesting, you're one of the first negative things I've heard Not so much negative, but just the fact that as someone who's not as into the Beatles It wore off on me Interesting

291
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let me put it this way.

292
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:11,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be less satisfied with a Guitar Hero release that is basically just re-skinned.

293
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,494
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't put any effort into the presentation.

294
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love the intro to the game.

295
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

296
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:18,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really played much of the story.

297
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mainly been just the quick play stuff.

298
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

299
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:22,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

300
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:22,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

301
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:27,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, for me, I wasn't, you know, I don't, like, listen to Beatles music that much.

302
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:31,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize their songs, but I don't really, like, go seek out Beatles music.

303
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:33,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you one more question.

304
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:37,410
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were, let's say, imagine that you were, like, a hardcore Beatles fan.

305
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:45,554
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think this game would compare to other artists' solitary games, such as Guitar Hero Aerosmith or the ACDC expansion for Rock Band?

306
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this would be awesome.

307
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they totally nailed the Beatles and just the whole feel of the game and everything.

308
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:52,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

309
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:52,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I really dig that.

310
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:56,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, I'm not a huge fan of the Beatles.

311
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if they put that amount of effort into other artist games, yeah, then I would still be likely to check them out.

312
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because even though I'm not a big fan of the Beatles, I still bought a copy of it, you know, because it looked really cool.

313
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't think I wasted my money on it it's just I'm not going to enjoy it as much as Rock Band where if I don't like a track in it or whatever it doesn't really matter because I can just always get different artists and stuff later on whereas the Beatles stuff if I don't like the tracks in it I can't really buy more tracks because there's just more Beatles music

314
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

315
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:34,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly a lot of comments going on about the Beatles rock band.

316
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:41,839
[SPEAKER_04]: J-Rod in chat says, so because rock band Beatles has an opening cutscene, it's not a reskin version and, quote, better than the Guitar Hero Artist games.

317
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, my brain is raging so hard.

318
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's not forget, this is not the first rock band artist-dedicated game.

319
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:56,487
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an ACDC game that a lot of people forget came out last year that was, I mean, it was probably even worse than the Guitar Hero games, right?

320
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:58,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was something they did for Walmart.

321
00:25:58,689 --> 00:25:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a cash-in.

322
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Just straight-up cash-in.

323
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:11,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's not like they've always done perfect releases, but to, I guess, kind of defend it a little bit, what do you think makes this a step above

324
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Van Halen

325
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,001
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

326
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero, Metallica, Van Halen, etc.

327
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, true.

328
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be fair.

329
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true.

330
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:14,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Lego Rock Band is pretty much going to be the same thing.

331
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:21,920
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with Lego Rock Band, though, is it's also more like the other Telltale games where they have the little cut scenes there with the Lego characters and stuff.

332
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,343
[SPEAKER_02]: All the Lego games kind of feel the same as far as that.

333
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:27,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a little bit of different elements into there.

334
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:33,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's really not that much different than, say, Guitar Hero Van Halen or something like that.

335
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:40,277
[SPEAKER_02]: They have gone a little bit further in the presentation, but not enough to where I'm going to say it's amazing or anything.

336
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:41,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, I'm not feeling Lego Rock Band.

337
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:47,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I appreciate the Beatles, I'm all about Beatles Rock Band.

338
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:51,408
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the music games I'll probably buy this holiday season are the Beatles Rock Band and guitar.

339
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:51,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 5

340
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:14,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, I'm still more looking forward to rock band Beatles, you know, Beatles rock band myself.

341
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I am a fan.

342
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:24,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not as big a fan as some people I know, but, you know, I'm a pretty, I love it and I'm actually looking forward to the overall experience of it, you know.

343
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not feeling it with Lego.

344
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:29,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know enough about Band Hero.

345
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:33,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like Band Hero is going to be a little bit... Band Hero should have marching band.

346
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:38,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Band Hero is basically just the same thing as Lego Rock Band.

347
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:40,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically their E10 Plus game.

348
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a bunch of different artists.

349
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who they have pimping it out?

350
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out the last artist that they haven't announced yet.

351
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,159
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

352
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:47,679
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.

353
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:49,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5 Guitar Hero 5

354
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:21,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but, I don't know, like, I'm okay with the re-skinnings if the song lists are really, really good.

355
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:24,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like Band Hero might have a pretty good song list.

356
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

357
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:25,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

358
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

359
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:27,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

360
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough of the music game, blah blah blah.

361
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:30,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anything else in your gaming week, Loki?

362
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:31,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

363
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:34,955
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

364
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:58,407
[SPEAKER_02]: TheDanceManiacs manual first sent to me because I would like to know how to wire this thing up.

365
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,328
[SPEAKER_02]: DanceManiacs sensors come in top and bottom.

366
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:07,730
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom have two sensors, one on top, one on bottom, I think, or two on the bottom, maybe.

367
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But the top sensors only have one sensor.

368
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:17,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got two top sensors, unfortunately, and now I have to do something or create my own sensors or something.

369
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the guy that sold them to me and see if he has any bottom sensors, but...

370
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

371
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:41,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

372
00:30:54,873 --> 00:31:02,038
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a Guitar Hero No Doubt game, even if it was just a re-skinning or whatever, I'd probably buy it, because I really like No Doubt.

373
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought that whole album and rock band and everything.

374
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:05,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

375
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Call me a sucker, whatever.

376
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:13,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people, if their favorite band came out in whatever game, would feel the same way.

377
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I don't want to get into too much more talking about music games.

378
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:22,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you heard that Lego Rock Band, the rumor is that you're going to import those tracks into...

379
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:23,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band 2.

380
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:24,775
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

381
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's the case because I'm going to rent it.

382
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:27,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rent it.

383
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:29,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Import those tracks.

384
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on you.

385
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:31,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

386
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what I can.

387
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:33,904
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

388
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:37,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Seg is in chat and wants to correct Loki.

389
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Telltale Games does not make any of the Lego games.

390
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you botched the company name when you were talking about that.

391
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:44,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm thinking of... It's Traveler or something.

392
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Traveler's Tales.

393
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:46,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

394
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Traveler's Tales.

395
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:48,636
[SPEAKER_13]: It's T.T.

396
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Close, close, but very different.

397
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

398
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Traveler's Tales.

399
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:53,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

400
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, same initials.

401
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

402
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,642
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

403
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, at least we got that clarified.

404
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, My Gaming Week.

405
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Good lord, I played a lot of games this week, actually.

406
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about DJ Max Technica real quick, because I know DarkSakura was kind of eh about it, but I really enjoyed it.

407
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Elite Beat Agents, basically.

408
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:19,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if Elite Beat Agents were an arcade game, where you tap the screen with your finger to hit the buttons.

409
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:23,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what happens, you see a bar going across the top, and then it goes back down to the bottom.

410
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like running a track around the screen.

411
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as it passes these dots, you have to tap the dots to play the music.

412
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can drag your finger for some of them and some dots you have to hit over and over again to hit with the beat of the music I really like the way it was set up I had a really good time playing the game, the only problem I had with the game the music was completely uninspiring and not memorable to me and I know that's going to piss a lot of people off that I said that, some of the music game fans especially if you like the Korean pop, but I'm sorry it just was not, like I didn't wasn't able to distinguish one song from another that I was playing, like I can't put my finger on it, like

413
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:03,459
[SPEAKER_04]: 2DX just has such a variety and such cool songs in it.

414
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it is so memorable, at least in the past.

415
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I would almost say the same is true about Beatmania 2DX now, ever since 13th style about there.

416
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:14,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad they don't have a Ubi machine there.

417
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game itself I thought was a lot of fun.

418
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play it again.

419
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the music will grow on me.

420
00:33:21,425 --> 00:33:21,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

421
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:24,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game itself I had a lot of fun with.

422
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm seeing frowns in chat.

423
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, guys.

424
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:32,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe it's a personal preference thing, but the game itself, pretty cool.

425
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:35,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, some other stuff I played this week.

426
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Zen Pinball.

427
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pinball game that's available on PlayStation 3.

428
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:41,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you check this out yet?

429
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:45,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet, but I saw one of the games in action.

430
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,250
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:28,606
[SPEAKER_04]: so unfortunately that makes the display a little difficult in a pinball game but you know they do the best job they can you have different view modes you can use in this game to look at the table from different angles it really reminds me of a lot of the pinball games I played on the PC in the 90s but obviously you know with the high def graphics and all that I hear there's multiplayer too but I haven't tested that mode out online so I can't really review that component of it yet

432
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:30,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Things I'm Learning About Sony

433
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:54,679
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's so much functionality in the PSP that I don't think Sony does a really good job at advertising because I was really surprised.

434
00:34:55,299 --> 00:35:08,202
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was looking at this, I was like, oh yeah, I think we've talked about this on this show but damn, I don't really hear about this a lot and it's actually a really cool feature of the PSP and that is that if you have a PSP, let's say I was here at Jamie's right now.

435
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I could, if I connected to her internet, I could power on my PlayStation 3 from home

436
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:18,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Go into my crossbar, see my crossbar on the PSP as I would see it on the PS3.

437
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to like a movie that I have downloaded on the PS3 or even a data disk full of movies that's in my PS3 right now and I can play them.

438
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Stream them over the internet to my PSP.

439
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

440
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:53,677
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh yeah I think I remember hearing about this but damn they should be shoving this down my throat that's really cool functionality that's way better than anything the DS and the Wii could ever do that makes the PS3 PSP combo in my opinion that much more awesome it's not just the movies thing or the data disc thing sorry you can't do blu-rays or DVDs but um

441
00:35:54,037 --> 00:36:13,546
[SPEAKER_04]: you can do some of the games too like especially the PS1 classics and some of the I don't want to say arcade games but the PSN downloadable games you can also play on the PSP from anywhere by turning on your PS3 from somewhere else that's like kind of neat so that's remote play of course is the feature there they call that

442
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's see.

443
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:17,970
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I play this week?

444
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say there were more games, but I can't think of anything right now, honestly.

445
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:26,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I will just leave it at that so we can continue on with the show because I know we want to get into some gaming news.

446
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:28,479
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we have some housekeeping news.

447
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

448
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:34,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to let you guys know I am going to be out in two weeks.

449
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:36,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be here next week, but I'll be out in two weeks.

450
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if there will be a show or not.

451
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:40,509
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll keep you posted.

452
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to be in LA, so I won't be here.

453
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going on a personal trip.

454
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens in two weeks.

455
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:46,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will be back next week.

456
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:52,976
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as other housekeeping goes, you can always follow us on Twitter, www.twitter.com slash OLR.

457
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:54,957
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be getting into Twitter topics a little later in the show.

458
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:58,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you can always send us emails, mailbag at orangelounge.com.

459
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:03,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to join us on Facebook at the OL Army or on LiveJournal at username Orangelounge.

460
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,183
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, how about some gaming news?

461
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:07,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off tonight with some gaming news.

462
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:09,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, lots of gaming news this week.

463
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:17,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's start off with the rumor, and this wasn't exactly a complete rumor, but we knew it was coming.

464
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:23,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if it was going to be coming this soon, but there are DSi only games coming this fall, apparently.

465
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:30,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, no official announcements have been made yet about...

466
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,596
[SPEAKER_02]: DSi exclusive games will be out this fall

467
00:37:59,355 --> 00:37:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: DSi Exclusive

468
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:30,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, alternative reality, or I guess an alternative reality game or something like that.

469
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Augmentive reality game, that's the word I'm thinking about.

470
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:37,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you find monsters and then you collect them and put them against each other.

471
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:39,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like Monster Rancher, but with a camera.

472
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, sort of like the barcode scanner games back when.

473
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:43,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, very similar to that too.

474
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:48,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the first DSi-only games.

475
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, I think from...

476
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:59,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if those are DSi exclusive.

477
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:02,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they do use the DSi, but I don't remember if they were exclusive or not.

478
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:07,353
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they were, but the sell sheet said not.

479
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:08,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

480
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:10,354
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be more coming.

481
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:14,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So interesting that Nintendo is kind of letting the third parties do this first.

482
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:15,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

483
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:17,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of torn on this.

484
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:25,402
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of those things where I'm a little bit disappointed because I really didn't see the point in getting a DSi because the DS honestly has everything I want.

485
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:27,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really need the camera or any of that stuff.

486
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:28,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't

487
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think you need this game either.

488
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:33,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just a lot of these games are going to be DSI only.

489
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:36,348
[SPEAKER_02]: They're obviously going to be using the gimmicks of it, the camera.

490
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically it.

491
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:37,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

492
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,029
[SPEAKER_04]: How long, Loki, and you know this is going to happen.

493
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,030
[SPEAKER_04]: How long?

494
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,490
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, let's take bets here on the show.

495
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,711
[SPEAKER_04]: How long until Nintendo puts out...

496
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost I think how they plan it.

497
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they care.

498
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they may not care, but here's the thing though.

499
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:41,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Their audience, the people that buy Nintendo products, are a lot different than your normal consumer that buys any other console franchise.

500
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:50,782
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, with the Wii and the DS owners, I think that they're pretty content with what they've got on the DS.

501
00:40:51,784 --> 00:41:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: or the Wii and they're not gonna exactly like if the Wii HD comes out your normal mom and pop is not gonna upgrade to a Wii HD because they could care less because they have Wii Sports and they don't really care about upgrading to another system.

502
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:03,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the DSi.

503
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Until Wii Sports 3 is Wii HD only.

504
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:07,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

505
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:08,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think

506
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:10,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

507
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:32,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how they're going to convince people that they need to buy a DSi because, oh, this game uses a camera now.

508
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:33,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.

509
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Question from your distribution perspective.

510
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the regular DSs being phased out?

511
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

512
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:40,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

513
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

514
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Takeo Ray in chat says, That's why I never got the DSi.

515
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,251
[SPEAKER_04]: My DS Lite is perfectly fine for me.

516
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much the same camp I'm in.

517
00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:13,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I rarely play the DS as it is.

518
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:17,115
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've listened to the show before, you know kind of my little rant on handhelds.

519
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I will say, the PSP is quickly gaining a lot of favor in my opinion.

520
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:26,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily as a gaming device, but as a multifunctional media device.

521
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It is quickly gaining popularity with me.

522
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

523
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:34,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry, but if they come out with a new Zelda game or something that requires a camera...

524
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:35,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

525
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't buy it.

526
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:37,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

527
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:40,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy another system for one fucking game.

528
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:41,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

529
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: When your library plays on my system except for this one game, boo fucking hoo, I'm not buying it.

530
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:48,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make do.

531
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

532
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,492
[SPEAKER_02]: You're expecting these hardcore players to go, okay, let me buy a new system for this game.

533
00:42:55,852 --> 00:43:00,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But the audience that buys the DS, they aren't really hardcore gamers.

534
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the wrong expectation for their market.

535
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:06,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

536
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:07,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you already have a DS.

537
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:32,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna play the new stuff that comes out.

538
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:33,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it was gonna happen.

539
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:35,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what if it sucks?

540
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:36,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's another thing we have to remember.

541
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:37,088
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I don't care?

542
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:39,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's a little different, because she's a system collection whore.

543
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

544
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,611
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not your typical gamer.

545
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:46,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, anything new that comes out, I pretty much want it.

546
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:48,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pretty much end up getting it.

547
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:51,878
[SPEAKER_04]: She owns some fucking Dreamcast game that came with a dish, for heaven's sake.

548
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, she's just a video game collector.

549
00:43:54,779 --> 00:44:00,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, you're not exactly going to want my opinion on that because mine's going to be, well, why shouldn't it be in my collection?

550
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:00,963
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

551
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:05,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on to another story that maybe we will get your opinion on then, and that's about the iPhone.

552
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:15,211
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting is that there's always been that rumor that's been going around probably as long as we've been podcasting that Apple's going to get into gaming.

553
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple's gonna get into gaming.

554
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna do something.

555
00:44:18,134 --> 00:44:19,215
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna get into gaming.

556
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:20,516
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of time.

557
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:25,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple kind of just got into gaming when everybody was kind of looking everywhere else.

558
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:28,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Apple is into gaming now.

559
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:32,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a lot of users using their games.

560
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:34,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I'm talking about the iPhone.

561
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:35,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't believe me?

562
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:37,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what they announced this week?

563
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:40,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.

564
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:43,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the game that was the DS exclusive.

565
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: They were so excited about it at E3.

566
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, they came out and, ooh, GTA Chinatown Wars is coming out.

567
00:44:48,738 --> 00:44:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

568
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the iPhone.

569
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is right after they announced that a PSP version was coming out as well.

570
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:56,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that is on its way as well.

571
00:44:56,904 --> 00:45:00,707
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also coming to the iPhone, and of course, that would mean the iPod Touch as well.

572
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:09,273
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a whole lot of other details at this time, but only just that they're calling it a perfect match for the iPhone and iPod Touch.

573
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:15,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of iffy on this because I don't think... Some games just don't run well on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

574
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a very...

575
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:17,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Peggle

576
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,882
[SPEAKER_04]: or any PopCap game.

577
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:29,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain games that are optimized for the iPhone and iPod Touch run pretty darn good.

578
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:43,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I see the iPhone and iPod Touch basically the app store that they have it's just the most successful mobile gaming platform is basically it.

579
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:47,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Other phones and stuff like that don't really work well with gaming whereas this

580
00:45:48,404 --> 00:45:53,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They built this phone around the apps that you can make in these programs, which is good.

581
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:03,376
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as it being a gaming platform, yeah, sure, I guess it could be.

582
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:09,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They can put lots of games on it, but you're not going to see the same functionality as some of these games that are on the DS and the PSP.

583
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,651
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

584
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:40,583
[SPEAKER_04]: but I would just see that they could do something like that that would just add a lot of oomph to the iPhone and iPod Touch and make it that much more.

585
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:43,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't you think it still is competition for the DS?

586
00:46:43,405 --> 00:46:44,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, definitely.

587
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:45,787
[SPEAKER_04]: To an extent, the PSP?

588
00:46:46,147 --> 00:46:47,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

589
00:46:47,187 --> 00:47:02,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always competition for them because their app store right now is definitely working a lot better than what they have for DSiWare or the PlayStation Network stuff and obviously the PlayStation Go is going to try to

590
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:04,799
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

591
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

592
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:47,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one story that I don't think we are covering tonight, I think, but it was in the thread.

593
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We just ran out of room tonight.

594
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a game on the iPhone that just came out this week that is like a PP simulation game.

595
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:55,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what it's called.

596
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,521
[SPEAKER_04]: IPP was the name of the game.

597
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And you literally are like aiming at a urinal.

598
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:00,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

599
00:48:00,863 --> 00:48:01,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

600
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's awesome.

601
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:03,345
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

602
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:04,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just dumb.

603
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:06,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It is stupid, but you know what?

604
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:06,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my point.

605
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:09,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of crap out there on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

606
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But one person's trash is another person's treasure.

607
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?

608
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:19,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then couldn't the same be said about whatever Sony's planning with their mini bar and the DSi to an extent?

609
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have a problem with Sony's minis.

610
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:27,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a problem with the DSiware because it's a lot of calculators and clocks, which, you know, I don't know.

611
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't really add anything to the DSi.

612
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

613
00:48:33,128 --> 00:48:35,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

614
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to release dates here in just a little bit, but first, over to DarkSakura.

615
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you sound so enthusiastic.

616
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:47,273
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, over to the one and only fabulous DarkSakura!

617
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:53,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Splatterhouse was being developed by Bottle Rocket Entertainment.

618
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:55,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they don't exist anymore.

619
00:48:56,615 --> 00:49:01,117
[SPEAKER_06]: They clung to life as long as they could, but the plug was pulled.

620
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:01,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So guess what?

621
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:10,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Their house got splattered.

622
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:18,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I really don't know what that means for Splatterhouse, except that it's not going to be coming out anytime soon unless someone else picks that up.

623
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it die.

624
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:23,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a neat idea, but just let it die.

625
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:24,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well come out at this point.

626
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:29,595
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that they're actually working on another company that they're going to start from the ground up.

627
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:36,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's sad, though, that although it seems like there's a silver lining here that for every door closes, another opens, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of sad.

629
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:48,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously feel like this is, again, we had a lot of this at the end of the year last year, but this is like the fourth story I think we've had in the scope of two months about some studio closing down.

630
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:50,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because they're way behind in schedule.

631
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:56,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was supposed to be out at the end of last year, and then they pushed it back to, you know, June, and then it still wasn't done.

632
00:49:56,768 --> 00:49:58,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, time to close.

633
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:02,350
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatUpG in our chatroom at chat.orangeonestradio.com asked a question.

634
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Namco take Splatterhouse internally?

635
00:50:04,612 --> 00:50:06,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember hearing that at one point, too.

636
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:06,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

637
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:14,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, yeah, there's nothing about what exactly is going to happen with it, but Namco pulled the development of Splatterhouse back in.

638
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:16,598
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, but there hasn't been anything else said about it.

639
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:18,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, interesting.

640
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:27,597
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, hopefully those guys, you know, as much as we're making silly jokes about Splatter and House, you know, it does suck when people lose their jobs.

641
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope this whole starting a studio from the ground up works out for them.

642
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, just try to get stuff out there as soon as you can.

643
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the public experience.

644
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:39,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really tricky balance, isn't it?

645
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:42,811
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to spend enough time on the products to have a quality product, but at the same time,

646
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:49,256
[SPEAKER_04]: If you spend too much time on it, you go the way of Duke Nukem Forever and the guys behind that.

647
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:54,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I am confident that that game will be super epic when it comes out.

648
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you say.

649
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm completely lying.

650
00:50:58,523 --> 00:50:59,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get your expectations too high.

651
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:02,925
[SPEAKER_02]: My expectations are incredibly low.

652
00:51:03,246 --> 00:51:03,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Your problem.

653
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:06,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, lo, then fine.

654
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:07,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, never mind then.

655
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:07,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

656
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

657
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:09,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Duke Nukem.

658
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like in the 90s.

659
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the 90s.

660
00:51:12,431 --> 00:51:13,172
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a long time ago.

661
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:14,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

662
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Yes, it's when No Doubt was popular.

663
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

664
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:23,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of something from a long time ago, God of War and God of War 2.

665
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:28,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I guess that wasn't that long ago, but hey, it was a few years.

666
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ancient.

667
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:29,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

668
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:32,588
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

669
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:58,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how we were talking about backwards compatibility and how they probably could do it, but they're not?

670
00:51:59,192 --> 00:52:04,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's why they're not doing it, because now we can sell every game that we've made over again.

671
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:08,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with it, actually.

672
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Because how is this different than what Nintendo's doing in Metroid Prime Trilogy?

673
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't different.

674
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:13,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

675
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:24,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... I think it's kind of cool, because then I can... You know, yeah, and why I'm okay with this, Loki, is because they're going back and they're making the games HD, they're giving them trophies.

676
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, they might be old games, but they're giving them new treatment.

677
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:30,351
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

678
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:48,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it was still a trend before.

679
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to the PlayStation 1, you would see Super Nintendo games, the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger re-release.

680
00:52:54,915 --> 00:53:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like this is anything new, but what I think makes this kind of special and kind of cool is that the games are being souped up a little bit to match the times.

681
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the God of War boat back on the PlayStation 2.

682
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,704
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually really interests me.

683
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:21,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, God of War 2 actually did output at 720p because there were a handful of games that were on the PlayStation 2 and on the Xbox that would both either output at 720p or they would do 1080i, which was kind of cool.

684
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:28,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But God of War 2 was one of the ones that actually did the 720p, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch for them to do that.

685
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:28,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that now.

686
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there like a secret code or something you had to put in to do that?

687
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

688
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so weird.

689
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey...

690
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:38,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a good way to get ramped up for the new game coming out, obviously, in March.

691
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:40,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And true, that is the price.

692
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to buy them both new right now on the PlayStation 2, that is the price that it would be.

693
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:43,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $40.

694
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'm going to wait a little bit for this.

695
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:00,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, I never played God of War 1 and 2.

696
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I played it at a friend's house for a little bit, but I never bought it myself.

697
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:03,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I played through 1, never played through 2.

698
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,350
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw makes a comment about Metroid Prime.

699
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroid Prime 3 in Metroid Prime Trilogy was censored a tad.

700
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:16,233
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the cutscenes had a character say, damn, it was redubbed with a no.

701
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,209
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

702
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:39,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, I told you not to climb up there.

703
00:54:39,038 --> 00:54:47,427
[SPEAKER_02]: What the... And then it pauses and says, do you want him to say fuck or do you want him to not use any... Fudge!

704
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:48,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

705
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:49,369
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fudge?

706
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just censors the rest of the game like that.

707
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of funny, the way that they give that option to you.

708
00:54:54,634 --> 00:54:55,775
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an interesting way to do it.

709
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

710
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:16,962
[SPEAKER_04]: J-Rod in chat gives his quick reviews these are like twitter reviews of these games it's very short but maybe help you out Loki God of War 1 I think has a better story but God of War 2 was overall better yeah I really wish I had played God of War 2 but the thing with God of War 1 is I got so frustrated at the end of the game because the last boss was really hard oh

711
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: and the last boss glitched out so it didn't quite work right so I beat the crap out of them just over and over and over again even though I know what I was supposed to do in the game but it still wouldn't work because the game glitched out so I just got pissed off with it.

712
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:31,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

713
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:33,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's go back over to the Nintendo Wii for a minute.

714
00:55:33,737 --> 00:55:35,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we were talking about Metroid Prime Trilogy.

715
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:40,041
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing you might be – which actually, by the way, the Metroid Prime games are pretty awesome.

716
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:45,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm even thinking – I have Metroid Prime 3, but I'm thinking about getting the trilogy because I never had Metroid Prime 1 or 2.

717
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:46,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's kind of weird.

718
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:49,387
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate had them around that time.

719
00:55:49,427 --> 00:56:00,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how you can't get, obviously, the Metroid game downloaded to your Game Boy Advance with Metroid Prime Trilogy, but you can get the costume.

720
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:08,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in that game as well to kind of download to the Fusion costume or whatever in the game.

721
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:09,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That unlocks.

722
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:10,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

723
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what other kind of synergy between the three games there is, if any.

724
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

725
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:18,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, you know how they had a web browser?

726
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:21,943
[SPEAKER_04]: They had their Nintendo Internet channel that you could download for a $5 fee?

727
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

728
00:56:22,824 --> 00:56:26,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier this week in Japan and Europe, that fee went away.

729
00:56:26,585 --> 00:56:29,788
[SPEAKER_04]: and then just a couple days later it also went away in North America.

730
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:32,331
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet channel is now free to download.

731
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:35,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a Wii but you never got the internet channel, you can go ahead and download it.

732
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

733
00:56:36,775 --> 00:56:39,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to cost 500 Wii points to download.

734
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:41,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I should take a step back.

735
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:46,304
[SPEAKER_04]: When it first came out, you might remember, if you were an early Wii owner like myself and I think the others in studio here,

736
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:47,905
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

737
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:33,063
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you were one of the people that paid 500 Wii points for this sadly Nintendo isn't going to give you the 500 points back but what they are going to do is they're going to give you a 500 point credit towards a virtual console game so at least you get a little something although I don't know if I was one of the people that paid 500 points for it I might be a little sad but then again it's only 5 bucks I don't know 5 bucks is still a lot I guess

738
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

739
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:49,575
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I'm also kind of like, as much as I think that's cool they're making it free again, unless this new remastered internet channel somehow made it a lot faster to browse the internet on the Wii, I don't think it's going to be that great.

740
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:52,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Browsing the internet on the Wii is kind of slow.

741
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:54,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

742
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:56,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

743
00:57:57,077 --> 00:57:58,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did you do when you were only dial-up?

744
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:00,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

745
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,431
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

746
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,347
[SPEAKER_02]: or Phantasmagoria, which was on seven CDs.

747
00:58:23,368 --> 00:58:31,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to download overnight, and I used to have a download accelerator to basically queue up a bunch of stuff to download.

748
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:32,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my thing.

749
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:33,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

750
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:39,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And some folks in chat want to clarify, X-Link says the credit was only for Japan.

751
00:58:39,218 --> 00:58:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, it did open up.

752
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out Nintendo.com.

753
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:43,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now.

754
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:46,964
[SPEAKER_04]: There is just a NES virtual console download credit that you can get now.

755
00:58:47,444 --> 00:59:14,441
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's not 500 points clarifies Deke Bandit as a free NES game that's right it's basically a credit towards a free NES virtual console game which of course is 500 points but you can't like take the 500 points and apply it towards a Sega game or something else has to be an NES game so there you go alright let's move on with some more news it would help if my brain worked yes it would it's kind of required to do a show

756
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:28,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, you know that the new Halo 3 ODST is supposed to be coming out and it has a launch date of September 22nd for, of course, Xbox 360.

757
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:39,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are people out there who are playing illegitimate copies, meaning they either have a burn of some kind or received a copy that they weren't supposed to receive.

758
00:59:40,882 --> 01:00:06,973
[SPEAKER_06]: and um so uh the uh big Microsoft enforcer dude went on Twitter and said and I quote I spy with my little eye some illegitimate ODST players no early play for you commencing permabans and except for those who actually have legit copies like early um you know actual true early copies for reviewers and that type of thing they're okay um

759
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:12,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you have an actual legit copy of the game that you happen to get early, then that's okay too apparently.

760
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why people are playing the one that's out there now because the leaked one that's out there is actually in French.

761
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:21,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious.

762
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people know French.

763
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

764
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious.

765
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:28,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we import Japanese games even though we can't read Japanese.

766
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

767
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

768
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:31,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious, though.

769
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they able to spot the difference?

770
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that some type of secret they're not saying?

771
01:00:35,828 --> 01:00:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: They're claiming that's a secret.

772
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:38,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they know.

773
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just going after whomever.

774
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:43,253
[SPEAKER_04]: But what if they get it wrong?

775
01:00:45,464 --> 01:00:46,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're wrong.

776
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they know.

777
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:49,026
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a way they can tell the difference.

778
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what they're doing.

779
01:00:49,866 --> 01:00:52,047
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically... Or is this a scare tactic?

780
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a scare tactic.

781
01:00:53,468 --> 01:01:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I think is, if you want to think the real conspiracy theory to it, is that people are thinking that this is actually a copy that they leaked out that's...

782
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:11,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Modified in a way that they can flag people that have played it or something like that, which would be entrapment, but I don't see how they're doing that.

783
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:27,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing that it's because you're going to see a bunch of people all playing this French-English version of it, like in the United States or something like that, and people are going to be like, Huh, I'm pretty sure that they didn't buy that from wherever it was released at.

784
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to be a hacked version.

785
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a weapon, I'm Mr. Chef

786
01:01:59,235 --> 01:01:59,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Master Chef.

787
01:02:00,456 --> 01:02:02,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he put Chef, but it's supposed to be Chief.

788
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:03,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I read Chef.

789
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:09,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would like a game called Master Chef to come out next to Cooking Mama.

790
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:14,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Deekman in chat says it's the same way they tell if people are playing burn games on live.

791
01:02:14,986 --> 01:02:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.

792
01:02:15,587 --> 01:02:19,690
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the new stuff that's out there now makes it very difficult for them to do that.

793
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,091
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really stealth.

794
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:27,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I would know, I played modified Grand Theft Auto 4's for like, what, how many months now?

795
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:29,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's still risky, you know it's risky.

796
01:02:30,101 --> 01:02:30,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

797
01:02:31,663 --> 01:02:36,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go around the globe and explore some upcoming release dates from around the globe.

798
01:02:38,197 --> 01:02:40,479

[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

801
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:19,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Bob was talking about earlier, right?

802
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome, seriously.

803
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,085

[SPEAKER_02]: Go Play City Sports on the Wii.

808
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:42,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You had another sports game collection.

809
01:03:42,867 --> 01:03:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this one has rooftop hockey, so I kind of had to think of a little bit of clerks there.

810
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:47,089
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of funny.

811
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:57,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Cubed, the Q Games collection coming to Xbox 360 with your resin Every Extend Extra Extreme.

826
01:06:03,488 --> 01:06:09,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of those games moving into the Platinum Collection, as well as Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, and Bioshock.

827
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:14,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft's doing a little push in Japan right now with all these recent price drops.

828
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:15,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all happening on...

832
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:33,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

833
01:06:33,743 --> 01:06:35,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Forever Blue 2 next week, but not this week.

834
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:38,707
[SPEAKER_04]: also another House of the Dead game but we'll cover that next week.

835
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2 nothing this week either.

836
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all on the 17th of September.

837
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:45,596
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much coming out on PlayStation 2 right now.

838
01:06:46,024 --> 01:06:46,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The Engagement on Desert

839
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:15,911
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you got for Japanese releases this week.

840
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:41,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for the UK, we have some, I mean, pretty much the standard stuff.

841
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,274
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 9th is Beatles Rock Band.

842
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 11th, we have Championship Manager 2010, Colin McRae Dirt 2, yay, Guitar Hero 5, Mini Ninjas, NHL 2K10, and Section 8.

843
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Rob, there's something on the 15th that you might be interested in.

844
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Zuma's Revenge.

845
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:03,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard about this.

846
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:07,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this has a similar release date here in the US if it's not out already.

847
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:08,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of like a sequel to Zuma.

848
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:11,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my favorite PopCap game.

849
01:08:11,357 --> 01:08:16,101
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem with Zuma is it's not something you can sit down and play quickly, like a game of Bejeweled or something.

850
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:22,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Zuma takes a long time to get through a game because not only does it take a little while to beat each level, but then you have three lives.

851
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not as big on Zuma.

852
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:24,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

853
01:08:26,038 --> 01:08:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are other PopCap games I really enjoy.

854
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:32,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I still got a copy of Bookworm Adventures 2 I need to play.

855
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:33,721
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't laugh.

856
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:34,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

857
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:36,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm laughing because I've played it.

858
01:08:36,582 --> 01:08:37,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

859
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.

860
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Final Fantasy meets Boggle.

861
01:08:39,644 --> 01:08:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

862
01:08:41,064 --> 01:08:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do want to check out the sequel.

863
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Rob, I have to say, I like your shirt and all of its Helvetica-ness.

864
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:48,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

865
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:11,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your font hornus.

866
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Helvetic, I swear.

867
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

868
01:09:15,537 --> 01:09:15,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

869
01:09:16,538 --> 01:09:17,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

870
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more stories for you before we get to the classic game of the week.

871
01:09:20,816 --> 01:09:29,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this week we had the debut of the new trailer for the new expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4, The Ballad of Gay Tony.

872
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:40,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, it looks like it's going to be returning back to the over-the-top Grand Theft Auto fun that you can expect from the rest of the series.

873
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Some new stuff to note in there.

874
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:47,255
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some new weapons that they did kind of show off in the trailer.

875
01:09:47,635 --> 01:09:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: A new...

876
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:49,476
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

877
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:12,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Subway Car, which is kind of cool.

878
01:10:13,093 --> 01:10:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a golf cart in there as well, and some new sports cars.

879
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be kind of fun.

880
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:21,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you notice what the song in the trailer was?

881
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:22,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

882
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was quite... Those that listen to the Orange Laundry after birth that we only do live for a little bit after we tape live will understand why that's funny.

883
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also they had...

884
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:40,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there was some other stuff rumored that there's a FIB tank in the game.

885
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:44,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their SWAT tank or something.

886
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:45,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

887
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:46,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

888
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:49,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to this because they ruined my modded games.

889
01:10:52,271 --> 01:10:55,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm seriously... It's like we're coming out of depression or something.

890
01:10:56,512 --> 01:10:59,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to playing the normal game is just wrong.

891
01:11:00,074 --> 01:11:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

892
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:05,966
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some pretty cool stuff coming for that.

893
01:11:06,226 --> 01:11:12,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, also out of the trailer, though, of course they had a lot of different cutscenes in there and they recognized some of the characters.

894
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:18,130
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them I was kind of interested by is Gracie, which was actually one of the missions in Grand Theft Auto IV.

895
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,870
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to kidnap her, which is kind of funny.

896
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's in there as well.

897
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:24,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, it looks awesome.

898
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:27,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not as big of a Grand Theft Auto IV player as you are.

899
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is Gay Tony?

900
01:11:29,193 --> 01:11:29,993
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like a mom boss?

901
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a mob boss.

902
01:11:31,314 --> 01:11:33,336
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Tony Prince, is the guy.

903
01:11:33,436 --> 01:11:41,802
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically owns nightclubs, and he's a member of the Ancelotti Crime Syndicate.

904
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:49,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, he owns the biggest gay and straight nightclubs in Algonquin.

905
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:51,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's who you play...

906
01:11:52,831 --> 01:12:02,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't play him, but you play a guy that kind of helps him out, Luis Fernando Lopez, which is like this Dominican guy that you play as.

907
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: He's his bodyguard.

908
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:17,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And the games, all three episodes, including the main game, all kind of culminate around this diamond deal that goes down and goes wrong, and that's the Impossible Trinity is each one of their...

909
01:12:18,192 --> 01:12:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolls in this diamond deal And if I remember correctly, I think Louise comes in And actually breaks up the diamond deal And tries to steal the diamonds So that's definitely going to be part of the game

910
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:43,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a weird question for you, but as kind of like the gay guy on the program, and who isn't as familiar with Grand Theft Auto 4, I'm kind of curious, not to get all glad on you, but I'm curious, like, is this like a step forward for gay rights, or is this going to be a bunch of stereotypes?

911
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:47,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, does gay Tony go around going, that's super!

912
01:12:47,302 --> 01:12:49,764
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he didn't really do that.

913
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:53,346
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a character, though, in Grand Theft Auto 4 that was like that.

914
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:54,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

915
01:12:54,927 --> 01:12:57,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember his name, but yeah, he was very flamboyant.

916
01:12:57,608 --> 01:12:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But he didn't seem flamboyant in the trailer.

917
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, he wasn't talking much, but I don't think he is.

918
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:09,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I'm totally cool with it if it's like, you know, hey, you have a gay character who's like a cool mob boss and all this stuff, just like anybody else.

919
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:14,714
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if it's just going to be stereotype after stereotype, then I'm just going to facepalm.

920
01:13:14,914 --> 01:13:16,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think it's going to be.

921
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:19,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're usually pretty, you know...

922
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:20,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

923
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockstar's pretty good about that stuff, usually.

924
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hopeful.

925
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:27,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hoping they don't add any more full frontal penis again.

926
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:29,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was enough in the last game.

927
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:31,275
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need full frontal penis in this game.

928
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:34,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But you wouldn't have any problem with full boobage and everything?

929
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:36,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they haven't done that in this game.

930
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm surprised.

931
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: It being an emirated game and stuff, for nudity and that kind of stuff, there's no...

932
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's establishment of a double standard.

933
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:45,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to see cock, but you don't want to see boobs.

934
01:13:45,804 --> 01:13:47,064
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't want to see more cock.

935
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:48,565
[SPEAKER_02]: There already is cock in the game.

936
01:13:48,705 --> 01:13:53,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to see boobs that go along with the cock so we have an equal representation.

937
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You want equal opportunity nudity.

938
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually support his statement.

939
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:00,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go for equal opportunity nudity.

940
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a problem with it.

941
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:04,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that they need to, like, you know...

942
01:14:04,693 --> 01:14:05,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but whatever

943
01:14:18,695 --> 01:14:19,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game.

944
01:14:19,215 --> 01:14:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell do I care?

945
01:14:20,395 --> 01:14:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just characters.

946
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:26,557
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just funny how there's a lot of people out there that says, Oh, because it's gay Tony.

947
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:28,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we don't have to see more cock.

948
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:32,058
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hope just for that you get beaver shot in this.

949
01:14:32,138 --> 01:14:33,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for that kind of ignorant comment.

950
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:34,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be cool.

951
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:35,359
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is going to be awesome.

952
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:38,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just hoping, though, that they bring back the tank.

953
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the tanks are awesome.

954
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,081
[SPEAKER_02]: The minigun, the flamethrower, and the chainsaw.

955
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:44,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

956
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:46,322
[SPEAKER_02]: But already I like where they're going with it.

957
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:48,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't wait to play it.

958
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,061
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys, and then we're going to go to the classic game of the week.

959
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:57,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And this story has to actually do with the 360, where this download content is.

960
01:14:57,982 --> 01:14:59,543
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, random-ass question.

961
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: When they announced the Grand Theft Auto 4 exclusive content, it is never coming to the PlayStation 3.

962
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

963
01:15:05,864 --> 01:15:06,805
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as we're aware.

964
01:15:07,605 --> 01:15:12,146
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe someday they might say, okay, Windows over, we're going to release this disc now on PlayStation 3.

965
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:12,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

966
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be ported in a heartbeat.

967
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:17,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see that.

968
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:19,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of curious.

969
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:23,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, since all the formats are basically the same, it's just recoding the textures and that's it.

970
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:23,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

971
01:15:24,884 --> 01:15:25,745
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

972
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,266
[SPEAKER_04]: If the system is in HD mode.

973
01:15:50,506 --> 01:15:53,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently anti-aliasing is also out.

974
01:15:53,872 --> 01:15:56,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Full screen anti-aliasing you do not have to do.

975
01:15:57,639 --> 01:15:57,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

976
01:15:59,025 --> 01:16:00,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Those requirements are now out.

977
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:20,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Microsoft kind of was lenient on these rules before, and one very, very notable game that got around these rules is Halo 3, because you might remember, and I remember some stories on this when Halo 3 first came out, it's not running in true 720p, it's running at 1152 by 640, so it's 100 pixels short on either side.

978
01:16:20,997 --> 01:16:24,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Call of Duty 4 is also 600p also.

979
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:25,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

980
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:26,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

981
01:16:28,944 --> 01:16:34,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is a huge deal because I'm all about frame rate a little more than resolution.

982
01:16:34,985 --> 01:16:39,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, a great game should have both great resolution and good frame rate, something like Oblivion or whatever.

983
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the games that get really busy online, they have to scale back the resolution a little bit.

984
01:16:46,128 --> 01:16:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So why now, though?

985
01:16:48,928 --> 01:16:51,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of wondering if they decided to get rid of this.

986
01:16:52,529 --> 01:17:02,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this because maybe 360 has enough penetration in the marketplace now so they don't need to be advertising all this HD, HD, HD?

987
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:03,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

988
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:13,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a big game coming out that didn't have this or something and they figured that, hey, let's make this available so that it's fair for everybody.

989
01:17:13,942 --> 01:17:14,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

990
01:17:14,283 --> 01:17:16,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it makes it easier to develop on the system.

991
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Cananogram has an interesting thought.

992
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:19,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's for the indie games.

993
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the indie games were ever held to the same standard.

994
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:24,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so either.

995
01:17:24,886 --> 01:17:25,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thought, though.

996
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:29,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I don't think a lot of the indie games I've played have full-screen anti-aliasing.

997
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:32,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think if that actually... Hmm.

998
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:33,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

999
01:17:35,769 --> 01:17:36,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there it is.

1000
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:40,871
[SPEAKER_04]: The technical certifications are changing, so we'll see what games come of that a little later on.

1001
01:17:40,891 --> 01:17:44,432
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, let's go to a classic video game in a little segment.

1002
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:46,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to call it the classic video game of the week.

1003
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:55,496
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the part of the show where DarkSakura likes to browse the gaming vault and find a game that she says, you know what?

1004
01:17:56,156 --> 01:18:00,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You kids should be playing this game this week, or at least check it out and show this game a little respect.

1005
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what game did you pick for the kids this week?

1006
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:04,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Team Sonic Team

1007
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, tell us a little bit about Choo Choo Rocket.

1008
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:26,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Just out of curiosity, does this have to do with the fact that it's 9-9 of 0-9 this week?

1009
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:35,499
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, it has to do with Dan fussing because I don't put in games he suggests, or I already have put in games that he suggested.

1010
01:18:37,150 --> 01:19:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Cat Mania So yeah, I put in Choo Choo Rocket So this was one of the first of the online games that came on the Dreamcast And then they just started giving it away with the Dreamcast as an online demo And it was also given away free in Europe When you would order a copy Well, you could order your copy by connecting to the Dream Arena service

1011
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:12,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole point of the game is to get mice, as in choo-choo, because in Japanese that's the sound a mouse makes, it's choo.

1012
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:19,487
[SPEAKER_06]: You get them onto a rocket while avoiding the cats, or the kapu-kapu, that roam around the board.

1013
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:28,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to place down arrows to determine the path the mice are going to take, because they just keep going in a straight line until they run into a wall.

1014
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1015
01:19:59,997 --> 01:20:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can get special colored mice like a gold mouse will give you 50 extra mice a pink mouse gives you those events like we were talking about the cat mania, the mouse mania

1016
01:20:11,713 --> 01:20:20,439
[SPEAKER_06]: But the single-player mode is actually, I think, my favorite because it's really... It's really... It gets super complex.

1017
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:30,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It really turns into a matter of figuring out how you're gonna get from point A to point B when you've got all these obstacles in your path and all you have is a limited number of arrows.

1018
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:32,647
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is fucking fast-paced, too.

1019
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:34,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was my biggest problem with it.

1020
01:20:34,428 --> 01:20:35,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too fast for me to keep up with.

1021
01:20:36,409 --> 01:20:38,331
[SPEAKER_04]: They need, like, choo-choo slow...

1022
01:20:39,946 --> 01:20:56,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you also got a challenge mode where you have to get all the mice into rockets or get a cat to eat all the mice or put the cat into a guarded rocket or other stuff and you had a time limit on it and it had 25 levels.

1023
01:20:56,426 --> 01:20:58,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do that actually one or two player or two.

1024
01:20:58,829 --> 01:21:10,273
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Game Boy Advance version that's really the same as the Dreamcast version, but you can actually play with one cartridge multiplayer.

1025
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:14,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, y'all said a level editor in it, too.

1026
01:21:16,476 --> 01:21:19,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the Game Boy Advance version wasn't made by Sega.

1027
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:26,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in Sonic Battle, Tails has a choo-choo for his landmine.

1028
01:21:29,798 --> 01:21:31,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's a pretty fun little game.

1029
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just fun.

1030
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:36,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Play it.

1031
01:21:37,901 --> 01:21:38,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1032
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:38,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Get Dreamcast.

1033
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:40,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Choo-choo rocket.

1034
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:41,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Dreamcast.

1035
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:48,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Which Jamie swears has nothing to do with the 9909 or 99, whatever you want to call it, anniversary of the Dreamcast this week.

1036
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:49,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the classic game of the week.

1037
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Chew, chew.

1038
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:56,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1039
01:21:56,931 --> 01:22:02,695
[SPEAKER_04]: We always like to take a break in the middle of the show to just kind of stretch, you know, refill our drinks or go to the restroom or what have you.

1040
01:22:03,116 --> 01:22:11,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So we suggest taking an opportunity to do the same because there is plenty more to come in Part B of our show tonight, including Twitter topics, rapid fire news tonight, and more long discussion.

1041
01:22:11,062 --> 01:22:13,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about Blur, which is a racing game I am really looking forward to.

1042
01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:15,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Damon Auburn.

1043
01:22:16,405 --> 01:22:16,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Blur!

1044
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Blur the racing game, silly.

1045
01:22:18,587 --> 01:22:23,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about a brand new reality show coming to Sony, PlayStation Network.

1046
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:26,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds kind of interesting would be the word for it.

1047
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And 3D, possibly on the PlayStation 3.

1048
01:22:29,414 --> 01:22:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Some interesting developments with that this week.

1049
01:22:31,515 --> 01:22:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do all that right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1050
01:22:35,258 --> 01:22:35,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned!

1051
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Part B of our podcast.

1052
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taping live on this Sunday evening, September 6, 2009.

1053
01:22:47,952 --> 01:22:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Labor Day to all of our American listeners who get tomorrow off of work.

1054
01:22:53,837 --> 01:23:00,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, if it's not America that you're from, then just have a happy Monday or happy week wherever you're at.

1055
01:23:00,703 --> 01:23:06,548
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into some more gaming news as we tape live on this Sunday evening at www.allgames.com.

1056
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:15,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have Bobby Blackwolf joining us earlier in the show, live from Seattle, where he had just wrapped up Penny Arcade Expo, which just came to a close earlier.

1057
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:20,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Any word on what the final game was in their little PAX... What do they call that?

1058
01:23:20,555 --> 01:23:22,437
[SPEAKER_04]: The little PAX... Megathon, thank you.

1059
01:23:23,218 --> 01:23:24,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Any word on what the final game was yet?

1060
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that hit the internet?

1061
01:23:26,742 --> 01:23:29,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've seen it on the internet, but I will look.

1062
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:46,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Props.

1063
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:48,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega props to you guys.

1064
01:23:48,747 --> 01:23:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1065
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: No pressure or anything, but can you imagine the amount of pressure that it all comes down to skee-ball?

1066
01:23:56,256 --> 01:23:59,861
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me, though, there was a pricing game on The Price is Right, because your shirt reminds me of this, too.

1067
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:01,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's wearing a Price is Right shirt today, everybody.

1068
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:02,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You should see it.

1069
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:02,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1070
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:08,189
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a skee-ball game that, like, if you could hit the target on the skee-ball, you'd win, like, a new car.

1071
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:09,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's almost as much pressure.

1072
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:26,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, like, okay, so the rounds as it went, the first round was Mario Kart Wii, the second round was Bookworm Adventures, round three was Halo 3 ODST, round four was the Beatles Rock Band, round five was Kinect 4, and then, of course, the final round being skee-ball.

1073
01:24:27,265 --> 01:24:31,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting, because you have, like, some new games mixed with some board games...

1074
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:34,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good mix at the Omegathon this year.

1075
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:35,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1076
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to get back into our show tonight.

1077
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off with some Twitter topics.

1078
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have theme song now for Twitter topics, don't we?

1079
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:46,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally forgot to queue it up.

1080
01:24:46,912 --> 01:24:48,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a bad host tonight.

1081
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:49,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Fired!

1082
01:24:51,232 --> 01:24:52,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a minute, let me get the theme song here.

1083
01:24:52,473 --> 01:24:53,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Only if we get to use fire.

1084
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:57,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Any exciting plans for Labor Day, you guys?

1085
01:24:58,474 --> 01:24:59,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to sleep.

1086
01:25:01,007 --> 01:25:03,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, we have to do something tomorrow.

1087
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:05,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, we'll see.

1088
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want to just stay in and play WoW all day.

1089
01:25:07,249 --> 01:25:08,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know what's going on tonight.

1090
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:09,530
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1091
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Becky's going to come over tonight and we're going to watch My Fair Lady.

1092
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:13,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun!

1093
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:16,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Any reason why you were just deciding to get into old school musicals?

1094
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the fun of it?

1095
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:20,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't remember how to except that it was very random.

1096
01:25:20,873 --> 01:25:22,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing wrong with that.

1097
01:25:22,613 --> 01:25:25,494
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're thinking about going to Yog-Yog after the show.

1098
01:25:27,111 --> 01:25:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: FNANDO

1099
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:57,276
[SPEAKER_04]: asked the very first question.

1100
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:59,578
[SPEAKER_04]: What if there was a mariachi band as a game?

1101
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It might sound a little like our background music.

1102
01:26:04,061 --> 01:26:05,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd play a mariachi game.

1103
01:26:05,362 --> 01:26:08,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I would totally play one, but I think the novelty would honestly wear off.

1104
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:09,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be honest.

1105
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: There was that tambourine game.

1106
01:26:11,507 --> 01:26:17,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've ever seen this, but the makers of Samba de Amigo, at least in the arcade, also made a tambourine game.

1107
01:26:17,532 --> 01:26:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And I forget the name of this game.

1108
01:26:19,593 --> 01:26:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the gayest game I've ever played in my life.

1109
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:23,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use that term to mean...

1110
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1111
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw305 says, there's a story here he's linking us to.

1112
01:26:54,222 --> 01:27:02,186
[SPEAKER_04]: The creator of Mobile Suit Gundam says that video games are evil and links us to a story that ran on Gamasutra earlier this week.

1113
01:27:02,546 --> 01:27:12,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Yoshiuki Tomino gave a keynote speech at the CEDEC game conference and said, quote, I think that video games are evil.

1114
01:27:13,086 --> 01:27:19,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming is not a type of activity that provides any support to our daily lives and all these consoles are just consuming electricity.

1115
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:24,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say we have about 3 billion people on this planet wasting their time bringing no productivity at all.

1116
01:27:25,175 --> 01:27:27,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Add 10 billion more people and what would happen to our planet?

1117
01:27:28,277 --> 01:27:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games are assisting the death of our planet.

1118
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, crazy man.

1119
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:34,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to bite the hand that feeds you, right?

1120
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:36,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1121
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:37,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would he say something like that?

1122
01:27:37,844 --> 01:27:38,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1123
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:42,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Gundam is unlike every fucking game platform ever in Japan.

1124
01:27:47,306 --> 01:27:52,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment wants us to talk about this topic.

1125
01:27:53,251 --> 01:27:57,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people complain that early adopters are getting screwed over.

1126
01:27:57,374 --> 01:28:00,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the PS3 Slim mean it the other way around?

1127
01:28:01,357 --> 01:28:04,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of been true of Sony for a long time.

1128
01:28:05,037 --> 01:28:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1129
01:28:28,445 --> 01:28:33,932
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do find the whole lack of even software emulation and the removal of Linux, I do find that odd.

1130
01:28:34,313 --> 01:28:35,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the rest of it I get.

1131
01:28:35,454 --> 01:28:36,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I get why they take out USB slots.

1132
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:38,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I get some of this other stuff.

1133
01:28:38,478 --> 01:28:41,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that the Slim might have a slightly longer loading time.

1134
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:42,763
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of this I don't think I get.

1135
01:28:43,244 --> 01:28:43,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

1136
01:28:44,305 --> 01:28:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.

1137
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:47,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why they removed Linux.

1138
01:28:47,696 --> 01:28:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand that maybe no one's using that function, but I don't see how that function really did anything unless people found a way to hack the PS3 through Linux.

1139
01:28:57,503 --> 01:28:59,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I don't know.

1140
01:28:59,344 --> 01:29:00,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard of that.

1141
01:29:00,205 --> 01:29:02,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually would be fairly easy using Linux, I would think.

1142
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:05,208
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think they keep everything separated.

1143
01:29:05,809 --> 01:29:07,190
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't understand.

1144
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:08,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1145
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want more information, I urge you to follow them on Twitter.

1146
01:29:41,892 --> 01:29:45,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They're at twitter.com slash fundarazor I just linked it in chat.

1147
01:29:46,434 --> 01:29:52,097
[SPEAKER_04]: F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R They only have 10 followers right now.

1148
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:53,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for charity.

1149
01:29:53,318 --> 01:29:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have 10,000.

1150
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out that event near you.

1151
01:29:56,059 --> 01:29:57,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and go to the one in San Francisco.

1152
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm pretty sure I will be going.

1153
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I kind of told Seg I would, so I'm going to go and then probably take the next day off work so I can go.

1154
01:30:04,243 --> 01:30:05,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to go.

1155
01:30:05,084 --> 01:30:05,504
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go?

1156
01:30:05,704 --> 01:30:05,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1157
01:30:05,924 --> 01:30:06,965
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll cover it for OLR.

1158
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:07,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

1159
01:30:07,805 --> 01:30:08,565
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1160
01:30:37,657 --> 01:30:48,385
[SPEAKER_04]: and once more fans on Facebook I don't think I'm following them on Facebook yet so I will go add them myself a little later in the show but again that's F-U-N-D-E-R-A-Z-O-R and K.O.

1161
01:30:48,405 --> 01:31:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray is reminding us about Extra Life which is the marathon that's also happening on October 17th that we talked about last week Extra Life SG is their Twitter so two great events one in October one in December do them both think of the children damn you and how crunchy they are shush

1162
01:31:07,278 --> 01:31:13,021
[SPEAKER_04]: and Spazinator says PlayStation 3 firmware 3.0 unannounced or hidden feature.

1163
01:31:13,661 --> 01:31:16,923
[SPEAKER_04]: The addition of print screen and screenshot to the web browser.

1164
01:31:17,023 --> 01:31:17,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not aware.

1165
01:31:18,224 --> 01:31:18,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting.

1166
01:31:19,845 --> 01:31:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nothing you can't already do on a PC, but I guess it's kind of nice to have that on the PlayStation.

1167
01:31:25,248 --> 01:31:27,609
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that screenshotting is coming to home as well.

1168
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:31,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to do like a first person view so you can screenshot there.

1169
01:31:31,211 --> 01:31:32,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

1170
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that is going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1171
01:31:38,984 --> 01:31:39,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'll do one more.

1172
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,810
[SPEAKER_04]: TKL Ray says, uh, just beat Batman Arkham Asylum.

1173
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,671
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think of it?

1174
01:31:43,691 --> 01:31:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was beautiful.

1175
01:31:45,594 --> 01:31:47,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan was playing a lot of it while Misty was here.

1176
01:31:47,938 --> 01:31:48,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1177
01:31:48,338 --> 01:31:48,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um...

1178
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,522
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course, and who's also here right now, our other friend Mystique.

1179
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:57,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had Misty and Misty and me making commentary the entire time.

1180
01:31:57,604 --> 01:32:02,606
[SPEAKER_06]: We were doing the MST3K version of Batman Arkham Asylum and it was pretty funny.

1181
01:32:03,086 --> 01:32:05,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And then every time Harley came out, I was like, Harley!

1182
01:32:05,588 --> 01:32:05,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

1183
01:32:06,508 --> 01:32:08,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good, but I wish it had more of an ending.

1184
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:10,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're a fangirl of the comics.

1185
01:32:11,149 --> 01:32:11,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

1186
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:13,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And the comic series.

1187
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:14,390
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1188
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:14,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.

1189
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like DC Comics.

1190
01:32:16,311 --> 01:32:17,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you would like the show.

1191
01:32:17,912 --> 01:32:19,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I meant the comic book show.

1192
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:22,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I watch some of the animated series.

1193
01:32:22,873 --> 01:32:24,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the world's biggest Batman fan.

1194
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan loves it.

1195
01:32:26,294 --> 01:32:26,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan loves it.

1196
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:28,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not.

1197
01:32:28,315 --> 01:32:29,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystique just came in.

1198
01:32:30,075 --> 01:32:31,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Has Mystique ever been on the show?

1199
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:31,756
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1200
01:32:31,776 --> 01:32:31,816
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1201
01:32:32,556 --> 01:32:33,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Come here, Mystique.

1202
01:32:33,197 --> 01:32:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, come here, come here.

1203
01:32:33,817 --> 01:32:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's end Twitter topics.

1204
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:35,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk to Mystique for a little bit.

1205
01:32:35,839 --> 01:32:36,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mystique.

1206
01:32:36,579 --> 01:32:37,040
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1207
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:37,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up?

1208
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:38,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1209
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Just talk loud and strong in that microphone because it's kind of sensitive.

1210
01:32:43,004 --> 01:32:44,145
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want me to be that loud.

1211
01:32:45,586 --> 01:32:49,109
[SPEAKER_04]: You hold in your hand a bunch of DC, what is this, DVDs of movies?

1212
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:49,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1213
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:54,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Superman, the animated series, and Justice League Unlimited.

1214
01:32:55,074 --> 01:32:59,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys going to Mystery Science 3000, like the movie you were watching last week when I was here?

1215
01:33:00,057 --> 01:33:00,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

1216
01:33:00,778 --> 01:33:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

1217
01:33:01,699 --> 01:33:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of.

1218
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there might be fighting going on over the TV.

1219
01:33:07,232 --> 01:33:08,153
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a throwdown.

1220
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:09,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's going to be a throwdown.

1221
01:33:09,674 --> 01:33:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Batman Arkham Asylum?

1222
01:33:11,896 --> 01:33:20,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot wait to play that game, even though I watched a lot of it with Dan, although I'm really upset that I can't play the Joker in the Xbox 360.

1223
01:33:20,102 --> 01:33:21,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, because he has the 360 version.

1224
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:21,523
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the 360 version.

1225
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:27,770
[SPEAKER_07]: He just had to tell me after I made a decision of which one I was gonna buy.

1226
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, hmm, both of them went down in price.

1227
01:33:30,951 --> 01:33:35,132
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think I'm gonna get the 360 since I have Netflix and all that.

1228
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:39,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dan had to go and tell me, you know, on the PS3, you can play the Joker.

1229
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:40,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you're a bastard.

1230
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:43,645
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get a bigger room!

1231
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need a bigger box.

1232
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:10,364
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1233
01:34:10,724 --> 01:34:11,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to get a bigger boat.

1234
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:13,325
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a shark.

1235
01:34:13,645 --> 01:34:13,905
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1236
01:34:14,325 --> 01:34:14,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter topics.

1237
01:34:15,045 --> 01:34:15,966
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done with that for tonight.

1238
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys very much for contributing to Twitter topics.

1239
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some gaming news.

1240
01:34:20,967 --> 01:34:22,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Rapid Fire News is up next.

1241
01:34:22,868 --> 01:34:24,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So some quick gaming news starting from Loki.

1242
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:25,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1243
01:34:25,949 --> 01:34:31,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted 2, of course, is getting a collector's edition, which will be coming out with the game in October.

1244
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the collector's edition, you will be able to get a replica knife.

1245
01:34:36,234 --> 01:34:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because that's what gamers need things to stab stuff with.

1246
01:34:39,595 --> 01:34:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a knife.

1247
01:34:41,437 --> 01:34:41,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1248
01:34:42,497 --> 01:34:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a knife.

1249
01:34:45,499 --> 01:34:53,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's the Fortune Hunter edition, and it does come with the replica of the game's mysterious ancient artifact.

1250
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1251
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:58,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1252
01:34:58,672 --> 01:35:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it is going to be very limited, and I guess apparently only available through GameStop.

1253
01:35:04,453 --> 01:35:07,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, they get all the limited editions nowadays.

1254
01:35:07,974 --> 01:35:08,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

1255
01:35:09,814 --> 01:35:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami, in kind of a strange turn of events, is publishing the new 99 Nights game, 99 Nights 2, which, judging by the screenshot, looks way better than the first one.

1256
01:35:21,357 --> 01:35:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1257
01:35:23,257 --> 01:35:23,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5

1258
01:35:39,491 --> 01:35:41,432
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1259
01:36:03,525 --> 01:36:17,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And the week after that, they're going to be getting the AFI Track Pack, which is going to include Beautiful Thieves, Girls Not Grey, and The Missing Frame, also available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft Points.

1260
01:36:18,112 --> 01:36:22,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, of course, the Track Packs as a whole you can buy in a bundle for $5.49.

1261
01:36:22,674 --> 01:36:23,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally...

1262
01:36:26,249 --> 01:36:29,492
[SPEAKER_02]: September 24th we'll be getting another track pack.

1263
01:36:30,252 --> 01:36:41,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No name for this track pack, but apparently it includes the editors with Munich, Faint with Geeks Were Right, and the Yayayas with Dull Life.

1264
01:36:41,822 --> 01:36:44,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Also available for $2 each or $5.49 for the pack.

1265
01:36:46,025 --> 01:36:47,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

1266
01:36:48,407 --> 01:36:48,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Bit.Trip.Void

1267
01:37:13,004 --> 01:37:13,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1268
01:37:21,564 --> 01:37:23,285
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bit.Trip games are actually a lot of fun.

1269
01:37:23,305 --> 01:37:25,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they'll release a compilation of this a little later on.

1270
01:37:25,747 --> 01:37:26,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1271
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be a very fun game.

1272
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there is a release date yet announced for this.

1273
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:32,231
[SPEAKER_04]: They just say later this year.

1274
01:37:32,331 --> 01:37:33,691
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, it was playable at PAX.

1275
01:37:34,292 --> 01:37:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So some folks already got to play it.

1276
01:37:36,873 --> 01:37:41,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Attack is coming to the Nintendo DS.

1277
01:37:42,037 --> 01:37:43,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's a brand new game.

1278
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the arcade style controls like you see in Turtles in Time.

1279
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are going up against Shredder.

1280
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way this was also shown at PAX

1281
01:37:54,554 --> 01:37:56,976
[SPEAKER_04]: You lucky PAX attendees getting your hands on some early stuff.

1282
01:37:57,396 --> 01:38:04,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Another game that's coming out onto Xbox Live Arcade, Puzzle Bobble Live coming out in Japan.

1283
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:14,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It will probably make its way over here as Bust a Move Live or something like that over here in America because there's that whole fact that Bust a Move over here is actually Puzzle Bobble.

1284
01:38:14,907 --> 01:38:22,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Why they call it Bust a Move and then ruined the name of the actual Bust a Move game as Bust a Groove over here, I will never understand that.

1285
01:38:23,012 --> 01:38:23,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an answer for that.

1286
01:38:24,213 --> 01:38:26,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they call Puzzle Bobble Bust a Move here?

1287
01:38:26,535 --> 01:38:27,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're stupid.

1288
01:38:27,957 --> 01:38:28,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1289
01:38:28,337 --> 01:38:29,538
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes perfect sense.

1290
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:35,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the game's coming out in Japan on September 30th for 800 Microsoft points.

1291
01:38:35,964 --> 01:38:39,748
[SPEAKER_04]: No comment yet on North America or Europe release dates.

1292
01:38:40,428 --> 01:38:42,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the games will be ported soon enough.

1293
01:38:42,269 --> 01:38:44,609
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty standard game.

1294
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:50,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember on the PlayStation 2, Bust a Move was one of the first games that came out for it?

1295
01:38:50,651 --> 01:38:55,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the cover, it had a baby wearing sunglasses and had a big bubble that said Bust a Move.

1296
01:38:55,533 --> 01:38:56,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It made no sense.

1297
01:38:56,213 --> 01:38:57,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It made no sense at all.

1298
01:38:57,493 --> 01:39:00,374
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Bust a Move 2 that had the baby, I think, on the cover.

1299
01:39:00,394 --> 01:39:02,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, what the hell was that?

1300
01:39:03,095 --> 01:39:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: That just sums up in a nutshell the transition of Puzzle Bobble to Bust a Move.

1301
01:39:08,117 --> 01:39:08,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I just never understand.

1302
01:39:10,259 --> 01:39:10,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Never get it.

1303
01:39:12,022 --> 01:39:13,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochikawa says it's copyright infringement.

1304
01:39:13,885 --> 01:39:14,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget on what, though.

1305
01:39:15,508 --> 01:39:15,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1306
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1307
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1308
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:21,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some stuff.

1309
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, some kind of interesting news in looking at almost an international point of view.

1310
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:37,057
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, as in Japan, the PlayStation 3 sales have plummeted.

1311
01:39:37,617 --> 01:39:38,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

1312
01:39:38,758 --> 01:39:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: With, you know, my bad sound effects.

1313
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That actually...

1314
01:39:45,561 --> 01:39:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: is going ahead of the PS3 Slim launch.

1315
01:39:53,703 --> 01:39:58,565
[SPEAKER_06]: They've gone for the regular PS3.

1316
01:39:58,845 --> 01:40:04,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only sold 1,040 units with last week.

1317
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:07,027
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the Xbox 360 rose to sell 7,254 units.

1318
01:40:07,127 --> 01:40:08,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course...

1319
01:40:16,463 --> 01:40:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little bit of Nintendo sale drop but they're still pushing a lot of the DSi and DS Lite.

1320
01:40:29,665 --> 01:40:43,680
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other stuff going on, for some rock band news, there's a new PAX track that's going to be Freeze Pop, Jonathan Colton, MC Frontalot, and Paul and Storm.

1321
01:40:44,681 --> 01:40:47,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And each song will be $1 a piece.

1322
01:40:48,165 --> 01:40:49,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got that.

1323
01:40:49,786 --> 01:40:50,527
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole dollar?

1324
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:51,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1325
01:40:51,769 --> 01:40:55,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's Freeze Pop and Jonathan Colton and other bands that are pretty cool.

1326
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:57,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have both of those at least.

1327
01:40:58,291 --> 01:40:59,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last thing.

1328
01:40:59,372 --> 01:41:02,293
[SPEAKER_06]: This gets the facepalm award of the night.

1329
01:41:03,153 --> 01:41:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than those idiot people wanting to pull their children out of school so they can't see Obama's speech.

1330
01:41:08,755 --> 01:41:09,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So stupid.

1331
01:41:10,296 --> 01:41:18,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there's a special function for the six axis in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

1332
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have six axis support.

1333
01:41:22,253 --> 01:41:23,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it's going to do?

1334
01:41:25,636 --> 01:41:26,156
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what?

1335
01:41:26,276 --> 01:41:26,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Boob jiggle.

1336
01:41:28,058 --> 01:41:29,699
[SPEAKER_02]: You can control boob jiggle.

1337
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the next likely progression.

1338
01:41:33,001 --> 01:41:33,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1339
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:37,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I was telling Sauce earlier today.

1340
01:41:37,285 --> 01:41:41,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I bet the developers are sitting around going, we should do something with the six axis.

1341
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:43,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1342
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: What should we do?

1343
01:41:45,271 --> 01:41:46,572
[SPEAKER_06]: We could wiggle their boobies.

1344
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:47,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that works.

1345
01:41:49,134 --> 01:41:49,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1346
01:41:49,554 --> 01:41:51,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet the conversation went just like that, too.

1347
01:41:54,785 --> 01:41:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1348
01:41:56,366 --> 01:41:56,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

1349
01:41:57,147 --> 01:42:03,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some longer news that we'll talk a little more about, and then soon your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1350
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy about this or not, and we know that with the new updates, especially coming in the fall, that they're going to be having some support for Facebook support and stuff like that.

1351
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:18,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I know with the Xbox 360.

1352
01:42:18,901 --> 01:42:23,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's interesting, though, is apparently the game Blur coming out is going to have Twitter support.

1353
01:42:24,224 --> 01:42:25,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they can turn that off.

1354
01:42:39,848 --> 01:42:41,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you don't give it your login.

1355
01:42:41,248 --> 01:42:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you turn it off.

1356
01:42:42,429 --> 01:42:43,749
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds like a horrible idea.

1357
01:42:43,869 --> 01:42:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1358
01:42:44,469 --> 01:42:48,630
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a horrible, horrible idea that is just contributing to the problem.

1359
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:49,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't get me wrong.

1360
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:54,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Blur is an amazing-looking game, and I really enjoy the demo at E3.

1361
01:42:54,271 --> 01:42:55,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorites.

1362
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:57,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, the plug needs to be pulled on this immediately.

1363
01:42:58,151 --> 01:43:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you spam this shit to your Twitter and I'm following you right now, you will be dropped.

1364
01:43:01,852 --> 01:43:04,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Because unfortunately, and here's the problem with Twitter...

1365
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:08,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Raptor!

1366
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:54,790
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's nothing personal I just you know here's the thing it is personal with me by the way there's a finite amount of tweets that my iPhone Apple download at a time it's 200 tweets and if 20 of those tweets are your fucking friend feed or something I'm sorry that's gonna piss me off because that's 20 things I could have read about somebody else you know that might be like actually about their day or something interesting you know I just I am not a fan of these auto tweets at all and kind of and think they're gonna destroy Twitter

1367
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:57,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless something is done about them very soon.

1368
01:43:57,371 --> 01:43:59,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know this is not going to be the first or last thing.

1369
01:44:00,112 --> 01:44:01,953
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Activision destroy something?

1370
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, a beloved guitar franchise?

1371
01:44:05,735 --> 01:44:11,977
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just so strange, though, because, you know, usually Bizarre Creations is... We've had them on the show.

1372
01:44:12,017 --> 01:44:13,018
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a great studio.

1373
01:44:13,638 --> 01:44:17,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand, you know, they're just trying to be on the cutting edge of technology.

1374
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:20,001
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do it really with Facebook.

1375
01:44:20,201 --> 01:44:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we're misinterpreting this.

1376
01:44:22,522 --> 01:44:35,409
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'll give credit there maybe we need clarification on how exactly this is going to work and I think it's pretty obvious to say if you don't give this game your Twitter login it can't do it so to some extent you're going to have to want it to post to Twitter for you but why?

1377
01:44:35,929 --> 01:44:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the part I failed to see why is this useful?

1378
01:44:40,212 --> 01:44:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other thing too is apparently it's going to feature like a faux social networking site like InnerTube I guess it's their bizarre version of YouTube or something

1379
01:44:52,234 --> 01:44:55,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have real Twitter support as well.

1380
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:56,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1381
01:44:56,959 --> 01:45:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fine if you have updates and stuff like that, but that's something more like Facebook because at least then you can filter it out.

1382
01:45:03,386 --> 01:45:07,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But Twitter, I don't want to see updates about stuff like that.

1383
01:45:08,271 --> 01:45:08,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1384
01:45:08,891 --> 01:45:14,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it gives you the option, like say you won first place and you get the option, do you want to tweet this or not?

1385
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a little more tolerable depending on how often people do it.

1386
01:45:19,906 --> 01:45:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little iffy on it, though.

1387
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:22,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I still say this.

1388
01:45:23,831 --> 01:45:24,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't do it.

1389
01:45:25,213 --> 01:45:26,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't bother with it.

1390
01:45:26,715 --> 01:45:32,121
[SPEAKER_04]: If my Twitter gets filled up with blur race updates, then I can't read that so-and-so just took a big poop.

1391
01:45:33,002 --> 01:45:34,243
[SPEAKER_04]: on Twitter, you know?

1392
01:45:34,864 --> 01:45:38,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And isn't that what Twitter's really about is what you ate for breakfast this morning?

1393
01:45:38,807 --> 01:45:42,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, with the new action or whatever.

1394
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:44,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I am actually starting to get really annoyed with Twitter.

1395
01:45:45,192 --> 01:45:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a love-hate thing with Twitter.

1396
01:45:46,653 --> 01:45:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of dumb shit on Twitter, but at the same time, I found it to be really good for networking and getting the information out there.

1397
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:55,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been really good for the show.

1398
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,761
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I use it for.

1399
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I use it for a lot of my networking now.

1400
01:46:00,564 --> 01:46:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I use it for OLR Foodio.

1401
01:46:03,888 --> 01:46:05,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, now there's a new hashtag.

1402
01:46:06,329 --> 01:46:09,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki invented a new hashtag, and the thing is, people are using it that listen to this show.

1403
01:46:10,052 --> 01:46:14,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just me, but I saw three other people using the new OLR Foodio tweet.

1404
01:46:15,555 --> 01:46:25,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm somewhere torn between this is really funny, and I just think Twitter needs to take some cues from Facebook and give us better ways to filter content.

1405
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:26,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really what they need.

1406
01:46:26,081 --> 01:46:28,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually been using my Facebook a whole lot more than Twitter now.

1407
01:46:28,863 --> 01:46:31,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, simply because of a lot of the reasons that you just mentioned.

1408
01:46:31,865 --> 01:46:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1409
01:46:32,952 --> 01:46:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bochikawa in chat makes a very good point.

1410
01:46:35,733 --> 01:46:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Poop is greater than race win.

1411
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:38,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1412
01:46:40,073 --> 01:46:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1413
01:46:42,454 --> 01:46:44,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, Blur getting Twitter support.

1414
01:46:44,994 --> 01:46:47,695
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see exactly how that plays out a little later on.

1415
01:46:48,275 --> 01:46:54,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Meantime, one game that's not going to have Twitter support, but it'll have support for your balance board is, of course, Wii Fit+.

1416
01:46:54,816 --> 01:46:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And a release date has been announced for Wii Fit+.

1417
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:58,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on October 4th.

1418
01:46:59,717 --> 01:47:01,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the great thing about Wii Fit Plus.

1419
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:05,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how a lot of us were thinking that Nintendo's just going to price gouge on this?

1420
01:47:06,182 --> 01:47:06,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1421
01:47:06,762 --> 01:47:07,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost $20.

1422
01:47:07,943 --> 01:47:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Fit Plus is only going to set you back $20.

1423
01:47:10,645 --> 01:47:14,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Now keep in mind that's if you already have a balance board.

1424
01:47:14,408 --> 01:47:19,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So they figure if you have a balance board, then they got you once already with Wii Fit because they don't sell the balance board separately, do they?

1425
01:47:21,634 --> 01:47:25,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to get rid of the SKU that is the Wii Fit...

1426
01:47:26,517 --> 01:47:29,899
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad news, which you forgot to mention, was now they also raised the price of that bundle by $10.

1427
01:47:46,426 --> 01:47:47,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

1428
01:47:47,146 --> 01:47:49,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I'll be $99.99 for that bundle.

1429
01:47:49,527 --> 01:47:57,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you didn't get in on the ground floor of Wii Fit, which I'm going to tell you this much, if you didn't get in on the ground floor of that, you're not missing out.

1430
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:57,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1431
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:05,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're dumb enough to buy the game by itself, no offense, but it's almost the same game again.

1432
01:48:05,533 --> 01:48:07,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why you'd buy the same game again.

1433
01:48:07,113 --> 01:48:08,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because there are some extra things in it.

1434
01:48:08,674 --> 01:48:10,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the little mini-games were kind of cute.

1435
01:48:11,395 --> 01:48:14,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're going to buy that Wii Play or whatever...

1436
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: You spend an extra $10 to get Wii Play and none of those games are good.

1437
01:48:21,103 --> 01:48:21,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1438
01:48:23,824 --> 01:48:24,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1439
01:48:24,285 --> 01:48:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying it.

1440
01:48:27,446 --> 01:48:30,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the same way as you about Wii Fit.

1441
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:34,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the point behind Wii Fit and I actually kind of like it.

1442
01:48:35,691 --> 01:48:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you actually make it a point to play the game every day, some exercise is better than none.

1443
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:58,602
[SPEAKER_04]: you know granted it's not the best thing you could be doing you could be lifting weights or you could be running or jogging but you know if it's kind of a nice meet you in the middle type of thing and I think that's what Wii Fit's always been about right?

1444
01:48:59,303 --> 01:49:13,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's trying to make exercising more fun for kids and non-kids who are just not as motivated they should just have you bench press the board and make it way more I'll have to put D cell batteries in it to make it a little heavier

1445
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just put in big old 9 volts.

1446
01:49:17,285 --> 01:49:19,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually considering picking it.

1447
01:49:19,407 --> 01:49:19,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only $20.

1448
01:49:19,788 --> 01:49:21,851
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that bad considering.

1449
01:49:22,091 --> 01:49:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it supposed to have some internet stuff too where you're going to be able to compare with friends around the globe?

1450
01:49:26,096 --> 01:49:27,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait for the peer used.

1451
01:49:27,278 --> 01:49:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will.

1452
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:29,770
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

1453
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:30,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll do that.

1454
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:31,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1455
01:49:31,711 --> 01:49:36,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Takeo Ray in our chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com, says, My friend's aunt lost 40 pounds using Wii Fit.

1456
01:49:36,873 --> 01:49:37,734
[SPEAKER_04]: She swears by it.

1457
01:49:38,794 --> 01:49:41,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Loomies in chat says, It's all about your diet and how consistent you are.

1458
01:49:42,095 --> 01:49:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's kind of true, too, is that you can't expect that you play Wii Fit by itself for like 10 minutes a day and that anything major is going to happen.

1459
01:49:50,199 --> 01:49:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of has to be part of a greater lifestyle adjustment.

1460
01:49:53,860 --> 01:50:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why and I also noticed that xlink in chat says I'll play my EA active you know one thing about EA active is that EA active kind of encourages you as well to be eating and doing other stuff you know doing exercises besides just EA active I don't think it implements it very well but at least it kind of makes it a point to emphasize that as a part of the game as well yeah because I mean it's you can't just do one or I mean you could do one or the other but they're more effective done together

1461
01:50:22,662 --> 01:50:31,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, I mean, to be honest, I think one website I think has been very good for this, you know, when I was kind of trying to lose weight and I still am to an extent.

1462
01:50:32,324 --> 01:50:44,206
[SPEAKER_04]: One website I found that I really enjoyed was Spark People, which is actually a pretty good website where you can monitor your food intake and you monitor your exercise and how many glasses of water you drink a day and everything.

1463
01:50:44,546 --> 01:50:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I really liked the way Spark People was set up.

1464
01:50:46,667 --> 01:50:50,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, and it has an iPhone app, which was the other big thing about that that was cool.

1465
01:50:50,448 --> 01:50:51,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would definitely recommend that.

1466
01:50:52,848 --> 01:50:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1467
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:54,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

1468
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:14,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that makes perfect sense.

1469
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:15,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people like that.

1470
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of one of them.

1471
01:51:17,871 --> 01:51:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go out and run.

1472
01:51:18,911 --> 01:51:20,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a gym person at all.

1473
01:51:21,092 --> 01:51:24,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a friend really, really trying to get me to go to the gym.

1474
01:51:24,272 --> 01:51:25,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of on the fence.

1475
01:51:25,533 --> 01:51:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1476
01:51:27,873 --> 01:51:31,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind going to the gym, but I usually hide myself in the weight room.

1477
01:51:32,554 --> 01:51:36,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is sometimes kind of really nerve-wracking, especially when you have all the guys there.

1478
01:51:36,835 --> 01:51:38,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I have a problem with all the guys there or anything.

1479
01:51:39,396 --> 01:51:41,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that I don't like going out.

1480
01:51:42,477 --> 01:51:43,258
[SPEAKER_06]: with all the guys there.

1481
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:47,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's probably some people listen to us like, come on, you pussies.

1482
01:51:48,304 --> 01:51:49,765
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't explain it.

1483
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:57,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I'm the only girl there and there's like 10 guys that just got off the basketball court all pumping away, so I'm like, yeah, bye.

1484
01:51:58,856 --> 01:51:59,957
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on with some more news.

1485
01:52:00,117 --> 01:52:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I could take them.

1486
01:52:02,571 --> 01:52:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Bench press them.

1487
01:52:27,762 --> 01:52:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1488
01:52:45,996 --> 01:52:54,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can see who has the best mental, physical, their best knowledge too.

1489
01:52:54,851 --> 01:53:00,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they get a job as a game tester with the PlayStation QA department in San Diego.

1490
01:53:01,772 --> 01:53:02,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

1491
01:53:02,593 --> 01:53:04,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel completely different from Jamie.

1492
01:53:04,554 --> 01:53:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think all reality TV is trash.

1493
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:07,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You watch Big Brother.

1494
01:53:07,436 --> 01:53:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of it is trash.

1495
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:11,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like reality shows that are basically modern game shows.

1496
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, in my opinion, Big Brother is a game show as is Survivor is a game show of sorts.

1497
01:53:17,442 --> 01:53:19,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've always liked game shows of all different types.

1498
01:53:19,763 --> 01:53:21,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not bothered by those shows.

1499
01:53:22,025 --> 01:53:26,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And even to an extent, I can tolerate some of those like VH1 and Bravo shows.

1500
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:28,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Project Runway is pretty good too.

1501
01:53:28,829 --> 01:53:29,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of that.

1502
01:53:29,369 --> 01:53:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Runway though is...

1503
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,331
[SPEAKER_06]: More like a design contest.

1504
01:53:32,391 --> 01:53:37,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, you can't say you hate reality shows and then say, but this one's okay.

1505
01:53:37,473 --> 01:53:40,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this to me, though, is like, what was the Trump one?

1506
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:41,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The Apprentice?

1507
01:53:42,535 --> 01:53:43,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated that show.

1508
01:53:44,736 --> 01:53:50,399
[SPEAKER_04]: See, The Apprentice is okay, but my biggest problem with it is that it basically came down to one dude's opinion.

1509
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:51,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it would have been better if there was a board.

1510
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I don't want to get into diagnosing all these reality shows.

1511
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:56,522
[SPEAKER_04]: What I don't like is like...

1512
01:53:58,074 --> 01:54:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: This VH1 is getting so saturated with these shows.

1513
01:54:00,936 --> 01:54:04,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned on the other day, it was like the Terrell Owens reality show or something.

1514
01:54:04,738 --> 01:54:05,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, really?

1515
01:54:06,058 --> 01:54:06,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1516
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1517
01:54:07,759 --> 01:54:09,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just a lot of these types of shows, like the dating shows.

1518
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:10,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I want unreality.

1519
01:54:10,961 --> 01:54:11,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much, too much.

1520
01:54:12,021 --> 01:54:13,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me back my unreality.

1521
01:54:13,982 --> 01:54:15,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I want sitcoms.

1522
01:54:15,623 --> 01:54:22,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's the funniest part about this reality show, is we've known game testers, and it's not as glamorous as you would think.

1523
01:54:23,167 --> 01:54:26,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I actually wanted to get to, is that the prize here...

1524
01:54:26,889 --> 01:54:28,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it, is not very good.

1525
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And no offense to the game testers I know out there.

1526
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:34,992
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you work very hard for very little money.

1527
01:54:35,493 --> 01:54:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I don't understand this whole glamorization of the gaming testing.

1528
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that hard to get into, I don't think, either.

1529
01:54:45,577 --> 01:54:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be offended, but it's kind of an entry-level position.

1530
01:54:48,418 --> 01:54:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how you get your foot in the door at gaming companies.

1531
01:54:50,539 --> 01:54:53,260
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people take that and work up to something a lot bigger.

1532
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:56,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't a prize on a reality game show be something bigger?

1533
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:57,142
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1534
01:55:16,828 --> 01:55:17,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what this is going to be?

1535
01:55:17,809 --> 01:55:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just going to be a holiday tie-in.

1536
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:21,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a free download on PlayStation Network.

1537
01:55:21,271 --> 01:55:25,714
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be product placement after product placement of all these Sony upcoming games.

1538
01:55:26,435 --> 01:55:27,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a terrible idea.

1539
01:55:28,016 --> 01:55:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, especially if it's a free show.

1540
01:55:29,637 --> 01:55:30,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll enter.

1541
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:31,158
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

1542
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:31,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I enter?

1543
01:55:32,278 --> 01:55:32,899
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to enter?

1544
01:55:33,479 --> 01:55:36,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't quit my day job, but if you want to enter and move to San Diego...

1545
01:55:36,946 --> 01:55:39,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I like San Diego, but I sure as hell don't want to live there

1546
01:55:58,274 --> 01:56:02,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this show is really about giving someone a once-in-a-lifetime dream opportunity.

1547
01:56:02,637 --> 01:56:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this show is going to be nothing but non-stop product placement for holiday Sony games.

1548
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:08,841
[SPEAKER_04]: But granted, it's a pretty clever way to do it.

1549
01:56:09,201 --> 01:56:10,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Patty said something funny.

1550
01:56:10,902 --> 01:56:13,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I was... Yeah, go ahead and read it.

1551
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:16,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a great suggestion for reality TV.

1552
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:17,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Life with my grandma.

1553
01:56:20,188 --> 01:56:22,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't know how compelling that would be.

1554
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless your grandma competes in the X Games, then I would watch a show like that.

1555
01:56:27,921 --> 01:56:30,026
[SPEAKER_06]: or she was like a serial killer grandma.

1556
01:56:30,266 --> 01:56:30,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1557
01:56:31,870 --> 01:56:35,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I would watch a show called Serial Killer Grandma.

1558
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:38,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have that on Discovery Channel?

1559
01:56:38,504 --> 01:56:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1560
01:56:40,271 --> 01:56:48,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I will check out an episode of this and see if it's any good, but I just kind of have a feeling it's just going to be product placement and trailers I can download somewhere else on PlayStation Network.

1561
01:56:48,674 --> 01:56:49,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1562
01:56:50,435 --> 01:56:57,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that this winner might be testing out is the brand new 3D support for the PlayStation 3.

1563
01:56:58,438 --> 01:57:01,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is kind of...

1564
01:57:02,990 --> 01:57:03,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1565
01:57:04,811 --> 01:57:15,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat, but at the same time, it's not that special because in order for you to be able to use it, you need one of those brand new TVs that can refresh at over 200 hertz.

1566
01:57:15,417 --> 01:57:15,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1567
01:57:19,019 --> 01:57:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a problem and not a lot of people have those TVs right now but if you happen to do and you have the special stereoscopic glasses for that then you can actually play some of the games one of them of course Wipeout in 3D and that will be coming out in 2010 I know actually sooner than that they're going to be doing that with Avatar but once again you need that really high end TV and right now there's like maybe 5 different TVs out there that have that kind of feature for them

1568
01:57:49,402 --> 01:58:17,627
[SPEAKER_02]: you think this might be the future of gaming though because when we see things like this I kind of go okay well maybe it's for a certain group of people right now but could it be the future of gaming it's cutting edge yes but it might be too cutting edge like you know it's too early because you know people aren't going to upgrade their TV just to get one of these TVs that does you know 200 hertz until they start coming out with like a lot of 3D movies and stuff and this stuff comes down in price but right now I mean I guess they can claim that they were the first to do this or something I don't know

1569
01:58:19,878 --> 01:58:27,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, they can't claim it as their first disc, because now that I think of it, because if Avatar is coming out on both the 360 and PS3, then they will be doing it at the same time.

1570
01:58:27,984 --> 01:58:30,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't, like, Rad Racer on the NES in 3D?

1571
01:58:31,747 --> 01:58:35,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that was, like, with those, you know, the red-blue glasses.

1572
01:58:35,249 --> 01:58:36,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't the Virtual Boy in 3D?

1573
01:58:37,831 --> 01:58:39,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The amazing migraine machine?

1574
01:58:40,193 --> 01:58:46,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, that was actually true 3D, but this, though, yeah, I don't know.

1575
01:58:46,738 --> 01:58:47,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat...

1576
01:58:47,578 --> 01:58:50,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of don't want to see gaming go all 3D like this.

1577
01:58:50,601 --> 01:58:59,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and saw Up in 3D, which don't get me wrong, great movie, had a great time, but I kind of had a little bit of a headache after for watching that for like 90 minutes.

1578
01:59:00,332 --> 01:59:05,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though they say you're supposed to take a break every hour when you play video games, you guys know that's not how it goes.

1579
01:59:05,297 --> 01:59:06,999
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll sit there and play a video game for four hours.

1580
01:59:07,299 --> 01:59:08,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Until you gotta pee.

1581
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:08,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1582
01:59:09,421 --> 01:59:10,702
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1583
01:59:32,973 --> 01:59:35,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, HD and all that stuff.

1584
01:59:35,074 --> 01:59:38,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because people... It's the progression that's going to go in.

1585
01:59:38,116 --> 01:59:42,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what their push is for cinema right now is more 3D.

1586
01:59:42,578 --> 01:59:44,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, eventually that's going to move to the home market.

1587
01:59:45,579 --> 01:59:48,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it makes sense that games are going to go in that direction.

1588
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since, you know, hey, 3D might come in handy when, like, Project Intel comes out.

1589
01:59:53,824 --> 01:59:58,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, these games are going to be using the, you know, Sony motion capture thing that they're going to have.

1590
01:59:59,026 --> 02:00:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you might need to see stuff in 3D space in that sense.

1591
02:00:01,908 --> 02:00:02,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1592
02:00:03,345 --> 02:00:03,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1593
02:00:04,346 --> 02:00:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cheap right now, though.

1594
02:00:06,507 --> 02:00:11,670
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to buy a monitor for your PC and the stereoscopic glasses, it's going to set you back $500.

1595
02:00:13,376 --> 02:00:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty cheap, you know, compared to an HDTV.

1596
02:00:16,439 --> 02:00:18,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but technology is going to come down in price eventually.

1597
02:00:18,881 --> 02:00:19,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, it will.

1598
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:25,086
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, remember when HDTVDs, or sorry, I just, I can't talk anymore.

1599
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:31,011
[SPEAKER_04]: HDTVs, remember when those were like thousands of dollars to get an HDTV?

1600
02:00:31,071 --> 02:00:33,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, like this Christmas, I think you're going to see those things.

1601
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:33,633
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the Vega.

1602
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:35,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Flying off the shelves, yeah.

1603
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:36,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the big deal?

1604
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:37,090
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like $5,000.

1605
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:39,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I have two DX and a Vega.

1606
02:00:39,811 --> 02:00:40,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1607
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:42,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a lot of that was faux HD, too.

1608
02:00:42,232 --> 02:00:44,013
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those Vegas didn't even really do HD.

1609
02:00:44,513 --> 02:00:48,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I mean, technology's going to come down in price.

1610
02:00:48,414 --> 02:00:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It always does, right?

1611
02:00:51,375 --> 02:00:51,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1612
02:00:53,076 --> 02:00:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1613
02:00:53,656 --> 02:00:56,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it doesn't, it kills the thing, too, you know?

1614
02:00:56,817 --> 02:00:58,638
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, because, you know, not everybody's rich.

1615
02:00:59,338 --> 02:00:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1616
02:00:59,659 --> 02:01:00,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to keep in mind.

1617
02:01:01,494 --> 02:01:04,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go back to our chat room, chat.orangelandreda.com and read some comments.

1618
02:01:04,837 --> 02:01:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a comment on the last story about the whole reality television from Salacious Pop.

1619
02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:10,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there.

1620
02:01:10,422 --> 02:01:15,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Says, if I recall correctly, the Penny Arcade guys were doing something reality based at Penny Arcade Expo.

1621
02:01:16,147 --> 02:01:20,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a mini doc for the DVD or a standalone thing or what.

1622
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:26,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, being a person that hates all reality television, would you hate a Penny Arcade documentary as well?

1623
02:01:27,267 --> 02:01:30,209
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between a reality TV show and a documentary.

1624
02:01:30,409 --> 02:01:30,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?

1625
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:31,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1626
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:33,171
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the difference?

1627
02:01:34,192 --> 02:01:37,514
[SPEAKER_06]: The documentary being that it's set for an informative purpose.

1628
02:01:37,695 --> 02:01:40,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Its purpose is not necessarily entertainment.

1629
02:01:40,757 --> 02:01:46,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It is to give you the information regarding a particular situation, a historical event, or an individual.

1630
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:48,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't a documentary be entertaining?

1631
02:01:49,743 --> 02:01:53,266
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I said not necessarily just for entertainment.

1632
02:01:53,286 --> 02:01:53,506
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1633
02:01:53,766 --> 02:01:58,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Reality TV is supposed to be, oh, here's your slice of how other people live.

1634
02:01:59,509 --> 02:02:11,216
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, if you took a documentary to Somalia to see about the results of the war and their own little mafia thing going on there.

1635
02:02:11,756 --> 02:02:21,262
[SPEAKER_06]: and you get unfiltered information or if it's filtered it's just to make it slightly more palatable but it's not scripted.

1636
02:02:21,622 --> 02:02:23,583
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what's going on.

1637
02:02:23,844 --> 02:02:25,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's inquisitive.

1638
02:02:26,085 --> 02:02:26,926
[SPEAKER_06]: It's editorial.

1639
02:02:27,326 --> 02:02:29,087
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what is going on.

1640
02:02:29,407 --> 02:02:32,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas reality TV is in the end a manufactured reality.

1641
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:35,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

1642
02:02:37,172 --> 02:02:38,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was kind of curious.

1643
02:02:38,913 --> 02:02:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's a pretty...

1644
02:02:41,567 --> 02:02:43,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1645
02:02:57,992 --> 02:03:14,200
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that has me kind of thinking about, though, is that, you know, I bet there would be a lot of people that would be interested in watching something like that, kind of a behind-the-scenes thing at PAX, and even though, you know, it was commented that it's probably going to be for a DVD, wouldn't it be kind of neat if this was a downloadable exclusive on PlayStation Network or Xbox 360?

1646
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's done a lot of work with Penny Arcade.

1647
02:03:16,101 --> 02:03:16,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be cool.

1648
02:03:16,901 --> 02:03:19,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even, like, you know what might be a really cool tie-in?

1649
02:03:19,502 --> 02:03:22,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Have it be something that's on Xbox 360 Netflix.

1650
02:03:22,784 --> 02:03:26,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it on Netflix as an instant queue title, and then people could watch it.

1651
02:03:27,548 --> 02:03:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be worthwhile.

1652
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:29,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty cool.

1653
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:37,394
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I think that is something that if PlayStation Network is going to make up this reality show or whatever, that should also be an avenue that they should think about doing.

1654
02:03:37,835 --> 02:03:39,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe Microsoft will beat them to the punch.

1655
02:03:39,656 --> 02:03:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1656
02:03:41,097 --> 02:03:49,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating these shows about behind-the-scenes development of games or fandom, I guess you could say in this case, or expos, whatever it is.

1657
02:03:49,762 --> 02:03:50,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, you know...

1658
02:03:52,304 --> 02:03:59,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like what I was watching today, Dan, because you know pretty much my favorite type of sports car is the Bugatti Veyron, right?

1659
02:03:59,851 --> 02:04:11,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dan was showing me the video for Forza 2 about how they got the Bugatti license and were mapping out the car, how it was done, the meat of how they...

1660
02:04:13,605 --> 02:04:16,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That type of stuff is always interesting to me.

1661
02:04:16,128 --> 02:04:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I love behind the scenes stuff in movies.

1662
02:04:18,632 --> 02:04:20,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I like watching the how they do that type thing.

1663
02:04:22,338 --> 02:04:24,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I did love watching Ripley's Believe It or Not.

1664
02:04:26,576 --> 02:04:27,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Unwrapped on the Food Network

1665
02:04:45,924 --> 02:04:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate it, I just don't love it.

1666
02:04:49,206 --> 02:04:54,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you've seen the same episode over and over and they start reusing some of their segments on other episodes.

1667
02:04:54,868 --> 02:04:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that, I'll give you that.

1668
02:04:56,048 --> 02:04:56,989
[SPEAKER_04]: They do need to make some new stuff.

1669
02:04:57,009 --> 02:04:59,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, this episode's the stuff that's packaged in plastic.

1670
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:01,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this episode's about baskets.

1671
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:03,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this episode's about Cheez Whiz.

1672
02:05:04,272 --> 02:05:05,972
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, I don't care.

1673
02:05:06,012 --> 02:05:07,573
[SPEAKER_12]: There was an episode on Cheez Whiz?

1674
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:09,414
[SPEAKER_12]: No, there was not an episode on Cheez Whiz.

1675
02:05:09,634 --> 02:05:12,575
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's been like three episodes about picnics and there's like...

1676
02:05:12,995 --> 02:05:15,399
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they show how they make picnic baskets.

1677
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care, that has nothing to do with food.

1678
02:05:20,216 --> 02:05:22,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What about those little, don't they call those picnics?

1679
02:05:22,117 --> 02:05:24,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Those little potato fried things you can buy and then forget it?

1680
02:05:25,438 --> 02:05:30,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what is a weird show that's kind of along the lines of Unwrapped?

1681
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:33,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how it's made or something like that.

1682
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:35,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the most random stuff put together.

1683
02:05:35,682 --> 02:05:44,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this episode you're going to learn how they make galvanized steel, doorknobs, bowling balls, and mayonnaise.

1684
02:05:44,546 --> 02:05:46,526
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, what the fuck is that?

1685
02:05:47,147 --> 02:05:47,627
It's like...

1686
02:05:48,448 --> 02:05:49,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I like those.

1687
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:50,069
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so random.

1688
02:05:50,129 --> 02:05:50,850
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, ooh, steel.

1689
02:05:51,131 --> 02:05:51,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, doorknobs.

1690
02:05:52,032 --> 02:05:52,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

1691
02:05:53,073 --> 02:05:59,440
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was just out of high school, there was a show that used to come on, and I don't think, I think this was before the day of the Food Network.

1692
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:04,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to come on where they would show you how to make snacks that you buy in the grocery store, like they showed how to make Twinkies.

1693
02:06:06,567 --> 02:06:07,608
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1694
02:06:24,786 --> 02:06:25,366
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

1695
02:06:25,466 --> 02:06:26,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than Scat before it.

1696
02:06:26,848 --> 02:06:35,558
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to remember, when our buddy Keith worked at Scandia, we ran that fucking joint when we wanted to do a tournament.

1697
02:06:35,899 --> 02:06:37,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did the most random things.

1698
02:06:37,701 --> 02:06:39,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the employees there must have hated us.

1699
02:06:40,064 --> 02:06:41,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And so did all the customers, which is...

1700
02:06:41,946 --> 02:06:43,587
[SPEAKER_06]: But we stayed and helped cleaned up.

1701
02:06:43,687 --> 02:06:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

1702
02:06:44,287 --> 02:06:44,567
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

1703
02:06:44,608 --> 02:06:47,269
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we did a really awesome tournament there and probably brought up some new business.

1704
02:06:47,569 --> 02:06:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did the most random stuff.

1705
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:54,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We turned the birthday party room into a station where you could buy fried Twinkies.

1706
02:06:54,973 --> 02:06:55,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we did.

1707
02:06:55,494 --> 02:06:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep fried Twinkies.

1708
02:06:56,694 --> 02:06:58,555
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell that has to do with video games?

1709
02:06:58,575 --> 02:06:59,436
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Irene.

1710
02:06:59,456 --> 02:07:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1711
02:07:00,856 --> 02:07:01,457
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Irene.

1712
02:07:02,267 --> 02:07:02,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I, I, I

1713
02:07:32,523 --> 02:07:33,744
[SPEAKER_06]: We should just have RandomCon.

1714
02:07:34,004 --> 02:07:37,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki presents the Baconator station or something.

1715
02:07:37,807 --> 02:07:38,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you.

1716
02:07:38,467 --> 02:07:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1717
02:07:40,448 --> 02:07:44,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We are seriously kicking around an idea of doing an all-bacon party for my birthday.

1718
02:07:44,851 --> 02:07:46,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.

1719
02:07:46,092 --> 02:07:47,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't your birthday already happen?

1720
02:07:47,332 --> 02:07:48,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it's coming up.

1721
02:07:48,113 --> 02:07:48,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Friday.

1722
02:07:49,013 --> 02:07:50,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you should do it.

1723
02:07:50,374 --> 02:07:51,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're thinking about it.

1724
02:07:52,155 --> 02:07:53,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Have some bacon fried bacon.

1725
02:07:53,836 --> 02:07:55,197
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not bacon frying bacon.

1726
02:07:55,597 --> 02:07:56,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just redundant.

1727
02:07:57,915 --> 02:07:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look, look.

1728
02:07:58,715 --> 02:08:01,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get to some more comments because we had some funny stuff on Unwrapped.

1729
02:08:01,717 --> 02:08:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: We had two fans of Unwrapped in chat.

1730
02:08:03,678 --> 02:08:06,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Takeo Ray says, Unwrapped is the best show on Food Network.

1731
02:08:06,199 --> 02:08:07,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, Unwrapped is awesome.

1732
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:12,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop says, that show makes me lull because I'm like, oh, go jump in some Gak Mark Summers.

1733
02:08:13,383 --> 02:08:14,704
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't.

1734
02:08:15,244 --> 02:08:16,845
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got that whole OCD thing going on.

1735
02:08:16,865 --> 02:08:17,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1736
02:08:17,465 --> 02:08:18,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see this documentary?

1737
02:08:18,345 --> 02:08:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about Double Dare.

1738
02:08:19,426 --> 02:08:20,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It scared him.

1739
02:08:20,447 --> 02:08:26,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, because he's... What type of phobia is it where you're afraid of messes?

1740
02:08:28,177 --> 02:08:28,939
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1741
02:08:36,294 --> 02:08:40,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ranma in chat simply says, fuck Unwrapped, Good Eats is better.

1742
02:08:41,376 --> 02:08:42,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Alton Brown is pretty awesome.

1743
02:08:42,837 --> 02:08:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look.

1744
02:08:43,297 --> 02:08:44,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I do agree, Good Eats is better.

1745
02:08:44,738 --> 02:08:47,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough food, let's get to emails.

1746
02:08:47,779 --> 02:08:48,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't eat emails.

1747
02:08:49,019 --> 02:08:52,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if you could, DarkSakura would have eaten one by now.

1748
02:08:52,341 --> 02:08:53,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, nope, you're wrong.

1749
02:08:53,081 --> 02:08:54,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have thrown them up.

1750
02:08:54,261 --> 02:08:59,964
[SPEAKER_02]: You could print out emails on that paper that they use to print photos on a cake, then you could eat emails.

1751
02:09:01,224 --> 02:09:02,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true!

1752
02:09:03,956 --> 02:09:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a contest where we eat somebody's email one night live on air.

1753
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:10,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Have your email eaten by a castle.

1754
02:09:10,842 --> 02:09:12,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the printer for that.

1755
02:09:12,543 --> 02:09:13,324
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have to take it out.

1756
02:09:13,604 --> 02:09:14,585
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does that cost?

1757
02:09:15,025 --> 02:09:15,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1758
02:09:15,466 --> 02:09:16,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that much.

1759
02:09:19,289 --> 02:09:20,050
[SPEAKER_06]: People are sick.

1760
02:09:21,812 --> 02:09:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag!

1761
02:09:22,873 --> 02:09:28,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura, dive into the email bag and read us some emails.

1762
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:30,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what?

1763
02:09:31,123 --> 02:09:34,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the first one comes from DeathWishing, which is actually the last email I received.

1764
02:09:35,889 --> 02:09:41,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have wrote, it's written, this message from a place called Howie's Game Shack.

1765
02:09:42,156 --> 02:09:44,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I went to Guitar Hero 5 and it is fucking amazing.

1766
02:09:45,038 --> 02:09:47,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the best one in the franchise.

1767
02:09:47,801 --> 02:09:48,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

1768
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird, but seriously, you gotta try it out.

1769
02:09:50,343 --> 02:09:57,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Just skip Smash Hits Van Halen and Metallica and any other weird, or weird, I should say, because he spelled it the same way twice.

1770
02:09:58,529 --> 02:10:02,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, any other weird, weird tie in games, they will make.

1771
02:10:02,673 --> 02:10:04,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he said, weird tie.

1772
02:10:06,436 --> 02:10:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyber Cafe loved Death Wishing.

1773
02:10:08,097 --> 02:10:09,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he meant weird tie in game.

1774
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1775
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1776
02:10:12,273 --> 02:10:13,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1777
02:10:26,249 --> 02:10:34,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey OLR, I was looking on the net and I heard if you have a PSP Go and a PS3, you can pair up the PS3 controller with the PSP Go to have dual analog sticks.

1778
02:10:34,097 --> 02:10:36,639
[SPEAKER_02]: A half-assed way to solve that problem, analog sticks.

1779
02:10:50,718 --> 02:10:54,061
[SPEAKER_06]: and make you buy more stuff from them.

1780
02:10:54,121 --> 02:10:54,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem solved.

1781
02:10:54,842 --> 02:10:55,222
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1782
02:10:55,643 --> 02:11:05,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I recently bought a UMID AM1, a 4-inch netbook, and it can play high-def games.

1783
02:11:05,854 --> 02:11:11,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it looks stupid with the USB hub, external CD-ROM, and a controller sticking out of it, but it is a good thing to know.

1784
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:11,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye!

1785
02:11:11,977 --> 02:11:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1786
02:11:36,474 --> 02:11:44,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, that feature isn't any good unless your PSP games actually support it, but I guess maybe it's a trend that'll be starting.

1787
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:45,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a PS3, and you're near your PS3.

1788
02:11:45,682 --> 02:11:55,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, but I was talking about earlier in the show, there's a lot of hidden functionality between the PS3 and the PSP that Sony does a really poor job at advertising that is very cool.

1789
02:11:55,330 --> 02:12:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Like playing the PSP on your TV, like if you did that DualShock thing, you could put your Resistance game on your TV and play with the DualShock controller.

1790
02:12:03,857 --> 02:12:04,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1791
02:12:05,543 --> 02:12:08,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed DarkSakura was looking at a little thing for Dissida.

1792
02:12:08,324 --> 02:12:10,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the download demo of that.

1793
02:12:10,884 --> 02:12:12,965
[SPEAKER_06]: This is part of the soundtrack.

1794
02:12:13,145 --> 02:12:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1795
02:12:14,685 --> 02:12:16,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get a grasp on the game.

1796
02:12:16,586 --> 02:12:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.

1797
02:12:18,687 --> 02:12:19,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was button mashing.

1798
02:12:19,827 --> 02:12:20,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all the game is?

1799
02:12:20,627 --> 02:12:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Button mashing with Final Fantasy characters?

1800
02:12:21,807 --> 02:12:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not exactly.

1801
02:12:22,548 --> 02:12:22,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1802
02:12:22,868 --> 02:12:24,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't figure out the strategy behind it.

1803
02:12:24,308 --> 02:12:25,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the demo was set up very well.

1804
02:12:26,008 --> 02:12:27,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It needed a tutorial or something.

1805
02:12:27,829 --> 02:12:28,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe I'm just stupid.

1806
02:12:28,949 --> 02:12:29,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine too.

1807
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:31,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah.

1808
02:12:32,139 --> 02:12:32,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1809
02:12:32,899 --> 02:12:33,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1810
02:12:33,519 --> 02:12:33,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

1811
02:12:34,459 --> 02:12:34,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1812
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,860
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from Dragon, by the way.

1813
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:41,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been listening to your podcast for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.

1814
02:12:41,781 --> 02:12:45,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to say I don't know why so many people are complaining about the cost of the PSP Go.

1815
02:12:45,762 --> 02:12:51,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in Toronto, Canada and a PSP 3000 costs $167 and a 16GB memory stick costs $139 so the PSP Go is a good deal for a new player.

1816
02:12:51,623 --> 02:12:53,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the great work on your podcast.

1817
02:12:59,508 --> 02:13:00,969
[SPEAKER_02]: A 6 gigabyte memory stick, he said?

1818
02:13:00,989 --> 02:13:00,969
16.

1819
02:13:01,530 --> 02:13:04,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1820
02:13:04,712 --> 02:13:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, get the bundle.

1821
02:13:05,533 --> 02:13:08,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much it would cost Canadian, but it can't be much more than it is here.

1822
02:13:08,775 --> 02:13:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got a bundle, because my old PSP was kind of dying, so I actually just picked up a PSP 3000 this week.

1823
02:13:13,238 --> 02:13:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a $199 bundle that came with the PSP 3000, a 4 gig memory stick, School of Rock little code you can use, which whatever, I don't really care for Jack Black, but I'll just download it because it was free, and then Rock Band Unplugged all came with it.

1824
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:31,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that wasn't a bad deal at all for the PS3 3000.

1825
02:13:31,992 --> 02:13:36,255
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, the PSP Go is, what, $50 cheaper than a PlayStation 3 is now?

1826
02:13:36,755 --> 02:13:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got, like, less features than a PSP 3000.

1827
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:43,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... That's where the logic fails me.

1828
02:13:43,919 --> 02:13:45,380
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to go PSP, go PSP 3000.

1829
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:45,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

1830
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, you can find memory sticks pretty cheap.

1831
02:13:48,102 --> 02:13:49,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other thing, too.

1832
02:13:50,764 --> 02:13:51,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1833
02:13:52,136 --> 02:13:54,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you really need 16GB of storage.

1834
02:13:54,857 --> 02:13:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're buying games on there, I mean, I don't think you need that.

1835
02:13:58,358 --> 02:14:03,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hell, when I was putting ISOs on there, I didn't need that amount of space.

1836
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:09,221
[SPEAKER_02]: 4GB at the most, maybe, and then... I mean, how many games do you plan on storing on there?

1837
02:14:09,281 --> 02:14:16,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need 16GB on a PSP Go because that's all you can do is download stuff, but you're going to be playing a lot of your games off UMDs anyways.

1838
02:14:16,503 --> 02:14:19,744
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no reason to get the Go other than, ooh, look, it slides.

1839
02:14:21,284 --> 02:14:25,168
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, my comments on Final Fantasy Dissida kind of got the chatroom talking about that a little bit.

1840
02:14:25,268 --> 02:14:28,831
[SPEAKER_04]: AlphaCananagram says, the demo doesn't do it justice, and he puts demo in caps.

1841
02:14:29,412 --> 02:14:32,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Geovadea says, Dissida is fucking amazing, I heart it.

1842
02:14:32,835 --> 02:14:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And AlphaCananagram wants you to know he is playing Dissida right now, a level 100 Onion Knight on hardcore play mode.

1843
02:14:39,681 --> 02:14:41,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe I'll have to check out the full game at some point.

1844
02:14:43,137 --> 02:14:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the last email, and I'm kind of not going to say who it's coming from, but he also didn't say who he got it from, but it's an email that was sent out to Disney cast members.

1845
02:14:56,759 --> 02:14:57,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, okay.

1846
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:20,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel's business meshes perfectly with ours and what we've all been doing to maximize the value of Disney's creative properties across our business, media platforms, and geographical markets.

1847
02:15:20,772 --> 02:15:23,414
[SPEAKER_06]: and then goes on to talk about Pixar.

1848
02:15:23,734 --> 02:15:24,795
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the other line.

1849
02:15:25,156 --> 02:15:35,263
[SPEAKER_06]: The acquisition of Marvel offers us a similar opportunity to advance that strategy, meaning putting out things all over the world for using it for marketing purposes.

1850
02:15:37,785 --> 02:15:53,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sort of, maybe I'm reading a bit more into this, but since they've been talking about use of the Marvel brand and, you know, the consumer market, I have a feeling we're going to start seeing actual, especially since this was sent out to cast members, meaning I think it's the park.

1851
02:15:54,938 --> 02:15:57,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that we might start seeing characters in the parks.

1852
02:15:59,299 --> 02:16:02,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, that's also going to mean games.

1853
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to mean movies.

1854
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:06,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to mean more things.

1855
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:07,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen tomorrow.

1856
02:16:07,662 --> 02:16:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not tomorrow, but I'm saying down the line.

1857
02:16:09,382 --> 02:16:10,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

1858
02:16:10,922 --> 02:16:12,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Their licenses aren't going to run until 2015, 2017.

1859
02:16:12,843 --> 02:16:13,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's that long.

1860
02:16:17,084 --> 02:16:25,251
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and what else is interesting, and for some reason, the whole story about Disney buying Marvel didn't make tonight's show roll, but I'm sure everybody read about it somewhere on the internet.

1861
02:16:25,272 --> 02:16:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't get away from it.

1862
02:16:26,473 --> 02:16:39,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought what was very interesting about when that story hit is that you just saw all this, like, frickin' cross-fanboy wank all over the internet all at once about, like, OMG, there's gonna be Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters, and, like, just all this stuff that ain't happenin'.

1863
02:16:39,864 --> 02:16:41,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Run my ass if Spider-Man was going to be in Toy Story 4.

1864
02:17:08,738 --> 02:17:11,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a cool 3D thing at Disneyland.

1865
02:17:11,319 --> 02:17:14,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe we'll get a cool Marvel ride at California Adventure or whatever.

1866
02:17:14,561 --> 02:17:15,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll bring back the 7th Portal.

1867
02:17:16,282 --> 02:17:17,502
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be a while.

1868
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:19,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Marvel have an agreement with other theme parks?

1869
02:17:19,343 --> 02:17:20,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I know DC does.

1870
02:17:20,884 --> 02:17:24,866
[SPEAKER_04]: DC is what you see all over Magic Mountain and the Six Flags.

1871
02:17:24,926 --> 02:17:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see the 7th Portal come back.

1872
02:17:27,748 --> 02:17:28,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

1873
02:17:28,168 --> 02:17:30,369
[SPEAKER_06]: You went on that with me at Great America.

1874
02:17:31,636 --> 02:17:39,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think Disney is going to mean that Marvel is going to run the same way Disney does.

1875
02:17:39,262 --> 02:17:40,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think a lot of people are jumping to conclusions.

1876
02:17:40,863 --> 02:17:42,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma also said Darkwing Duck and the Avengers.

1877
02:17:43,025 --> 02:17:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney, fund it.

1878
02:17:44,926 --> 02:17:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft says The Incredibles vs. Fantastic Four.

1879
02:17:48,209 --> 02:17:49,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is the best.

1880
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:49,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop.

1881
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:52,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be on board for a Deadpool-Hannah-Montana crossover.

1882
02:17:53,653 --> 02:17:55,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I would totally be down for that.

1883
02:17:55,335 --> 02:17:55,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1884
02:17:56,075 --> 02:17:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1885
02:17:58,257 --> 02:17:59,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Not happening.

1886
02:18:00,405 --> 02:18:01,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be so down for that.

1887
02:18:01,325 --> 02:18:04,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, hey, the Kingdom Hearts with Marvel characters is kind of a neat idea.

1888
02:18:05,787 --> 02:18:07,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not going to happen right away.

1889
02:18:07,167 --> 02:18:10,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hell, we don't even know when Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to happen, if anytime soon.

1890
02:18:13,649 --> 02:18:18,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, Rob Roberts, yeah, but Disney already pulled the old budget cuts on one of their publishing arms.

1891
02:18:18,971 --> 02:18:19,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

1892
02:18:20,233 --> 02:18:20,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1893
02:19:02,793 --> 02:19:05,094
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really have anything to inspire the FUs tonight.

1894
02:19:05,134 --> 02:19:05,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a story.

1895
02:19:06,274 --> 02:19:09,635
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about that guy that said that video games were poison or whatever?

1896
02:19:09,695 --> 02:19:11,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll dedicate the FUs tonight to him.

1897
02:19:11,656 --> 02:19:12,496
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gundam guy.

1898
02:19:12,857 --> 02:19:14,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I had something, actually.

1899
02:19:14,657 --> 02:19:15,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1900
02:19:15,177 --> 02:19:15,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Already.

1901
02:19:16,798 --> 02:19:22,000
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're supposed to be doing Obama's speech in public schools on the 8th.

1902
02:19:24,810 --> 02:19:27,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I feel about this whole political, but okay, go for it.

1903
02:19:27,451 --> 02:19:30,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's really, it's an encouragement to stay in school.

1904
02:19:30,953 --> 02:19:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

1905
02:19:31,853 --> 02:19:35,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great that, you know, that this is going out.

1906
02:19:35,114 --> 02:19:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sign that, you know, our president does care about children instead of, you know, Bush going, how do you read?

1907
02:19:44,698 --> 02:19:50,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, what really pisses me off are all those people who say, oh, well...

1908
02:19:51,281 --> 02:19:56,304
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to interrupt my kids' school day, so I'm going to not let them go to school that day.

1909
02:19:59,106 --> 02:20:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes no sense.

1910
02:20:00,086 --> 02:20:03,228
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes my brain go, what?

1911
02:20:03,949 --> 02:20:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1912
02:20:04,809 --> 02:20:05,130
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1913
02:20:05,950 --> 02:20:10,733
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, especially when all the schools are making arrangements for parents who don't want their children to see the...

1914
02:20:15,999 --> 02:20:18,860
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1915
02:20:39,969 --> 02:20:44,350
[SPEAKER_04]: My whole thing with the people just need to stop thinking in one extreme or the other.

1916
02:20:45,031 --> 02:20:48,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you when all is said and done, nobody is blue and nobody is red.

1917
02:20:48,412 --> 02:20:49,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's a little bit purple.

1918
02:20:50,152 --> 02:20:56,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the whole like taking kids out of school as some type of political statement or whatever is just too extreme.

1919
02:20:57,154 --> 02:21:01,476
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that they're doing it not so that their education isn't interrupted.

1920
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch the speech.

1921
02:21:03,239 --> 02:21:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Let your children watch the speech and then talk about it.

1922
02:21:06,642 --> 02:21:07,382
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, be a fucking parent.

1923
02:21:30,653 --> 02:21:32,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of being a parent, yeah, true.

1924
02:21:32,374 --> 02:21:35,657
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to make sure that your child's not going to see anything harmful.

1925
02:21:36,237 --> 02:21:40,281
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you can't protect them from every damn little thing that you don't want them to see.

1926
02:21:41,562 --> 02:21:42,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the real world is.

1927
02:21:44,124 --> 02:21:47,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met people who've grown up sheltered, and they're frightening people.

1928
02:21:48,047 --> 02:21:49,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that...

1929
02:21:51,872 --> 02:21:53,453
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1930
02:22:16,957 --> 02:22:24,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you Rockstar for getting rid of my modded Grand Theft Auto games and it's absolutely ruined the whole Grand Theft Auto experience for the two of us.

1931
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1932
02:22:26,181 --> 02:22:28,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I will find a way around it like I always do.

1933
02:22:30,062 --> 02:22:32,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say something that's a total inside joke.

1934
02:22:32,523 --> 02:22:35,384
[SPEAKER_04]: There's maybe like two or three people listening that would understand this.

1935
02:22:35,745 --> 02:22:38,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just going to give a big F you this week to exclamation points.

1936
02:22:41,247 --> 02:22:42,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

1937
02:22:42,807 --> 02:22:43,888
[SPEAKER_04]: F you exclamation points.

1938
02:22:45,097 --> 02:22:45,757
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1939
02:23:15,235 --> 02:23:22,459
[SPEAKER_02]: and also the ability to sync up your voice with the player's mouth movements, so it actually makes it look like they're talking.

1940
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:27,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, it's really, really cool.

1941
02:23:28,502 --> 02:23:37,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they do have an animation system, I guess that's intelligent enough to turn your audio stream into lip-syncing for the on-screen characters.

1942
02:23:38,668 --> 02:23:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

1943
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:44,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I guess it's neat that they're offering all these things.

1944
02:23:44,201 --> 02:23:47,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if we will actually see a lot of Makima videos for this.

1945
02:23:48,663 --> 02:23:52,904
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting when gaming companies kind of really embrace the whole Makima thing, you know?

1946
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1947
02:23:54,824 --> 02:24:01,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I liked about this story was that they're really kind of showing that off and leaving it to people's creativity to make whatever they're going to make.

1948
02:24:02,007 --> 02:24:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really interesting how more and more gaming companies really embrace it.

1949
02:24:04,908 --> 02:24:05,648
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I mean...

1950
02:24:06,604 --> 02:24:08,526
[SPEAKER_04]: XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation XTAL Corporation

1951
02:24:35,748 --> 02:24:37,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Sexbox.

1952
02:24:37,729 --> 02:24:46,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this company, they're going to be making a video game system that only plays interactive adult only rated video game titles.

1953
02:24:46,775 --> 02:24:47,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yes.

1954
02:24:48,448 --> 02:24:49,089
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

1955
02:25:07,859 --> 02:25:19,646
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, as well as specializing in the adult-only games, the Sexbox will also give its owners access to adult-only content and entertainment in all sorts of other digital forms.

1956
02:25:20,267 --> 02:25:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming this means like streaming movies and video and all that.

1957
02:25:24,249 --> 02:25:33,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Audio, video, HDTV, DVD, online, gaming, social networking, webcams, video on demand, downloading, movie rentals, purchases, etc., etc., etc.

1958
02:25:33,955 --> 02:25:36,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything but real fucking games.

1959
02:25:37,048 --> 02:25:41,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Only because the technology doesn't exist yet.

1960
02:25:42,068 --> 02:25:42,628
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1961
02:25:42,748 --> 02:25:44,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you seem to be a big advocate for this Xbox.

1962
02:25:44,929 --> 02:25:47,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this something legit or is this just teehee?

1963
02:25:47,370 --> 02:26:00,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way they're going to approach it is going to be teehee, but I'm all about a system that will allow publishers, assuming that they actually want to put out stuff on this system, the opportunity to put out games uncensored.

1964
02:26:01,314 --> 02:26:09,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we're probably going to see a lot of porno games that are probably going to be crap, but at the same time, if they want to release a really fucking crazy version of Manhunt 2 or something like that,

1965
02:26:10,217 --> 02:26:10,858
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do it.

1966
02:26:11,098 --> 02:26:15,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I applaud that, but at the same time, I think it's going to be kind of lame.

1967
02:26:15,703 --> 02:26:20,689
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that being said, assuming that the games on there look pretty decent, I will probably pick one of these up.

1968
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:22,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it will be funny.

1969
02:26:22,251 --> 02:26:24,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go, hee hee, I have a sex box.

1970
02:26:27,476 --> 02:26:28,017
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1971
02:26:29,499 --> 02:26:30,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for...

1972
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:34,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten into this rant a long time ago on this show.

1973
02:26:35,003 --> 02:26:41,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for sexier video games and all this and just downloading porn on your PlayStation 3 and Xbox.

1974
02:26:41,127 --> 02:26:45,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why the companies don't want to open Pandora's Box and that whole thing, but why not?

1975
02:26:46,010 --> 02:27:01,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just because we have this whole stigma in our society where the violence is okay, Manhunt 2 is okay, and a lot of these games and the Saw movies are fine, but heaven forbid we show a cock or some bush, and I'm not talking about a president,

1976
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:04,621
[SPEAKER_04]: On the television, you know, it's just, I'll never get it.

1977
02:27:05,321 --> 02:27:09,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But granted, how can you make a serious game out of sex?

1978
02:27:09,882 --> 02:27:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of these AO games we've seen, like the Three Feel and stuff, those are all a little silly.

1979
02:27:15,664 --> 02:27:20,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they are a little silly, but also some of the games that do get an AO rating, it's really silly what they're getting it for.

1980
02:27:20,965 --> 02:27:24,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would be fine with seeing legitimate games, just maybe push...

1981
02:27:25,006 --> 02:27:25,667
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1982
02:27:40,303 --> 02:27:50,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they put some real time and investment into making a serious game out of it to just really wow everybody instead of all these cheap games that just have titties and stuff.

1983
02:27:50,947 --> 02:27:53,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Make an epic fuck quest or something like that.

1984
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily with sex, but over-the-top violence.

1985
02:27:58,609 --> 02:28:04,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Something absolutely crazy where you can just rip parts off of people and it's gruesomely detailed and stuff like that.

1986
02:28:05,452 --> 02:28:06,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want violence.

1987
02:28:06,352 --> 02:28:08,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I want cock and titty.

1988
02:28:08,753 --> 02:28:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I like violence.

1989
02:28:10,515 --> 02:28:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I like, I want violence.

1990
02:28:12,096 --> 02:28:17,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, you'll play a cock and a titty that goes around ripping your limbs off of people.

1991
02:28:17,241 --> 02:28:17,741
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1992
02:28:17,761 --> 02:28:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Deekman in chat says, rip parts off of people and fuck them with it.

1993
02:28:21,825 --> 02:28:22,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew, you're dirty.

1994
02:28:23,146 --> 02:28:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with you?

1995
02:28:23,927 --> 02:28:25,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a game called Naked Slayer.

1996
02:28:25,548 --> 02:28:25,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1997
02:28:25,888 --> 02:28:26,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Naked Slayer.

1998
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Naked Slayer.

1999
02:28:28,851 --> 02:28:30,192
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play either a guy or a girl.

2000
02:28:30,853 --> 02:28:33,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You can choose, you know, whatever their orientation is.

2001
02:28:33,515 --> 02:28:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And they run around naked, killing people.

2002
02:28:37,265 --> 02:28:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2003
02:28:48,506 --> 02:28:55,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop in chat says, apparently they're still making Leisure Suit Larry games, though Sierra and the dude who originally made them have nothing to do with it, and they're terrible.

2004
02:28:55,611 --> 02:28:56,251
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2005
02:28:56,912 --> 02:29:00,815
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, that last one had an AO-rated version, and it was pretty bad.

2006
02:29:00,855 --> 02:29:01,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are making still a new one.

2007
02:29:01,955 --> 02:29:02,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new one.

2008
02:29:02,836 --> 02:29:06,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They had that Magna Cum Laude or whatever that was a little stupid, and they have a new one coming out, right?

2009
02:29:07,259 --> 02:29:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember hearing a story on that earlier.

2010
02:29:09,741 --> 02:29:12,283
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a new one that came out a while ago that was kind of eh.

2011
02:29:13,604 --> 02:29:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea by Salacious Pop.

2012
02:29:16,045 --> 02:29:17,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Layton goes to Bonertown.

2013
02:29:20,766 --> 02:29:21,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Professor Layton.

2014
02:29:22,447 --> 02:29:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Layton, that's funny.

2015
02:29:25,568 --> 02:29:29,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole social networking thing, though, could be interesting.

2016
02:29:29,589 --> 02:29:29,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

2017
02:29:31,184 --> 02:29:35,765
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people really unleash their sexuality when they're hiding behind a computer monitor.

2018
02:29:36,245 --> 02:29:40,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might be able to find people that are into the same freaky shit you might be into.

2019
02:29:40,626 --> 02:29:44,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, let me think of a fetish that not a lot of people are into that's not completely disgusting.

2020
02:29:44,767 --> 02:29:48,828
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually, you can actually quote Patton Oswalt on that.

2021
02:29:48,948 --> 02:29:49,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2022
02:29:49,869 --> 02:29:56,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking about that there's a magazine for, you know, for every fetish that you think is so dirty and awful, there's a magazine about it.

2023
02:29:56,370 --> 02:29:56,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2024
02:29:56,810 --> 02:29:57,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Piss drinkers.

2025
02:29:57,831 --> 02:29:58,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, bleh.

2026
02:29:59,712 --> 02:30:01,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm sure there's people into that, so whatever.

2027
02:30:02,257 --> 02:30:09,433
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm saying that's the perfect... I'm trying to think of something that's not totally disgusting that I can use as an example.

2028
02:30:09,473 --> 02:30:10,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's one.

2029
02:30:11,149 --> 02:30:13,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have a food fight fetish.

2030
02:30:14,151 --> 02:30:16,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to have sex after a food fight.

2031
02:30:16,952 --> 02:30:23,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Like getting really dirty, just rubbing around in pies and salads and stuff.

2032
02:30:23,495 --> 02:30:24,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2033
02:30:24,456 --> 02:30:25,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a food fight.

2034
02:30:25,936 --> 02:30:27,697
[SPEAKER_04]: No one has a salad food fight.

2035
02:30:27,857 --> 02:30:29,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard about this on the radio.

2036
02:30:29,358 --> 02:30:29,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

2037
02:30:30,659 --> 02:30:31,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

2038
02:30:31,419 --> 02:30:40,604
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a food fight fetish or whatever, you could go onto this sex box console, find somebody else with the same fetish as you, and then have some safe fun together.

2039
02:30:43,064 --> 02:30:44,144
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with that?

2040
02:30:44,724 --> 02:30:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as these consoles preach safety and not things that are illegal like ripping parts off of dead people and fucking them with them, that's not legal.

2041
02:30:55,309 --> 02:31:06,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But as long as this encourages safe, legal things within boundaries with consenting adults that have to prove that they are adults in order to even be able to log into this service, why not?

2042
02:31:08,556 --> 02:31:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

2043
02:31:12,003 --> 02:31:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo Shannon Chat says, Rob, you should give Angel's Feather a try.

2044
02:31:15,225 --> 02:31:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically a game with Final Fantasy type story and battles plus some porn on the side.

2045
02:31:20,449 --> 02:31:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds amazing.

2046
02:31:21,930 --> 02:31:22,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to check this game out.

2047
02:31:23,231 --> 02:31:23,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please do.

2048
02:31:23,811 --> 02:31:25,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That again is called Angel's Feather.

2049
02:31:27,173 --> 02:31:29,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it actually has anime too.

2050
02:31:31,256 --> 02:31:31,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

2051
02:31:32,357 --> 02:31:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Poppet Chat says, I don't think ants should be a possible consequence of sex.

2052
02:31:40,757 --> 02:31:42,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, People Have Balloon Fetishes

2053
02:32:06,179 --> 02:32:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't there any, like, Pie Pod fetishes?

2054
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Pie Pod from, like, Nickelodeon?

2055
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:13,740
[SPEAKER_02]: They should seriously have them.

2056
02:32:14,121 --> 02:32:16,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like, you know, the people that make those sex machines.

2057
02:32:17,041 --> 02:32:20,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the sex machine stuff with a food fetish in there as well.

2058
02:32:21,062 --> 02:32:23,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be the interactive game on the sex box.

2059
02:32:23,602 --> 02:32:24,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Pie Pod.

2060
02:32:25,182 --> 02:32:26,003
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2061
02:32:30,043 --> 02:32:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this show has just gone to shit tonight.

2062
02:32:32,324 --> 02:32:33,284
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a yowie game.

2063
02:32:34,096 --> 02:32:35,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, is it a Yaoi game?

2064
02:32:35,337 --> 02:32:35,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like.

2065
02:32:36,038 --> 02:32:37,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times, good times.

2066
02:32:37,038 --> 02:32:37,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All male cast.

2067
02:32:37,999 --> 02:32:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype line time, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2068
02:32:44,084 --> 02:32:45,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and feel free to give us a call.

2069
02:32:45,785 --> 02:32:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we are going to go to Loki for some last minute stories.

2070
02:32:49,368 --> 02:32:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming he has some.

2071
02:32:50,618 --> 02:32:53,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku

2072
02:33:17,699 --> 02:33:19,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, I'm just like at a hookah bar right now.

2073
02:33:19,541 --> 02:33:21,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Just figured I'd drop in, just say what's up.

2074
02:33:22,704 --> 02:33:24,065
[SPEAKER_10]: You at a hookah bar?

2075
02:33:24,205 --> 02:33:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have never guessed.

2076
02:33:25,166 --> 02:33:25,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hookah too.

2077
02:33:25,966 --> 02:33:26,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you having fun?

2078
02:33:28,349 --> 02:33:28,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

2079
02:33:28,889 --> 02:33:33,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've already, you know, I've already gotten in some cheap hookah right now.

2080
02:33:33,133 --> 02:33:36,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like had my first cider, my first hard cider.

2081
02:33:37,457 --> 02:33:41,080
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, just like been keeping up on what's been going on in PAX.

2082
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:49,462
[SPEAKER_10]: especially the fact that one of the guys in Xbox Live had this little quote-unquote sermon about the Banhammer.

2083
02:33:49,482 --> 02:33:51,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually called on Kotaku earlier today.

2084
02:33:52,063 --> 02:33:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not hear about this.

2085
02:33:52,903 --> 02:33:53,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about it.

2086
02:33:55,224 --> 02:33:55,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

2087
02:33:56,244 --> 02:33:58,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear about this whole spiel, what happened there.

2088
02:33:58,285 --> 02:33:59,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about what happened.

2089
02:34:00,386 --> 02:34:10,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was basically one of the guys who works for Microsoft for Xbox Live who's in charge of maintaining order within there and the one that wields the Banhammer and he was basically just

2090
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:15,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, you know, giving a speech in the form of an actual, like, religious sermon.

2091
02:34:16,432 --> 02:34:39,499
[SPEAKER_10]: The way he's using, like, a lot of religious terms in terms of how he managed to wield the, you know, in other words, like, the name, like, the gamer tags, and how, you know, they get banned, and then he's saying, like, but this god is merciful, even though, you know, and he'll give you a second chance if you use any banned term in your gamer tags.

2092
02:34:40,874 --> 02:34:43,196
[SPEAKER_10]: and then the other one, and then this other thing.

2093
02:34:43,876 --> 02:34:44,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on a sec.

2094
02:34:44,637 --> 02:34:46,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did it.

2095
02:34:46,658 --> 02:34:47,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sure, we can hold.

2096
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:52,342
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, he was basically saying stuff about, like, um, the...

2097
02:34:53,482 --> 02:34:54,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still here.

2098
02:34:54,062 --> 02:34:56,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're about to head out, but I'm actually still good for talking.

2099
02:35:19,352 --> 02:35:23,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, give us any final thoughts, quickly, because we do want to get some other calls.

2100
02:35:23,453 --> 02:35:34,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, I heard that the new WiiWare game, that Contra game, that's supposed to be really hard to tell, that you can't even get through.

2101
02:35:34,077 --> 02:35:39,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was already out in Japan earlier this year, but I figured that it might present a challenge to folks.

2102
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:42,620
[SPEAKER_10]: The original Contra was hard as hell.

2103
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:46,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anybody that can beat it without the up, up, down, down, left, right code?

2104
02:35:46,561 --> 02:35:47,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan can.

2105
02:35:48,171 --> 02:35:48,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's a freak.

2106
02:36:16,713 --> 02:36:18,014
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the Japanese version.

2107
02:36:19,295 --> 02:36:26,600
[SPEAKER_10]: But even then, he's just shrugging it off because he's pretty much a classic gamer in that sense.

2108
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:30,302
[SPEAKER_10]: A challenge like that wouldn't be a no-brainer.

2109
02:36:30,703 --> 02:36:32,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird that they haven't released that over here in the U.S.

2110
02:36:33,004 --> 02:36:34,625
[SPEAKER_04]: yet, though, but I guess soon enough.

2111
02:36:34,705 --> 02:36:34,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2112
02:36:34,966 --> 02:36:38,388
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to come out tomorrow.

2113
02:36:38,768 --> 02:36:40,469
[SPEAKER_10]: It only came out in Europe.

2114
02:36:40,649 --> 02:36:43,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they dumb it down for us Americans like they usually do.

2115
02:36:46,339 --> 02:36:49,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they dumbed it down for the Americans like they usually do then.

2116
02:36:49,524 --> 02:36:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard the folks in Kotaku were complaining about the fact that it was pretty damn hard.

2117
02:36:56,313 --> 02:36:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2118
02:36:57,314 --> 02:36:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Zaku, we gotta let you go.

2119
02:36:59,097 --> 02:37:00,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun at the hookah bar.

2120
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke one for us, alright?

2121
02:37:03,837 --> 02:37:04,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will.

2122
02:37:04,658 --> 02:37:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

2123
02:37:05,679 --> 02:37:06,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good day, Rudy.

2124
02:37:26,881 --> 02:37:28,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Light another one, dude!

2125
02:37:28,783 --> 02:37:32,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The hookah bar does not get you high, Rob.

2126
02:37:32,285 --> 02:37:33,326
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know it doesn't.

2127
02:37:33,386 --> 02:37:35,027
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it's really fun to blow smoke bubbles.

2128
02:37:35,768 --> 02:37:37,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I had hookah once.

2129
02:37:37,889 --> 02:37:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so back to the Data East collection here.

2130
02:37:40,831 --> 02:37:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the games are going to be included with it.

2131
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:52,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical Drop 3, Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, Burger Time, Caveman Ninja, Street Slam, and Secret Agent.

2132
02:37:52,519 --> 02:37:54,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many ninjas, as if there was such a thing.

2133
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:58,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's pretty awesome.

2134
02:38:00,463 --> 02:38:01,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to another call.

2135
02:38:01,483 --> 02:38:02,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2136
02:38:02,524 --> 02:38:02,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2137
02:38:03,544 --> 02:38:05,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm DSMaster25.

2138
02:38:05,545 --> 02:38:07,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, DSMaster25.

2139
02:38:08,006 --> 02:38:08,727
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind?

2140
02:38:10,387 --> 02:38:11,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, scratch that.

2141
02:38:11,868 --> 02:38:11,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm 26.

2142
02:38:12,388 --> 02:38:14,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I aged.

2143
02:38:15,610 --> 02:38:22,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, I've been playing a whole lot of old school titles.

2144
02:38:22,833 --> 02:38:23,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what?

2145
02:38:23,273 --> 02:38:24,174
[SPEAKER_11]: For the past few weeks now.

2146
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:34,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying my best at trying to beat Contra for the Super C, for the Super NES.

2147
02:38:37,526 --> 02:38:38,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to you.

2148
02:38:38,686 --> 02:38:39,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

2149
02:38:40,067 --> 02:38:40,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

2150
02:38:40,567 --> 02:38:42,948
[SPEAKER_04]: What is with all the Contra revival tonight?

2151
02:38:42,968 --> 02:38:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two Contra calls in a row.

2152
02:38:44,869 --> 02:38:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That is some strange anomaly.

2153
02:38:47,089 --> 02:38:48,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rite of passage, Rob.

2154
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

2155
02:38:49,910 --> 02:38:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: For the life of any young gamer, the rite of passage is making it to Contra.

2156
02:38:52,992 --> 02:38:53,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

2157
02:38:53,632 --> 02:38:57,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Super C on the Super Nintendo was badass, and everybody should play it once.

2158
02:38:57,453 --> 02:39:00,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Those Mode 7 stages were pretty awesome, but I just find it very strange.

2159
02:39:00,854 --> 02:39:02,855
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had two calls about Contra back-to-back.

2160
02:39:03,115 --> 02:39:05,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Is every caller going to ask about Contra tonight?

2161
02:39:06,212 --> 02:39:08,294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just Contra I've been playing.

2162
02:39:09,355 --> 02:39:19,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, this homebrew version of DDR for the Nintendo DS I came across called DSDS Revolution.

2163
02:39:20,264 --> 02:39:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would hope you don't dance on your DS.

2164
02:39:22,185 --> 02:39:22,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You might break it.

2165
02:39:24,067 --> 02:39:29,811
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's like... Did you guys ever come across the old Game Boy...

2166
02:39:31,075 --> 02:39:33,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I played the Game Boy Color ones.

2167
02:39:33,877 --> 02:39:34,797
[SPEAKER_04]: They were hideous.

2168
02:39:35,038 --> 02:39:37,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a way to memorize step charts on the go.

2169
02:39:37,619 --> 02:39:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really the only reason I have it.

2170
02:39:40,381 --> 02:39:49,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, basically, okay, the controls seem to do multiple arrows and everything with using A and B for the up and right arrows.

2171
02:39:50,007 --> 02:39:56,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, DSDS Revolution seems to do the same exact thing, which is weird.

2172
02:39:57,169 --> 02:40:21,125
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course I got the new R4i so I can play my homebrew stuff on my DSi and I'll say here it sounds a whole lot better than it did on my DS Lite but other than that I've mostly been trying to play some of my old Genesis games my Genesis doesn't work anymore which sucks what was that on Genesis?

2173
02:40:22,864 --> 02:40:24,626
[SPEAKER_11]: My Genesis does not work anymore.

2174
02:40:25,566 --> 02:40:26,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

2175
02:40:26,147 --> 02:40:26,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear that.

2176
02:40:26,968 --> 02:40:30,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, get that freaking collection on the 360 or PS3.

2177
02:40:30,391 --> 02:40:31,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

2178
02:40:31,071 --> 02:40:32,332
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like tons of games on it.

2179
02:40:33,634 --> 02:40:35,215
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but here's the cool thing, though.

2180
02:40:35,495 --> 02:40:41,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I found a really easy to use, easy to install emulator for the Nintendo DS.

2181
02:40:43,142 --> 02:40:44,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been using that now.

2182
02:40:44,719 --> 02:40:47,821
[SPEAKER_11]: because I also had this thought of trying to play Genesis games on the go.

2183
02:40:48,662 --> 02:40:51,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And most of my collection was as follows.

2184
02:40:51,323 --> 02:41:02,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Outrun, King of Fighters, I had Monopoly, but... Look, I'm just saying if you want to do it legitimately, the Mega Collection's not a bad deal.

2185
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:03,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, sorry.

2186
02:41:04,772 --> 02:41:07,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, it... You know, it...

2187
02:41:08,334 --> 02:41:20,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though, like, you know, granted, I'm 17, you know, and I was never around when these games originally came out, but I'm like, you know, it's great every once in a while to, you know, have an old-school jig every once in a while.

2188
02:41:21,057 --> 02:41:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

2189
02:41:21,897 --> 02:41:23,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a very important question.

2190
02:41:24,137 --> 02:41:31,899
[SPEAKER_04]: You said at the top, you introduced yourself as DSMaster25 and then said, no, wait, I'm DSMaster26 because I age, and now you just said you're 17.

2191
02:41:32,639 --> 02:41:33,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally lost.

2192
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:35,319
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are you?

2193
02:41:35,379 --> 02:41:37,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm 17.

2194
02:41:39,312 --> 02:41:41,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so where's the 26 come from?

2195
02:41:42,375 --> 02:41:52,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because all the DS Master Tales are tooken up, and 25 is the only one available at the time, so it took that, um, and so now it's 26.

2196
02:41:53,965 --> 02:41:54,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2197
02:41:54,765 --> 02:41:57,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I had, no, I, this was important!

2198
02:41:58,088 --> 02:41:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

2199
02:41:58,769 --> 02:41:59,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important!

2200
02:42:01,031 --> 02:42:01,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

2201
02:42:01,691 --> 02:42:03,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and plus I have a review, um,

2202
02:42:04,335 --> 02:42:11,738
[SPEAKER_11]: For a bit on a new DS, well, semi-new DS title that I came across, Chinatown Wars.

2203
02:42:11,818 --> 02:42:13,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, make it quick, because we've got to get some more calls.

2204
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:23,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, I've got to say here, it looks exactly like the old PlayStation 1 GTA renditions.

2205
02:42:23,444 --> 02:42:27,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually runs quite well on the DS.

2206
02:42:27,786 --> 02:42:27,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

2207
02:42:29,628 --> 02:42:32,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And then our quickie, which I give that one of five stars.

2208
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:35,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my last quickie review, Quake Live.

2209
02:42:36,813 --> 02:42:45,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommended, you have a pretty decent hardware because it was getting a little bit shaky when there was multiple explosions on screen.

2210
02:42:46,756 --> 02:42:55,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't try to play it with a trackpad mouse on a laptop, because I'll tell you this, this is murder on my hands beyond belief.

2211
02:42:56,383 --> 02:43:07,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I had my index finger and all the rest of my fingers up to the WSAD keys, my thumb all the way stretched down to the left mouse button to shoot, and used my right hand to try to aim.

2212
02:43:08,132 --> 02:43:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely don't play Quake Live on the netbook.

2213
02:43:10,814 --> 02:43:13,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DSMaster, thanks so much for the call.

2214
02:43:13,076 --> 02:43:13,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2215
02:43:14,697 --> 02:43:15,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out.

2216
02:43:15,558 --> 02:43:15,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2217
02:43:17,625 --> 02:43:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you see, DS Master 1 through 24 was taken, so I just went for 25.

2218
02:43:22,447 --> 02:43:26,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have you know that someone linked me in chat to a listing on eBay.

2219
02:43:27,449 --> 02:43:36,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for $235 plus shipping, we can own our own edible ink cake printer that will allow us to print emails and eat them.

2220
02:43:37,253 --> 02:43:37,693
[SPEAKER_04]: for $235.

2221
02:43:37,733 --> 02:43:38,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

2222
02:43:39,395 --> 02:43:40,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about it.

2223
02:43:40,175 --> 02:43:41,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be good.

2224
02:43:42,016 --> 02:43:43,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a challenge though on a future show.

2225
02:43:44,358 --> 02:43:48,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to hear from DS Masters 1 through 23 at some point.

2226
02:43:48,241 --> 02:43:50,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know where they are.

2227
02:43:50,342 --> 02:43:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 1 through 24.

2228
02:43:52,004 --> 02:43:57,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to hear from DS Master 2 or someone with a lot of seniority in the DS Master chain.

2229
02:44:00,094 --> 02:44:00,334
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

2230
02:44:21,851 --> 02:44:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2231
02:44:38,246 --> 02:44:56,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring a cool roster of characters including Pyramid Head, Robbie the Rabbit, and of course characters from Rumble Roses, Frogger, Goemon, they even have Taco from Parodius it looks like.

2232
02:44:59,931 --> 02:45:01,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.

2233
02:45:01,912 --> 02:45:03,672
[SPEAKER_02]: They even have Pyramid Head in this shot, it's kind of funny.

2234
02:45:03,932 --> 02:45:04,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Phone's ringing.

2235
02:45:05,313 --> 02:45:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2236
02:45:08,305 --> 02:45:09,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

2237
02:45:10,166 --> 02:45:10,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Spazinator.

2238
02:45:10,866 --> 02:45:11,446
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2239
02:45:11,466 --> 02:45:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, a couple things.

2240
02:45:15,108 --> 02:45:25,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, I just caught one of your little stories about an adults-only console that's about to come out.

2241
02:45:25,591 --> 02:45:27,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are your thoughts on the adults-only console?

2242
02:45:29,073 --> 02:45:31,694
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of iffy.

2243
02:45:32,054 --> 02:45:35,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have to get some more information, uh,

2244
02:45:36,169 --> 02:45:50,775
[SPEAKER_10]: about before I fully form my opinion one way or the other, but, Mike, you know, at least for the moment, you know, the question is, even though the game's going to be adults only, you know, are they going to be actually any good?

2245
02:45:51,155 --> 02:46:00,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, you can almost draw a parallel to a lot of the mature titles that came out at least last generation.

2246
02:46:02,660 --> 02:46:04,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, uh,

2247
02:46:10,697 --> 02:46:15,499
[SPEAKER_10]: BMX XXX was awesome.

2248
02:46:16,139 --> 02:46:19,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesomely bad, but in a so-bad-it-was-good kind of way.

2249
02:46:19,560 --> 02:46:21,140
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to carry a hose around on your bike.

2250
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:22,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2251
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:27,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to derail this conversation for a minute, Spazinator, because I have a topic I need to hear about from you.

2252
02:46:27,642 --> 02:46:31,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we just had DS Master on the show talking about where his name comes from.

2253
02:46:31,083 --> 02:46:32,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to know where Spazinator comes from.

2254
02:46:34,651 --> 02:46:36,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's kind of a weird story.

2255
02:46:36,732 --> 02:46:41,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I assume you're familiar with, uh, the American Pie movies, right?

2256
02:46:41,953 --> 02:46:42,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2257
02:46:43,793 --> 02:46:50,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know how there's, uh, the, you know, there's a character on there, you know, that goes by the name of the Shivernator?

2258
02:46:51,275 --> 02:46:51,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2259
02:46:52,036 --> 02:47:01,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, well, you know, when I meet a Spazinator, I, you know, this is back in the PS2 days, I literally just got down watching, uh,

2260
02:47:02,361 --> 02:47:05,102
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the first American Pie movie.

2261
02:47:05,903 --> 02:47:12,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also had those kinds of Network Adapter and, you know, and SOCOM 2.

2262
02:47:13,726 --> 02:47:22,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And I went to create a screen name and I thought, there's a Sherman here, I like the American Pie movies.

2263
02:47:23,031 --> 02:47:24,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Changed the name up a little bit.

2264
02:47:27,093 --> 02:47:31,515
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first thing that came to mind was Batmanator, so...

2265
02:47:32,348 --> 02:47:34,449
[SPEAKER_10]: and eventually the name kind of stuck.

2266
02:47:34,509 --> 02:47:41,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I started using his name on all the games and, you know, just to be a little consistent.

2267
02:47:41,391 --> 02:47:46,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it kind of stuck.

2268
02:47:46,992 --> 02:47:47,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad I asked.

2269
02:47:48,693 --> 02:47:49,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's cool.

2270
02:47:50,913 --> 02:47:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what else do I want to ask you about?

2271
02:47:52,714 --> 02:47:53,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2272
02:47:53,914 --> 02:47:56,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us one more thing that's on your mind, then we're going to take another call.

2273
02:47:58,463 --> 02:48:11,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know, right at the top of the show, after you got off the pole with Bobby, you had mentioned during your gaming week that you picked up that Zen Pinball game.

2274
02:48:11,566 --> 02:48:11,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2275
02:48:13,206 --> 02:48:23,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I actually just got there a couple days ago, and by looking at it, I figured what table it's on by, and I actually beat one of your scores so far, so...

2276
02:48:24,733 --> 02:48:25,654
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here's a good one.

2277
02:48:25,774 --> 02:48:25,894
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2278
02:48:53,683 --> 02:48:54,644
[SPEAKER_04]: She's playing Sims 3.

2279
02:48:55,104 --> 02:49:03,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of my soul died just in the last... 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2280
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:06,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you have some more last minutes?

2281
02:49:06,651 --> 02:49:07,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

2282
02:49:07,131 --> 02:49:08,112
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting another call.

2283
02:49:08,332 --> 02:49:08,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take the call.

2284
02:49:09,733 --> 02:49:10,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2285
02:49:10,734 --> 02:49:11,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2286
02:49:13,134 --> 02:49:15,795
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Deathwishing.

2287
02:49:16,636 --> 02:49:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry I tore apart your grammar earlier.

2288
02:49:18,657 --> 02:49:21,738
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to talk loud so I can barely hear you.

2289
02:49:21,758 --> 02:49:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: About my name, huh?

2290
02:49:22,198 --> 02:49:22,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Counterstrike.

2291
02:49:44,755 --> 02:49:45,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just say I died a lot.

2292
02:49:45,896 --> 02:49:46,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, that's it.

2293
02:49:46,696 --> 02:49:46,976
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2294
02:49:48,597 --> 02:49:49,538
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we had to ask.

2295
02:49:49,578 --> 02:49:51,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't everybody have a story like that?

2296
02:49:54,260 --> 02:49:55,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did your name come from?

2297
02:49:55,301 --> 02:49:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom.

2298
02:49:57,122 --> 02:49:57,362
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2299
02:49:58,363 --> 02:49:59,003
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

2300
02:49:59,383 --> 02:50:02,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Since your story was so short, I'll let you... What did you want to call in about tonight?

2301
02:50:04,686 --> 02:50:07,328
[SPEAKER_09]: The sex box and... Yeah.

2302
02:50:07,708 --> 02:50:09,829
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty... It's kind of stupid in a way.

2303
02:50:10,950 --> 02:50:11,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

2304
02:50:12,888 --> 02:50:17,729
[SPEAKER_09]: One, it's kind of a rip-off of internet meme name stuff.

2305
02:50:18,289 --> 02:50:19,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we really need a porn game console?

2306
02:50:20,050 --> 02:50:22,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lolcat console.

2307
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:24,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a two girls, one cup console.

2308
02:50:24,711 --> 02:50:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably is a lolcat fetish, so it probably will be a lolcat console.

2309
02:50:30,452 --> 02:50:31,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A lolcat fetish.

2310
02:50:31,432 --> 02:50:33,433
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's something I hadn't thought of.

2311
02:50:34,633 --> 02:50:37,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be interested in meeting people on the internet with a lolcat fetish, Deathwishing?

2312
02:50:39,289 --> 02:50:41,670
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I have a girlfriend, so I don't need it.

2313
02:50:42,671 --> 02:50:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I can has fucking.

2314
02:50:43,652 --> 02:50:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any low-cat cosplay is what I want to know.

2315
02:50:48,334 --> 02:50:49,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I should do that.

2316
02:50:50,215 --> 02:50:55,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just walk around in cat ears with a sign that says, I can has, and then insert random items.

2317
02:50:56,039 --> 02:50:56,959
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to have been done.

2318
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:59,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it has been done.

2319
02:50:59,421 --> 02:50:59,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2320
02:51:01,462 --> 02:51:03,103
[SPEAKER_06]: We had someone go around as low-cat.

2321
02:51:05,004 --> 02:51:06,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, your thoughts on the sex box, sir.

2322
02:51:08,466 --> 02:51:11,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were following PAX coverage, right?

2323
02:51:12,328 --> 02:51:13,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit.

2324
02:51:13,149 --> 02:51:15,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Bobby calling in for PAX.

2325
02:51:15,791 --> 02:51:21,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently there was a Street Fighter 6 they had for sale there, like limited edition for PAX only.

2326
02:51:22,476 --> 02:51:23,137
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

2327
02:51:23,177 --> 02:51:23,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the girl one.

2328
02:51:24,518 --> 02:51:24,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2329
02:51:25,658 --> 02:51:27,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, you, Frank, gave one away for free.

2330
02:51:29,421 --> 02:51:29,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucky.

2331
02:51:29,922 --> 02:51:31,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless they didn't get a thousand viewers.

2332
02:51:33,231 --> 02:51:38,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure they might have, all I know is they gave away a lot of swag and stuff But they would only give it away if they got a thousand viewers, you said?

2333
02:51:54,060 --> 02:51:55,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they try to give away anyway.

2334
02:51:55,341 --> 02:51:58,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, God, they heard about the sticks off and they just want to buy two.

2335
02:51:58,202 --> 02:51:59,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a shameless promotion.

2336
02:51:59,582 --> 02:52:00,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It is completely shameless.

2337
02:52:00,403 --> 02:52:00,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate...

2338
02:52:22,492 --> 02:52:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2339
02:52:23,233 --> 02:52:25,896
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do Orange Laundry for 12 people and loved it.

2340
02:52:26,376 --> 02:52:30,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't understand this whole, like, we're not going to pay attention to you until we get 500.

2341
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:32,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's disrespectful to others.

2342
02:52:32,842 --> 02:52:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2343
02:52:33,403 --> 02:52:35,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a tangent you probably weren't intending on, but you got it.

2344
02:52:36,826 --> 02:52:41,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really think no one really cared about the new track thing either.

2345
02:52:41,971 --> 02:52:44,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so and so they posted the link to it on...

2346
02:52:45,681 --> 02:52:49,323
[SPEAKER_09]: and Chan.com and nothing happened.

2347
02:52:50,204 --> 02:52:56,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a user tell I was watching up to like from 197 to 200 and then went back down lower than before.

2348
02:52:57,628 --> 02:52:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe everybody was at PAX.

2349
02:53:01,991 --> 02:53:03,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2350
02:53:03,812 --> 02:53:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing, is there a fight breaking out behind you?

2351
02:53:07,795 --> 02:53:11,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's these people playing some game called... Oh, well, they stopped playing...

2352
02:53:12,338 --> 02:53:16,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Hero of New Earth, which is kind of like Dota, and they're all playing Star Cry 2 now.

2353
02:53:16,380 --> 02:53:16,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2354
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:17,240
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2355
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:20,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let you go, Deathwishing, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

2356
02:53:22,383 --> 02:53:22,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2357
02:53:23,003 --> 02:53:23,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2358
02:53:24,283 --> 02:53:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now shutting off the skyline.

2359
02:53:27,245 --> 02:53:27,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2360
02:53:27,685 --> 02:53:28,505
[SPEAKER_04]: No more calls tonight.

2361
02:53:28,885 --> 02:53:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

2362
02:53:32,027 --> 02:53:34,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you have anything else for us before we close out shop tonight?

2363
02:53:34,656 --> 02:53:35,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, real quick.

2364
02:53:36,037 --> 02:53:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The ESRB has rated more games coming to the PlayStation Network.

2365
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: These are PlayStation 1 download titles, including Blood Omen, Legacy of Kain, Cool Boarders 3, International Track and Field, Oddworld Apes Exodus, and Oddworld Apes Odyssey, Pandemonium, Syphon Filter 2, and Um Jammer Lammy.

2366
02:53:53,675 --> 02:53:55,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't some of those already come out this week?

2367
02:53:55,677 --> 02:53:57,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I heard some of those came out this week.

2368
02:53:58,508 --> 02:54:09,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, Um, Jimmerlammy came out, um, in Japan, and actually, um, Blood Omen and Pandemonium were rated before previously in March.

2369
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:11,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think any of them actually came out this week, though.

2370
02:54:13,204 --> 02:54:14,986
[SPEAKER_02]: But, it's neat, I guess.

2371
02:54:15,847 --> 02:54:15,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2372
02:54:17,449 --> 02:54:37,596
[SPEAKER_02]: and we talked a little bit I think before about how Guitar Hero World Tour is going to have an option to or Guitar Hero 5 is going to have an option to import some tracks from Guitar Hero World Tour however it's actually quite pathetic only 35 of World Tour's 86 tracks are actually going to be available to import and it's going to cost you $3.50 to do so

2373
02:54:40,723 --> 02:55:06,762
[SPEAKER_02]: and also Smash Hits is only going to have a few tracks to import as well I believe they're going to have oh let's see here 21 songs from Smash Hits available to import and with an undisclosed price on that one and that's coming out later this fall but it's still pathetic if you ask me since Rock Band you can import everything except for three tracks well it depends what the songs are too maybe they weren't willing to pony up the money I don't know

2374
02:55:07,706 --> 02:55:18,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, apparently there's new versions of Bonk, Bomberman, and I think maybe some other games coming as well.

2375
02:55:19,451 --> 02:55:21,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And these were discovered on Hudson's website.

2376
02:55:21,932 --> 02:55:33,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's a Bonk update coming, a Bomberman live sequel, and a Wii and DS version of a game called Rooms the Main Building.

2377
02:55:34,269 --> 02:55:36,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunk Brink of Extinction 2.5D Action Platformer

2378
02:55:55,100 --> 02:55:58,063

2379
02:56:14,187 --> 02:56:38,910
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting and I guess now I guess Bonk and Barman have been officially announced by Hudson with screenshots and it looks like Bonk and Barman so not much to report there that's it alright sounds awesome Bonk is though one of those things that's a little better left in my memory I think but I don't know if they soup it up a little bit it might be cool

2380
02:56:39,478 --> 02:56:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Frozen Yogurt

2381
02:57:01,670 --> 02:57:03,331
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, sounds amazing.

2382
02:57:03,651 --> 02:57:07,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought this show would be shorter tonight, but it was actually kind of long tonight.

2383
02:57:07,394 --> 02:57:07,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

2384
02:57:08,795 --> 02:57:10,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you just never know how long the show's gonna go.

2385
02:57:10,896 --> 02:57:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2386
02:57:11,997 --> 02:57:13,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I have a toy for my cat.

2387
02:57:14,519 --> 02:57:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a laser pointer.

2388
02:57:15,639 --> 02:57:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, the laser pointer is shaped like a cat.

2389
02:57:18,481 --> 02:57:20,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that make it a laser cat?

2390
02:57:22,324 --> 02:57:22,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

2391
02:57:24,806 --> 02:57:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

2392
02:57:26,867 --> 02:57:28,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a cat that fires a laser, so.

2393
02:57:29,569 --> 02:57:30,850
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you don't have a laser cat fetish.

2394
02:57:31,727 --> 02:57:34,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into Orange Launch Radio.

2396
02:57:36,250 --> 02:57:40,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you like what you've heard, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the station because you know what?

2397
02:57:40,653 --> 02:57:43,414
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a big magazine promoting us.

2398
02:57:43,474 --> 02:57:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have zillions of followers on Twitter, and we're never going to have a contest that we'll only do if so many people follow us or what have you.

2399
02:57:50,038 --> 02:57:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Just help us get the word out.

2400
02:57:51,399 --> 02:57:52,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we ask.

2401
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:58,544
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you can do it through an iTunes review, through anything, and we'll try to keep it free for you guys for another seven years, all right?

2402
02:57:59,164 --> 02:58:00,124

2406
02:58:07,426 --> 02:58:09,467
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to have games after games after games.

2407
02:58:09,827 --> 02:58:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So our reviews and yours sitting around talking smack about what we love, video games.
