00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
An intentional glitch outs pirates of a popular game

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
And a popular franchise's sequel gets canned in Japan

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

And the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Here with you over the next three hours, live every Sunday night on All Games Radio

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Also with me as well, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Beer

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
What kind of beer tonight?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
250th Anniversary Guinness

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And what makes it so dang special?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Because it's 250th Anniversary Guinness

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
How are you, Loki?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm good

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Alright, now of course before we get into gaming weeks usually

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
We somehow start off the show as Orange Lounge Radio Foodio

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And tonight is no exception to the cause here

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Loki, what the hell did you bring with you tonight because

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I have to admit it actually looks kind of disgusting

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I brought parts of Bacon Fest 2009

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
As Nellie would call it, it was the bacon themed birthday party

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Some of the food that we serve there

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Including bacon muffins

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Which they're cornbread muffins

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
That have a little

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm seriously looking at all this food, oh my god

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
It's just too much, it's too much

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Don't get me wrong, I love bacon

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But this is too much bacon

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Bacon is meat candy

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Ok, sorry to interrupt

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Anyways, so it's

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Ok, let me just run down the list here

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
The bacon muffins, they're basically cornbread muffins

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
It initially had a little bit of reserved bacon fat in there

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
To give it the kind of bacon flavor

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And there's bacon inside of it

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
And then Nellie decided that they didn't quite taste like enough bacon

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And she

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Originally when I made them, I bought the wrong size tins

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So I only made like 10 muffins

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And I'm like, you can't eat any of those because we only have 10 muffins

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
So there's a piece of the muffin mix or whatever that had fallen into the bacon grease

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And she snatched it up and ate it

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And she's like, mmm that's good, you should rub all of them into the bacon grease

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
So we rolled the top of them really quickly into the bacon grease

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
To give it a little bit of extra bacon flavor

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
And then on top of it is like cream cheese, hot sauce, green onion, and bacon

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
It's kind of like a spicy, I don't know, frosting almost

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And then we made these pancetta cups with mac and cheese inside of them

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Just mainly because we couldn't think of anything good to fill inside of them

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Ok

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And they're ok

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm about to eat one and just for the record

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I have yet to touch the bacon food

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
This is actually funny because I was going to be

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I had said I was giving up bacon and I had decided I'm going to do it tomorrow

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
So this is great because I can now make myself completely sick of bacon

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Why give it up now when you can procrastinate to tomorrow

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Especially with all these bacon temptations in front of you

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Nom nom nom

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't know, I've got to admit

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm a little over bacon being the food of worship

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Like, you know, bacon's kind of been the in-food for years and years now

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I think we need to move on to a new food of worship

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Like, what about the jelly bean?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't see enough appreciation for jelly beans out there

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It has to be jelly bellies

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Alright, forget it

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
And then the last one is shrimp wrapped in bacon with barbecue sauce

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
And mozzarella cheese broiled on top of it

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But it's actually, the shrimp's pretty good

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We ate mostly the shrimp

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And then I had candied bacon

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
It was with, you know, brown sugar

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
You know, kind of caramelized on top of it and stuff

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
That I meant to put on ice cream so we'd have bacon ice cream

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
But everybody ate the bacon, you know, the candied bacon

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Before I got a chance to bring out the ice cream

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Now sadly I missed Bacon Fest because it conflicted with my dad's birthday

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And I had a friend from out of town who I hadn't seen in years who was visiting

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
But thank you to Loki and Nellie for bringing a little piece of it here

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
It was very nice

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I will try at least one of the bacon shrimp things

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That looks kind of good

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
They're pretty good

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
And then Irene and Nathan brought these like mashed potato ball things that have like bacon and stuff

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So I don't, I haven't tried those

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
But everyone liked those I think

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Alright let's go to our chat room

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes we do talk about video games occasionally on this show

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But let me go to the chat room and introduce them

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Howdy guys at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
They're always with us, the EverPresence fourth guest on the show

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Tigerclaw says you guys should take a picture of this and post on the OLR Gallery

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
We are one step ahead of you sir

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Dark Sakura I think already did that

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
They should be on their way up to the OLR Gallery

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So if you want to check out the food

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Go to orangelaungeradio.com

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Click on I think it's galleries and you'll see

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
If you're smart you'll figure it out

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Click on like pictures or galleries

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I don't have it in front of me

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
And then you can find the bacon stuff that Loki brought

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Sadly the one thing that wasn't there was super bacon

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Just because I thought I had plenty of bacon

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And I actually ran short of bacon

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I had bought like five packages of bacon

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And it was still not enough

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Salaciouspopnchat says popcorn jelly bellies equal vom

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
The chat room by the way is called Kevin

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
I just want to point out though that I actually like the popcorn jelly beans quite a bit

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
But my favorite is toasted marshmallow

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Jelly Belly makes a toasted marshmallow jelly bean that is delicious

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
In honor of Bacon Fest

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The chat room is called Kevin

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm very sorry I did not refer to them by their proper name

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I still don't understand this whole renaming the chat room to names of people you know

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You are Kevin!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Fine

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Alright there you go

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So okay I'm going to try one of these bacon shrimp things

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Even though my pancreas hurts just looking at it

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Dear God

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Well that's two of them

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
There's two of them

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
You need to separate that

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Okay here we go

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Careful and chew carefully because like you said it's a little choke-y

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
This is not good radio

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Sorry

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It's delicious radio

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
It takes a while to chew through because unfortunately the bacon did not crisp up as well as I'd like to

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It's pretty darn good

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
It's pretty darn good

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But no one seemed to care because you know

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It's delicious

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It's good but damn

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
This is probably all I'm going to have

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm going to have another piece of shrimp

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
You guys can see in the picture gallery and even if you're listening on the podcast you can go on the website

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm sure it'll still be there

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
You can go in that picture gallery and look and it's too much

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
It's too much

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes there is a such a thing as too much bacon and it is sitting in front of us tonight

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
The important thing today Rob is that all I've had is a salad so I could safely eat this bacon

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But tomorrow no more pork

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
See I'm already a little full because I had wings topped today which is not good

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Oh my God all the weight I've worked so hard to lose I'm getting right back today

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I'll move it out of here if you'd like

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
At some point we're going to need to do that

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
That's right not right now

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Let's get into our gaming week

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
We should talk about video games that is what we do here on this show

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Dark Sakura what type of video games have you been playing this week?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't know what type of games

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Enough with the bacon

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Put the bacon down step away from the bacon

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Do you want me to have Loki go first?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
My gaming week was awesome

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Well you know played the usual stuff New Grand Theft Auto what not

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
Also got around to playing a little bit of Scribblenauts which it's alright

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
But I haven't really gotten past the tutorial stuff yet because I've only played it for a little bit

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
I've been busy messing with the little front end thing where you can spawn wherever you want and stuff

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
And let me tell you and I know this really sucks to say it but oh my god does it get old after 5 minutes

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And you know that is really sad

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I knew it I knew that's what was going to happen with this game

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
I haven't played it yet so I just you know it's one of those things I think it's like the Nintendogs of this year

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
It's like one of those things is going to be cute as hell for 30 minutes

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And then you're going to be like okay I did all the lolsy things I wanted to do

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
And pretty much and you know I'm sure the puzzles and stuff are going to be fun

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
I haven't quite gotten there yet because I'm still doing the fucking tutorial stuff which is annoying

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
But just as far as messing with stuff it's kind of boring

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And the other thing that I don't really care for in it is the control

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
The control you have to use the stylus and you click to where you want Maxwell to go

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
And it's so non-responsive it's just ah it really bugs me

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
But it's cool I guess you know that you can spawn all these different things

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
But like you know they've got like 2200 words or something in this

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
But a lot of the other words just you know create the same thing

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
If you type in any type of dog it just makes this generic looking dog or something

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Now you're getting called out a little bit in chat from our good friend Bobby

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Who's on Before Us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Black Wolf says so Loki played with the playground and not the actual game and called it old

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Well I'm telling you what I played

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm just saying I thought I'd be able to play this playground part

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And just you know have a lot of fun with it for quite a while

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Because I mean dude I made a cat

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Well first thing I did was I did what the ESRB had

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
You know where they said you can lure a lion with you know meat strapped to a baby

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So I strapped meat to a baby and you know lured a lion with that and that was kind of funny

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And then I strapped the laser to a cat and tried to make a laser cap

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
But that didn't work because you know it just it didn't know what I wanted to do

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
But yeah I'm sure the puzzles are fun but like I said I haven't played there yet

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And I'm just saying what this is my impression so far

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
It's a really quick impression but yeah it's not as much fun as I thought it would be

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Fair enough I guess

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
Now the other thing too this week is I finally finally finally got my arcade cabinet

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
So I went down to the San Jose and picked up my Astro City candy cab

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And brought it home and also with that I got a

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
Was it an MVS Neo Geo board a single slot with a 48 in one

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Which I'm sure is absolutely not legit one bit

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
48 in one Neo Geo cart that's got a lot of King of Fighters and Metal Slug and whatnot on there

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
But you know basically I have that to hold me over until I finish my main computer and all that stuff

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
But it's kind of cool so I'm putting that all together

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And actually going to be painting the whole thing black

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So I have to do that as well because it's kind of scuffed up

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
And I tried to find a white paint or something that might match it

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
But I mean you can't match the color of the plastic there so it's just easier to paint the whole thing black

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
So yeah and I've got some pics on my live journal right now of just the cabinet

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It's kind of taken apart a little bit the control panel wasn't on there

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I had to re-screw that back on there because they gave me like two different control panels

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
None of which were the one I wanted but you know it's fine for now

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
And then I plan on getting the correct one later because I wanted a two player both with six buttons

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
But I have a two player with three buttons on each and a one player with six buttons

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
So whatever it'll work for now

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And what other stuff did I have to do

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
Oh yeah I had to get a new halogen or not halogen a fluorescent light for the marquee

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
And of course it's some special fluorescent light that they don't make over here in the United States

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
You know because most of them are standard size like 12 inch, 18 inch, 24

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
This was 22 and 3 eighths so I had to go order that specially online from Atlanta

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
And they had apparently some of these Toshiba fluorescent lights so I had that

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Now you are still taking late donations for your cabinet

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh yeah definitely

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Okay good because I never donated

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I was going to do it on Friday but I got sidetracked so I'm going to give you a late donation

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I still got lots of stuff I got to get online

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm planning on actually rebuilding my DDR pads

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
And I have an email to channel Beat about Dance Maniacs sensors

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Because I have the actual Dance Maniacs machine

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I have two upper sensors but I need two lower sensors

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
And if I can get them for a good price I'm going to buy them from them

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Now where did you put all these machines are you putting them in your garage?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Well I don't have a Dance Maniacs machine I have the motherboard inside of it

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Right but you used to have your candy cab where's that going?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
The candy cab is in the garage right now but it's going to go in the middle of the room

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
I'm taking the HDTV and there's an HDTV and a Stanford in the room right now

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
So you have to put the toys in the middle of the bedroom so the wife can close the door and not see it?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Well she doesn't close the door I just wanted it in there because that's where I'm going to put my DDR pads

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And that's going to take up a lot of space

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I could put it in the garage and that would be fine going through the winter

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
But in the summer fuck no it's like 100 degrees inside there I'd die

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah it's even worse than the studio where we were taping at my house

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
It's quite pleasant today though

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah it's nice today

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Alright so that's it for your gaming week

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
That's it

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Dark Sakura now that she's done with her bacon

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Mmm bacon

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
My gaming week was a marathon session of Beatles Rock Band

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Which I really loved I had a great time playing especially doing harmony

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Because everybody doesn't have to do all the harmony but you get more bonuses if you harmonize properly

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
And I had a really good time with that that was a lot of fun except that my hands started hurting after a while playing some of the guitar

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
I was going to say I forgot I also did play the Beatles Rock Band and Rock Band 2

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Did you know actually and this is kind of neat I just tried it because I wasn't sure if it worked

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
That the old Karaoke Revolution mics from the Playstation 2 actually work on the 360 version of Rock Band

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Did you know the Lips mics also work on it?

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
I didn't know if they patched that stuff in yet but I know they were supposed to be getting patched in soon

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
Well we cause Dan made it out of his conference with a double set of Lips mics

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
And so we used those we had a really good time I thought it was great

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
So you guys both feel, no you kind of already gave your review last week Loki and you said

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm not a fan of the Beatles so I'm not as yippy about this but I see where people are getting excited about it

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah it was alright but I think we came away with it like wow the Beatles had some really tripped out shit in there

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
Their songs were weird because we had Nathan singing this stuff and he's just like holy crap I didn't know that they had these weird songs

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
But after about maybe 10 minutes of it we were just like ok let's go to Rock Band 2 because we just got tired of it

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
But Dark Sakura is someone who is more of a Beatles fan you were like yay I'm in heaven

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
I was like dude I want my other songs in here because like the songs that I most wanted in there weren't there

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
Well a lot of the ones that I really liked like some of my favorite songs are like

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
Dear Prudence was in there which is one of my favorites and which is actually really easy and fun to sing

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
It's the only one I beat on Expert and then Something was on there which is another one I like

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
And we also the theme was we had a discussion on who had the better hair and we all agreed that George Harrison had better hair

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
Now quick question have you explored download content because you know some of it's there

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
We just rented it because Dan with a button didn't pre-order it for me

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
But the one song that I would have most liked in there I know it would make zero sense to put it in there

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
Because the only thing you could do on it would be vocals unless you could mimic violin on the guitar controller

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
Or something would be Eleanor Rigby which is my favorite Beatles song

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
There were really some fun ones in there like Taxman was in there and I think I saw She Came in Through the Bathroom Window

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Which is a cool song

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
A lot of stuff you know but of course then I had to go and listen to all the stuff that Tiare gave me

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
So I actually listened to Rubber Soul like three times all the way through

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I feel so uncool I'm like the only person that didn't play Beatles Rock Band this week

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Because my ex and granted it's my own damn fault my Xbox 360 is still broke and I need to go get it fixed

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
I just you know I've just been complacent doing all this other stuff and I've just been busy with some other things in my personal life

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
So I haven't really gotten out to get it fixed but I'm not gonna re-buy the instruments just for the PS3 version

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
No I have all these money invested in instruments on the 360 that's where I want to get Beatles Rock Band

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
So I'm just a little behind and by the time I'm ready to play it there'll probably be nobody left playing it online

17:16.000 --> 17:25.000
Well I also like I'm doing right now play Sims 3 because I love Sims 3

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
And it's actually really easy to run it during the show because I have to always be doing something

17:32.000 --> 17:42.000
I also, what else did I play? No I don't think I played, I was gonna play a Dreamcast game and I didn't

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
You know, thought about it, didn't do it, played some Pinball

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I go back to work Monday

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Sucks to be you

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh I played Peggle, lot of Peggle, lot of Peggle

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
My gaming week was not quite as exciting as Dark Soccer or Loki's, I had pretty mellow

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
I played a lot of World of Warcraft, don't judge, haters gonna hate

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
But I'm playing Alliance this time because I was Horde for years

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah I played that too

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Good, I'm glad now instead of calling me an addict you're like oh okay yeah I'm addicted too

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm not addicted, I played twice

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Clearly I have issues because I'm already like level 24 but I have some friends that are playing so whatever

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
It makes it go by faster, and I'm sure these people are gonna be like you could have gotten your Xbox fixed

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
But you've been playing World of Warcraft, don't judge me

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
Let's see what else, I've been playing, I have been playing some stuff on the Playstation as well

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
Just kind of mostly the same stuff, Wipeout and Home, even I got some more invites to the club on there taken care of

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
So if you were waiting for that then you probably got that, and yeah just kind of playing that stuff

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh and also Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP, that's probably been the game I've been playing more than any other console game

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Is that, and it's difficult, it's way harder than regular Rock Band

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm sorry some of those note patterns are really tough to do with the four buttons

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
So I can see where Rock Band Unplugged definitely polarizes audiences

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
But I'll tell you what, after having been missing frequency and amplitude for so long it's kind of cool to have this

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
I do miss the techno music, but Rock Band Unplugged has a decent song list

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
So I'm satisfied

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Alright well that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into our housekeeping tonight

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
In tonight's housekeeping, there may or may not be a show next week

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm thinking, and I kind of have to ask this live on air, no? No show? Are you out?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I'm out

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Okay so then we're not gonna do it

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I have stuff that needs to get done on Sunday night

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
Okay then fine, cause I was gonna suggest we could do it late cause my flight gets in at 5.30 so maybe we could start the show at 7

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
But we'll just not do it then if you have stuff going on too

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
So free night for Loki, woo, I gotta work in the cabinet, woo, woo

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
But the problem is I am also going to be out the first weekend of October

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
So I'll have to figure something out for that, where you guys can do it without me or something

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Cause we don't want to miss too many shows, or we pre-taped that week or something, maybe we can do that

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
Alright so yeah, there's gonna be no show next Sunday so just brace yourself for that and have a good week without us here

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Alright, that's it I guess for housekeeping, otherwise you can always follow us on Twitter

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
We're OLR on Twitter, we're OLRME on Facebook, it's a club so you have to search for OLRMY

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
And Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, although I don't think we've posted to LiveJournal in about a year, but it's there

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
I should cross post some of mine

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
You should actually cross post some of it to Orange Lounge, it'd be nice to see that being updated, so there you go

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news already and some long discussion tonight

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Loki's gonna start us off with a four part story

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Yes, well speaking about Twitter, apparently Courtney Love has one

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
And she wasn't too happy about some stuff that went down with a deal that she had with Activision

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Regarding Kurt Cobain's appearance in Guitar Hero 5

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Apparently, and this is her two posts that she had on Twitter

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
For the record, this Guitar Hero shit is breach of contract on Bully's part

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
And then she followed up with, we're gonna sue the shit out of Activision

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
We being the trusty estates, the LLC, and the various LLCs, Cobain Enterprise

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
This is gonna be a completely unrelated statement, but I just have to get this off my chest

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Isn't this fascinating that we live in a world now where Twitter is like a late breaking news source

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
And a lot of the reason why is because celebrities on Twitter are unfiltered

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
They're not going through their publicists and writing things like this

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
Like I don't know why, but like seven years ago when we started this show we would never have a story like this

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
But now it's kind of weird that we're reading about Courtney being pissed off like through her Twitter

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
It's just weird that Twitter is like this news source all of a sudden

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Here's my thing

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Why the hell is anyone reading CourtneyLovesTwitter?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I mean seriously

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
She has fans

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Who?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
She does?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Like convicts? I mean who?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I don't know

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
You know what? I will say this

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
When I was in high school, I was a senior in high school

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
We participated in the lip sync contest

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You know how they do the lip sync contest at high school?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
I'm sure your high school did one, like all high schools did this right?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
So we decided to make a mockery of the whole thing, me and my two friends

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And I dressed up as Courtney Love

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
And we did what's the song called?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Violet by Hole?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Go on take everything

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
And you know I had a wig and I wore this really trashy outfit and everything

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Yes it's like one of the few times in my life where I've cross dressed outside of Rocky Horror

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And let's see

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Then one of my other friends put his long hair in pigtails and pretend to play the bass

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
And then our other friend dressed up like a Japanese schoolgirl and ran out on stage with these random signs

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Like it was the most random anti lip sync thing you did

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Because everybody else was doing like lollipop lollipop

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
And all this stupid shit and all dressed and clear cut

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
And here we are going out on stage in drag singing Violet

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And it was all kinds of awesome

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
You know how we did? We got last place

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Last place

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Thank you Courtney Love

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I was a hot ass Courtney Love though

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I will just put that out there

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Well they did have a picture of Courtney Love on Kotaku during one of the stories

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
It actually was one of the good pictures of her

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm like wow she was hot at one time

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
What the fuck happened there?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
I'm guessing a lot of drugs but you know

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Anyways back to the story

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
So she was pissed off that you know Kurt Cobain is totally

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Mainly the thing that they're pissed off about is

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
And I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos regarding this

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Apparently these characters or these artists can be unlocked

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
As playable characters in the game

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
So therefore you can make them sing any retarded song that's in this game

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Including I think they had one that had Flava Flav in it

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
So they had the clip of course of Kurt Cobain

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
You know lip sync to Flava Flav

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
And I mean that's just blasphemy right there

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Activision responded of course after these stupid Twitter updates

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Saying that Courtney Love signed a contract for this

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
And you know tough luck

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Because they aren't in breach of contract

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
And then of course then her publicist I guess

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Released a statement I guess it was

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh I'm sorry then I have publicist

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Other band members from Nirvana

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
They said this is a statement regarding Nirvana

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Guitar Hero and the likeness of the late Kurt Cobain

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
We want the people to know that we are dismayed and very disappointed

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
In the way a facsimile of Kurt is used in Guitar Hero

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
The name and likeness of Kurt Cobain are sole property of his estates

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
We have no control whatsoever in that area

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
While we are aware of Kurt's image being used with the two Nirvana songs

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
We didn't know that the players have the ability to unlock the character

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
This feature allows a character to be used with any kind of song the player wants

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
We urge Activision to do the right thing in relocking Kurt's character

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
So that this won't continue in the future

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
It's hard to watch an image of Kurt pantomiming other artists alongside cartoon characters

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
Kurt Cobain wrote songs that hold a lot of meaning to people all over the world

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
We feel he deserves better

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
You read that about as enthusiastically as I feel about it

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Just so you know

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Well here's the thing, they have no say in it

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
They didn't sign any contracts, they're just giving their piece about it

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
They're just throwing gasoline on the fire basically

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
And then of course Cobain's attorney

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Basically saying the same thing that they want them to kind of

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Relock the character so that he can only sing certain songs or something like that

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Which I can tell you right now is not going to happen

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
It's not going to happen because Guitar Hero 5 is out on the Wii right?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Whoops! We can't patch games on the Wii

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
You're fucked

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
So it's just not going to happen

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
They said that they, you know, of course they know that they signed the agreement

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But they didn't know that he was going to be used in that way

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That kind of thing

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
This says it all right here

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Exactly where this whole thing is coming from

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
They signed the agreement but didn't know that it was going to be used in that way

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
And here's the thing, I'm sorry, go ahead

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because I have a rant on this

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I think that's actually it

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Good

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Here's the thing

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Obviously there's multiple sides to every story

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But having covered this crap as long as we have

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You know, I think, I think

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I have a pretty good idea what's going on here

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And I'm probably wrong and I'm pulling this out of my ass

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's complete speculation

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
But here's my thought

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
When this was shown to the people that it needed to be shown to

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
They didn't show the clip of Kurt Cobain doing Flavor Flav

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
They didn't say anything about Kurt Cobain being an unlockable character in the game

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
They probably showed clips of Kurt Cobain doing the actual Nirvana songs

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
And then, you know, the proper signatures were obtained or what have you

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Although I hear that Courtney Love, like, she signed it then she resisted it

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You know, even before this

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That she didn't want to approve the likeness of the character and all this other stuff

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
So she was, she was kind of resistant to the whole thing to begin with

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I don't know how much ultimate control she has over his likeness or what have you

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
But here's what it boils down to

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
You cash the check, it's done

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
You know, whether this was not an intended purpose of his likeness when they signed off on it

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
They probably should have thought about that a little harder or read the fine print

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Because obviously they saw him being used in the Nirvana things

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And that's probably the footage that Activision showed to them

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh yeah

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
But didn't realize when they signed the contract that he was also going to be a character

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Just like Slash was in Guitar Hero 3

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Just like, you know, and so forth these other characters

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Just like Johnny Cash is

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I mean Johnny Cash can very well do the Flavor Flav stuff in this game as well

28:06.000 --> 28:14.000
I mean, it's, it's, it's just, you know, a model of a person being thrown on top of these

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
You know, motion capture data that they basically collected for these different songs

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Going to chat.orangelandradio.com and reading comments

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I could understand him having a problem with him singing stuff from other artists

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
I don't see why they couldn't just lock him to only the Nirvana stuff

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
See, well A, there's two things to that

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
A, you can't patch games on the Wii and you can't patch games on the Playstation 2

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So, it's, it's done

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
I mean, they could recall the game, but what's the point, honestly

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
In my opinion, B, the damage is done

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
The YouTubes are out there and it's done

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And even if they were to recall the game, people aren't going to send it back because they think this shit is funny

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
So

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Exactly, I thought it was funny

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Exactly, I kind of think it's funny too

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I guess I am

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
You're putting him in a video game, what do you expect?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean, this isn't, this is Guitar Hero

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
I mean, if you want respectful treatment of artists, you need to go to Rock Band, I'm sorry

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Burn

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Does Rock Band really, they don't have artist's likeness in the games, do they?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
No, they don't, except for the Beatles Rock Band, but that's the way you do it

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
But I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, God, it's Guitar Hero

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, get over it people, if you don't like his likeness in the game, don't buy the game

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
There you go

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Or if you bought the game and it's too late, return it

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
At the same time, isn't it just a game?

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Isn't this just a type of artistic impression?

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
I mean, what's to stop me from going on YouTube and making a sock puppet effigy of Kurt Cobain

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
Singing whatever songs I want, and then pretending to have that sock puppet effigy

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Put a shotgun in his mouth and do away with himself

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Is it in bad taste? Yes

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
But can Courtney Love really sue me over that? No, because it's art

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And I can kinda do whatever the fuck I want

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Well, keep in mind though, her perspective too

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
She is his widow

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
And that's gonna put a different emotional push on it for her than it would for anyone else

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
And why in the hell did she ever allow this in the first place?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Because she's stupid

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
If she's that passionate about it, why did she ever sign off to his likeness being in the game in the first place?

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
And B, why wasn't everybody more educated on what was going on?

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
I mean, you know, the Beatles were involved with Beatles Rock Band like the whole way through

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
Why didn't at some point someone send Courtney the game or send the lawyers the game and say

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Here it is, here's your final review copy before we send it out

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
If you have a problem, speak now or forever hold your peace

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
I mean, in my opinion, before I signed, that's what I would have wanted to see

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But I have a feeling that it didn't happen

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So, I don't know

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
As your edge in the chat says, you should do that

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I'm not gonna do that, that's kinda, that's like

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Look, I may not be the biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but that is extremely disrespectful

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
What I just suggested doing and I'm not gonna do it

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That's time out of my day that I don't want to

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Exactly, I could be playing WoW, come on

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm not gonna make a mess

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Hey, do you know how much red corn syrup that would take?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
At least, at least it's not Revolution X, okay?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I mean, they could have had it worse

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Frisbee says, even if it's not art, lol, freedom of speech

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You know, I suppose the difference though is

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
That if I were to make that whole YouTube as disrespectful as it might be

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm not charging for it and I'm not making money off of it

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And that's probably the big difference is that, you know

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Activision makes a ton of money off Guitar Hero

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
No offense, I'm sorry, but I can't see people going

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Oh my god, Kurt Cobain's in this game, I must buy it

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't think so, I mean

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm sure maybe there is one or two, but I mean, come on

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I don't think people are gonna buy a game just because an artist is in it

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Unless it's like the Beatles rock band where it's all about the artist

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
Oh yeah, yeah, I can understand like if it was, you know

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Guitar Hero Navar

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Or even the Metallica Guitar Hero, the Van Halen

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
There are gonna be people, as much as we've kind of made fun of Van Halen Guitar Hero

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
There's gonna be people that really want that because they're just diehard Van Halen fans

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
You know, I get that

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yes ma'am

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
We need Van Hagar

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Different topic altogether

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
Alright, GS68 in chat says, Kurt Cobain confirmed for Super Smash Brothers 4

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
How about Silent Hill?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Now that's bad taste

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
Salacious Pop says, when he finds his way into Space Channel 5-3, I'll be impressed

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
It wouldn't be funny if she just didn't realize

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
I would like to see people make YouTubes of Kurt Cobain in other video games now

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Like this should become the new meme or whatever you wanna call it that's out there

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Somebody should do that, put Kurt Cobain's face on Ulala's head and have him doing the choo choo

33:00.000 --> 33:09.000
Or would it be funny though if she accidentally signed off on his appearance being in any Activision game

33:09.000 --> 33:17.000
Like Call of Duty or some Madagascar game

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
The other thing to consider too is how intoxicated was she when she signed

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Because now

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Well I'm sorry, that's her own fucking fault then

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
If she can prove though that she was sufficiently drunk enough or intoxicated enough

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
Then it actually could be considered null and void under federal business law

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
You have got to be kidding me

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Even if witnesses signed it too

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I took business law

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Why should that be an excuse? Sober the fuck up before you sign something

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
The same thing applies to weddings too

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Like I was too drunk to marry him?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Well no like

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Isn't that why the annulment process is there? Like if you change your mind

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
That's what annulments are for

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
But it's the same thing

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
There's a big fucking difference though between a wedding and a likeness in a video game

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
But it's still considered business contract

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
I don't know

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I just think if you're high you shouldn't sign things

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Call me crazy

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Well they shouldn't have got her to sign it

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
But you know she can say

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Hey I was really drunk at the time then

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And who wouldn't believe her

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Then there is cause to take it to court

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I don't know if she'd be smart enough to realize that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
You wouldn't be able to prove that

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Maybe

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Salacious pop and chat says it is not legal to enter contract with an impaired person

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Then how did they ever get her to sign?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Ever

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Hey she's drunk let's get her to sign

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean isn't there

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Surely

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
I don't know

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I'm thinking does she have soul

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
We can't tell the difference

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Does she have soul power of an attorney over everything?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Probably

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
She probably does huh

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
There wouldn't be like a lawyer involved or anybody else that signs off right

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I think she was a full executor wasn't she

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
And I don't think their daughter is 18 yet

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
No

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
So no

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Although she's an attractive young lady I don't know if you've seen pictures of her

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
She's you know aging very well

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Got stuck after her dad

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Alright anyhow sorry we're talking a bit too much about this

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And I think everybody's got their thoughts out on this

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
But yeah I honestly I don't think there's anything that can be done

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I think the stink is out there

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I don't think her lawsuit is going to hold much weight

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Unless maybe Dark Soccer is on to something honestly

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
It could be very interesting if that is the defense that comes up in court

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Is that she was too high to sign the document

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
She's a drugged up bitch

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Clearly she can't enter into any contract

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Which makes me wonder

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
That might violate other terms though

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Because doesn't she have some sort of custody term with her daughter

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
For having to be clean or something

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Oh maybe

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Oh that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
So then she couldn't say

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Ah her answer ties

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
I'm fucked up

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
You know what I'm placing my bet on out of court settlement

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
That's the way these things always end up

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Out of court settlement more money

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Frisbee says zombies ate my cart

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Alright shush

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Let's move on to some more news

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And talk about zombies of a different sort

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
And the type of zombies that are in Left 4 Dead 2

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Now you know we've been talking about the boycotts of Left 4 Dead 2

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I know we've talked about it previously on this show

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
About how there was this you know thing out there

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Where all these people were signing it

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Wah wah wah you shouldn't be making Left 4 Dead 2

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Because you haven't supported Left 4 Dead 1 enough

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
And I think the agreement among us here in studio was

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Get over it

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
Because you know tons of games are re-released every year

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
With different types of skins and everything

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
And you don't see hundreds of thousands of people bitching about that

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
And Valve's done a pretty good job supporting Left 4 Dead 1

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
As it is

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Like those

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
They got a heck of a lot more support

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Than I think people do for their maddens

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
For their DDR's

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
For their what other games do they re-release every year

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
You know those are two of the big ones I can think of

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
But you know what I mean right

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Guitar Heroes

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
And so forth

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Okay

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
Well here's an interesting tactic by Valve

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
I actually have to hand it to them

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
They actually invited the two Steam users who started the boycott

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Their online names are Walking Target and Agent of Chaos

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Right after the game was announced at E3 2009

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
They invited these guys to Valve's offices to play the game

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Interview members of the development team

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Now the interesting thing is that the resolution of this

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Is that these two guys say they're going to continue boycotting the upcoming title

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But at the same time

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Reported that the game seemed balanced and tight

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And did not feel like a rush jobs

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Now of course

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
The people that all signed this petition

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
There's a lot of them saying

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
It's corrupt

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
You guys are corrupt

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And now you guys should step down

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You should no longer be admins of this

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
And the guys that went say

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Hey what we did

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
We did way more than most people thought we'd get done

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
Meaning they have only over 40,000 members in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group on Steam

37:54.000 --> 38:02.000
And they are still demanding that Valve release this as a low cost expansion pack to the original Left 4 Dead

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Is what the community is bitching for

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
What I think, I really don't think that it's in any way kind of selling out

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
It's that Valve offered an olive branch

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, I don't think these guys sold out

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
By any means

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
I think that they out of

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
I actually think it's a very mature thing that they did

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Going, you know, humoring them

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Looking at it, you know, trying to see if maybe

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
They were justified or not, you know what I mean?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
But doesn't that strike you as weird that on one hand they're saying

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
We're going to continue the boycott

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
And on the other hand they're saying

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
But the game doesn't feel rushed, it does feel pretty complete

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Like, don't you get the sense that they're only continuing the boycott

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Because they don't want to have that percent

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Like, imagine they come home and drop the boycott

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Like, what's that going to make them look like?

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
It's going to make it look like their silence was bought, right?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
No

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Don't you wonder if that's coming into play

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
That they just don't want their integrity questioned?

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
See, if they came out and said

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
We played the game

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
And, you know, we'd like to retract our position

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Everything that we complained about

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
We were wrong

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
I think that is bigger balls and shows more integrity

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
But have they provided a reason that they're still going to continue their boycott?

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Do they say it still doesn't feel like a sequel?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You know

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
To be fair, I'm reading this off of another news release

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
So I don't have their full statement on whatever it is they went and visited

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
We need to wait to see if they say why they're continuing

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Let me see if I can find that

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Or chatters, feel free to help out if you have a link to something that they said

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's just a safe face on their part

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
That's all it really is

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Because, like you said, if they came back and said

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, the game's awesome, you know, we should drop our boycott

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Then, you know, 39,998 people would go

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You're fucking retarded

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Here's another quote from them I found on another news source

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And it will only get better

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
But they will continue the boycott until their, quote, individual concerns are addressed

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Which, you know, I don't

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Big fat paycheck

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
No, I don't think it has anything to do with that

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
I think, again, it's that they've dug themselves in too deep in this boycott now

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I don't think Valve was under any obligation to do what they did

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I think that was actually kind of nice of Valve

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And sets kind of a sad precedence

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Is that if you bitch enough about something they'll fly you out to fix it

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
It almost kind of makes me go

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Hmm, where do I want to travel

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh, I would like to kind of go to Boston

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Hey, Beatles Rock Band blows

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
And it was released way too soon after Rock Band 2

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
And you know they're going to release Rock Band 3

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
You know what, Rock Band 3 needs to be an expansion to Rock Band 2

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
A cheap upgrade

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, that's right, I said it

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Come sign my petition

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Yeah, free trip to Boston, yeah

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I'm just worried about the precedent that sets

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
But, again, I'm not blaming Valve

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
It was very cool of them

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, but this has been a very big thing

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
They've got a big gathering

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Like, you may have people go

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
If you had like a hundred people or so

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That would be big enough

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
But they've got, you know, in the tens of thousands

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
You know, they've got a big following

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
TheRobDeeInChat, chat.orangelandradio.com says

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
The gamers who support this boycott in the first place

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Have way too large of a sense of entitlement

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
I almost kind of think that hits the nail on the head

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
If these guys feel that strongly about it

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You know, and I realize we've debated this topic to death on the show

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And I really don't want to rehash the whole damn thing

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
But if you really feel that strongly about it

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
The best message you could send is don't buy it

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Honestly, at the end of the day

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
No petition you sign or anything like that

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Is going to have the impact that your wallet has

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
At the store

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So there it is

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And let's see

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 exists

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Because what Valve wants to do requires a sequel

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
SalaciousPop says

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Valve has already done a ton of stuff

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That is anthema to pretty much every other developer

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Anathema

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Using big words in my chat

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
How dare you, I'm just kidding

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
By the way, there was a somewhat related story

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Going on

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Where I guess there's a campaign

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Going on to fly the

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Valve boss

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Gabe Newell over to Australia

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
To actually look at a

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Left 4 Dead campaign

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
That was made called Shotgun Sunrise

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It's a custom campaign

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
That he basically

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Wanna fly the guy out there

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
To release this

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
They raised $3,000

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
In donations

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I don't know how they raised all that money

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Just trying to get this guy to fly out there

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
And look at this expansion or whatever

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I think he actually made like a quote

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Kind of tongue in cheek that

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Oh well I'll go look at it if they fly me out there

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
And they actually raised the money

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
But now he's kind of backing down or whatever

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
So

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Hopefully they donate the money somewhere

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Or something

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I just

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
But again it kind of goes back

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
To that entitlement thing

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Okay yay for you you made a mod and spent a lot of time

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Making the mod but why did you

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Do that? Did you feel entitled

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
To the fact that Valve should release that as an

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Official expansion? I mean

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
You know

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Don't mod if you're not gonna be

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Content with getting nothing

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
For what you did

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
That's what I don't understand

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
So

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
People suck

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I don't know I think the Left 4 Dead community

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Some of them

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I think they should be happy

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Where they're being angry

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I think that's a waste of money

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
What? Well I mean I can understand

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
If you feel passionately enough about something

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Especially if you put a whole lot of work into it

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
And you have enough other people that

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Enjoy your work that they're willing to

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Contribute to that yeah

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
But in the end it's a game

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
You know why not

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Save that three thousand dollars for

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
You know people who need it

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Aren't we in a global recession?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
God damn they raised that much

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Money over this

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I'm just kind of surprised

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You know that could go into an

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Arcade cabinet

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Shush

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
The Rob D in chat

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Says I would love love

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
For Valve to cancel Left 4 Dead 2

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Just to see how they would react

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I don't think that's gonna happen and I don't think

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
You should let a few bad apples spoil the barrels

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So to speak

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I don't see how this is different from

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
The sports games that come out every year

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And the DDR's and music

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Games that get re-released every year

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
That people buy

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I don't see how this is that much different except it actually

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Sounds like Valve is doing more

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Than what a lot of these other games that come out every year

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Do it actually sounds like there's more to it

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I don't know I think they should be happy

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I think some people just need to

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Get over themselves

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Well guess what came out for

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
iPhone

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Commodore 64 emulator

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Isn't that great?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Awesome where can I download it?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You can't

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Because they have found

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Problems that will be problems

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
For Apple actually

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Yeah there were

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Ways to access

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Basic programming

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Like the language basic

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And so Apple's like ah no

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And stopped it

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Because you can't release

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
An application that programs

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Or something like that like you can't

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Have an application on the iPhone that can program

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The iPhone to do anything

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You want all they have to do is

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Edit the

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
The emulator just to

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Disinclude the basic

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
What's funny is I think people

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Are going to constantly find ways to

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Get to basic you know because obviously

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
They figured out a way to abort the game somehow

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
And get into basic so I would think

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
They're going to keep doing this somehow but

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I guess if they patched this to keep Apple happy

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Then that's kind of cool because

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I grew up on the Commodore 64

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Okay that was my gaming system

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Until our family had an NES

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
That was my gaming system from ages like 5 to 10

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
So you know

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I would love to relive some of those games

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
For my youth but

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Well it's been resubmitted

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
So we'll see if it hangs around

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That would be

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Kind of cool

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I wonder though if the games that are being released

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
On this emulator are legal

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Like I know they say that

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
They have kind of like this mix of games

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Is the guy getting permission from these companies

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Or does he have to? Maybe copyright

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Laws are up because it's been about

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
25 years since most of these games

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Were released what like 84 yeah about 25 years

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Since most of these games came out maybe

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Copyright law comes into play if none of these companies

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It's only a handful of ROMs that are actually licensed

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
The ones that came out were Dragons

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Den, Limons, Jupiter

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Lander, Arctic Shipwreck and Jack Attack

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Okay Limons I recognize

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
As an official Commodore title that was one of the

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Games that was put out by Commodore

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
So I'm wondering if and I don't know if

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
All of these fit in that same car I actually

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
You know why? I actually owned Limons

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
It was one of the few paddle games that you had

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You played this little car and you held the little

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
It was actually one of my favorite games to play

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
You held down the little fire button to drive

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
And you turned the paddle back and forth

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
To kind of move back and forth on the track

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It was a lot of fun you had to avoid other cars

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And you could race forever

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That would be even though that's the type of game

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I think would throw me for five minutes

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Now like hours I played

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
This game as a kid but it was

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Like I guess you could call it a first party

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Or whatever it was actually put out by Commodore

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So I'm wondering if all these games don't have

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Commodore's sort of blessing or what's

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Going on so

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Frisbee in chat says

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Dear Apple what about some

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Open source on the iPhone

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I just don't think

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
You're going to see that happen because what they're

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Probably worried about is

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
People getting into the phone aspect of it

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Using all these programming

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
You know hacking it so that the phones

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Get open and suddenly you can make

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Phone calls without having to pay for it and so on

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Like I just think they're really worried about how

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Far you can hack these devices

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
GS68 says I want to see

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
MSX games on the iPhone dammit

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh wait Americans don't care about

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
MSX I'd like to see the

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Original Metal Gear Solid

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The original Metal Gear for one

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Before it was Nintendo-fied

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
And the original Metal Gear 2

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And I wouldn't mind seeing

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Gardic but the problem is who's

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Going to translate those

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Fans!

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Better learn how to speak Japanese

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Something like that

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Coming to the PSP is yet another firmware

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Of course why not

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
They have plenty of other firmwares

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Like all the other firmwares

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
It's been cracked already

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Which is really important

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
But what this firmware does

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Hint at though is

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Some things that possibly will be coming out

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Later on including game rentals

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Apparently

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
As part of the change log

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
They have ways that you can

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Now group different folders

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
It says games now can be grouped

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
And displayed in folders based on their

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Expire dates under game

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
So that means that there's

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Going to be some sort of trials or something

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
That will expire after a certain amount of time

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And then of course

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Some other stuff

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
They changed settings

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Network updates have been changed

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
To system updates

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
The number of colors that can be selected

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Under settings has been increased

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And revisions to strengthen

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Security of course

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
With the internet browser

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
The other

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Of course

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Before they already have support now for

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Video rentals so maybe

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Now they're going to do it with games

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I think it has to be something big like that

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Because what else justifies the

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
6.0 I mean it's not like

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
5.3 or 5.0

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Like this is a major release

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Or they wouldn't call it 6.0

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It's the PSP Go because it's coming out in like 2 weeks

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh that makes sense too

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Fair enough

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Do you think though that game rentals is something

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
It's nothing I ever thought of before

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
But then when I thought oh my gosh

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Like companies get mad

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
At the game rental industry

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Because they don't see any of those profits

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But this would

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Let them get a chunk of those profits

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Where the rentals are happening

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And Sony gets a good chunk of that too

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Because they're endorsing the service

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
And they kind of can put the rental thing

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Out of business

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It's not going to happen right away or for a long time

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I mean this could be something huge

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
That we're looking down the barrel of

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I mean really it's not going to cut into rental business

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Because most rental stores

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I mean you know how bad

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
The PSP is doing I mean it's hardly

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Selling anything there's not a lot of good games

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Out for it most stores do not

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Bring in PSP as a rental

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Category

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Okay but only a matter of time then

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Before it's on Playstation 3

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Although those games are ginormous

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I don't know the feasibility

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Of that but

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
We're years away

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
From that being possible

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I mean technology gets better data moves faster

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
We're five years away from

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
A PS3 game being

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Downloadable as fast as

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Super Nintendo ROM is these days

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah but in five years it's going to be a Playstation 4

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
And no one's going to give a crap

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
About Playstation 3 titles that are downloadable

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Just like Playstation 1 titles

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That come out now

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah that's kind of cool that they're re-releasing them again

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
But really is it such a big deal

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I mean is it even something that you would go rent

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I mean especially when the titles are like

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Ten bucks

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
What are they going to charge for rentals? Two dollars?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I mean it's just it's not really

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Cost beneficial

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
To actually rent a title

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Frisbee in chat says there's already game rentals

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It's called DRM

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm not sure I quite understand that comment

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Is that like a dig on the fact that

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
When you download things you can't share it with other people

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
And all that I don't know

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Or I was thinking that the comment was going to say

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
It's called demos is kind of a way of

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Doing it and seeing if you like it

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Well that's kind of an asinine way of doing things

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I mean oh

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
We could put out demos for free

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
So that you can test our products

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And see if it's something that you want

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
But no we're going to be assholes about it

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
We're going to allow you to buy a demo basically

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Of this game

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Rent it for a little bit and decide if you want it

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And that way if you don't like it

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Hey we still got some of your money

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
But at the same time what about

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
We drop $60 on a game that we play for a week

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I mean imagine if we could

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Spend only $10

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
You know $9.99 to rent the game for a week

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
That would be

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Maybe something I'd rather do for a lot of games

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I would go rent them at

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Like your mom and pop rental store

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
But they're always out

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Imagine if I can go onto this digital thing

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Click a button it's downloading I got it

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Well good if that's an option for you

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I mean that's awesome but

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
The thing is

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I mean it's always good to have more options

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
To forego demos for this

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
You know rental stuff because

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
You know they feel that they can make more money

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
If you don't have a way to try

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Out this game

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Without you know paying money

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I just think

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Especially PSP games I think you're going to see

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And you're right

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I don't think PSP games are really

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Rented at stores so I don't think you're going to see

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
This dig into the real rental market

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Right now but it's about setting a precedent

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You know especially with

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
PSP Go being digital

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Download only and that they think

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This thing's going to be huge although I don't think

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
It is Oh it's going to fail I think they're

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Setting the stage for you know this whole

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Rental thing that is first party and we

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Haven't seen anything like it before

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I think this is

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
A pretty big deal on what's coming

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And I think probably it sounds like by the holidays

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
This is going to be something that's launched

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Oh man PSP Go is going to be

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It's going to fail so bad

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Don't get me wrong I like

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
The PSP 3000

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I just

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Yeah well

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I hate going over the same

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But still

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I mean there's other stories

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I'm sure we have coming up

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
It's like

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
What exactly are you doing different with the PSP

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Go other than charging me a lot more money

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
And not having the ability to play

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
UMD games I mean there's really

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Nothing that's going to be exclusive to that

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Maybe rentals are exclusive

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
To the PSP Go?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It won't be because you know why?

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Because if they do it exclusive to the PSP Go

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Then they lose out on all the

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
PSP 3000 stuff

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know Deathwishing in Chat says

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I love renting PSP games

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Renting PSP games are awesome when you go on trips

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Makes sense

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I mean if you're going to go on a long road trip

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Why not rent a game?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
They do have PSP rentals and NDS rentals

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
With like the

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Kiosk and airports

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And stuff like that you can do that

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
There's a place in the airport here that has

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Rental thing and you drop it off in the box

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Oh good I'm going to LA next week and I'm flying

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Maybe I'll have to utilize that

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Yeah it's actually pretty cool you rent it

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Where you're

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Flying out of and you can drop it off

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
They have one in every single airport

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Major airport yeah

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Alright well

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Moving on to another story

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
We'll see what unfolds with the PSP

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
possible rental system a little later on

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
But I want to move into this because this has to do with

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Copying games too but of a whole different

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Sort now of course Batman

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Arkham Asylum was huge it came out on

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
All these consoles this past week but don't

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Forget it also came out on the PC

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Hello there's still quite a few people

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
That are very into their PC gaming love it

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
And Batman Arkham Asylum of course was released

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
On the games for windows platform

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
So that those folks could play it there as well

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
But of course where there is

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
PC gaming there is piracy

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
So I guess an early version of this

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Game leaked out and there was

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
A user that actually posted on

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
The official Eidos forums

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
With a post that went something like this that he had a

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Glitch with his PC version of the game quote

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I've got a problem when it's time

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
To use Batman's glide in the game

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
When I hold like it's when I

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Hold the comma like it's said to to jump from one

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Platform to another Batman tries

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
To open his wings again and again instead

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Of gliding so he falls down

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Into poison gas if somebody could tell

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Me what should I do here and

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
It was actually replied to by an

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Admin on the forums Keir

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Responded to the thread and said the

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Problem you have encountered is a hook in the copy

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Protection to catch out people who

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Try and download cracked versions of the game

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
For free it's not a bug in the games code

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
It's a bug in your moral code in other

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Words this

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Crack or this version of the game

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Was put out there with this bug in it

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
So that when people call

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Support to complain or go post on

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
The forums to complain or spend the time to

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Download it or what have you to do it

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
They essentially out themselves as

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Pirates isn't that entrapment

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
No because they're not

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Really implicating them of a crime

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
It's just so that they have

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
An unplayable copy of it if they but

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Here's the thing here's the funny thing about it

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
One they've done this before with Grand Theft Auto

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
If you pirated Grand Theft Auto

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
4 on PC they had this

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Thing basically it was drunk cam all the

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Time it was shaking around making it really hard

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
To play

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
And then the other thing is

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
This problem with Batman Arkham Asylum

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Got patched within like a day

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It was only effective for about a day

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And then that was it

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
And that's what TigerClaus does in chat

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
As well as the glitch was later fixed

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
And yeah I think we're all not surprised

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
To hear that but

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
How many people do you think

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Think to find the fix

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Do you think that maybe

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
This does still defeat

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
A lot of pirates because they'll get the game

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Play it go this sucks and delete it

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Without ever thinking to look

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
For a patch

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
No maybe stupid people

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
That you know are

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Not really normally pirating

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Games but a lot of people will

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Get frustrated with it and then

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Like a week later they'll read on the forums

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
That this was intentional and then they'll re-download it again

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I mean it's just like the guy that

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
You know had ran into this

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
He's not going to go oh my goodness

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I can't believe they got me

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Well I'm just going to buy games from now on

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
No he's just going to go and re-download the game

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
When it's been patched or fixed

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Wait for someone smart to do it

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And that's what's going to happen

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
If they have no intention of purchasing the game

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
They're not going to purchase the game

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
El Non Hombre Hombre

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
In our chat room says

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
No it's not entrapment because they're

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
A. Not law enforcement and

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
B. They aren't asking them to pirate

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Well I meant that

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I thought that they had called the police on them

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
No it looks like they just banned

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
This guy from their forums or what have you

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Well to be fair

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Couldn't they report it?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
They could report it but

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
They sort of set him up

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I don't know I'm kind of reminded of

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
And this is going to make me sound super gay

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
But Madonna

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
When one of her albums was leaked to the internet

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
It was actually something Madonna's record label

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Released themselves and it would

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Start the song and you would hear like the first

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
15 seconds and then you would hear Madonna's

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Voice come on and go what the fuck are you

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Doing?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
So she basically put out all these

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Bogus MP3's that started off like the real

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Thing and then would just cut off and it would be her

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Going what the fuck are you doing?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm kind of reminded

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Of that this is essentially the

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Video game equivalent

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Of that except the game doesn't taunt

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You well

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
It taunts you without directly taunting

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
You if that makes sense

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I don't know if entrapment

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Would be the word I would use though

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah that wasn't quite what I was thinking

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I don't know what legal

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Recourse they could seek with this

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Because

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I certainly think it's a

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Good way to out the people that

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Aren't supporting them

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
To go so far it's pretty bold to download a

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Pirated copy of the game and post on the forums

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
About it that is kind of a stupid

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Thing to do in my opinion

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Is that if you're gonna

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Steal but I don't think that they had

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Any way of knowing that it was an intentional

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Glitch

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Salacious pop in chat

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Says that it would defer anyone

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Even the idiot makes it worth

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It in my opinion I kind of tend to agree

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
With that statement because

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You know even if it took a day

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
For that patch to came out

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
That patch to come out that fixed it

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That was still one day

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Where you might have some of these pirates get fed up with

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Waiting and go I'm just gonna buy it

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It looked cool enough from what I saw

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I'm just gonna buy it

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And even if that drove sales it did curb

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
A low percentage of the piracy

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And had more of an impact than not doing anything at all

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Sure

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I guess

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Alright

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The Rob D in chat says the best part would be

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
If the game crashed before the final boss

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
That would be the best middle finger to the pirates

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I think that Rob D

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah but the problem with things like Earthbound

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Is one thing but I think the problem with what Rob D

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Is suggesting as funny and clever as that is

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I think that most people

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Would say at that point I played enough of the game

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Forget it I mean I love the Earthbound

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Thing we talked about a couple weeks on the show

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
That you know it doubled the number of monsters

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And you know would crash your game

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Delete the save and everything but

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I think there's a lot of people that at that point would just go

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Ah fuck it I don't need to worry about this game anymore

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I'm gonna move on and steal something else

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Also after having seen the last

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Boss and ending of the game

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
First of all the last boss

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Is actually kind of easy

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Um you know Uber Joker

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And uh the

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Ending was uh less than a minute long

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Really for Arkham Asylum?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Well

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It was it was short okay

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Spoiler free please but

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Less than five minutes is fair but

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Although I don't remember it even being that long

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Wow okay fair enough

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Rob D in chat says

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I think that if they played that long

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They would be really frustrated with the inability to finish it

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Yeah to some extent but I

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You know I do think

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I think Eidos or you know did

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Did a funny thing here because

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I think people that are gonna be bold enough to steal

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And then complain about their stolen game

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
On the official forums I think they deserve

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
To kind of be made a mockery of

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You know what I mean? So

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You know he kind of got his just desserts and I think that's

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Where a lot of us are doing the Nelson here going

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Ah ha

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know it's one thing to steal but it's

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It's like even it's like the different

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Circles of hell

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Like stealing a computer game is it's

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
It's one of the circles of hell but it's like you know

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It's just getting poked with a hot prod

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But then to like go and actually complain about it

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
On the forums and try to blame the

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Developers for their borked game

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
That's like eternal damnation

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Come on

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
So alright anyhow

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
More news stories and we're gonna get into release dates

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Dark Sakura

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Let's see

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Well Lucas Arts

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Um is actually

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Working on a new game

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And now Lucas Arts

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Loom 2

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I wish I so wish

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But this is actually kind of cool because they said that they took

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Their inspiration from games that are like

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Braid

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And of course Braid was you know pretty freaking cool

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Which by the way has gone down in price on Steam

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It's on sale

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Um

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But it's called

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Lucidity which is supposed to be an

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Xbox Live arcade game

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And um there's rumors of a PC

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Version but they didn't say anything about that

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It's a 2D side scrolling

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Um

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Platformer but it has puzzle elements

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Um we play as a girl

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Called Sophie and

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
She keeps moving you just have to move

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Things out of her way

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Kind of lemming-ish right you know

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That's kind of what it sounds like to me a little bit

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
But I guess your

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Goal is to get her from point A to point B

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But is she stupid?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Like you know lemmings were stupid that was the whole point of the game

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
They would just keep walking right off a cliff

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
If they you know needed to

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
They said that she's like in her

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Abstract dream world

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
So maybe she's just

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Dreaming you know

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Kind of out of it but the art

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Style is supposed to be the cut paper

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Look of a pop-up book

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Oh that's kind of sounds neat

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
So it's going to look like an old school children's book

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Hmm

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
She's dreaming stupid

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
What was the last time

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
We got a um

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Game

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
From LucasArts like

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It wasn't Star Wars related

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Like at Indiana Jones?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Oh I didn't realize they were behind the Lego games

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It is LucasArts

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Oh gotcha

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Well this sounds like it could be cool but um

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I'll wait to see if there's a demo

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Before that there was fracture

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Alright so there's just games I missed

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Somehow there's too many video games you can't play them all

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I think that was them yeah fracture

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Fracture sucks

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Underachiever

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I want to go back for a minute because I think this chat room

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Comment bears repeating

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
To Arkham Asylum, Tigerclaw wanted to clarify something

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
On the ending of Arkham Asylum

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
He says Arkham Asylum continues on though

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
After you beat the game you can still click on

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Continue story and you have free roaming

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Of the entire game so you can go and find

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Those Riddler trophies, the alignment

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Puzzles and interview tapes

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Yeah but that's just for completion

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So that's not really the ending

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Or to do with the story itself

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
That's like New Game Plus

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
You can go taunt Harley for a little while

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Alright fair enough

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Ok

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Let's get into some release dates we're going to travel the globe

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And talk about what's coming out in your neck of the woods

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Starting off with the US, Loki

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Yes this week actually quite a few things coming out

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Starting off with of course

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Woohoo

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Yes which will be coming out on pretty much everything

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Need for Speed Shift will be coming out this week as well

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
PSP and I believe the PC version as well

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Scribblenauts will be making its way out on DS this week

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Actually I believe like a week from today

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I think

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
No Tuesday my mistake

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Actually tomorrow Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story on the DS

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Some other crappy games on the DS

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
My Boyfriend and Princess in Love on DS

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Woohoo

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yeah

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let's see

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Animal Planet Vet Life

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I just want to say though I saw Commercial for Need for Speed Shift the other day

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
On TV and it looked pretty hot

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Because it was in high def

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It's like Project Gotham

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Looks kind of neat

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And speaking of piracy

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Batman Arkham Asylum on PC

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So if you're complaining about it now you don't have it yet

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Liars

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Bleach the Third Phantom on DS

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Chicken Blaster on DS and Wii

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Another movie tie-in game

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on pretty much every system except for the Playstation 2

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Heroes of the Galaxy

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Which looks like an OK World War 2

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Played some game

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
NHL you've got two games coming out this week

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
NHL 10 from EA on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And NHL 2K10 on Playstation 2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Red Faction Guerrilla finally making its way out on PC as well as Resident Evil 5

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Time of Shadows

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I didn't even know they were giving that a PC release

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Time of Shadows also on PC

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
This week that really crappy game they played on Konami's booth at E3 this year

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Tornado Outbreak formerly known as Zephyr Rise of the Elementals

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
On Playstation 3 Wii and Xbox 360

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
You remember that as kind of the tornado Katamari type of game

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Toy Story Mania based off the ride and in 3D coming to the Wii

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
A game I ranted and raved about last week

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Wet coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And then finally just thought I should mention this since we talked about them around E3

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
That will be coming out as well

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And then finally on Xbox 360 the Q Entertainment Trilogy on Xbox 360

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Qubed which features Rez, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and of course Luminous Live

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And they left out 99 Nights

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Well that's not Xbox Live

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I know but still

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And I don't think it is

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Is there anything extra in this though?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
You know what's funny?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Besides some of their misfires like 99 Nights

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I really love Q Entertainment

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Tetsuya Mizuguchi is the man

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
He's one of my favorites

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Most of the games he puts out I love

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000
So I'm kind of curious if there's anything extra in the collection that would make it worth getting

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Probably the download content is probably in there

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I'm not positive but it would make sense

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Oh and how did I miss this?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Naruto Shippuden, Ninja Destiny 2

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Who cares about Naruto

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Going over to Japan, September 17th

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Fuel, the localized version for Japan finally hits on September 17th

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Also Left 4 Dead gets a price drop

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It moves into the Platinum Collection

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
These are both on the Xbox 360

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Terminator Salvation from Squeenix is putting it out over in Japan

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
A game called Velvet Assassin from Ubisoft makes its way to the Xbox 360

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Moving on to the Playstation 3 coming out on the 17th

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Also Fuel there as well

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Makai Senki Disgaea 3

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Appendisk, Razz Barrel, Hen Hajime Mashita

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I'm assuming that is some type of extra scenario for Disgaea 3

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Tales of Vesperia makes its way out on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And then lastly Terminator Salvation and Wet

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Both on the Playstation 3 this week as well in Japan on the 17th

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, checking out the games there

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean comes out from Nintendo in Japan this week

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
House of the Dead Overkill that comes by itself and a version with the Wii Zapper

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
The Wii Zapper is not dead in Japan apparently

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It's coming out with that little bundle out there

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Or they're just trying to unload the remaining supply they had

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Probably

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Playstation 2 sees some price reductions this week

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Bully the Scholarship Edition and Biohazard Code Veronica

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Which of course is Resident Evil Code Veronica in a bundle with Resident Evil 4

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Or Biohazard 4 as it is in Japan

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And lastly on the handhelds

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Trying to see if there's anything

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Saga 2 Hyou Densetsu Goddess of Destiny comes out from Square Enix

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So this must be another Saga game that's coming out in Japan this week

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So I know that series has its fans

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So maybe there'll be some folks wanting to import that

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Although they'll have to try and read it

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And Idolmaster, Dearly Stars, DS, get it?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Idolmaster definitely has its fans in Japan

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That is coming out on the Nintendo DS this week

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Do you think that's a franchise we will ever see happen over here?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Probably not

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Why not?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Because

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's too Japanese

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Exactly

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I hate to say it because it sounds weird but yeah

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Quite a few games to pick from on the PSP this week in Japan

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Ys 7 comes out this week

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Tag Force

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Katakyuu Hitman Reborn Battle Arena 2 Spirit's Burst comes out this week

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000
As well as a price reduction for Irregular Hunter X and Rockman Rockman value pack

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I'm assuming that is just the Mega Man games all packaged together

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And lastly, Iki Utsun Eloquent Fist gets a price reduction this week

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I'm trying to see what game that is

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I think that's one we have over here

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
No

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
No, one of the characters looks just like Sakura though

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But like an older version

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Look at that, she's like wearing the same outfit and everything

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Well it is a, you know, high school uniform

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I guess

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
That's just what it makes me think of though

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And it's Ys chatroom

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Ys

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Ys

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Okay there you go, there's your release dates for Japan

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.000
For the UK we have, on the 15th as we discussed last week, Azuma's Revenge

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And then on the 18th a whole crap ton of stuff

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
We have Batman Arkham Asylum for PC, don't pirate it or you'll get laughed at

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Blood Bowl, Katamari Forever for PS3

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2 for Wii

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Order of War, Raven Squad, Red Gorilla Faction, I'm sorry Red Faction Gorilla, sorry

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I was reading Gorilla and thinking beer

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Resident Evil 5, Spectrobes Origins, The Humans for DS and PC

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Wacky World of Sports for Wii, and Wet

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Also Yamaha Supercross for DS and Need for Speed Shift on a crap ton of systems

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Hmm, very cool

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So there's some new stuff finally making its way to home

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And this is kind of cool, I fully endorse this

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Robot Chicken is coming to the PlayStation Home Theater

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I did that off camera, sorry

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Dark Sakura's making sound effects in the studio

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm singing the Robot Chicken theme

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It was actually really funny, it's a bummer you couldn't hear her

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I'm stealing a cookie

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So now they will actually have a bunch of different clips available on their theater screen

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
That once played Twilight's, I remember when they were playing the Twilight trailer on there

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Well thank god they got rid of that

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yes, so you'll be able to watch Robot Chicken for free even though you can pretty much on your TV as well

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000
But neat I guess, something else to watch while you're doing the Running Man

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Well I think it's nice they're putting more useful things in home, does that make sense?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You know trailers are one thing but it's kind of nice that they're actually giving those theaters something a little more

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I don't know, in demand to watch

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Although I heard there was a soup, you know that show The Soup?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I think there was a clip show that was supposedly on Sony Home, I couldn't find it

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But I didn't look very hard to be honest

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I noticed that Sony's kind of branching out into putting some of these TV shows for free in home

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And I think that's a good use of home, makes it a little more appealing in my opinion

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I think it's just a matter of time before you start seeing the first episode of TV shows that they're trying to get you hooked into

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Like the Glee pilot or what other pilots they've been trying to sell this year

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
There are other science fiction, Caprica's pilot, some of these shows that are coming out in 2010

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Trying to kind of push those in Sony Home, I bet, especially for the next fall season you start seeing more of that

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Yeah

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
We'll see

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But that's kind of cool, I think that's a good use of Playstation Home

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
By the way there's some free stuff on Home this weekend too if you haven't logged in

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And search for the OLR Club, I don't actually have to invite you, if you want to join the Orange Lawns Radio

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Just search for it in Clubhouses, either search for Orange Lawns Radio or O-L-R-M-Y is like the keyword for it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
So search for either of those and you'll find the Clubhouse and I'll invite you in

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do with Penny Arcade Expo

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And some unfortunate kind of side effect of so many folks being all contained in one place

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000
PAX organizers did report this week that a confirmed swine flu case did break out at the show

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And unfortunately this has grown into about a hundred cases of swine flu

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Of course H1N1 is the real name for it but everybody calls it swine flu

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Coming out of Penny Arcade Expo so kind of scary that you get all those people together and these types of things break out

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Now it's not just the swine flu but of course the regular flu is showing up as well

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
You know as is various types of con things

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Now this came up and we talked about this for a little bit on our phone call with Bobby Blackwolf

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
That we do on his show right before we go on the air tonight

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
So we talked a little bit about this and you know a couple bottom lines that come out of this

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Is that A, this is just an unfortunate circumstance of cons

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And Jamie you said something very smart about the fatigue that goes on at cons

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And why this happens a lot

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Well and keep in mind I was a long time con goer ever since I moved out here

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And before I moved out here

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
You know my first convention I slept like three hours

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And it was a three day convention

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So yeah

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
A lot of people will do that

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's a big thing

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Like for people who don't you know buy their hotel room and sleep in the lobby

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
People do that sorry

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You are typically saving the typical con goer

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
May not be thinking in terms of proper nutrition for one thing

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
They'll be eating cheap con food

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
They'll be bringing snacks like when Julie used to go with us to cons

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
She would pack nothing but like croissants and cookies and all this crap

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And I'd be like bring me some freaking carrots

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You know because I can't eat that much sweet food all the time you know

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And like I even ran away and got Moroccan food once

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
At AX one year

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So um

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
But people don't really think in terms of their health

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And the precautions they should be taking you know

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
At least have a couple of good decent meals you know with vegetables

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Bring your vitamins with you take a good supplement in the morning

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
You know all of that contributes to your level of fatigue

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And sleep please sleep

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You know the con is a few days

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
But you've got to live with your health for the rest of your life

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Now I know that some people have kind of been wondering what my piece is going to be on this

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Because you know if you were listening to show a couple months ago

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You know I have been very personally affected by swine flu

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I lost a good friend of mine who is only 24 years old

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
She passed away of H1N1 a couple months ago

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
On June 23rd right before my birthday

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I realized that what happened to her is not going to happen to everybody

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Okay so I don't think there needs to be paranoia out there about the swine flu

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But it pisses me off when people don't take this shit seriously

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And I don't think that people have to like you know

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Oh my god mass hysteria like no nobody wants that

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
But at the same time don't belittle what disease can do

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And whether you know you know if you want to argue with me

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The whole well swine flu is just like the regular flu

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Blah blah blah fine whatever

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
You know yes I admit you can die from both

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And I don't want to because I actually know people like on Twitter

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
That apparently caught this at PAX

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And I don't want people to freak out like oh my gosh am I going to die

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Probably not

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's you know what happened with Beth was certainly an isolated circumstance

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
There's still many questions

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
We're never going to get answers to as to what happened there

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
My point is though

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Don't belittle this like it's the common cold

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
If you have a high fever

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Call your doctor

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Go in make an appointment

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Get checked out get told it's nothing

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Don't wait because the longer you let it go

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
The worse it's going to get and I don't want you to end up

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I don't want anyone I know to have what happened to Beth happen to them

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So you know please

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You know and again this is not something I really get into ever on the program

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
But my day job is I work for a health insurance company

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company in the state

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And we work directly with the members in the center that I work with

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So I know and I'll tell you

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Most health insurance companies at least any decent one I know mine does

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Will pay for urgent care

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
If you suspect you know whether you have PPO HMO whatever

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It will pay for urgent care if you have symptoms

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So you don't have to go to the ER because you have a high fever

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
You can go to an urgent care center

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
You can make an appointment with your doctor

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Just go get checked out

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Get told it's nothing get told it's the common cold

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It's better you do that than the alternative

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And if you don't have coverage

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Still a lot of those urgent care places

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Will treat you for

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The last one I ever went to was 75 bucks I think

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
If you're uninsured you know and

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
They're there for that reason

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Yeah go to an urgent care center not the ER for this

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But get checked out for heaven's sake

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You know don't sit on it and don't wait on it

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And the other side I want to do with this is that

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
When you go to cons

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And when you go to these places

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Please be hygienic

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I know a lot of people make jokes about this stuff

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
The whole con funk and all that stuff

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
But that is a very real thing that can continue to spread disease

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And I want to reiterate one thing that Beth's mom Lynn

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Said to the media when she was interviewed

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Because Beth was the first person to die in this county from H1N1

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And the one thing that her mom said to me

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I will never forget this for the rest of my life

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Is her on the news saying this

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And I want you all to remember this

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Wash your hands wash your hands wash your hands

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I am not fucking around when you go to these conventions

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And you're touching these controllers that hundreds of people have touched before

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And so forth

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Wash your hands

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Please help stop the spread of disease

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And wash your body while you're at it

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Well I remember

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I don't actually know if you remember this Rob

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The last time that we went to E3 together

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
What did I have on me all the time?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Probably hand sanitizer

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Hand sanitizer

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I also had antibacterial lotion on hand

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I had band-aids

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And now this is something else I learned being a massage therapist

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You don't want to have an exposed open wound

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
When you are around that many people

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
You do not want to touch other people's blood

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Because first of all for example hepatitis

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Lives outside of the body I think for two weeks

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Active, live

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Even if you think you've wiped up all the blood

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It'll still live on the surface of anything that's touched

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Unless you wipe it off really good

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
That's why they always say if you're going to be around someone who's bleeding

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
You put on latex gloves and then you take care of them

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Put on your own mask before

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And speaking of latex if you're going to have con sex use a condom

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Use a full body condom if you're having con sex

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But I'm saying you may not think about this

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And the average person doesn't

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But there are so many different ways to get sick

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And I'm not saying be paranoid

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
But really take precaution if you're going to be around that many people

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And at least always keep hand sanitizer around you

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And at least be considerate to other people

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
If you've got like a paper cut or a cut on your arm or something

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Put a good watertight bandage on it

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So that you don't you know

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I've got like for example

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And no I've never had it but I have antibodies for hepatitis

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Because I inherited it from somebody

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But that still puts me at danger for exposing other people

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
So that's why I'm always extra careful

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I always bandage up my cuts and things

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Because I mean you always have

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
It's a matter of also being considerate to other people

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And if you are sick and you do go

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Wear one of those little paper masks

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Don't cough on anyone wash your hands all the time

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
You know be considerate of other people

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
If you are going to be so inconsiderate

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That you're going to go around other people while you're sick

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And possibly contagious

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
If you have a sinus infection I don't care

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
That's not contagious

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
If you have the flu

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
If you have the cold

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
If you have something that is communicable

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Take a precaution that you don't share it

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And honestly it's not worth it

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Stay home

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
There'll be another convention

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Now I'm hoping you're sitting there on your chair

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Going okay get on with it O.L.R.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I know this crap

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
But please understand if like one person's kind of sitting there

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Going oh yeah maybe I should take like

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Extra soap to the ex-con I go to

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Then this whole little rant was worth it

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Because I see a comment in chat

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Frisbee says O.L.R. dash common sense

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I really hope to everybody it is common sense

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But if you've ever made the con-funk joke

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Then you know it's not common sense to everybody

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Okay so just please

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
From your friends at O.L.R.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Wash your damn hands

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And again I do see

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I see the con-funk around two particular groups

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
The really young

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And the I have no life

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I've never you know been on a date

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
You know 50 year old con-van boy

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
That's probably why they never had a date

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
S.H.A. 100 Matt also wants to put out

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And don't pee on the seat when you use the toilet

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Yeah don't do that Nope

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I will say something this

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Do not be afraid of urine on a seat

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It is sterile

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Just wipe it off Ew

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But I'm telling you if you see poop on the seat

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
That's different No

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Okay this is too much I'm done I'm done

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Rob it actually is true urine is sterile

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You have more germs on your hands and mouth

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Than you do on your butt

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I'm done nope too much done

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Just wash your hands okay

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
That was the point I wanted to make

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Before you pick up a controller at a gaming convention

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Just wash your hands

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Alright let's get into the classic game of the week

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
True though I know

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Somehow we always end up with the show in the toilet

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Even literally

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Hey every week here on Orange Lawns Radio

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
We urge you kids to go visit the archives

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And check out a classic video game of years past

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And tonight is no different

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Dark Sakura's gonna go into the vault

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And pick out a game she thinks you all should be playing

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Dark Sakura

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's Pissarama

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
No I'm kidding

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I hate you

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Heart heart heart heart heart

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Okay no it's Space Harrier

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
About damn time I did Space Harrier

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I actually just got an IM from Becky

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Saying that she thinks it's funny whenever I go off about pee being sterile

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Will you get to the game

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Get ready

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Go back go back cause people have to go that far

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Alright

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
We're looking at an arcade version of the game here

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Yeah

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
It has my catch phrase on it

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Here we go

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Welcome to the fantasy zone

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Get ready

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Now everyone knows where that comes from

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
That has been like what my catch phrase as long as you've known me

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
It's been your little quote on forums like ever since I've known you

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Yeah

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Why why that quote of the thousands of quotes out there

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Why this quote do you love so much

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because it's just cool

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Welcome to the fantasy zone

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Get ready

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Alright

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
It's like it really makes no sense

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Um Space Harrier is my third favorite video game ever

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Which is me which means I have now covered all three of my top three favorite video games

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
The first being the Guardian Legend

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
The second being Fantasy Zone

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And the third being Space Harrier

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
So moving forward

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:06.000
It is a game that was produced by Yu Suzuki who did a lot of Sega's really good games

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And sitting right next to me is a picture of my husband shaking hands with Yu Suzuki

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
That was pretty cool

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So Space Harrier is a sort of a fake 3D type of game

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
It is a sprite based game and it scrolls towards you

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Well not kind of like a real over the shoulder cam but it's from behind you

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And it has 18 levels each with a boss

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And you have to shoot you know everything that gets in your way before it shoots you

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And you can run on the ground or you can fly in the air with a jet pack

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And everything really does come at you very quickly

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
It's brightly covered levels

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Even for you know as old as it is because it came out in 1985

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It is a fantastic game and it's one of the early games to use digitized voices in it

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And after you beat a boss it tells you that you're doing great

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It constantly encourages you I mean how many games do that

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Anyway

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
By the way I just want to point out and I'm sorry Darsak if you were going to get to this

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
But since I was a Nintendo kid and not a Sega kid growing up

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
There was a game on Nintendo called 3D World Runner

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
That was a direct rip off of this game

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I was going to get to it

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Sorry

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Actually that game was put out by Square by the way

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And there was also Pony Canyon did a parody called Animal Attack Academy

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That had a Japanese school girl fighting Australian animals

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.000
But yeah the game is also that along with After Burner

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Was one of the first cabinets that had you in a seat

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And that the whole cabinet would move along with your joystick movement

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
There also is one that doesn't move that sits down and an upright version

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So it was really really cool to play

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I haven't played a space harrier in the you know with the full motion sit down cabinet in ages

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
It also it used the same music for the most part over and over again

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But I really loved the music

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I put up a link also to just the music

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I will bring that up so you can hear just the music without all the explosion noise

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Let's listen to a little bit of that

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Not bad for a game from 85

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
It really is one of my favorites

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Now as far as other releases we got a there was a computer a home computer version

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
There was also the 32x version and one thing I will say is that the 32x version is a direct rip from the arcade

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:00.000
In fact you actually have a little trick that you can do with it where it changes from press start to insert coin

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So that space harrier of course

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
But After Burner were both direct arcade ports

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
There was a Sega Saturn version

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:20.000
There was a Sharp x86000

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It only came out of Japan

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
All of those were supposed to be the most arcade available

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
There is a Dreamcast version that is playable within Shenmue and Shenmue 2

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And the Suzuki Gameworks Volume 1

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
An Xbox version of course it was in Shenmue 2

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And in the Sega Arcade Gallery for Gameboy Advance and the Sega Classics Collection

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
For the PS2

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Space Harrier 2 was the Genesis version

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Which actually also just came out on Virtual Console December 2 years ago

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
My head students they just came out

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
In Europe it came out in October 2008

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And over here on November 3, 2008

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
For the Master System

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Also the arcade version is unlockable in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
For Xbox 360 and PS3

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And apparently it has sound issues by everything being just off pitch

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
That means I couldn't play

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Actually I know that first hand because I tried to play Space Harrier

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And the music sounded wrong to me

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000
But I also have this thing where I hear anything off pitch

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Really strongly perfect pitch for listening

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I can't do it

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
There is also the Space Harrier Complete Edition

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
But you know what

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
They've done the series an injustice

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Because they didn't release the sequel at home

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
The sequel being Planet Harriers

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Have you played Planet Harriers?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I've heard of it

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I've heard you talk about it before

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Actually you know what

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I think that you've seen me play it

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Because they had it at Great America

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I probably have just seen it and don't really remember it

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Well I don't know if they still have it at Great America

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
But that one was pretty much a fantastic follow up to a great series

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I think this game

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And again sorry if I'm covering something you're about to get to

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
But I'm pretty sure this game is in that Sonic Genesis Collection

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That just came out

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
That's what I just said

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh sorry

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I said it was Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But it suffered from

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Oh I was zoning reading the Twitter

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So okay yeah it's there

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Yeah the reason why I couldn't play it is because it had pitch problems

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
All the voice and sound was just off

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Gotcha

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Enough to drive me nuts

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I have the same problem with music on the radio too

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
If they play it too fast

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I hear the pitch

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But anyway I digress

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But yeah go out and play Space Harrier

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
It's a lot of fun

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It's one of the few games of that perspective

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
That doesn't make me utterly motion sick either

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Unless I'm playing it in the cabinet

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
The motion cabinet

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Then I will get very sick and throw up all over you

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Which is not sterile

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Lovely

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So that's your game

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Alright there it is

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Your classic game of the week is Space Harrier

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
And I think Dark Sakura prefers the arcade version

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But there are some other places

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Actually

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
If I'm gonna play it at home

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I'm gonna play it on the 32X

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Just so I have a reason to play a good game on the giant mushroom of death

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Alright then there you go

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Space Harrier on the 32X is your classic game of the week

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Something non-Sega next week Dark Sakura

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I tried to pick something non-Sega

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And then it occurred to me that I have done dozens of other games that are among my favorites

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And have not done Space Harrier

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Alright fair enough

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But next week

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I got them on a month streak of Sega

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
So next week we'll have to do something non-Sega

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Next week something non-Sega

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Alright

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Maybe I'll do something on the Atari 2600

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That would be cool actually

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I would love to see some Atari 2600 games

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I'm actually just looking at a game on the Atari 2600 we have sitting around

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Alright

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Anyhow

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
We'll get into that next week

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
For now we're gonna take a break

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
We will be back though in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio and Part B tonight

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Twitter topics

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
We're also gonna talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 13

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Some more Sony news

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Including news about the minis

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And some Playstation 3 bundles

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And we're gonna talk about a possible Wii price cut

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
We'll get to all that and rapid fire news after this

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:22.000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And welcome back everybody to this Orange Lounge Radio

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
We are live on September the 13th of 2009

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Taping live at All Games Radio

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
The folks that always are kind enough to host our show

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
And let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
They have a new show starting by the way this week

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I just heard about it on Bobby's show tonight

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
The Escapist Live

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I'm probably getting the name of that show wrong and I apologize

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But I do know the cool thing about it is that you're gonna hear

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
The Yahtzee interviews early

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Like that's the first place you can hear

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
The Yahtzee reviews

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
The zero punctuation reviews

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Yahtzee's the guy that does it right?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Like the nice game?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Okay

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
You're gonna hear those reviews early before they actually go out

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And that's gonna be live on Tuesday nights at All Games Radio

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And it's sandwiched right in between Dead Pixel Live and Video Game Outsiders

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And Video Game Outsiders are another cool bunch

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's actually funny because they're very similar to us

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Because it's like two guys and a chick

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But they all do it over Skype

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And I think one guy's in Canada

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But it's funny because one of the guys on the show reminds me of you, Dark Sakura

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Because he has a classic arcade game collection that he always talks about on the show

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And how he's getting these new video games and so forth

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Just like you have your pinball tables, right?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It's kind of funny how our shows kind of complement each other, but they're very different

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Like we don't...

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
They play more like Warcraft and stuff

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And we're more, you know, music-based games and RPGs

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
They're very Xbox-centric, you know, it's just kind of funny

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
That we have so many similarities yet differences

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But anyway

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I wasn't meaning to plug them as much

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Although they are a good show

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I want to plug the Escapist show that's brand new that's coming to All Games as well

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
You know what, I say just go to All Games on Tuesday

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Just leave it running throughout the day

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And you're gonna hear a lot of great radio

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
That's just what you need to do

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And then don't forget on Sunday nights

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Come back and listen to Bobby Blackwolf and ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Alright

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Let us move on and get into some Twitter topics

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Before we get back to some news this week

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And very thin on the Twitter topics tonight

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I guess everybody's too busy with the Video Music Awards

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And all this other garbage that's going on tonight

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
We didn't get a lot of tweets

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
In fact we really only have one tweet

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
And it's from Spazinator tonight

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And the question is

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Oops, it's down here a little bit

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
He wrote like five tweets, good lord

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
How about either Home, upcoming 1.3 update and OLR Club

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
As well as sale on the PSN Video Store

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I don't know what they put for sale on the PSN Video Store

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
It's funny enough

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Because I was actually looking at what kind of offerings were in the Video Store this week

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Because since my Xbox 360 is broken

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I can't do Netflix right now

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It's kind of too bad though

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Because a lot of stuff that is available on the PSN Store

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And not to say the 360 is any different

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But it's a lot of movies I'm just not interested in

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
It's all like slasher flicks

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And action packed

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Which I understand who their target audience is

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
But forgive me if I like a good chick flick

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Or art house film every once in a while

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I don't really find those on either network to be honest

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
But then also the OLR Club

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I did plug that at the top of the show

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
But if you haven't joined the Orange Lounge Radio Club

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
In Sony Playstation Home

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
We do have one

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So check that out

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
ORMY is our little buzzword

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
And we have some arcade cabinets

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
That I got from the Namco Collection demo

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
That we put there

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So you can play like Dig Dug and stuff in our home

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And I'm trying to get other furniture as I find it

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
But I don't really want to pay for a lot of furniture

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But I guess there's some free stuff this weekend

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So if you go into the stores

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
You can find some new shirts and things like that

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And I guess some new furniture is free too

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So I want to try and dig that up

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Because I guess there's a coffin you can get for free this weekend

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So I thought maybe I'd plop a coffin on the stage

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Of our Orange Lounge Radio Clubhouse

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Wouldn't that be lovely?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Wouldn't you like that, Dark Sakura?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Just a coffin?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
That would be fantastic

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Alright

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And kick off with some rapid fire news tonight

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Starting off with Loki

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Yes

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Of course, Rock Band's got new stuff coming out each week

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And this week we've got some new songs

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Including Tenacious D

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Yes, that's right, Tenacious D will be getting a couple individual tracks

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
With Rock Your Socks and Tribute

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Both available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft points

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I'm totally getting Tribute

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Also part of the individual songs

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
The Guess Who with Hand Me Down World and No Time

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And then finally Dinosaur Jr. with Pick Me Up and The Wagon

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
All those available as individual song downloads

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Of $2 each or 160 Microsoft points

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Or I guess 200 Wii points

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
But that's a little easier to figure out

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Then to kind of coincide, I guess

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I know there's a new Anvil documentary coming out

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Well, they have the Anvil pack

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Which is available for 440 Microsoft points or $5.50

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Included with that is 666, Metal on Metal

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And this is 13

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And those also can be purchased individually for 160 Microsoft points or $2 each

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And then finally coming to the PSP

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
We've got Evanescence with Bring Me to Life

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And Spinal Tap with Back from the Dead

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And then also we've got Forza 3 going gold

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
And of course with that they announced the demo for the game

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Will be hitting the Xbox Live Marketplace on September 24th

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
You'll be able to check out some of the new cars

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
As well as some of the tracks

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And the demo will include 5 playable vehicles

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Including the 2007 Porsche

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Number 80 Flying Lizard 911

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Looks like an Audi R8 5.2

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
The Ferrari California

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
That would be 10

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Whatever

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And the mini John Cooper works

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
That's interesting

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Finally, a game I'm quite excited about

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
DJ Hero will be getting its healthy dose of Daft Punk

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And they will be contributing 11 unique mixes for the game

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
As well as being playable characters in the game as well

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Included with that would be Daft Punk Ride the World vs. Young MC Bust a Move

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Defunk vs. NASA Strange Enough featuring Karen, ODB, and Fatlip

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Daft Punk Defunks with Queen, another one bites the dust

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Robot Rock with Hashim Al-Nayefish

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I guess that's translated to the soul

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I'm glad I'm not the only one that horribly butchers pronunciations on this show

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Robot Rock vs. Queen, We Will Rock You

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I guess that's kind of appropriate

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Short Circuit vs. Boogie Down Productions Jack of Spades

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Technologic vs. Gary Numan's Cars

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I think there's too many tracks mixed with Cars

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
That's just my guess

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Television Rules the Nation vs. No Doubt Hella Good

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And I'm very disappointed to see that there's not anything for like

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Some of the songs One More Time or something like that

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Last, well, I guess that was their last album, maybe the album before last

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But man, maybe some download content later on

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And I think that all that is probably download content, all those songs, right?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Did they say that? Because I wouldn't think Daft Punk has that many songs in the game, do they?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
No, I think that's that many songs in the game

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Wow, that's kind of cool

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Yeah, so that was only 8 of the 11 songs too, so there's going to be more

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Well, getting into the Nintendo Virtual Console releases from this week

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000
On Virtual Console we had the Super Return of the Jedi from the Super Nintendo

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Came out this week and that was 800 Wii Points

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And I think every week they've been doing a Star Wars game, I think for the month

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
So there you go

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
DSiWare, they had Clubhouse Games Express Family Favorites

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Which has games like Hearts and Bridge and so forth

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
On WiiWare though, they had a game called Color Z, or Colors

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Which was where you go forth in spaceships on a mission to clean up virus infested planets

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I guess you absorb viruses of your color, but you want to stay away of other viruses

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
But who cares about that when you have Contra Rebirth hit for 1000 Wii Points

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Which is kind of like a Super Nintendo-ish looking newer version of Contra

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Which, funny enough, our caller last week, nailed it

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
That they thought Contra was going to be out on Labor Day and they were correct

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So good job on that

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Hey, Capcom vs. Tatsunoko has some new, apparently leaked, characters from poor website planning

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Apparently somebody was able to mine the website and find some images that were missing on the website

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
That apparently are going to be added later, which include Frank West from Dead Rising as a playable character

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Ah, we knew it

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
As in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Apparently Zero from the Mega Man series is there as well

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And Yatterman number 2 and Joe Asukara

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
We should have been in it to begin with, yes

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
He's always the one that wants to push the button

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Now see, I don't know dick about anime, so I guess Jamie's excitement has me excited too

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Woo!

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I guess that's good news, right?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The Pac-Man world record was broken, apparently the kill screen was reached in 3 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I'm sorry, that was the old record from Chris Ira

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Now it has been beat by David Race, I think is his name

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
3 hours 41 minutes and 22 seconds is the new time

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Wow, Billy Mitchell once held that spot

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
But Billy Mitchell's a dick

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I don't know, it's a movie, I'm not going to

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
He really is

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I don't know the guy, I'm not going to bother

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Alright, let's finish off the rapid fire news, Dark Sakura

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Well let's see what else we've got going on

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:46.000
There's actually an ESRB rating for Castlevania The Adventure on Wii

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Which really wasn't that good of a game

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
It was, you know, the Game Boy one that came out

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Also, and I mentioned this earlier, Braid is cheaper now on Steam

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It's $5 now, or £3.39

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
And it's a pretty cool game

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:15.000
And also, Final Fantasy VII on Wii has more download content

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Chapter 9, The Crystals, which is the final part of the story, that's 800 Wii Points

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I need to finish up that game

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Yep, I thought you'd be interested in that one

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yeah, I kind of stopped playing, but it was a really good Wii download game

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
A little other news in WiiWare, is that for 800 Wii Points, Spaceball Revolution

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Not to be confused with Spaceballs

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Then 2 and 1 Solitaire, which is Spider and Klondike

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And then, Sullivan's Key and Rygar for 500 and 600 Wii Points respectively

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Alright, let's get back into some long discussion topics tonight, Loki

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yes, the music game sales are down

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:07.000
But, even though they are down 46%, it is still the third best selling genre among video games

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:13.000
And of course, this is coming from the NPD group, they do all these sales tracking and whatnot

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And I guess, year to date sales have declined quite a bit

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:24.000
But, when you look at it, they're pretty much calculating stuff from up until

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Up to Guitar Hero 5 and the Beelz Rock Band

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I think a lot of people were anticipating those two games

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I was going to say, because I've seen this story spread like wildfire through blogs this week

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And I'm like, this is completely misleading, in a way

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Because the big music games for the year haven't even come out yet

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Or just came out

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Well, you obviously can't have that data right away

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I mean, they usually release the previous month's data like halfway through the next month

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I think that it's even selling half of what it used to is pretty damn impressive

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
When you consider a year ago, we had Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I mean, those are both huge titles

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
The DS games were just coming out too

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Those are all huge stuff

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
So, I mean, I'm not surprised

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I mean, since I don't really think that Smash Hits and Metallica sold

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I mean, they sold alright, but not like, you know, a Guitar Hero 5

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
They're just not going to sell the way a Guitar Hero 4 or a Rock Band 2 does

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Exactly, and the track packs, I mean, that doesn't really count

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
So, it's a little misleading

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It'd be more interesting to see what happens after the holiday

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
At the end of the year

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I would like to see an end of the year wrap up as compared to last year

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
You think it'll be kind of in the same?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I think you'll still see a little decline

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I don't think the Beatles Rock Band is going to sell quite the way Rock Band 2 did

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Don't get me wrong, I think it'll still sell pretty big

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And I think Guitar Hero 5 will probably be on par with Guitar Hero World Tour

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Which, if I'm not mistaken, didn't Guitar Hero beat Rock Band last year in terms of sales?

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Um, yes

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Yeah, because Guitar Hero is still, you know, despite the fact that, you know

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Rock Band gets more press usually because they have done more download packs

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And, you know, so forth, Guitar Hero still sells better

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Because they have more releases

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Well, and also, I would say they have better peripherals too

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I wouldn't call their drum set better than the other ones

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Alright, I'm basing it off the guitars, I am

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
But I like the Guitar Hero guitar much better than the Rock Band

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Yeah, definitely they're going to skew everything

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Because now they're going to consider, you know

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Each copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen that people redeem for free as a sale

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
You know, just stuff like that

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
It's, they do a lot to really skew their numbers

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And they're like, yeah, look how much Guitar Hero is selling compared to Rock Band

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
And you can't compare the two because one has way more releases than the other

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Because they refuse to embrace download content on a regular basis

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I mean, they do have download content on a regular basis

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
But nowhere near what Rock Band has

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Alright

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Well, moving on with other stories

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Completely out of the Music Game League

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Final Fantasy XIII finally had its release date revealed

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
There was actually like a little conference earlier this week

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Where they finally revealed some details about the game

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
But, you know, the biggest thing, because we weren't there

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
We didn't get to play the playable demo

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
December 17, 2009 is the release date for Final Fantasy XIII in Japan

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But, I will say this, don't forget the Playstation 3 is region free

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000
This game is not coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
That was not something they said as part of the announcement

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So it is only PS3 in Japan

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
And I bet you, you're going to have a lot of folks that import this

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Although, it's going to be very Japanese heavy still

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
That's the problem

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I don't think I will though

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I mean, I've done that in the past

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I've played Final Fantasy games in Japanese and never had a problem

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Well, look, I don't know Japanese like you guys do

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I don't know Japanese

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I would get nothing from this

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I print out a nice little fan translation of everything and that works

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That's why I played through Final Fantasy VIII when I originally imported that

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
It would be cool if they had English subtitles

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
But they don't want to dip into the US sales

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Naturally, it's not going to be there

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000
However, though, that doesn't happen until the international versions

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
That they have English subtitles

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
My copy of Final Fantasy X-2, my Japanese one

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Well, I have the international version

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
It has subtitles

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
No, but I haven't heard of any type of extras

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That we're going to get in Final Fantasy XIII here in the US

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
With the exception of the fact that we have a 360 version

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So do you think there will even be an international version this time?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Maybe

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Or maybe, I guess they could always do a remixed version

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
You know how Final Fantasy X, I don't think there were a whole lot of differences there either

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
But the international version had the different

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
What was the name of the board where you leveled?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
You filled in the spots on the board

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
That was how you leveled your characters, remember that?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
They have a different version of that board in the international version

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I wonder if they'll do things like that, I don't know

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
But I am certainly excited for Final Fantasy XIII

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
But not excited enough to import it because I don't know Japanese

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
And for me, the story is everything in Final Fantasy XIII

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Well, it's not everything, but it's like 90% of it

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
So I'm going to wait for the English one

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Which I'll be able to comprehend

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Atdeft points out in our chatroom at chat.orangewashowagerdoo.com

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The international version would probably be on the 360

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I don't think it will in Japan

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I mean, I see where your logic is going and that's a logical thought

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:24.000
But again, you have to remember the 360 has not penetrated the Japanese marketplace the way it has here

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Sony is still on top, well Nintendo is still on top in Japan if I'm not mistaking

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
But Sony has a clear second place

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And I think Microsoft has gained some ground

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
They're not a laughing stock in Japan at this point

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But they're even further back than where Sony is here

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I mean, at least Sony has been gaining a lot of ground here

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
In this generation

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
But I think in Japan it's a whole different story

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
And Game Guru says the 360 version is your extra

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Keep in mind 360s aren't region free

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
So if you live in Japan and for whatever reason have a 360

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
You're out of luck unless you can figure out a way to mod or whatever

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Also, I wanted to kind of point out one thing

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
This had me thinking about was Final Fantasy XIV

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
When do you think we're going to start seeing more Final Fantasy XIV?

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Do you think it's going to come out?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I don't know if the game itself will come out next year

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
But do you think we're going to see a lot more information start to spill out really quick?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
It seems to me like we're going to have our shortest window

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Between Final Fantasy games with this and XIV

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Being that we already know there's a playable alpha out there

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
That they demoed at a show

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I'm wondering if XIV is not going to show up at Tokyo Game Show as well

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It might, they may have a little bit there

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
But I don't know how finished they'll be

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.000
That's true, well maybe that same alpha that they had at the Gamescom in Germany

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I don't know

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
But I think it's very possible that we're going to at least see the beta

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Final Fantasy XIV by next year

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
One of my friends was trying to tell me it was going to be this year, the beta

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
I'm like dream on

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
There's no way that XIV is going to be out there before XIII is

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
That would just be weird

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
That's like dividing by zero

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
You can't do that in the Final Fantasy universe

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Of course there's a lot of people that think those online games

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Shouldn't be part of the regular numerology anyway

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I sometimes tend to agree with them

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Anyhow, let's keep moving on with some news, Darcyra

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Well there is a rumor going around that there's supposed to be

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Three different 250GB bundles of the PS3

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Coming out in the UK in October

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:36.000
There were FCC documents showing that there was supposed to be a PS3 Slim

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:45.000
And a retail source to a Eurogamer

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
That said that there was supposed to be three different bundles with different games

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
As in Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, Gran Turismo 5, and Assassin's Creed 2

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And they were supposed to sell for £299 which over here would be £494

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And there's of course no statement made to the rumor

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I don't know, are all these different bundles necessary?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I guess so, I guess bundles help drive sales

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
There's a ton of different PSP bundles here in the States

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000
There's the Hannah Montana OMG Girls one and the Rock Band one

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
No, I think that's seriously what it's called

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
OMG Girls Play 2 or something like that

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Kind of their way of getting girls to get Sony PSPs

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Because right now they all have DS's

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
That's funny

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
We'll probably see something over here too

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
As far as US bundles, I'm guessing

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
In time for the holidays, certainly

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Definitely

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
So to kind of go back to something we were talking a little bit about

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Or complaining about I guess in part A

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Was the PSP Go

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And one of the things that they were kind of showing off during E3

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Well actually not so much E3, but during Gamescom was the PSP Minis

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And they said that there is a possibility though

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
We will see collections of these Minis available on a single UMD

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
At a later stage later on

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Where maybe a publisher or whatever can put out a bunch of these little games

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I guess like you see right now on the Xbox 360 every now and then

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You'll see an Xbox Live game collection or something like that

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
They also said that there's a possibility that the Minis will jump to the PS3 as well

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
To be downloaded

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I could see that happening especially if they feel that

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
They're not making up enough sales with the PSP Go

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And I have a feeling that's going to be the problem

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
But at the same time

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And to kind of go back to what we were saying before

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
What exactly does the PSP Go have going for

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Other than it's more expensive and slightly smaller

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I mean nothing

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
It's new

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Oh goody

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So if Nintendo came out with the Wii Gold

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Or something like that

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
It's a gold colored Wii, but it's $500

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Does that mean I have to go buy it?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I mean that's stupid

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
But

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Oh well

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I mean to me

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Saying that they're going to re-release these on UMD later on

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Makes me feel that they're not really confident in the PSP Go

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And that they will need the supplement or sales by other means

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about putting these on the PS3 as well

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I mean it makes sense

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
But then again we kind of talk about this

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Oh you know they're going to do all this with the Minis

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
We don't really know what they're going to be yet

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
We haven't seen what the Minis are

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Right? Like I know that little picture you have there

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Looks like a little bejeweled thing

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Well they have like Tetris and stuff

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Do they already have some Minis out there?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Tetris is supposed to be one of the Minis

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I heard by the way that there was somebody

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I was trying to get them to tweet us about it

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Because I didn't have a story on it

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
But I heard about it

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
That there's like a new Tetris in development right now

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Not the Nintendo one, but like a new Tetris

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
There's one for the DS I think, maybe the Wii

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
No there's a different one even outside of that

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Yeah

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Is it now going to have like more blocks?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Tetris now with more blocks

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Tetromino is made out of five cubes instead

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
No I imagine it's more like probably more competitive in internet things

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
You know like I'm sure there's some people out there

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
They're like how many times can you do Tetris?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
But like look at Tetris DS

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
A million

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Yeah I mean but realistically yes you can

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Because look at Tetris DS

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
That was an awesome version of Tetris

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
You know one series they've managed to re-release several times

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And actually do a pretty good job with every time

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Is Tetris

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Like if you look at the original PC game

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Then you look at the NES Tetris

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Even Tengen Tetris versus Nintendo Tetris

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And then Game Boy Tetris with its whole link play was revolutionary

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And then Nintendo DS is awesome I mean

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Tetris is kind of actually one game that they've done right

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Many many times

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Not to say it's been perfect

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Because there was a Tetris on the Playstation

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
By Jellico I think it was

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Tetris Plus

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
That was awful

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
It was an awful awful game

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
So it's just kind of interesting

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Agreed

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
You know it's kind of interesting that you can take like

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
A game that's essentially the same and do it so many different ways

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And sometimes it's very very good like Tetris DS

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And sometimes it's very very sad like Tetris Playstation

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Anyhow

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Let me move on I didn't mean to get into a different topic

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
But I did

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
I want to talk about Silent Hill Homecoming

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Which you know was the fifth game in the series

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Even though it didn't carry the number 5 on it

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
And was somewhat razzed here in the states

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
As you know kind of because it was by an American developer and so forth

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Well the game was set to make its way to Japan

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But guess what

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
The website was updated this week

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
The Japanese Silent Hill Homecoming website was updated to say

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
The game has been cancelled

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Silent Hill Homecoming will not be out in Japan

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
No reason was given for the decision

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
It just said on the website simply quote

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Please look forward to future titles in the series

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Kind of interesting that

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
They

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
That this game was developed in the west

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Took some shit for that

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And now the Japanese aren't even going to release it at all

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But it's not too surprising considering the site hadn't had an update

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Until this

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Since November of 2008

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I don't know what do you guys think

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I don't think Silent Hill Homecoming was terrible by any means

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
But I can see where

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
It's different

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
And maybe

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I don't know I don't know it just seems weird to me

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
That they're not releasing it at all

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Like even under a different name or anything

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Given the reviews that it got here though

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
That's really not very surprising

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Because it doesn't I think

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000
The biggest complaint about it was that it didn't have the same kind of

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Scare factor that appealed to Japanese players

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
It wasn't the same type of a scary game

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I don't think the game was terrible it was different

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
But you know I also like Silent Hill 4

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I didn't say it was bad but I'm saying that it wasn't

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
What was up to snuff

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
For that series

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
It's just interesting that

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I wonder if that's because of sales figures here

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I wonder if that game just didn't sell well here

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I don't know Loki from your inside perspective

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I don't know if you would know this but

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
It didn't sell that well here

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
It didn't sell well in the beginning but that's it

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
It's not something that's constantly being reordered or anything

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
It's too bad

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Yeah

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Alright let's get into tonight's mailbag

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
A part of the show where you can interact with us

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
By sending us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Dark Sakura's gonna dive in head first into the mailbag

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And find some emails to read for us

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I am

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
You are, you is

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I is, okay

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Greetings Rob, Loki, Dark Sakura

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Here's the dilemma

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I'm a hardcore PC gamer and want a PS3

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
But can't justify bringing one

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Buying one because

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Any of the games I like for it I can buy for the PC

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
And play with better graphics, cheaper and less hassle

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
But I like the idea of having one

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
If only for Gran Turismo and Blu-ray

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
To get a system I would have to buy an HDTV

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Which is expensive

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And I don't know whether I should wait

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
For the 3D TVs

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
So many questions so little time

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Are there any good PS3 exclusives

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
That would justify me buying this system

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And should I wait for 3D TVs

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Also, how do I vote for your show

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Without going through iTunes, I hate Apple

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
The turtle

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Wait, just wait

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And you can get a Blu-ray player, you know, for your PC

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
So wait, they're getting cheaper

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
The one thing that

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I kind of have to say on this though

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Is that, you know, one thing to consider

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And has always kind of been a drawback

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Of PC gaming is that you have to constantly

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Build your PC

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And I realize there's PC gaming fans that are gonna

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Hate me for kind of calling that out a little bit

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Cause there's a lot of people that do spend the kind of money

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
To keep on tip top shape

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
But the nice thing about console games is that

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
The metrics are already established

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
On console games

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And that, you know, the game is always

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Going to play the way it was

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Meant to be played on a certain console

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Whereas on the PC sometimes you have to deal with

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Frame rate issues and so forth if your PC is not up to par

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
But it sounds like you are

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
An established PC gamer and you have a lot of games

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
On PC, you probably have a top of the line computer

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
You may have hit the nail on the head

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
If every game you want to play

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Is coming out on PC

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Then maybe you don't have a reason to get a

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
PS3, Dark Soccer makes a good point

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Get a Blu-ray player for your PC

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
They're coming down in price

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
But keep in mind too

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
The Playstation is a bit of an

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Entertainment hub, quote unquote

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Not just the Blu-rays, but you know

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Home and the download movies and so forth

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I don't know if it's really enough to justify a $300

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Expense, especially if you're saying you get all

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Of the rest of it on your computer

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
The only other thing I do want to

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Say though, Sony exclusives, keep that in mind

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
There are certain games that

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Will not come out on the PC, period

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Games like LittleBigPlanet, which are

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Pretty awesome, I gotta say

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Mag, the ModNation Racers

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
These games are not going to ever come out

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
On PC because they're made by Sony and they want you

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
To have a Playstation to play it on

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
So, if those games are

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Worth it to you, then you're going to have to take

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
The plunge, but if you know the types of

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Games you're getting are, you know, Batman Arkham

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Asylum, Call of Duty and the games

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
That do come out on PC, then

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
You might be right, you don't need a

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Playstation 3, so don't spend money on one

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Um

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I personally just love the

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Controls and sitting on my couch

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
And all that, you know, but that's

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I realize it's not for everybody, that's

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Why we have choices, as far as the other part of your question

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
About iTunes and you want to leave a review

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
That is not on an Apple place, that's fine

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
We always ask, look, just tell

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
A friend about the show, you don't even have to leave a review

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
I think there are other places

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
That take them, I don't know of any other big big site

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Like, I know of one called Podcast Alley

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
That has some reviews, like PodcastAlley.com

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
You can always use that, or Dig.com

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
If I could also say something really quick

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
About iTunes reviews, I've become really pissed

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Off at some of the things I've read on there, and I know I

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Shouldn't care, but I kind of do

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
That there's some one star reviews

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
First off, there's a troll on there, and I'm not gonna

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Say who they are, because I'm not gonna give them attention

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
But all I'm gonna say is, when I find out your

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
IP, I'm gonna ban you, so that you

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Can never download the show and listen to it again

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
It's not that I can't take criticism of the show

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
But this person is probably

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Jacking off right now to listen to me talk about

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Them on the air, like, this is why you would write

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
A negative review of a show over

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And over again, that says nothing constructive

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
About the show, so if this is you

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
I want you to know you're banned from this program

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
We do this for free, out of

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Our spare time, because, you know

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
We like to do it

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
You pay nothing for this, and for you to continue

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
To troll us like that is just ridiculous

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
You're banned, and if I ever find out

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Your IP, I will block you from the domain so you can no longer

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Continue to download the show

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
You better pray I never figure that out

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
So, just go get fucked with a chainsaw

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
If you write a negative

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Review, though, and say constructive

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Things, I'm fine with that

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
As long as you've shown that you've listened

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
To the program, because then I saw another

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Review that talked about how we were

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Box fanboys and fangirls

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
And I'm like, and that we were always too critical

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Of Sony, and I'm like, okay, we're critical of

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Everybody when we need to be

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Critical, and especially tonight

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
We've barely had any Microsoft

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
News, and maybe a little bit of Sony

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
News, so it's kind of unfortunate because

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
That person clearly based their review off one

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Episode of the show, I'm not mad

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
At that person, I just wish they would've tried

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
A little more before writing that, but I'm not gonna say

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Oh, I'm gonna ban you because you don't like the show, that's ridiculous

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
But if you're trolling, that's the difference

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That other guy needs to go get fucked

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
And I wish, more people need

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
To report that to Apple, too, that's what I did

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
So hopefully, because I just, I hate that you can't

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Review reviewers, you kind of

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Can, you can put, was this review helpful

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And I just click no all the time, but the problem

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Is when he rewrites a new review

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Complaining about something in the show this week

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
That, you know, didn't even happen

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Then it just

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Gets rewritten, so

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
There you go

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
And I'm looking at chat.orensonsrated.com

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
ActDef says

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Sky rant and FUs incoming, no not yet

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Not yet

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
SHA100Matt says the troll is a

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Former all games listener that one stars every

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Show, including Bobby's, that guy

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Needs to go get fucked, and like I said

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
He's probably jacking off right now because I'm talking

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
About him on the air and he got the attention he

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Looked for, so I'm going to stop talking about him

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
And just hope that a meteor

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Falls on his head

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Next email, please

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Okay

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Um

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Next email, um

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Okay

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I guess this was sent out to multiple people

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
But I'm going to use the part that's addressed

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
To us, um

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I know what you're thinking, dslover the person who

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Despises 360 wants

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
One, I can't read this

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Why is the grammar

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Okay

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Almost no

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I'll go read it if you need somebody

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
No Rob, it's not just that

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
They hardly use any punctuation

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So it's hard for me to get phrasing on this

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Just go slow

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Um

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Gosh

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Okay, well if you were wondering

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Why here's the things

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
That pushed me over the edge

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
During my boy scout, oh that's it, you're a boy scout

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
You know, funded by the Mormons

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
During a boy scout troops holiday

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Party where we stay up all night

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Playing games, I saw one of my

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Friends playing Guitar Hero 2

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And we played over 13 songs, then we played

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Thunder Horse, okay you use a hyphen

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
In a song that doesn't even have a hyphen

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
In the name, okay

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Then at the end of the song, I saw an achievement unlocked

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And then I saw another one of my friends

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Playing Burnout Revenge after he left

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
His 360 in my hands, I plugged in my

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
MP3 player to the 360 and started using

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
My own music like Dragon Force and Anthrax

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
While doing takedowns

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And crash events made my eyes open

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
And especially when I started playing with my friend

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Communication, flawless, comma

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Finally, compared to the PS

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Doesn't even

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Need a comma, okay

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Compared to the PS3, it can suck my balls

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Sony, I ain't buying your stupid PS3, period

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I need some recommendations

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
On games and accessories to buy with my system

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And I'm needing one on

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Should I buy it used or new

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I've been waiting for a price drop on 360

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Comma, doesn't need to be there

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I'm wondering which, WITCH

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
By the way, configuration I should start off with

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Sincerely, dslover, PS

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Keep the shows rocking

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
It wasn't even addressed to the right

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
People, was it?

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
We were in there

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I don't know what type of games

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
This guy likes, it's so hard

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
To recommend games when I don't

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Her inner grammar Nazi

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Is crying

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
I don't know what type of games to recommend

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
When, put the Dalek away

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I don't know what type of games to recommend

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
When I don't know what type of games you like

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Did he say what type of games he likes to play

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Guitar Hero 2, I don't know

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Get Rock Band Beatles, Guitar Hero 3

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I mean Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 5

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
What game has takedowns in it

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Oh, Burnout

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Burnout Paradise

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Ok, Burnout Paradise and Split Seconds

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Gonna be very cool, and that comes out

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Need for Speed, Fuel

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I liked Fuel even though a lot of people gave it

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Kinda mediocre reviews

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Yeah, I don't know

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
See, when you say what PlayStation 3 game should I get

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Oh, LittleBigPlanet, I think that game's amazing

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And I think everybody should

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
This person asked about Xbox 360

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I thought they said PS3

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
That was the previous one

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Oh, they want Xbox 360 games they should have?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
No, they want, they're thinking about getting an Xbox 360

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I thought they said PS3 at the end

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I wanna know, I wanna know which

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Version of the Xbox 360 to get

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
It was the last one

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That asked about what PS3 games

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Were exclusive and what to buy

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
You need to find

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
One that matches what needs

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Do you have an HDTV

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
That can benefit from HDMI

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Do you have, you know

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I don't think you need all the frills

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
But I think you do need a hard drive

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
So I wouldn't get the one that doesn't come with a hard drive

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I think that you need to stop thinking about an Xbox 360

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
You need to sell your DS

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
And you need to freakin' hire a tutor

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Wow

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
If you would like Dark Soccer to criticize your emails

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Please send us an email

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Okay, last one's from Deathwishing

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Um, well

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Thanks to this game, oh let's talk about Beatles

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Rock Band by the way

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Well thanks to this game, I like the Beatles

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Sure, I liked a few songs before, but now I like them all

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It doesn't even have all of them in there though

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
You need to go download some

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Or pay for the new albums

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Yes, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
It's also very cool to learn about

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
The, about the fan with

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Photos and pictures

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you saw the Jelly Babies photo

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Slayers

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
My favorite song by them is Here Comes the Sun

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
And you know what, I think that's the part

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
That makes harmonics and the

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Surviving Beatles and relatives of

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
The deceased ones very happy

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Is that it's like a whole new generation

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Discovering the Beatles, and I think what they

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Would say to your email is, mission accomplished

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I think that's a very good thing

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
So, um

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Congrats to you discovering your love for

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Beatles music

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I don't, I always kind of

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I respect the Beatles

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I don't like, love them or

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Foam of the Mouth about them

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Or even really buy a lot of their albums, but I respect

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Them, I really understand what they did for music

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And why they were so popular

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
But I'm thinking that maybe playing this game

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Will kind of open up the catalog, but

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I also like the movie Across the Universe

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Somewhat, I actually

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I love that movie

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I didn't like the movie, but I like the parts of the movie

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
It had nice parts

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I do, that's a perfect

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Comparison, it has nice parts, but the whole

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
It adds up to is WTF

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Well, that, therefore the Xanady rating

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I actually love the whole movie

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Um, I was gonna

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Say something else too, yeah, if you had to say

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
You had a favorite song by them, Rob, what would it be?

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Probably Across the Universe

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
But I also know

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Covers of that song that kind of, you know

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Skew me a little bit like that

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Don't say Fiona Apple

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I do like the Fiona Apple cover, but I also like

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Oh, he has one too

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I also really like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
William Shatner version? No

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
And I like Strawberry Fields Forever

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
And I've been to Strawberry Fields

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
And it's beautiful, in New York City where the

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Imagine Memorial is, so I think

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I think Strawberry Fields Forever

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
And it does make me think of that scene in Across the Universe

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Which I think is one of the better scenes in the movie

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
That seriously is my favorite scene in the movie

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I would say that's definitely one of my top songs

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I met the guy that was

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
In the movie, oh really?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
How random, I know, there you go

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Well, do you have a favorite song?

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
In what, in Across the Universe? No, Beatles, Beatles song in general

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
No

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Strawberry Fields isn't in the rock band, is it?

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Uh, no

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
It should be

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Um, I did want to say though

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Um, one of my

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Probably my favorite favorite song of

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
The Beatles as a

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Not just the band itself, but all the members

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Was Imagine by John Lennon

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
I mean, that is a

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Song that will live on forever

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
And it rightfully should

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I mean, I think

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
That song, to me, even transcends

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Anything the Beatles ever did

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
But that's just, that's my opinion

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
So, alright, anyhow

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Um, moving on

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Why isn't my Sim dying, by the way?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Was that it for the mailbag? Yeah, I'm trying to kill the Sim too

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Alright, cause he's a dick

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Let's get into the FUs of the week

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I don't have a story to inspire the FUs of the week

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
But certainly Darksiders, but her Sim is a dick

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yeah, that's right, her Sim is a dick

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
So the FUs of the week go to that Sim

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Ooh, DarkTetsuya in chat says

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Less Sims, more show, please

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Um, I can do both at the same time

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
And you are totally not one to talk, okay?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Addict! That's right, I can text message

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
At five at the same time, so she can play Sims

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Rob

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
You saw the video, didn't you? Yes, I saw the video

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
That was fantastic!

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
It was stupid! It was great!

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
It was the most over-the-top thing I've ever seen

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I know, but it was gorgeous

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
And I've been to the Rocky Horror Picture

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Show 300 times, and that text messaging

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Crash video was the most over-the-top thing

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Yay, my Sim is drowning! Alright, shut up

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Why'd you build a wall around the pool?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
So that he couldn't get out?

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
You're killing your dick, Sim

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
And the Sims 3 have learned

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
That they can pull themselves out of the pool

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Without the ladder? Yeah

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Damn it! They're always getting smarter

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
She built walls around the pool

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
As you should

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Well, you can't put a fence around him

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
But what I could do is the moving

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
The move objects on, and then I put

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
The little sign, neighborhood sign

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Can you douse him with gasoline? No

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Alright, can we get to the FUs of the week?

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I guess

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Um

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Um

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
FU to, um

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Going back to work

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Bogey!

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Um

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Huh, I had something

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
And I don't remember what it was

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I guess FU to

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Having a bunch of new locks for my arcade cabinet

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But not any of the keys

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
That's it

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I think, um, I've actually been in somewhat

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Good mood, so, um, I don't know

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
FU to the fact that I'm not

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Already at Disneyland, because that's where I'm going to be in a few days

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I'm so

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Freaking excited I need to be there

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
So, oh, did Death show up to get your little

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Yep

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And Death can't get to the person?

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Oh yeah, Death can't do anything

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Alright, anyhow

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
See how Sims is derailing the show?

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Now you need to drown Death in a pool too

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Because that'd be ironic

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Back to games, Loki

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Yes, I am not going to be talking

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
About The Sims

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
However, I am going to be talking about Fallout

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
And apparently Bethesda is suing

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Interplay over the

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Fallout MMO

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Um

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I guess, uh, you know

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
They wanted to make a Fallout MMO

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I guess called Project

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
V13

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
And, um

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
You know, the problem is, though, that

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I believe Bethesda has the rights

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
To Fallout right now

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And, um, Interplay infringed on

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Its trademark

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
So, um

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Interesting

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I'm surprised, though, if we did see a

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Fallout MMO, that it wouldn't be coming from Bethesda

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I would think that that would be kind of right up

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Their alley

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I think Bethesda's

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Gotta be working on some MMO

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Right now, but it's probably in the Elder Scrolls

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Universe, not Fallout

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
But, who knows? Anything's possible

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Both those games are huge. How about combining

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Them?

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Nuclear Holocaust in, like, the medieval

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Times? A nuclear holocaust hits

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
The world of, what's the name of the world that

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
The Elder Scrolls is set in?

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I can't remember. But that's what we need

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
We need a crossover game of the two

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
And it's an MMO. There you go

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Or that they

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Turn nomadic and they're back

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Now to, like, you know, medieval

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Technology

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
You know I still haven't played Fallout 3

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Like, I'm like

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
It's Oblivion with guns. I don't know how I wouldn't like

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
This game, but I just somehow haven't played it

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I'm too addicted to Warcraft

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
I have Fallout 3 and I have still not played it

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I also have Left 4 Dead and still have not played it

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Can I borrow your Fallout 3 if you're not gonna play it?

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
See, Fallout 3 is pretty cool

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Is it?

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Becky's Husband was playing

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Quite a bit of it and it just looks

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Really cool. I liked it

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
No, I've never heard anything but good things about it

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
And even when I've watched it, it looks like a lot of fun

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Remember guys, I don't have time to play

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Every game, especially when you're addicted to an MMO

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Actually, no, I take that back

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I think I did sell it already

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Cause I don't have a lot of

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Games anymore

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Wow, you unloaded all your games? Why?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Different reasons

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Alright, well

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Do you think Bethesda has any ground to stand on with this?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I mean, do you think they'll win, Loki?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Yeah, if they have the rights for it right now

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
I mean, I know Interplay I think was the one that actually

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Came out with the original Fallout, but

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Um

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I don't know, they're saying that

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
This has caused

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Immediate, substantial

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Inrepairable harm, I guess

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I don't know

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
It probably wasn't going to end up working out for them anyways

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Okay, well

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I want to move on to one more story

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Before we get to your phone calls tonight

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
And it has to do with the Nintendo Wii

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Apparently, Nintendo

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Is going to price

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
The Wii

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Rumor is that the Wii is going to get its price drop

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
The first week of October

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Which makes sense, cause the machine still costs $250

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
And you know, isn't the Xbox 360

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Now $199?

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Yep

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
And it has been for a while, so

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I think the Wii is probably going to have to move

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
To a price drop

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Their sales have been kind of slowing down

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Well, plus it's time to update with the pack too

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
You know, I think it's inevitable

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
They're going to put Wii Motion Plus in it

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
And Wii Sports Relevance

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I think is what you're going to find

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
In the new pack

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
No?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
No, it's going to stay the same

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Really?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I think it is

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
You don't think they'll bundle in an extra game?

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
No, because you can't get Wii Sports by itself

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
What about a Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort bundle?

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
What about it comes with Wii Sports

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
No, because that would impact their sales of Wii Sports Resort

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Really?

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Yeah

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Well, we'll see

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
This is from an early version of a Walmart ad

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
But apparently it is coming soon

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I don't see the exact price though

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
It's just apparently the ad says

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That it's coming

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
So we don't know exactly what the new price is

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
But

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Now, Nintendo doesn't

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Do Tokyo Game Show

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
But they will be participating in a thing called

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Kyoto Cross Media Experience 2009

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
But that's at the end of September

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
September 26th to October 4th

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
So if they're going to announce a price drop

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
That's when it's kind of expected

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
To happen, because Nintendo never does

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Tokyo Game Show

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
I don't remember the reason behind it

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
They kind of do their own media thing in Japan

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Got it

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
So, very interesting

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
It is

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I wonder if there will be a fitness thing

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Like maybe the original Wii Fit

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Or something, I don't know

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Because then you'd have to throw in the Wii Fit

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Balance board

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I can see maybe some holiday bundles

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
If they're going to do anything

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
What they're going to do is some crappy

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Holiday bundle later on

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
That it's going to have new Super Mario Brothers

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Wii bundled in it, and maybe that's it

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
But, you know

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
At the same time, they may think that their

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Game system stands alone

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
That it's just super awesome

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
That they're going to drop the price a little bit

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Just to kind of spark some more sales

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
But, I don't know

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I mean, we'll see

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Yeah, I mean there's really nothing on the Wii

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I'm really looking forward to

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Even the new Super Mario Brothers, I'm very meh about

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I kind of wish

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I was just thinking the other day

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Even though I understand they have the new

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Super Mario Brothers and so forth

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I wish they would just release a game called

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Super Mario Brothers 4

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And make it very similar to like Mario 3

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
But with the whole like

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
New graphics and the types of things

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
That you can do on the Wii

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
That's not 3D

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Would that be Super Mario World?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Well, I would like to just see them make a game

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Called Super Mario Brothers 4

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
That kind of does away with

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
You know, a lot of the changes to the Mario Universe

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
That might be too difficult for Grandma

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Maybe

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Maybe I just live in this weird fanboy bubble

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Or I just miss the old school days

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Of Nintendo, but

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
It'd be kind of cool

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Alright, I guess it's time

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
For us to open up the Skype line

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
We're ready to take some calls

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like to

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Give a comment on any topic that you've heard about tonight

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
And we'll take some calls

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
To see what's on your mind

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I'll ask if there's any last minute stories

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Here in the studio because we have a delay

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Oh, no, we just, we're getting our first call

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Well, I'm the first caller, hey, this is X-Link

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Well, hello X-Link, congratulations, you've

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Beaten some of our serial phone callers

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
That seem to get through every week

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
It's been a little while since we've heard from you, what's on your mind?

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Yes, actually I played

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
A really cool demo on the Playstation Store this weekend

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
It was called the Half Minute Hero

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Which was really interesting

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
It had a Final Fantasy 1

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Dragon War 1

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Type, you know, NES

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Roleplaying type feel to it

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
But they give you 30 seconds

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
From the time you start

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
To get to the boss

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
To beat the boss

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
But in order to do this

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
You like, really, it plays like

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Basically you're playing the game in fast forward

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I've heard about this, isn't this the one, doesn't it switch

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Genres too, like every 30 seconds?

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I remember, there's a demo for that

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Out now? Yes

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Is that on PSP? It's coming soon

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Yeah, it's coming

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
It's coming on, it's supposedly October 20th

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Is the release date for it

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Is that on PSP or PS3?

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
PSP

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Oh, I want to check that out, that game, I remember

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
When we reported on that game and I was like, oh, it's kind of like

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
WarioWare, but like

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
It sounds even cooler than, what was the

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
WarioWare clone we got on PSP, WTF, right?

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
WTF was kind of funny

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
This sounds even cooler, like

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I definitely want to check this out, so

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Did it feel like WarioWare to you, XLink?

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Was it? Kind of, yeah, but it had

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
More of a, when I played it, it had

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
More of the Roleplaying type feel, so it's

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
More like playing Final Fantasy 1

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
On fast forward, like I said before, so it was

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Really good though

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Cool

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
How far did the demo let you go? I mean, it sounds like

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
With games like that, I wouldn't think you could do much of a demo

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Because, well, you start on

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
This small island, and they're like, okay, you're

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Here, the boss is here, go

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
And then they give you the 30 seconds, we'll count

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Down, and then

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
There's like one or two islands you can choose, the first one

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Does that one, and the second one's more complicated

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Where it's like, here's the

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Town, here's where the

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Boss is, here's where it doesn't, where you can get more gold

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
For, you know, items and stuff

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
But in the town, it has a statue

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Where we'll reset the timer

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
The 30 seconds, depending on how much

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Gold per time you do it

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
So the demo

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Was cool enough for you to go pre-order the game?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Oh, definitely, I would definitely

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Pre-order it

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
It had like

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Other elements I saw from the

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Trailer, which really piqued my interest

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Like shootings and stuff like that

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
And summons

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
A successful demo, thank you for calling me

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
To tell me about it, because I'm gonna go

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Put that in my queue to download my PSP

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
No, no problem

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I got to get my PS3 and PSP to work together

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
And I got a better memory card for my PSP

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I'm all about checking out all the latest

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Demos and so forth, because I know I've been critical

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Of the PSP as a gaming device

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
But there are some gems out there, there's some real

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Gems out there, definitely, and I'm looking forward to

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Two percent, which comes out in about two weeks

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I already had that pre-ordered and paid for

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Awesome, well anything

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Else on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Nah, not really, I've been too busy

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Doing my live journal game, so I've been

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Really trying to catch up back on the

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
News here during the weekend, so

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Of course I'll send it to you guys and give you guys five stars

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I know what you're talking about, and I hope it's

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Fun for you, in fact I'm going to be talking about

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Live journal games on this show in a couple weeks

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Because I'm going to be hosting another one, and I want people to

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Sign up and play

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Real quickly, it was very unique

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
The way some of you guys approached me and told me

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Oh hey, if you like doing this kind of stuff

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
You might like doing this, so I signed up for it

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
It was very unique and very fun

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
And I got to meet a lot of

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
New people through it, and if

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Everybody has to do it or wants to do it

02:25:35.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I'll give you more details in a couple weeks here on Orange Lawns Radio

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
He kind of already had it lined out

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
He spoke very well, obviously tested

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
This connection before, and you know

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Just kind of laid it all out there

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
When I asked him if there was anything else, he kind of

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Added a little more, and I just

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Very good, everybody take notes

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
From that last call, so sorry about that

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Rama, now you have to follow that

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
I'm not trying to say we get bad calls

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I'm just saying that if you want to know what I think

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
A perfect phone call is, that last call was great

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
So now you have to follow it Rama

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
What's on your mind tonight?

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Well, I will do my best, but first off

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Me and Jodea, we went to a

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Classic gaming convention yesterday

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Called Gamecore

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
First of them post

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
A link in the chat

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Makes for great radio, doesn't it?

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Yes, exactly, that's okay, I'll forgive you

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Thank you, the pictures are on

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Small and large size, because it was

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
A lot of stuff

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I can call this convention like

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Jamie's vault

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Game six, that's how much

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Stuff was there, you had a lot of

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Classic arcade machines there

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
That were for sale, such as the

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Simpsons arcade machine for like 400 bucks

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Oh my god, I would have went home with that

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Seriously? Even though I'm supposed to be

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Saving for a new car right now, I would have went home with that

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Dude, it was cash and carry

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Do they really?

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Oh my god, I should get an arcade machine

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
For my house, you should

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Wouldn't my roommate fucking love that?

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Sorry, by the way

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Rob, I met your picture gallery, there's a lot of broken pictures

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
You might want to check that out

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I don't know if it's me or...

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
It's an issue with the gallery sulfur, but if you click on the broken

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Link, the picture will actually show up

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Okay, I probably shouldn't look at them all

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
During the show, but I am looking at some of these things

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Yeah, I see some things that are reminiscent

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Of classic gaming expos, certainly, did they have a lot

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Of playable stuff out there?

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Pretty much they did, a lot of

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Arcade machines, they had a

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Roll of Dreamcast set up to celebrate

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
The tenth anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
There was an actual Neo Geo

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
MVS machine set up, not the whole

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Arcade unit, but the actual console

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
And board, you know?

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I have an MVS board now

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Sweet

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Dude, what is up with everybody getting fucking Neo Geo

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
MVS boards? You, Bobby

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
No, okay, here's the thing

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
They threw it in with my cabinet

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Because I was testing

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
To test my cabinet, they plugged an MVS board

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
In there, and they're like, okay

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
And he's all, hey, you want this board for

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
You know, 60 bucks, and I'll throw in this bootleg

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
48-in-1 cart with him, like

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
What?

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
What? I am so uncool

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
I have to get one

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I have to fit in with

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Everybody else, I'm gonna have to get a fucking Neo Geo

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Now, just so I can feel cool

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Sorry, Rama, I didn't mean to derail your call

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
See, this is an example of where the hosts

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Derail your call

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Which happens, what town was this

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Convention in again?

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Oaks, Pennsylvania, it was about

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
20 minutes outside of Philly

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
I wonder

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Was it at, like, an actual classic gaming store

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Or is there one, like, right nearby?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
No, it was an actual

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Convention center

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Oddly enough, a lot of the people that are selling

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Old school games and accessories

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Were right out of Jersey

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Because there was a classic gaming store in Pennsylvania

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I was gonna visit when I was out there

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Because, you know, I spent several weeks in Allentown for work

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
And I just never got out to the store I was gonna go to

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
I don't even know if it's still in business, it was a few years ago

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I'm sorry

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Did they do panels or anything else at this con

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Or was it just mostly, like, a sales floor

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
That you could test the merchandise

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
There were panels there

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
But I didn't get a chance to check them out

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
But what they were mostly also focusing on was

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Nerdcore rappers

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
And Chiptunes music

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Nice

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
The list of people that were there

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Performing was MC Lars, YT Cracker

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Super 8-Bit Brothers

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Armadillo Tank

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
This is cool

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Yes, yes

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Did you go to the concerts at all?

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I went to a couple of the concerts

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I walked in on Super 8-Bit Brothers

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And since I was dressed as Luigi

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I got a lot of props and shout-outs

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Very nice

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
There was actually a couple of classic cars there

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Such as the DeLorean and Kit

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Huh

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Well, sounds like you had a lot of fun at the convention

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Is this something that travels

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Or was it just the one place

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I was talking to some of the people

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
That helped create it

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And they were seeing some ups and downs

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
They had with it

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
So they're looking to do things a little bit differently

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
For next year

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
And also I have a bit of a game review too

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Oh, please

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Yes

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
There was a company there called Storm City Games

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Independent publishing group

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
They had a game there

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
They were demoing out called Hands-On Tangrams

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Like the Tangrams

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Like we used to play with in junior high school

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
That game came out a long time ago

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Interesting

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Alright, well how was it

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Did you get your Tangram on

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Yes I did

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
And for 20 bucks I think it was well worth it

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
This is like a perfect time waster

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
If you need to kill 10-20 minutes while you're waiting for something

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I came out back in spring

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Okay, Debbie Downer

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Hands-On Tangrams

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
They said they had the demo

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
And this is actually coming out October

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Maybe it's a new platform or a new version

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Maybe that's what's going on

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Probably so

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Alright, well Rama we're going to let you go get some more calls

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
But I'm glad you had fun at the convention

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Sure, sure, sure

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Can we talk to Jamie for one quick second please

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
I suppose

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Hello

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Hello

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Hi

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
While we were there they were actually

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Doing viewings for

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Nerdcore Rising

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Which is the film by

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
MC Frontalot

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
And they were actually giving a couple of them out

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
I

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Had asked Rama to go up there

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
And see if he could win one

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And he did

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
So we're going to be giving it to you Jamie

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
What

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Yes

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
It's a copy of Nerdcore Rising

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And if you open it up on the DVD itself

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
It is signed by

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
MC Frontalot

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
And it says

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Win win win on there, we don't know exactly

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Who wrote that on the DVD

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
But we think it was Lars

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Sweet, we're not exactly sure

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
But yeah, just wanted to let you know that

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
And who is this on the phone right now

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
This would be Giove Day, Patty

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Hello, well welcome to the show, I don't think you've ever

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Called in before, but what a great first

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Call, we like when new

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
People on the show give stuff away

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I don't remember her talk, I know she's been in

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Chat and Twitter and all that

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
We've heard her

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
With Rama before

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Well that's awesome

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
And then you have to deliver it to me in person

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I will attempt that

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I swear to God

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I will try and attempt that one

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
If not, I am actually

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Looking to get to New York, possibly as soon as

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
The end of the year, so I may just have to come pick it up

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
That would work too

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
On behalf of Dark Soccer

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And then I can forget to give it to her

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I'm just

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Just kidding, no that sounds really awesome

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
That's so awesome

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Of some of our listeners to do

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Thank you guys

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
And how did you like the con, Giove Day

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
How did you like it

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I liked it a lot, it was

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
I'm not really big into loud

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Crazy conventions, it was nice, it was mellow

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
But there was enough stuff there to do

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
That you didn't feel that you were bored

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Alright

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Very cool, and any favorite classic game

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
That you discovered or something that you played

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
No, I was actually

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
In the booth most of the time

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Chatting with the guy next to us

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Who was selling all the D&D

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Stuff and he sold me

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
D&D dice for two bucks

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
That made me happy

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Hey, nerds need their dice

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Yes, we do

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Well, we're gonna let you go so we can roll the dice

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
On another phone call, but thank you so much you guys

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
That sounds like an awesome present and you guys didn't have to

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Do that, so I know Dark Soccer

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Is bouncing as she's playing The Sims

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Hey, I'm bouncing in like

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Most of my parts, they're quivering with joy

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Alright

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Before this gets dirty, I'm gonna have to let you go

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Night guys

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Alright, take care

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
We've had some good phone calls tonight

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Any call that gives Dark Soccer like something

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Free is always gonna be a good call

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
That makes my liver quiver

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
There's just no way that that's gonna be a bad call

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch, wait, did I answer this one?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
There we go, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
This is Cheeseburger

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Hi, Cheeseburger, have you been on the show before?

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I don't think you've ever called

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
No, I haven't, I've been in chat

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
You've got a deeper voice than I imagined

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
I've heard your name before

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Like reading the Twitters and the chat and all that

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
And I just want to point out

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
The icon on Skype is

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
A picture of a cheeseburger

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Why do you go by cheeseburger?

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I know why I guess by cheeseburger, because I read his emails

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Are you just a big fan of cheeseburgers?

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
No, it's extremely similar to my last name

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Oh

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
See, I know

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Okay, I get it

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
If you go on the wiki, I put it on there

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Alright, cheeseburger, I'll stop interrogating you

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Because you called us, what's on your mind tonight?

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I know you played WoW for a while

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
And I just want to know why you got back into it

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I didn't know you got back into it

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.000
I'm trying to think how far I want to get into this on a public radio show

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
The reason why I had to stop playing WoW

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Was I found myself kind of getting too involved

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
With some of the stuff that was going on in the guild

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And unfortunately

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000
As seems to always happen in various guilds in WoW

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
There was some very unfortunate guild drama

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Where people went their separate ways

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
And it really kind of turned me off to the game

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Because part of me

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Actually, all of me felt it was very unnecessary

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000
And that I think if people across the board

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Had been a little more reasonable

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And open minded and hadn't reacted

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And I think some very selfish things were done by certain people

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And god, I hope I'm going to get in deep hot water

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
For getting into this on my radio show

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
But unfortunately, that's just kind of how I view things

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
And I just thought

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
You know, I am taking this too much

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
For something that's an online game

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I need to just step away and involve real life for a while

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
And you know, at the same time

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I was starting to date somebody new

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
And kind of get into a relationship

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:20.000
And you know, anything that happens in real life

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Is more important than WoW

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
WoW is what you go to when you're bored

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
So the reason why I got back in

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Well, I found a new group of people to play with

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
That have different goals in the game

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
That aren't so focused on the end game rating

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
And so forth

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
And just kind of rediscovering what makes WoW fun

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000
And also I dumped the guy I was seeing

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.000
So I have a little more spare time now

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.000
It's kind of like what I told one of my friends

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
When she criticized me, she's like

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I can't believe you went back to Warcraft

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I said, this is what depressed people do

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I wouldn't really say I'm depressed

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
It's just, you know, it's a time waster

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
But like I said, I think real life

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
If there's stuff going on in real life

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
It will always be better than WoW

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
And this is kind of what I tell people

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I don't watch a lot of TV

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
There's some things I watch

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
But I don't watch as much as probably most people do

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I'm playing while I'm not playing as many console games

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
It's just my entertainment of choice

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
But, you know, finding a balance is important

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
What realm do you play on?

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Right now I am playing Alliance on Blade's Edge

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Is the server I'm playing on

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Is it alright if I join your guild?

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Possibly, send me an email after the show

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
It's not my guild

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
That's the difference this time

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Actually, I wasn't in charge of the guild before

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
But I knew the people in charge more

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Than I know the ones here

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
As long as you're not a dick

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Which you don't sound like from your phone call

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I don't see why not

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Cool!

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Alright, well you take care of yourself

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Thanks for the call, okay?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Alright, you too. See ya. Take care

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
See, I was gonna say at the end of that phone call

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
For the Horde! But then I was like, oh shit, I'm Alliance now

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I can't say that. I'm playing one of each

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
You're playing what? One of each

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
One of each? You're on a different server, right?

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I am, but I'll play on another

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I think I'm actually gonna pay for it

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
But I'm playing

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
A blood elf

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
And I'm playing a goat girl

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Alright, fair enough

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
You know what I mean by a goat girl

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yes, Draenai

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Draeno!

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
And those were all excellent calls tonight, so thank you very much

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I think we'll leave it at that

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
I do still see calls coming in

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
But no offense, all those guys that are calling in

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Have been on the show before

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
So we're gonna leave this as a

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
New caller, well even though Rama's not a new caller

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
So

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Two out of three at best

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Plus about three phone calls

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Tonight's good, so

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
If you didn't get through tonight though

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Twitter topics next week, we didn't get a lot tonight

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
And don't forget you can always interact with the chat room

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Mailbag! Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Always plenty of ways to interact with the program

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
So let's get into some

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Last minute stories, I never

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Allowed Loki the chance

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
I'm not gonna steal one more cookie, because they're delicious

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
That's fine, they're there for stealing

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And we can throw away all the

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Bacon stuff, except for my plate

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
I need that plate

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Well, why don't we feed all the bacon stuff to Dan?

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Well, if he wants it

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
What the hell is this crap

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Anyways, Sonic is

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Possibly gonna come back in the way that it

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Should've been coming back in the first place

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
None of these 3D

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Crapfests with were

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Hedgehogs and that kind of stuff

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
No, we're actually gonna get a brand

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
New 2D HD

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Sonic the Hedgehog game

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
It's gonna be as old school fun

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
As it can get

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
And it's in the early planning stages right now

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
But they do have a wonderful teaser for

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
What they're calling as Project Needlemouse

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
The working title for the game

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
So that's kinda neat

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
King of Fighters

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
You may remember that they had a

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Japanese

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Shoot-em-up version of King of Fighters

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Called Sky Stage

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
To Xbox Live Arcade

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Well now it's also making its way

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
To arcades as well

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I don't know man

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
I've seen screenshots and video of this

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
It just looks weird

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I don't think King of Fighters really translates itself

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Well into

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
It's one of those things I wanna see just once though

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Just like for the WTF value

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Yeah

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
By the way, the Sonic 2D thing

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I'm a little nervous about that

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
And I'm with everybody else in the camp

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Of OMG Awesome

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Sonic 2D

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Hopefully it's kinda influenced by Mega Man 9

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Just to go back to your damn roots

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
But I am a little worried because

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
This is like the third time Sonic has been

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Reinvented

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And the last few have not been that great

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
So I really hope this one's good

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
I'm hopeful

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
But I'm a little apprehensive and I think I have the right to be

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
As do all the rest of you

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Yeah

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
And then

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Also to kinda go along with

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Some stuff we were talking about before

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
You may remember that porn has been

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Kind of

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Making its way to the Playstation 3

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Playstation Network

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
In Japan

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Well now apparently Vivid Entertainment

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Is hoping to do the same thing in the US

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
They're making a stand

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Trying to convince

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Sony that their porn

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Should be on

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
The Playstation Network

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Bravo I say

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
So that'll be kind of interesting

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
And

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Apparently

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
You know to kinda go back to some of the

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Piracy stuff we were talking about

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
We may have talked about this in the past

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
But yes

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
They have finally released the sequel

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
The official sequel to

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Don't Copy That Fluffy

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Don't Copy That 2

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
And let me tell you this much

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
And then promptly copied a floppy

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
And it's horrible

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
If I still had a floppy I would copy it

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
And my favorite

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Thing about this is they're talking about how

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Oh copying is a crime and stuff

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And yeah piracy is a crime

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Whatever but the guy that they show

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
At the very end there's like a real pirate

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I guess who

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
He was selling copies of stuff

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Okay I think that's something

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
That's gonna probably land you in jail more than

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Pirating games for your own use

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Can I get into this a little bit

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Because I haven't seen the video

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
I've purposely not watched the video because I

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Thought maybe I would watch it here on the show

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
So how long is it? Is it long?

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
No it shouldn't be that long

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
About five minutes

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Well it's got a funny song

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
He raps in it

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
And we can laugh at it

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I don't know legally how much of it we can play here on the show

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
It's a YouTube clip

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
I think they want it

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Freely distributed everywhere

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Even if we're critical of it?

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Even if we're critical of it

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
So are we gonna copy the

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
The thing

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Read that in a minute DarkSocker I know what you're looking at

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
It's related

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Where is it here who linked it in chat here

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
It's this right

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Okay hold on I'm bringing it up in studio sorry

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Okay here it is

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Don't copy that floppy 2

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Welcome back to 90's Time Trip

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
It's that anti-piracy classic

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Don't copy that floppy

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Can I just skip ahead here

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
I don't wanna watch this whole damn thing

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
I just wanna see what the song sounds like

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
And I wanna see that bit at the end

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
He looks kinda like Max Headroom but black

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Like is it just me?

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
But that's kinda what it looks like

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Sorta

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Don't copy it

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Oh he does

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
See?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
I don't know it's not

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
As funny as the other one was

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
I think the old 90's

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Value of the first one is what made it so

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Funny and catchy but this one

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Is like

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Technically enough is a copy of a copy

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
And you know how copies of copies

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Like lose quality over time

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
That's what I feel this is

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Like a unnecessary

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Sequel okay I wanna see the bit

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Woah what happened the thing stopped

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Don't do that

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Don't stoppie my floppy alright

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Let me see the bit at the end

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
It's about the last minute is where the pirate shows up

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Um yeah even

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I wanna see

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I wanna see the little like

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Message to kids

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Would I be immature for making fun of his voice?

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Because

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I wondered if that was a woman

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I don't mean to sound rude

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
And or petty and I should really

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Not be the first to talk but

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Like

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
He doesn't sound like he's ever gone through puberty

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Maybe that's

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Is that a disease?

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
See what happens when you copy

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Does piracy

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Does selling pirated

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Does selling pirated games cause

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Your balls to go back into your body

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Or something like

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
I think being in prison causes your balls to go back

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Into your body

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I had to look at his neck

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I guess it's okay for me to make fun of him because he is a felon

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
I had to look at his neck

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
To see if there was an Adam's apple?

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Oh he's got too much facial hair

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Even if that was drugs

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
A woman can grow that much facial hair

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
With hormonal therapy yes really

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
I wanna see the rest

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Can I see the rest of this uplifting message here

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Oh he's

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Sad face

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
It was just a sad face that was the end of it

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Nevermind

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
So now he's serving four years in jail

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I learned my lesson

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And now he's being made fun of on the internet

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Well how about you don't

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Sell pirated copies of stuff

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Stupid

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Of course see that's the people that they go after

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Is the big piracy rings that

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Cause companies money because they're actually

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Selling bootleg copies

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Amazetatsuma in chat says his body

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Copied too much estrogen

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
And Rama says and people wonder why

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Software is so fucking expensive

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
By the way that's a free download

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
At iTunes

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Yeah better be it wouldn't be worth

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Someone should go copy it

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Ha ha ha

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Oh you gotta love irony

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Alright guess who's never gonna download that

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Me

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
DarkSocker you had a last minute story and then we'll let Loki

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Finish up if he has anything else

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Yeah it's actually somebody

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
To quote Silent Scope

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Let's play Metal Gear for real

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
A guy

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
In France who was

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Accused of killing

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
The

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
There's an actor Roland Gerard

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
He was convicted with

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Well supposed to be going actually in jail waiting

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Trial for killing the guys daughter

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And her friend

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
He escaped

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
From jail in a box

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
In a box

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Playing Metal Gear

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Not really

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
He had put himself

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
In a box that was

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Being

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Loaded onto a truck to take to southeast

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Of Paris

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
And he broke free

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
And the driver didn't even figure it out until later

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
And so the guys from what I can

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
See is still at large

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
His name is

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Jean-Pierre Trebert

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I think so

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Trebek

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Not Trebek

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
But uh

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I just thought it was kind of funny

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
That he shipped himself out in a box

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Like Solid Snake

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
It's myself in a box

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Anyhow sorry

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Like Solid Snake you know

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Oh no

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Cause you know in the game he was in a box

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
And he moved the box in the truck

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
And says oh no the truck have started to move

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
The truck have started to move I love that

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
I need to play through old school NES Metal Gear

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Hey that gaming marathon

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
We're doing on the 17th

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
I want to play Metal Gear for an hour

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Old school

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
What?

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Yeah

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Hey by the way

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I hate you

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
The other thing I wanted to say

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
I was watching Saturday Night Live last night

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Those of you that follow me on Facebook

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Probably saw I made a little joke

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
I'm watching Saturday Night Live drinking wine and eating ice cream

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
And two of the three things are good

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
There was actually

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
One funny thing they had on Saturday Night Live last night

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
It was a repeat but I never watched Saturday Night Live

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
So it was new to me

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
But they had like a sequel to the Dick in the Box thing

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
With Justin Timberlake and whoever that guy

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Andy Samberg is that his name?

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
It was like something like

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
We're gonna fuck each other's moms for Mother's Day

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Or something like that

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
It was actually really funny

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
I hadn't heard that one

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
That was the one funny thing I saw on that show

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
It's not on the album

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Cause they tried to do this parody of the Governors of New York

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
For a very long time

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Where it's like you're just watching someone embarrass themselves

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
And you're like please stop

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Please stop

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Much like you probably do listening to this show

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Did you see that Tina Fey won an award?

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
For what?

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
For her portrayal of Sarah Palin

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Well she deserves it

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Everybody thinks that Sarah Palin

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Actually said I can see Russia from my house

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
She never actually said that

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
People think she did

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I just think it's funny

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
So Mother Lover is what it's called

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
And that's what they're saying in chat there

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Thank you

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Alright anyhow, Loki did you have any other last minute stories?

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
I don't have any last minute stories

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
That's it, we're done, we're out of here, time to go

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Time to say goodnight

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I guess that's it

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
But before we close the door on tonight's program

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
We do have to go around and get everybody's

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Final thoughts

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Darth Sockery your final thought tonight

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Bacon

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I have now officially

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Given up pork

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Good luck with that

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Well I'm gonna be very sick tonight

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
So it's fine

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Have you ever talked about why you're doing that?

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Or is that not something you want to get into on Orland?

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
I don't want to get into it

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
My final thought is I'm gonna be working on my cabinet all week

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Yay

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
My final thought is

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Disneyland

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Yay

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yay

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000

You know

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Oh my god that scared the hell out of me

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
We had the window open and Dan walked up to the window

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
That scared the hell out of me

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
That was like Satan on my shoulder

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Telling something

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Did that get picked up on the mic?

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
I don't even know

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
