7000	13000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Lokey!
13000	19000	Tonight, September 27th, 2009, a controversial rumor hints at big Sega and Sony plans.
19000	25000	A PlayStation Home spin-off is PSP-bound, and is the sequel to one of this year's biggest hits already in the works.
25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	43000	We are that video game program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	47000	So pull up a chair and join us for the next three hours as we talk about video games.
47000	52000	It'll be myself, Rob Roberts, and, as always, your lovely co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52000	55000	How are you, my friend?
55000	58000	I am, uh, contemplative.
58000	59000	Contemplative?
59000	61000	Yes, that's a very good word for how I am right now.
61000	63000	Things you want to talk about on air or private things?
63000	65000	Um...
65000	68000	You want to have a Dr. Phil therapy session here in Oprah moment, if you will?
68000	70000	Live on our video game program?
70000	78000	Well, um, uh, I am, uh, going to only be here for about an hour, and then I'm going to a temple tonight.
78000	79000	Oh, okay.
79000	82000	For, uh, services.
82000	87000	Well, you have fun, and, um, sorry that you won't be here for the whole show, but certainly understanding.
87000	88000	When you have other commitments, you have other commitments.
88000	90000	Try not to ruin my house.
90000	91000	I'll try.
91000	95000	You know, this isn't the first time we've taped a show at Studio DarkSakura without DarkSakura.
95000	96000	It's going to be a little creepy.
96000	99000	But you will be here for a little while to, uh, give your colorful insight, as always.
99000	101000	Oh, yes.
101000	103000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
103000	104000	But what are we going to do?
104000	106000	Because I don't have Sims 3 on my laptop.
106000	113000	Actually, what we'll do, we'll have DarkSakura bring it up on her computer and just put the microphone kind of, like, at a distance from the speaker.
113000	115000	I turn off the sound during the show.
115000	117000	And it'll be, it'll be like she's here.
117000	118000	Okay.
118000	120000	And then we'll hear the Simlish every once in a while.
120000	122000	And it'll be, that'll be her input.
122000	124000	Sounds about right.
124000	126000	So, what did you think about Tokyo Game Show this year, DarkSakura?
126000	132000	I thought about it, well, actually, you know, I'll tell you what, I had a friend that went.
132000	133000	Did you really?
133000	142000	Yeah, one of my, uh, friends from Berkeley, she lives in Japan now, and she went to Tokyo Game Show and posted lots of pictures of the cosplay and the win.
142000	144000	I heard it was kind of a mixed bag this year.
144000	153000	Our, uh, buddy Bobby Black Wolf, who, of course, tapes before us at All Games Radio, where we always tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, but starting at 5 Pacific.
153000	157000	Gotta, gotta plug All Games, because they let us steal their bandwidth every week.
157000	171000	Um, but, of course, there's a bunch of great shows on All Games, and the one before us is Bobby Black Wolf, and he was kind of talking, you know, his piece, and we were doing a little phone call at the end of his show, as we always do, and he had mentioned that some of the things he had heard on Tokyo Game Show this year, not so hot.
171000	174000	And I think that it depends on what you go there for.
174000	179000	I mean, I think she was just going there just to see and to look around, so I think she had a good time.
179000	188000	Right. And I got the impression, like, he didn't say who it was for whatever reason, which is fine, but, you know, I got the impression maybe because it was an industry person, so I didn't want to say who it was.
188000	195000	So, probably, maybe from the industry perspective, it's eh, but the kind of, the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is open to the public.
195000	197000	That's something E3 is not.
197000	202000	So, it is like E3 meets Penny Arcade Expo, in a way, I guess you could say, in Japan.
202000	205000	I mean, I don't think we should really compare Expos to each other. They're all kind of different.
205000	209000	But the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is an open to the public trade show of sorts.
209000	216000	So, I think if you're like a private citizen kind of going and not really into the whole industry, but you're just a gaming enthusiast, I bet it's a heck of a lot of fun.
216000	219000	So, there you go.
219000	220000	I agree.
220000	221000	Alright.
221000	232000	Well, we do like to think of ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio as kind of like, you know, friends getting together for, like, post-arcade, night at the arcade dinner, meeting up at a diner, because that's what we actually used to do.
232000	242000	That's how Dark Soccer, Loki, and myself all met. We used to go to this little diner called Brookfield's in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land after a night of DDR and fighting games and who knows what else we would play back in the day.
242000	248000	Sadly, arcades have gone downhill in the past eight years, but we're still here doing our thing, and we always invite you guys to come to the table with us.
248000	254000	Join us at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, if you want to chat with us during the program.
254000	257000	We are back after a week off last week.
257000	261000	Unfortunately, we're a little spotty in our schedule right now.
261000	263000	We're going to be out next week as well.
263000	264000	But I have some good news.
264000	268000	We are going to have a best-of show airing next week with some new content.
268000	270000	We're going to get together next week and tape some new content.
270000	276000	So we won't be live next week sadly, but you will get to hear some of our best bits going back a little ways too.
276000	278000	So some of our new fans in the past year or two.
278000	280000	And this will actually go to the podcast feed as well.
280000	281000	So you'll be able to hear it.
281000	283000	It'll air live first, of course as it always does.
283000	286180	it always does and then go to the podcast feed a little later so if you
286180	289280	want to be the first to hear it just stay tuned after Bobby next week like
289280	293960	you always are sadly we won't be here live but then after that that should be
293960	297760	it for the rest of the year we'll be here every show up through Christmas I
297760	300220	don't think Christmas is on a Sunday this year and New Year's and all that so
300220	307400	I think we'll be fine so anyhow um I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com
307400	311920	actdeft says the OLR dinner table yay I want to welcome all of our new
311920	315460	chatters as well I'm not sure who exactly all in chat is new tonight but I
315460	318600	do want to say welcome if you are new to the program and of course welcome to our
318600	321560	veteran folks as well especially those of you that have been with us for a long
321560	325880	time like dark Tetsuya I think he's been here every week since episode 1 you got
325880	330280	to love that he was literally there for episode 1 so props to you longtime
330280	334280	listeners and new time listeners tonight so if you're new then you ought to know
334280	336760	that we always start off every show with a little bit of how was your gaming
336760	342880	week start Sakura how was your gaming week it was not very eventful I should
342880	347960	say I really I really didn't play much of anything this week Rob except for
347960	355160	like a game of pinball and cuz I was gonna I haven't paid for my World of
355160	359160	Warcraft account because of financial issues here at home which hopefully I'll
359160	363560	be able to rectify next week but I had no idea that back I played some Sims I
363560	368160	actually did for about 20 minutes I have to say as far as the pinball thing goes
368160	371480	one game that I played a little bit of this week not a lot but was the Zen
371480	374680	pinball on PlayStation 3 and I know Bobby was giving you some crap about
374680	376840	that a while ago saying you gotta check it out you gotta check it out well I'm
376840	379560	gonna I'm gonna jump on board and say you got to check it out cuz it is a
379560	384040	pretty good pinball collection and some fun tables on there I was finally
384040	386960	getting into one of them I think it's called v12 it's like a racing table and
386960	389460	it's one of those things where there's like a field on top and then a play
389460	393160	field underneath the glass and the way they do it on the PlayStation 3 is kind
393160	398320	of neat so um it's worth checking out we know this week is you know remember if
398320	402400	it's this week or last week but uh what was it the pinball Hall of Fame
402400	406120	Williams collection will be out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 you know I
406120	408760	already own the game on we did they talk about if they're doing anything new with
408760	413440	that it's all high-res and stuff I guess that's cool but I do own it on we the
413440	418160	uh we version though they're getting the one that came out in the UK they got a
418160	423960	little collection become out here in November so it's a great week great week
423960	427320	to be a pinball enthusiast apparently I would like to see more tables come to
427320	430320	Zen pinball I think they only have the one table and I know there's a very
430320	436120	comparable game on the Xbox 360 and I apologize the name escapes me but I know
436120	440000	there's a and somebody in chattel name and I know it but they have a
440000	443280	comparable pinball game over there and they get a lot of they've had quite a
443280	447160	few tables I think two or at least three there's a pair table one time well I
447160	450800	think it's probably the same table that's on Zen pinball so kind of funny
450800	455140	uh Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games mainly I
455140	462640	played Grand Theft Auto lost and damned this time though since they went and
462640	466680	broke our modded games which you know how to suppress for a while we didn't
466680	470640	really know what the hell we're gonna do with the game now so the killer time
470640	474480	until the new expansion comes out we've been playing ranked games actually and
474480	478480	it's quite fun cuz we kick the crap out of everybody that plays with us
478480	482800	everybody just and normally I don't talk crap through my games over if there's
482800	487480	someone else that's playing outside of a group I talk shit the entire time it's
487480	493320	awesome but wait so you now go now ever since they banned your private games
493320	496480	because you were doing the hack thing or whatever yeah you now go out on the
496480	500160	public and play public now yeah we play ranked games all time and it's funny so
500160	503400	will you now take challenges from all our listeners well ranked games it's
503400	506920	just kind of a matter of chance getting in the same game okay honestly right now
506920	510800	there's so few people playing ranked games like at lunch at sometimes because
510800	514880	we have five consoles that all happen to be gold accounts I can literally put all
514880	518880	five consoles in a game and just take sniper shots at heads and stuff to kind
518880	524280	of boost my stats a bit but cheater cheater no I only do it for the costumes
524280	527800	and crap because really there's no point in getting up the leaderboard I guess if
527800	532680	you get the rank 10 or whatever you get 20 points big fucking whoop I mean it
532680	535520	let me put it this way I'm at rank 4 right now and then to get to the next
535520	541600	look next rank is $100,000 and you get maybe about in your average game $1,500
541600	548120	so it's just it's killing time until the new one comes out basically I do want to
548120	551680	say real quick before we get too far away from the topic but pinball FX is
551680	555680	the name of the pinball game on Xbox 360 thank you hit stun who said it first and
555680	558520	black wolf points out it's the same company that makes both games that's why
558520	562840	some of the tables hop across both of those games and vidpower wants to point
562840	566440	out if you're listening live on this Sunday night pinball FX is on sale for
566440	569880	the rest of today so if you are looking for any I do have that game on 360 I
569880	574520	just haven't played it in a long time I still have a bork 360 so I'm finally
574520	580080	taking care of that this week but it's a it's a it's a decent pinball game as
580080	583080	well I mean it's pretty much the same thing on the PlayStation 3 so I would
583080	586680	totally urge you to check it out sorry lucky yeah but yeah we're not really
586680	589920	just cheating and stuff we're just doing it the kind of because the other thing
589920	594120	too that happens a lot of times is it will roll back our stats so like I was
594120	600200	ranked for the other day then it like the next day I was back $25,000 and back
600200	606160	to rank 3 again so their leaderboards kind of fucked up anyways and you know
606160	610520	instead of just wasting another 20 days to get you know the same amount of money
610520	615120	we're just going in there and doing like you know headshot kills and stuff like
615120	618240	that but yeah actually when we get into the games with everybody else so I
618240	624280	definitely hold my own so it's no problem then on top of that then really
624280	627920	it's not game playing but I've been working on my arcade cabinet that I got
627920	634680	and it's actually pretty much done I mean it's I finished sanding the whole
634680	641320	thing and then respraying it with black spray paint and I got replacement
641320	646200	buttons replacement joysticks I actually converted the panel I had because it was
646200	649840	a two-player panel with three buttons each and I drilled three more holes in
649840	656720	there for the other six buttons and it's close to what's supposed to look like
656720	662320	you know drilling stuff into steel doesn't really a line up sometimes and
662320	668360	then I've just been kind of putting everything back together so I got most
668360	672040	of it done yesterday before I had to go get dinner and end up watching TV but
672040	675760	hopefully this week it'll be all put together and I can start moving it into
675760	680240	the house and I also sought to build the computer I have all the parts that build
680240	684720	the computer but I just haven't got around to doing it yet so that's kind of
684720	693640	exciting and I played a little bit more scribble knots so I had to go to the ER
693640	697640	for something Nellie thought she had like some eye infection thing and it
697640	700520	ended up being nothing but okay I was gonna say she's okay though right no
700520	704880	she's fine she's just wanted to go the ER so I sat there playing scribble knots
704880	710360	until my battery ran out five minutes later so I don't know it's still the
710360	714480	same I did find though that you can drop anything in lava and they'll kill it so
714480	718360	you can drop Cthulhu in lava and he died drop little babies in lava and they die
718360	727840	I don't know we I just have fun that's it all right my gaming week I did play
727840	730760	some new games this week and I do want to point out cuz I'm Brad from pod
730760	734360	culture another podcast we enjoy here at orange orange radio was razzing me in
734360	739200	our chat room a little bit saying you're 360 still broken damn dude get the thing
739200	744400	fixed already um honestly I my gaming tastes have been satiated by the
744400	748040	PlayStation 3 as of late there hasn't been anything on the 360 I've been
748040	751640	dying to go out and play except rock band beatles but I know I'll get to that
751640	757880	in time it's a boy if once my life stops me so crazy and I'm going on all these
757880	761640	trips and stuff I will or I'm just gonna get the damn thing at some point too but
761640	765800	we'll rock out a couple more weeks and DJ here I'll be out man rocket builds
765800	770040	like whatever well we'll see but honestly you know between that and you
770040	772480	know I've been getting back in a while lately and you all know how that goes
772480	776080	but that's not it I actually did play some new games this week I got it I
776080	779680	interrupt you real quick sure did you see the new video for Final Fantasy 14
779680	785640	yes I did isn't it awesome oh my god I cannot wait that was gonna be a whole
785640	790440	new crack right there that was the greatest thing no I can't go back yes
790440	796240	looks amazing all right um here's the thing I want to talk about some new
796240	799360	games I played this week funny enough I played some portable games I played on
799360	802680	the PSP fantasy star portable I decided to pick up because I was traveling this
802680	805640	week and you guys know I like to play portable games the most when I'm
805640	808800	traveling as I'm sure a lot of you do so I picked up fantasy star portable which
808800	812440	is kind of a port of fantasy star universe to the PSP which is weird
812440	816280	because fantasy star universe is an online game but fancy star portable
816280	819800	doesn't really have that it has an ad hoc mode so you can play with local
819800	823960	people but you can't really go online and universe is like online as in like
823960	829360	fancy star online was online where you can play it offline though um well
829360	833040	Phantasy Star Universe has both a single-player campaign and an online
833040	836560	mode. Yeah. Phantasy Star Online was pretty much only online. It was the only place you could play it.
836560	841360	I always played Phantasy Star Online offline. Well you had to have a hacked disc or something to do that, I think.
841360	844840	No. Or you just make your own private rooms or something, right? No, you just play it offline.
844840	848160	Could you do that? Yeah, you could do that. I don't even remember. It's been so
848160	851720	long I can't even remember. Because I didn't want to do dial-up because that was...
851720	857480	Yeah, kind of slow. But, um, Phantasy Star Portable is kind of a port of a single
857480	860840	player campaign. It is not the same campaign, I want to make that clear. It's a much
860840	861680	different story
861680	865280	going on to the PSP. But it's weird because they made some weird decisions
865280	865660	with it.
865660	869680	A, they added voice acting, which is kind of not that great.
869680	873320	And the interesting thing that they changed when they ported
873320	876320	Phantasy Star Universe to the PSP is that they made the
876320	880640	space station, the home base where you basically are, they made it all 2D.
880640	885760	You don't really walk around. You just kinda highlight little icons on a mini-map
885760	888880	and that's how you talk to people. That's how you visit shops.
888880	893280	And I hate it. Like, I think that was a really bad game design decision.
893280	897520	It's pretty bad because it says, well, if a person's name is green
897520	900400	they have new information for you. But I don't want to just kinda like sit there
900400	902720	and highlight different icons on a 2D map.
902720	906760	It's like you're browsing the mall map at the mall saying, oh, I want to go to Hot
906760	908640	Topic. I want to go to Sears. I want to go, you know.
908640	912320	I just didn't like that design choice. But that's
912320	915360	that's my negative for the game. The positive for the game is that it
915360	918920	they did a pretty good job porting it over to the PSP graphically.
918920	923640	The game still looks, you know, you can tell it scaled down a little bit but not
923640	926000	that bad at all. You expect you're gonna get a little bit of that.
926000	929080	The PSP is a pretty powerful piece of hardware. It
929080	931880	carries the game very well, especially with the full motion video and some of the
931880	933020	things they put in there. So
933020	935820	it does make a pretty solid single-player campaign, especially if
935820	937520	you're a fan of Phantasy Star Universe.
937520	941400	Unfortunately, I think the biggest flaw of Phantasy Star Universe
941400	945160	all together and thusly Phantasy Star Portable
945160	947840	and I think I'm gonna get some shit for this but this is the reason why I
947840	948440	couldn't
948440	953160	continue to play the game online. It's too damn repetitive. It doesn't have
953160	956880	the variety that an online game such as
956880	962120	WoW, Final Fantasy, even some of these other, you know, MMOs we've talked about
962120	967400	in the history of our gaming. It just, I'm sorry, I love the idea of an
967400	969780	action-based MMO but honestly
969780	973640	I feel so constrained as to what you really can do. You do these same sword
973640	976520	moves over and over. Granted, you can pick different weapons.
976520	980980	Yes, I realize there's skill-ups but you don't really mix and match things. There's
980980	984740	not a lot of strategy as to what you mix and match, like how you
984740	989360	chain things in Final Fantasy based around the elements or how you,
989360	992540	you know, have, like PvP is very intensive in
992540	995680	World of Warcraft and even some of the boss strategies
995680	999000	go way beyond hack and slash. I think that's part of the reason why Phantasy
999000	1001520	Star Universe just didn't end up being that fun.
1001520	1004480	I think in a lot of people I know that played this game, just played it for a
1004480	1005440	little while and was like,
1005440	1008900	eh, bored, and I think that's why it kinda, you know, got old quick.
1008900	1012240	Phantasy Star Online I think was a little different because I think at the time we
1012240	1015720	really didn't have anything like it. I think of a game, honestly, and I know I'm
1015720	1017240	gonna get crap for saying this but I don't care,
1017240	1020880	as much as I love Phantasy Star Online, I've played both
1020880	1024200	online and universe pretty extensively, as much as I do love and respect Phantasy Star
1024200	1024680	Online,
1024680	1028780	I think if that game came out now, it would tank. But,
1028780	1032360	granted, it's unfair to say, well, this game came out 10 years ago, let's hold it
1032360	1033200	to today's standards.
1033200	1036560	It was important for what it did 10 years ago and it's always gonna hold a
1036560	1038360	place in gaming history, but I just think
1038360	1042720	the problem is Phantasy Star Universe didn't evolve on that as much as it should have,
1042720	1046020	and that's its biggest weakness. I think they should have a Gauntlet Legends
1046020	1049520	Online, like a version of Gauntlet Legends where
1049520	1053320	you can basically throw as many players as you want,
1053320	1057200	you know, together and it just, the game scales itself based on that, that'd be
1057200	1057880	pretty awesome.
1057880	1061720	XLink in our chat room, chat.orangelaundry.com, says,
1061720	1064640	part 2 for the Phantasy Star Portable is coming out next year. Yeah, that is one
1064640	1066960	story that didn't make our show world tonight, but that came out of Tokyo Game
1066960	1067520	Show this week.
1067520	1070800	They are making a Phantasy Star Portable 2 and that looks pretty cool
1070800	1073720	that they're doing and that is, the reason why I say that's cool is because it's
1073720	1075560	going to have online multiplayer,
1075560	1079080	but even then, what are they gonna do to make the game not so repetitive?
1079080	1083000	That's my biggest question. Hardcore fans of Phantasy Star Universe are going to
1083000	1083480	enjoy
1083480	1087240	Phantasy Star Portable. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play the game to
1087240	1088520	completion just because
1088520	1091720	I'm not seeing enough variety in the game, but we'll see. Sometimes,
1091720	1095640	sometimes I form these opinions of games then I can't yet, yet I can't put it down.
1095640	1098160	I probably, I'm traveling again this upcoming week, that's why we're not having a
1098160	1098880	show next weekend.
1098880	1102120	I will probably still continue to play this game.
1102120	1105800	Another game that I played is not really a game and it's a DS
1105800	1109960	title. I played a game called Personal Trainer Walking.
1109960	1114160	Yes, tease me all you want. I picked up Personal Trainer Walking because
1114160	1117800	I've been getting into walking lately. It's like a form of exercise. I like to go on
1117800	1120880	long walks and I kinda want to see what this game would do for that.
1120880	1124840	The game comes with a little pedometer. I'm actually really interested in this because I walk
1124840	1125480	regularly.
1125480	1128800	It comes with two pedometers actually. They're these little pedometers. You put it in your
1128800	1130800	little pocket and you carry it with you everywhere you go
1130800	1134280	and you'll notice that, like as I walk them down, see how the light's flashing red right now?
1134280	1138720	Just like my old Pikachu. It's because I haven't reached my 3,000 step goal for
1138720	1141920	the day yet. Once you hit your 3,000 step goal for the day, it turns green.
1141920	1146280	There really is no game in Personal Trainer Walking. All it does is that you
1146280	1147080	communicate.
1147080	1150520	The pedometer has an infrared device and so does the cartridge,
1150520	1154280	which I thought was very interesting. You hold the device to the cartridge and you
1154280	1156320	press a little button and it communicates like a graph.
1156320	1161160	Here's how you walk today. Here's where the hours were that you did the most walking.
1161160	1164600	If you were an animal, you would be a night owl or you would be a morning deer
1164600	1165600	or whatever it is.
1165600	1169400	Owls don't walk. That's stupid. Well, that's kinda smart though.
1169400	1172920	I don't think it says like that. It's tracking your activity in general.
1172920	1176280	It is. But here's the thing, and I can't stress this enough,
1176280	1179960	there is really no game to this. This is a tool.
1179960	1184420	They did add some frilly little things. You can use your Miis. It's actually the
1184420	1185880	first DS game where you can actually
1185880	1189000	take your Miis from your Wii and put it on the DS.
1189000	1192680	So you can use your Miis in some of the online things, which is...
1192680	1195720	Take your Miis from your Wii on your DS.
1195720	1199160	Yes, exactly. It's a poet.
1199160	1202440	There's these modes where
1202440	1206380	the number of steps you walk cumulatively will trace these pictures
1206380	1209000	and you fill up a little globe. It's like a trophy room.
1209000	1212440	Or you compete, because the game actually comes with two pedometers, so you can
1212440	1213960	compete with somebody in your own house.
1213960	1218760	The game will kind of pit you against each other and see
1218760	1222840	who's generating more power for the house. And then the only online mode that
1222840	1224360	this thing has is that you
1224360	1228560	communicate with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection
1228560	1231760	and it will send your steps and it will say
1231760	1235360	this is how many steps the world has walked cumulatively.
1235360	1239120	You can put it in this mode called Walk the World and you can see how long it
1239120	1241360	took for everybody to walk from the world
1241360	1245120	to the moon. And that took about three months. So right now everybody that's
1245120	1247040	playing personal training is trying to walk to Mars.
1247040	1250360	And they're about a third of the way to Mars from the moon. That's kind of cool.
1250360	1253280	Yeah, but it's a little silly. Well, I think it's a fun kind of silly.
1253280	1256320	That's a little no-be-no-be void. I was just thinking that.
1256320	1261040	But here's the thing. Here's the thing is that unfortunately
1261040	1265560	there's a lot more that could have been done here.
1265560	1268520	What about me getting to compete with my friends?
1268520	1272320	I also don't think the challenges are particularly that challenging.
1272320	1276400	3,000 steps in a day, either the device is very generous in what it's
1276400	1277000	measuring
1277000	1280520	or, but looking at the graphs I can kind of remember, oh yeah, this is my
1280520	1283120	lunch. This is when I was walking down to get coffee for the day.
1283120	1287040	You know, it's kind of funny that you remember those things. But I didn't find 3,000 steps
1287040	1290040	particularly challenging. I kind of do that in a normal day. Maybe it's because I'm a
1290040	1292560	teacher and I pace the room as I teach. Well, can you increase it?
1292560	1296600	No. At least I haven't seen that happen yet. You can set your own goals for
1296600	1299280	yourself, but the game always challenges you to get to 3,000.
1299280	1302720	I think it's, from what it seems like, it's actually trying to encourage
1302720	1305960	an average number of steps. Like, especially if people are,
1305960	1309960	you know, not really, like, for example, me.
1309960	1312840	If I'm working at my desk job, I'm not supposed to get up from my desk that much.
1312840	1316120	I normally wouldn't get up, except I
1316120	1320520	get up and walk all the time. You know what I mean? It's to encourage people to have a
1320520	1321200	normal
1321200	1323840	amount of activity. And I think that's what the game is ultimately trying to do. And I
1323840	1325560	think the other thing I want to point out is that
1325560	1330720	the game also, you know, it gives you these little mini goals like,
1330720	1334360	hey, your mini goal for today, watch the number of calories you consume.
1334360	1339280	Or go for the longest walk you possibly can today. It does give you little mini goals,
1339280	1342160	but the game doesn't really reward you or punish you if you don't meet them. You track
1342160	1343160	them on a calendar, that's it.
1343160	1346640	I find this game to be an enhancement
1346640	1350320	to an already, you know, if you think this kind of information is worth it to you,
1350320	1352880	like, you want to be able to track your walking patterns,
1352880	1356520	you want a little bit of incentive, go for it. But I think there could have been
1356520	1358280	a lot more that could have been done with this game.
1358280	1361480	I don't think it's worth $50. What they should have done, and what I'm
1361480	1365320	guessing they probably didn't do because this is Nintendo and they take the easy way out,
1365320	1369880	is they should have been integrated this game where you can track that data
1369880	1374440	for Wii Fit Plus. They probably didn't do that because then that would mean
1374440	1378000	effort and they're not going to put that effort in. Yeah, I just,
1378000	1382080	or I think a better comparison would be EA Active. I think EA Active probably does the
1382080	1384880	best job that I've seen so far out of all the games that have really given you
1384880	1386600	like a plan and having you stick to it.
1386600	1390520	So proceed with caution with personal trainer walking. If you are,
1390520	1393840	you know, interested in this, I don't think you absolutely need it.
1393840	1397920	Really what you need, not this game, is Walk It Out from Konami.
1397920	1401600	A game where you're not only walking, you're fake walking
1401600	1404640	in a game, listening to music.
1404640	1408200	So you're basically marching in place. This sounds
1408200	1411360	idiotic. It's a walking game. It's a rhythm
1411360	1415160	music game that's walking. You walk to a rhythm, basically.
1415160	1418160	You know what, that reminds me of what I used to do about
1418160	1423160	13 years ago when I would stay in my bedroom listening to Sunscream,
1423160	1426440	if anyone remembers that group. No. I see these in my closet there.
1426440	1430120	And just jumping around my room like an
1430120	1433280	idiot with the door closed because that was my exercise. Nice.
1433280	1437000	So again, proceed with caution with personal trainer walking. I think there is
1437000	1440520	benefit to be had in it, but at $50, I think that's asking a bit much, even
1440520	1442000	though it does come with two pedometers.
1442000	1445480	I want to answer a question in chat, and they didn't change their nickname, but it's a
1445480	1446560	good question. It's
1446560	1449760	8283 in our chat room. They get just
1449760	1453920	barcode numbers. Ask a vet how to change your nickname if you want me to read your real
1453920	1454840	name in the future.
1454840	1458840	Do you have to leave your DS on to track it? No. The little pedometer
1458840	1462240	must have a pretty powerful battery in there because it just works.
1462240	1465560	You just communicate with your DS once a day, you know, and then
1465560	1468880	you don't have to leave your DS on at all. The little pedometer is very tiny. It's about the
1468880	1469480	size
1469480	1473640	a little larger than a silver dollar, honest. Well, maybe not.
1473640	1477120	Maybe like a quarter of the size of the iPhone is about how big it is.
1477120	1480360	And you just leave it in your pocket, and that does all the tracking for you. So
1480360	1480880	there you go.
1480880	1485400	All right. We're going to get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we're going to mix it up a
1485400	1487960	little bit. I want to start tonight with release dates because we want to get to those
1487960	1489120	before Dark Sakura leaves.
1489120	1492840	So we'll start tonight with release dates and then get into the normal gaming news.
1492840	1496200	But some housekeeping tonight. Next week, again, we won't be here live. There will be
1496200	1498440	a Best Of with new content on the feed
1498440	1502480	tape, so look out for that. I do also want to say this. This is a bit of
1502480	1504720	unfortunate news. I don't like having to
1504720	1507840	kind of go on this and backtrack on something, but
1507840	1511120	we here at Orange Launch Radio also have personal lives as well, and sometimes
1511120	1511880	things come up.
1511880	1515920	There was a charity event that we planned on doing on October 17th for
1515920	1516800	Extra Life.
1516800	1520960	We unfortunately are going to have to back out of that, and that's not an easy thing to have to
1520960	1523380	say or do, especially when you consider it's charity.
1523380	1526800	However, there is a conflict has arisen with my day job.
1526800	1530640	It is one I have to do, and I'm sure as you can all understand, work comes first
1530640	1534160	even before some of these other things. So unfortunately, we will have to back out of
1534160	1536280	the Extra Life event and not participate.
1536280	1540280	But, we will make a nice donation on behalf of Orange Launch Radio to one of
1540280	1540800	the groups
1540800	1544160	participating. There may yet be something
1544160	1548360	to be mentioned later. We might do something in the future
1548360	1553200	that we'll do, but as far as
1553200	1556120	us doing our show for 24 hours and all that, we're not going to be able to do
1556120	1558480	that because unfortunately I'm just not going to be available. I have work
1558480	1559360	commitments.
1559360	1562800	Yeah, so that's a really sucky thing, but you know,
1562800	1566720	best of luck to those guys. I think it's for a great cause. We'll certainly be donating
1566720	1570080	and, you know, again, good luck. I hope we can do our own charity thing
1570080	1575360	in the winter. Also, I believe Bobby Blackwell's Friday Night Gaming is doing
1575360	1576780	something in the next couple weeks.
1576780	1580440	I think they're doing it like two weeks after, and I apologize if I misstating
1580440	1581360	anything, but I think
1581360	1584960	he mentioned something about that. So lots of fun charity events coming up,
1584960	1589480	all for good causes, so keep your eyes out for that.
1589480	1593240	Okay, we're going to get into release dates tonight. Let's start off, we're a little
1593240	1595840	bit out of turn tonight. We'll get into long discussion news, but I wanted to get to
1595840	1598640	release dates before DarkSakura has to go. Let's start off with US,
1598640	1602400	or you want to start with UK tonight? I could do that, since we're completely going out of order.
1602400	1605400	Sure, why not? I just have to check on what today is.
1605400	1608640	Okay, for our UK release dates,
1608640	1611920	we have on the 29th,
1611920	1616160	Jam Sessions 2 for DS, and Left 4 Dead Crash Course,
1616160	1619160	and Tales of Monkey Island, Lair of the Leviathan,
1619160	1622840	and on the 30th, Fate Unlimited codes.
1622840	1628080	Also, on the first Fallout 3, Operation Anchorage,
1628080	1631960	Fallout 3 The Pit, and Gran Turismo for PSP.
1631960	1636560	There's Beta Raider
1636560	1640160	on PSP, and Dead Space Extraction,
1640160	1643600	FIFA 10, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2,
1643600	1649120	and Risen for PC. I just want to quickly say, Bobby in chat clarified
1649120	1652720	his charity event as October 30th. That's him and his Friday Night Gaming
1652720	1656600	project, so keep an eye out for that. Beta Raider, that's the Timbaland game, right?
1656600	1660760	on PSP? Yes, it is. Beta Raider. That just sounds vile.
1660760	1664200	It does a little bit. It's a little bit dirty. Sounds like Beta operator.
1664200	1668360	Okay, you had to go there. Yes, I did. Why don't we do US next, Loki?
1668360	1672360	Ah, yes. US, well, we're getting quite a bit of stuff this week.
1672360	1675480	Starting off with the re-release of Midnight Club LA,
1675480	1678520	the complete edition with all the download content intact,
1678520	1682880	available for 30 bucks on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1682880	1686320	Also this week, Tornado Outbreak
1686320	1689880	on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii.
1689880	1693400	Family Feud coming out on the DS
1693400	1697160	and the PC and Wii. Battle of Giants Dragons
1697160	1702320	on the Nintendo DS. Also, Animal Kingdom Wildlife Expedition
1702320	1706200	on the Wii from Tecmo. Family Fun Football
1706200	1709320	also on the Wii. Ninja Gaiden 2
1709320	1712720	or Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, or Gaiden,
1712720	1716120	sorry, I keep mispronouncing that. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2
1716120	1719240	will be coming out this week as well on PlayStation 3.
1719240	1722320	Hidden Mysteries Titan. Just remember, he's not gay.
1722320	1727280	He's banging Irene, remember? The old school games? He's getting it on with Irene at the end.
1727280	1730720	Okay. Alright, just saying.
1730720	1734320	Anyways, Hidden Mysteries Titanic on the Wii and DS.
1734320	1737560	My Sims Agents on DS and Wii.
1737560	1740800	Kinda funny, I found out one of my friends is actually doing the artwork
1740800	1745120	on the My Sims games, and she's really talented. Family Party
1745120	1750880	30 Great Games Outdoor Fun on the Wii. Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 Days
1750880	1754520	on the Nintendo DS. On PC, Fallen Earth,
1754520	1759440	Welcome to the Apocalypse. The Wizard of Oz will be on the Yellow Brick Road
1759440	1763960	on Nintendo DS this week. Imagine Salon Stylist
1763960	1769360	on the DS. Really? Really. Do you chop hair with your stylist or something?
1769360	1772600	I think you do. Undead Knights
1772600	1776480	on PSP from Tecmo. Deca Sports 2
1776480	1779880	on the Wii. Valhalla Knights Eldar Saga
1779880	1784280	on the Wii. And see here.
1784280	1788360	Gran Turismo PSP.
1788360	1791880	Coming to the PSP. And
1791880	1795120	then about a week from today actually
1795120	1799280	we're gonna be getting Wii Sports, or not Wii Sports, Wii Fit Plus
1799280	1802360	which will be available in the game only and bundle
1802360	1805740	that's coming out on the Wii. But the game only is 20 bucks.
1805740	1808720	Which kinda surprised us. We thought Nintendo might try to gouge a little bit on the
1808720	1810000	price but they're actually kinda
1810000	1813400	you know, giving a little break. Only 20 bucks for all the new stuff. Well, the game's exactly the same
1813400	1817560	except for a few slight changes. Yeah, I hope that they give a break. Well, doesn't it have like an internet thing now?
1817560	1821080	Which is what I was thinking this personal trainer should have.
1821080	1824840	You can customize your training
1824840	1827920	schedule or guests in there and you can also, there's a few more minigames and stuff.
1827920	1831240	But it's essentially the same damn game just re-released and enhanced.
1831240	1836720	Alright, fair enough. Dreamer Top Model on DS and wrapping things up.
1836720	1840200	Risen
1840200	1846000	on PC. Alright. Quickly going over the Japanese release dates. Coming out on
1846000	1847200	October 1st
1847200	1850560	we have Gears of War 2. The Game of the Year edition makes its way.
1850560	1854400	That's actually in the other Asia regions, not just Japan. So keep an eye out for that.
1854400	1858680	Also coming out on the 1st of October, X-Edge Dash comes out on the Xbox 360 as
1858680	1859200	well as
1859200	1863360	Shin Sangoku Mosu multi-raid special comes out from Koei.
1863360	1867200	Moving on over to the PlayStation 3.
1867200	1871200	Pulling up those release dates. Which if I remember correctly, the multi-raid one now,
1871200	1873660	they actually have added in the costumes from
1873660	1877680	Ninja Gaiden as well. Yes, and I think that's coming up a little later in the show. Sorry.
1877680	1881520	No, that's okay. Spoiled it. That's alright. I think it came out of Tokyo Game Show and
1881520	1884040	I think there's a little vice versa going on. We'll get into that later.
1884040	1889080	Trinity Universe comes out on the PlayStation 3 also in a limited edition
1889080	1892920	case if you're looking for that. I'm not sure what kind of game that is. I haven't
1892920	1895040	even heard of this. It looks like some type of
1895040	1900200	role-playing game but I guess it's kinda more of a light and fun.
1900200	1903960	Due to a freak accident during an important ceremony
1903960	1908480	you are turned into the Puppy Demon Lord. Oh, that sounds unfortunate.
1908480	1911800	That's on the PlayStation 3.
1911800	1914840	It looks like it could be interesting.
1914840	1918280	It's got the Disgaea Penguins in it. What the hell are these things
1918280	1921840	named? I can't remember.
1921840	1924840	The little penguin dudes from... God damn it.
1924840	1928760	Somebody will remember in chat. We have to say goodbye to Dark Sakura by the way.
1928760	1929640	She's on her way out.
1929640	1932680	I think that's actually the Trinity thing. I think that's actually one of those
1932680	1935180	games. It's a cross game where they have the characters from everything.
1935180	1939280	Prinny! Thank you Jay Dizzle who was first to say it in chat. God, the name was on the tip of my tongue.
1939280	1942760	I'm gonna go ahead and leave my name in chat just in case anyone wants to send me a message.
1942760	1946360	Alright. Take care Dark Sakura. Have a good night and hopefully we'll see you when you get back.
1946360	1948120	I don't know if we'll still be on or not but we'll see.
1948120	1951520	Should be. Alright. Moving on to some other releases
1951520	1954720	on the Nintendo Wii
1954720	1959360	on October 1st. I have a long way to scroll because of all the releases here.
1959360	1963040	Wii Fit Plus makes its way to Japan. Of course that is also coming with the board
1963040	1965040	and a mat if you want it.
1965040	1968600	Dead Space Extraction comes out as well as
1968600	1971800	some karaoke games are making their way out.
1971800	1973840	Moving on to...
1973840	1978440	They're not branded games though. On to the PlayStation 2.
1978440	1981720	Yes, they are still cranking out the games for PlayStation 2 over there.
1981720	1985320	They all have very long complicated names. I'll give you a taste of them.
1985320	1989400	Hiro no Kakeru Shin Tamayori Hime Denshuu comes out.
1989400	1996040	And also Momosuke Kofu no Misasagi O comes out.
1996040	2000040	But I know you guys are probably very interested in Beatmania 2DX16
2000040	2003080	Empress Plus Premium Best. That is coming out in two weeks.
2003080	2007680	That's like the uber Beatmania 2DX game coming out. That's supposed to have like 150 songs in it.
2007680	2011600	Like something nuts. That's pretty awesome. Well it's like the last PS2 game I think they're doing.
2011600	2016000	So, keep an eye out for that. Moving on to the handhelds real quick.
2016000	2018000	On the Nintendo DS this week.
2018000	2025600	Nothing I recognize with name stuff by name, but I do notice Blue Dragon is next week.
2025600	2027600	There's a Blue Dragon game coming out on the DS over there.
2027600	2033400	Coming out on the PSP if anything this week.
2033400	2038000	Gran Turismo comes out in Japan just like it's coming out over here on the PSP.
2038000	2041600	Also Macross Ultimate Frontier.
2041600	2046800	You know, I actually missed quite a few titles here for the US as well.
2046800	2053600	Real quick, we're also getting the Beater Raider on the PSP.
2053600	2060400	There's going to be a new Kebales game, Big Game Hunter 2010 also on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
2060400	2065600	Sideswiped on the DS which looks like a pretty cool kind of full auto game.
2065600	2068400	Rapala Wii Fish on the Wii.
2068400	2074400	And Obscure the Aftermath on PSP.
2074400	2078200	And then some other games, but I'm not going to mention those.
2078200	2079800	Alright, now we can get into some news.
2079800	2082400	So we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
2082400	2086600	And now it's just Loki and I just holding down the fort over the next few hours.
2086600	2089000	But you guys in chat as well.
2089000	2092600	So, Loki's going to steal Jamie's chair.
2092600	2096600	That chair is way uncomfortable and too small and I'm getting a headache from sitting on it.
2096600	2099200	Oh no. I'll have to figure out something in the future.
2099200	2101000	Oh yeah, that's much better.
2101000	2104400	You know what's funny? I think I have a folding chair in my car, of all places.
2104400	2106800	I don't care. This chair is much better.
2106800	2109600	Alright, fair enough. Well, it is her throne after all.
2109600	2112400	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?
2112400	2117000	So, in case you weren't aware, there was a Wii price drop today.
2117000	2124200	It dropped down to $1.99. It was one of those really well-kept secrets, I guess.
2124200	2129800	You know, it's not like numerous ads leaked out and leaks everywhere.
2129800	2134400	Okay, so maybe it wasn't so secret, but it is official now.
2134400	2138600	And that's kind of cool.
2138600	2143400	To kind of go along with that though, in Europe, you don't get a price drop. Sorry.
2143400	2150400	However, you do get a new bundle, and they're going to be including both Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort in that bundle.
2150400	2155200	So, I guess a little more bang for your buck, which is kind of cool.
2155200	2159000	You know what's funny? Is that on last week's show, I predicted that that would be a bundle.
2159000	2162400	So, I was kind of half right, because I kind of meant that it would be a bundle here,
2162400	2164600	but it ends up that it's going to be a bundle over there.
2164600	2170400	Yeah, I mean, it's... I don't know. We may see something like that come over here if they're really hurting for sales,
2170400	2174800	but I don't think that right now they're going to bring it over here.
2174800	2180600	I don't know if you did see, though, Wii Sports Resort, though, is going to be getting a different bundle over here,
2180600	2187000	actually, in a few months, where they're going to be including two Wii Motion Pluses with it instead of just one.
2187000	2191000	So, you get a, you know, a little bit of a savings there as well.
2191000	2195000	Hoping they'll drive some more sales for that, I guess.
2195000	2198400	I have to read this little Z-statement in chat first before we discuss this story.
2198400	2202000	I'm amazed that Suma, in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com, says,
2202000	2206600	Headache for sitting in a chair. Guess we know where Loki's brain was located.
2206600	2212800	It's a tension headache from my neck, because it's bad posture in that chair, and I have to sit forward,
2212800	2218400	and there's, I mean, literally, the back of the chair comes up to, like, almost my waist, and that's it.
2218400	2220800	Yeah, you insensitive ass.
2220800	2224800	And I had to drive from Oakland, okay? So, that's enough to give you a headache.
2224800	2231400	Alright, and all's there is this. Loki, is this going to help sales of the Wii over there?
2231400	2234000	Well, I mean, of course it's going to help sell more Wiis,
2234000	2237600	but is it going to keep the Wii the number one system this holiday season, you think?
2237600	2242400	Well, right now, the problem is that they've, I mean, there's already plenty of systems out there,
2242400	2245400	so they're going to be the number one system. I'm sure this will help.
2245400	2248600	The Wii's going to be popular anyways.
2248600	2255800	Software-wise, so there's nothing really, other than New Super Mario Bros. Wii, that's that amazing.
2255800	2257000	A triple-A title.
2257000	2260200	There's no real, like, must-have titles coming out this fall.
2260200	2262800	I mean, there's going to be good titles coming out, but nothing like,
2262800	2267600	oh my god, it's a new Zelda game, or oh my god, you know, it's, you know.
2267600	2271200	I guess it's a new Mario game, but, I mean, it's kind of, like,
2271200	2277200	literally putting in the least amount of effort possible into a Mario game, is what I'm seeing there,
2277200	2281800	because it's not like, you know, transitioning from, like, Mario World to Mario 64,
2281800	2287800	where those are completely different, and you can tell that, you know, this was something that they really thought out.
2287800	2290400	New Super Mario Bros. Wii just seems like,
2290400	2295400	eh, let's throw, you know, a game where there's four players and stuff like that, and kind of run with it.
2295400	2299600	And if I remember correctly, isn't that the one that plays the game for yourself, or plays the game for you or something?
2299600	2303200	Yeah, it has that whole little controversial pause and skip ahead mode,
2303200	2306800	but I was just going to say, old school is new school, remember?
2306800	2307300	Yeah.
2307300	2311600	That's not, I'm not so hung up on the graphics and all that stuff, like, I'm cool with the way they're doing the game.
2311600	2313400	I actually, I would like to see a Mario game like that.
2313400	2316800	No, I'm fine with the game being that way. I'm talking, like, the effort put into it.
2316800	2319000	I'm not saying that they, you know, went and improved the graphics or anything.
2319000	2330400	I'm saying, like, you know, I guess the example would be, like, you know, Mario 1 to Mario 2 in Japan, okay?
2330400	2335200	There was some new levels in there, but they didn't go and add anything really new as far as the game and stuff,
2335200	2341600	you know, whereas Mario 3 was completely new, you know, Mario World was completely new.
2341600	2347200	It's just, I don't know, this doesn't really seem, like, it's like half-assed releases is what it is.
2347200	2350200	You know what's funny, though? I think this game is still going to be huge.
2350200	2354000	You know why? Everybody fucking loves Mario Brothers.
2354000	2357200	Everybody, and when I say everybody, I don't mean just gamers.
2357200	2361000	Everybody knows Super Mario Brothers, the old school Nintendo game.
2361000	2363800	People are retarded. They will buy anything that has Mario in it.
2363800	2368600	That's why Mario Tennis sells well. It's a fucking tennis game.
2368600	2371600	But it's got Mario, so I must buy it, you know?
2371600	2375800	If they came out with, like, and you know what they're going to fucking do?
2375800	2378200	This is how they're going to sell that crappy Vitality sensor.
2378200	2382000	It's going to be Mario, like, Dr. Mario's Vitality sensor or some shit like that.
2382000	2384200	Dr. Mario visits trauma center? What's this?
2384200	2386400	No, Vitality sensor.
2386400	2387000	They're going to have, like, a-
2387000	2389000	If Dr. Mario was a puzzle game, that doesn't get your Vitality.
2389000	2392600	It doesn't matter. The character Dr. Mario will be in there, you know, because people will be like,
2392600	2395000	Oh my God, Mario must buy it!
2395000	2399000	So, I don't know.
2399000	2404000	Well, it's effort for trying, but it's going to be hard with not that many big releases coming out,
2404000	2408200	whereas the 360 and PlayStation 3 have a lot of releases coming out that are going to be really big titles.
2408200	2413800	But you know, then again, you know, the people that buy the Wii aren't necessarily looking for the big titles.
2413800	2415200	They're just going to buy Mario games.
2415200	2421200	And honestly, I just want to go on record and say I think this new Super Mario Brothers game is,
2421200	2423200	for that audience, the game.
2423200	2426000	You know what I mean? I don't think you're giving it enough credit.
2426000	2428200	From a gamer perspective, I get what you're saying,
2428200	2432400	but from an accessibility perspective and selling to the soccer moms of America,
2432400	2437000	I totally get what they're doing here, and I think the game will sell pretty well.
2437000	2441200	If it were Mario Galaxy 2 right now, it'd be a little bit different.
2441200	2443200	Weird that that's not out already.
2443200	2448200	I mean, they have teased that game that it is coming out, but it's surprising it's not coming out this holiday season.
2448200	2453200	These are first-party games now. It's only like one or two a month, or not even a month.
2453200	2460200	It's like, let's say there's some really obscure DS games out there that suck and end up being like something else.
2460200	2464200	Like, okay, Professor Layton's pretty awesome. Okay, that did well.
2464200	2470200	Fossil Fighters, though, is exactly the same as this other game that was put out called Fossil League DTS, I think.
2470200	2473200	And it came out from Sega a while ago.
2473200	2476200	I mean, it's literally almost exactly the same game.
2476200	2479200	And it did pretty horrible.
2479200	2484200	And Legend of, what is it, Legendary Starfie or something like that, which was a series that was only in Japan,
2484200	2488200	they finally brought it out over here in June, and that tanked as well.
2488200	2494200	And so there's a lot of DS titles that they keep putting out that really tank, even though they're kind of okay titles.
2494200	2499200	And then the Wii games, like, you know, I thought Excitebots would have been fucking awesome.
2499200	2504200	You know, it's a sequel to Excite Truck, and it kind of tanked.
2504200	2507200	And then Wii Sports Resort, it's doing well.
2507200	2512200	But I don't think as well as someone would figure for a Wii Sports sequel,
2512200	2515200	you would think that that thing would be flying off the shelves, like selling millions of copies.
2515200	2518200	I think it's going to be a gradual sell throughout Christmas.
2518200	2521200	I think that that's going to be under a lot of Christmas trees this season.
2521200	2524200	And, you know, Wii Fit Plus, I mean, come on.
2524200	2527200	It's just, stop releasing the same damn games.
2527200	2531200	Do something absolutely new. Something groundbreaking.
2531200	2537200	Again, I think all these games, the new Super Mario Brothers, the Wii Sports Resort, the Wii Fit Plus,
2537200	2540200	these games are going to show up under many Christmas trees this holiday season.
2540200	2542200	Those games are still going to sell very well.
2542200	2546200	And I get, believe me, as a hardcore gamer, I get what you're saying.
2546200	2548200	They cashed out. That's what they did. They cashed out.
2548200	2549200	They sold out.
2549200	2550200	They sold out.
2550200	2554200	But you know what? They're making, they're shitting money at this point.
2554200	2556200	Can you blame them? Can you blame them?
2556200	2561200	Exactly. But it's the point, you know, just like a musician, you know,
2561200	2564200	you get to the point where you're so rich that you can go and do those crazy ass things
2564200	2567200	because if they fail, it doesn't matter. You're fucking rich.
2567200	2571200	So that's the thing. They need to go out and start doing the crazy shit.
2571200	2573200	But no, they're playing it safe.
2573200	2577200	They need to take out the motorbike and they need to try and jump the shark.
2577200	2580200	And you can't play it safe and win American Idol. Okay.
2580200	2590200	I never thought the wife getting you into American Idol would ever help your perspectives here on the program,
2590200	2591200	but you just proved me wrong.
2591200	2593200	Hey, I want to read some comments from the chat room.
2593200	2596200	And there was an interesting perspective from Tiger Claw in our chat room
2596200	2601200	at chat.orangestonesradio.com talking about the Mario being hoarded in all the different games.
2601200	2603200	They did soccer, baseball, and tennis.
2603200	2607200	The next game would have to be Mario hockey.
2607200	2612200	Now wouldn't that be fun? You could just clock Mario in the face in a ringside fight.
2612200	2614200	I think that's why they haven't done Mario hockey.
2614200	2616200	They haven't done Mario hockey, yeah.
2616200	2620200	And because hockey is just not popular right now.
2620200	2629200	I mean, as far as a game, hockey and sadly enough, soccer are just the dogs of sports games.
2629200	2635200	And soccer or football around the world is literally the biggest sport worldwide.
2635200	2639200	But in the Americas, it sucks balls.
2639200	2641200	Or at least in North America.
2641200	2642200	Is it big in Japan?
2642200	2643200	It is big in Japan, yes.
2643200	2645200	Football is really big in Japan.
2645200	2647200	But baseball is really big in Japan.
2647200	2648200	Yeah, baseball is huge in Japan.
2648200	2653200	And it's just, over here, it's just tanks.
2653200	2655200	But they had Mario Strikers.
2655200	2657200	And it did okay.
2657200	2659200	But, you know, not...
2659200	2662200	Well, what else to sell to soccer moms but a soccer game?
2662200	2665200	They had Mario Football, you know, or something like that.
2665200	2667200	I don't know, maybe that would sell better.
2667200	2670200	But it's just...
2670200	2672200	And then again, it doesn't matter because it has Mario in it.
2672200	2675200	Seriously, when I'm selling this to my customers, you know, if I said,
2675200	2680200	Hey, look, it's Mario Dodgeball or something, or not even dodgeball.
2680200	2682200	Let me think of a crappier sport.
2682200	2683200	Mario Curling, okay?
2683200	2685200	And they'd be like, Oh, Mario, I'm buying that.
2685200	2690200	You know, it could be something completely crappy.
2690200	2693200	Wow.
2693200	2698200	You know, Mario Water Polo or Mario...
2698200	2704200	Hey, we might have some water polo players that kind of resent that remark you're making.
2704200	2706200	What they need is like a Mario snowboarding game.
2706200	2708200	That'd be pretty sweet.
2708200	2710200	How about another Mario Paint?
2710200	2711200	That's what I want to see.
2711200	2712200	Oh, yeah.
2712200	2718200	And where the fuck is that damn Bob Ross game that they promised us from a long-ass time ago?
2718200	2719200	Where the hell is that shit?
2719200	2720200	Did it get canceled?
2720200	2722200	Didn't we have a story on that a while back that got canceled?
2722200	2723200	It's a painting game.
2723200	2724200	Come on.
2724200	2725200	It's perfect.
2725200	2726200	All right.
2726200	2729200	And I do know that they do have a Mario snowboarding game.
2729200	2731200	It's Mario and Sonic, but whatever.
2731200	2732200	All right.
2732200	2736200	Let's move on and talk about something besides Mario.
2736200	2739200	But we will stay on the topic of price drops, and we'll talk about Microsoft.
2739200	2742200	Granted, we already know that the Xbox 360 recently got a price drop.
2742200	2747200	But there, of course, is a mole out there that helps out the website Ars Technica.
2747200	2752200	And apparently, they had reported earlier this week that there was going to be some
2752200	2754200	other types of price drops going on.
2754200	2759200	And apparently, there's going to be a holiday bundle that includes Pure and Lego Batman
2759200	2764200	with an Xbox 360 Elite, kind of like a little bundle coming out over there, which apparently
2764200	2766200	Joystick has their own mole.
2766200	2767200	That's Joystick with a Q.
2767200	2769200	They've got a picture of what it looks like, although it looks like it might be like an
2769200	2772200	Australian box because of the ratings on the cover there.
2772200	2773200	You have the banner that they have.
2773200	2775200	The other ones are US.
2775200	2776200	Gotcha.
2776200	2777200	Yeah.
2777200	2782200	So once pictures surface, you kind of know that's going to happen.
2782200	2783200	I don't think it was Photoshopped either.
2783200	2784200	It looked pretty legit.
2784200	2785200	Yeah.
2785200	2792200	Also, supposedly getting a price drop over in Microsoft's world, the 802.11n adapter.
2792200	2793200	I'm sorry.
2793200	2795200	That is the new one because it's n.
2795200	2796200	That's coming out for $100.
2796200	2799200	The G is getting the price drop to $79.99.
2799200	2801200	Still way too damn expensive.
2801200	2806200	For a feature that you should consider that the PlayStation 3 has built into it.
2806200	2815200	And seriously, you could go buy a wireless switch or whatever way cheaper than that,
2815200	2816200	and it would work perfectly.
2816200	2817200	Yeah.
2817200	2818200	I have a non-Xbox 360 router.
2818200	2823200	I have a wireless gaming router that's supposed to work with all my systems that I just basically
2823200	2826200	run a CAT5 from my box to this gaming router, and it works fine.
2826200	2827200	It works perfect.
2827200	2833200	And when I had my PlayStation 2 online once in a while for the DDR games that were online
2833200	2837200	and Amplitude and stuff, I would just switch out the CAT5 from the Xbox and the PlayStation
2837200	2838200	2 and it worked fine.
2838200	2839200	It worked great.
2839200	2840200	Yeah.
2840200	2841200	So, you know.
2841200	2843200	And I think the original Xbox I would use that with too.
2843200	2845200	So it worked great for all those systems.
2845200	2847200	Well, they overcharge for everything.
2847200	2849200	I mean, look at how much their fucking hard drives are.
2849200	2852200	And hard drives are damn cheap.
2852200	2858200	You know, for a hundred bucks, you can get a terabyte now.
2858200	2863200	So, why is it a hundred dollars for a hundred and twenty gigs?
2863200	2864200	You know, seriously.
2864200	2867200	Bring down the price.
2867200	2868200	Some comments in chat.
2868200	2872200	ACDEF says there's going to be a bundle that includes the wireless adapter, a media controller,
2872200	2874200	one thousand Microsoft points, and three months of live.
2874200	2875200	Yes.
2875200	2878200	And it looks like a big box of popcorn.
2878200	2879200	How cute.
2879200	2883200	I guess is that targeted at the Netflix audience?
2883200	2884200	Probably.
2884200	2885200	Probably.
2885200	2886200	All right.
2886200	2890200	Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchery.com as we tape on this
2890200	2892200	lovely Sunday evening at allgames.com.
2892200	2894200	No, it's not too big of a surprise.
2894200	2897200	I mean, because the Japanese love their Final Fantasy.
2897200	2898200	So, of course.
2898200	2900200	I love my Final Fantasy.
2900200	2901200	I'm with Japan there.
2901200	2902200	I do too.
2902200	2909200	And, you know, announced at Tokyo Game Show to go along with the going to be, you know,
2909200	2911200	epic release of Final Fantasy 13.
2911200	2915200	Of course, the Final Fantasy 13 PlayStation 3.
2915200	2916200	Oh, but it gets better.
2916200	2919200	It's also got 250 gigabyte hard drive.
2919200	2920200	Yes.
2920200	2921200	Apparently the FCC doesn't lie.
2921200	2923200	Oh, but wait a second.
2923200	2925200	The FCC is only in the U.S.
2925200	2927200	So, maybe that's coming out over here later on.
2927200	2928200	But it is.
2928200	2930200	Oh, interesting.
2930200	2931200	But it is coming out in Japan.
2931200	2932200	It's got...
2932200	2933200	Fuck!
2933200	2935200	I wish I'd waited for the PlayStation 3 then.
2935200	2937200	If they're going to release a Final Fantasy 13 one here.
2937200	2939200	That sounds awesome.
2939200	2941200	And it dropped in price.
2941200	2942200	But anyways.
2942200	2944200	Does yours have backwards compatibility?
2944200	2945200	No.
2945200	2947200	I have like the crappiest PlayStation 3 possible.
2947200	2950200	It's a fat and it doesn't have backwards compatibility.
2950200	2953200	And I bought it six months before the price dropped.
2953200	2954200	I'm just praying mine doesn't die.
2954200	2956200	Because I've got full backwards compatibility.
2956200	2957200	And I use it.
2957200	2958200	Never.
2958200	2959200	Hmm.
2959200	2963200	Well, you know, backwards compatibility might be coming back.
2963200	2964200	But that's in the future.
2964200	2965200	We'll get to that story later.
2965200	2967200	Not a big thing.
2967200	2969200	At a price.
2969200	2970200	Anyways.
2970200	2977200	So this new system is going to be coming out for 41,600 yen.
2977200	2981200	And also it's got...
2981200	2987200	It basically looks like a white, possibly silver system with like a pink silkscreen on it.
2987200	2991200	So a little bit on the fruity side there.
2991200	2993200	If you ask me.
2993200	2994200	I would think a black silkscreen.
2994200	2996200	Which makes it awesome.
2996200	2997200	A black silkscreen would look better.
2997200	2998200	It would show up better.
2998200	3003200	Because it's a little hard to see.
3003200	3008200	But then also of course with a matching white controller and that kind of thing.
3008200	3011200	And to go along with that though.
3011200	3014200	There's going to be some more bundles coming out.
3014200	3019200	Of course not in the US because god forbid we actually announce something over here.
3019200	3024200	They're going to be having a 250GB system for quite a few different games.
3024200	3028200	Including the new Ratchet and Clank, Crack in Time.
3028200	3036200	Also Assassin's Creed 2, FIFA 10, Need for Speed Shift, and Uncharted 2.
3036200	3043200	And these are all kind of leaked out of a Norwegian GameStop database.
3043200	3044200	Wow.
3044200	3045200	Yes.
3045200	3052200	So you better believe if they're getting it over there we're probably going to get it over here.
3052200	3053200	Maybe not that many bundles.
3053200	3057200	That would be really freaking crazy.
3057200	3058200	In time for Christmas though right?
3058200	3059200	I'm sure we'll get something.
3059200	3062200	They're going to announce something in time for Christmas.
3062200	3066200	Just a cash in on that I guess.
3066200	3067200	I don't know.
3067200	3069200	Well you know if you see Xbox 360 getting one.
3069200	3072200	You know that Playstation 3 is going to have one as well.
3072200	3073200	Not necessarily.
3073200	3074200	I mean they do one every year.
3074200	3078200	They've done it for the last three years with the Xbox 360.
3078200	3080200	You know this year they're actually.
3080200	3082200	Because the arcade I think last year had one game bundled with it.
3082200	3084200	And then the other ones had two.
3084200	3090200	They had the Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.
3090200	3093200	These games we had a million extra copies of sitting over here.
3093200	3095200	Actually the Lego one sold pretty good huh?
3095200	3098200	But that Kung Fu Panda couldn't have been a huge.
3098200	3099200	It's actually supposed to be pretty good.
3099200	3100200	Is it?
3100200	3101200	Yeah.
3101200	3102200	I'll shut up.
3102200	3104200	It's like my kids first action game.
3104200	3105200	Alright.
3105200	3107200	Loki is now going to take us to the next story.
3107200	3109200	Which is probably in my opinion.
3109200	3111200	I think kind of the biggest news story this week.
3111200	3113200	Even though it is a huge fat rumor right?
3113200	3115200	It's not a fat rumor.
3115200	3116200	It's absolutely true.
3116200	3118200	And the reason why it's absolutely true.
3118200	3120200	Is it's coming from Sega's FTP site.
3120200	3121200	It just got leaked out there.
3121200	3123200	And they're like oh shit.
3123200	3124200	Pulled it back.
3124200	3125200	But it's absolutely true.
3125200	3128200	It's their minutes from a meeting that they had.
3128200	3131200	Now there's a few things in there that don't really make any sense.
3131200	3136200	But for a while though they did have a link straight to that file on their FTP site.
3136200	3137200	Were you able to grab it when it was up there?
3137200	3138200	I wasn't able to grab it.
3138200	3139200	I wasn't able to get it either.
3139200	3143200	But they have it basically transposed on here so.
3143200	3145200	It's everything you know.
3145200	3148200	But here's what it did entail though.
3148200	3149200	Lots of new.
3149200	3150200	Back up.
3150200	3152200	So this was from a meeting between Sega and Sony.
3152200	3153200	Apparently that occurred.
3153200	3154200	This was like the minutes.
3154200	3155200	August 6th.
3155200	3156200	We're sitting on the FTP.
3156200	3159200	I guess August 5th was when the meeting was.
3159200	3162200	And then August 6th they kind of you know.
3162200	3164200	Put a new draft or something up there.
3164200	3168200	But basically it covered a bunch of different stuff.
3168200	3172200	It also mentioned PlayStation 2 emulation on the PlayStation 3.
3172200	3177200	Also saying that they want to sell PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.
3177200	3179200	We knew it.
3179200	3180200	And some other things.
3180200	3182200	So let's run down the list here real quick.
3182200	3186200	Let's see.
3186200	3188200	So the motion controller.
3188200	3190200	They were talking a little bit about that.
3190200	3192200	A lot of stuff that was pretty much at Tokugame show.
3192200	3194200	Mentioned it's coming out in the spring.
3194200	3196200	Which I think they've already mentioned anyways.
3196200	3201200	You know seeing that they can differentiate with a PlayStation.
3201200	3204200	Or different PlayStation Skew or something like that with it.
3204200	3207200	Talking about Alpha Protocol.
3207200	3209200	Planet 51.
3209200	3210200	Let me see here.
3210200	3211200	Let's get through the good stuff.
3211200	3216200	Let's see.
3216200	3218200	PlayStation 2 emulator for PlayStation 3.
3218200	3219200	Confidential.
3219200	3220200	Don't leak this out.
3220200	3225200	Apparently they want to sell all PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.
3225200	3227200	See how that works.
3227200	3231200	Why bother giving you a free update that includes the emulator for your system.
3231200	3236200	When we can sell you every single game all over again for a price.
3236200	3238200	But it's weird they're going to.
3238200	3241200	I mean you know we kind of saw this coming.
3241200	3245200	But isn't it weird though that they're going to have some PlayStation 3's out there that can just do it.
3245200	3247200	And some that can't.
3247200	3248200	I mean that's so weird.
3248200	3249200	I would hope that.
3249200	3251200	I mean if they were sporting like that.
3251200	3255200	I would hope that they would actually update it like they did with the PlayStation.
3255200	3261200	Well actually I think the original PlayStation 3's had the PlayStation 1 emulation already built into it.
3261200	3263200	They still do.
3263200	3264200	Mine will still play PS1 games.
3264200	3267200	Yeah they'll still play it because the software emulation is built in there.
3267200	3269200	But this is something they could add with a patch.
3269200	3274200	If it's running through software where you could be able to play the PlayStation 2 games straight from your drive.
3274200	3277200	They're just not because they're assholes.
3277200	3278200	Well we don't know.
3278200	3280200	But we're assuming.
3280200	3281200	You are making an assumption here.
3281200	3282200	We don't know this for sure.
3282200	3283200	I'm making an assumption.
3283200	3284200	And the memo's not even out.
3284200	3289200	But we're kind of making an assumption based on just how long we've been following the gaming industry.
3289200	3291200	And what we just kind of expect is going to happen.
3291200	3295200	Sony's going to find a way to cash in on this and that's why.
3295200	3300200	I don't anticipate them being generous with that.
3300200	3304200	Do you remember a theory I had a while ago that the PSP Go.
3304200	3307200	Because I was like why the hell would.
3307200	3310200	I mean honestly we're trying to find reasons to buy a PSP Go.
3310200	3311200	We can't think of anything.
3311200	3312200	Don't get me wrong.
3312200	3313200	PSP 3000.
3313200	3315200	I can think of plenty of reasons to get that.
3315200	3318200	PSP Go can't really think of one.
3318200	3319200	Unless you need a smaller system.
3319200	3320200	I guess that would be one.
3320200	3322200	But I had theorized a while ago.
3322200	3324200	What if the PS2 games you can only play on the PSP Go.
3324200	3328200	But the thought is no there's no real change in the hardware on the PSP Go.
3328200	3329200	So what have you.
3329200	3333200	But that would make a little more sense to me.
3333200	3339200	And it's a little weird that they are going to lose one big perk about the PS1 games paying for them on the PlayStation Network.
3339200	3341200	Because that is one thing you can't do.
3341200	3342200	Even if you have the PS1 disc.
3342200	3344200	You can't just beam it to your PSP.
3344200	3347200	You can only do that with the downloaded ones.
3347200	3348200	Yeah.
3348200	3350200	And the thing I could see them adding the backwards compatibility.
3350200	3354200	Because really the PlayStation 2 is at the end of its life cycle.
3354200	3359200	You know a lot of game series already have cut their PlayStation 2 versions.
3359200	3360200	It's slowly dying out.
3360200	3362200	It'll probably be gone by the end of next year.
3362200	3365200	But I don't know.
3365200	3367200	It's just interesting.
3367200	3368200	Alright.
3368200	3370200	And then other things that's interesting.
3370200	3375200	They were talking about the possibility of import games coming out over here.
3375200	3376200	Which is kind of neat.
3376200	3380200	So it might be neat to see some of those over there.
3380200	3384200	And they're saying that also with the PlayStation 2 emulation.
3384200	3388200	I guess they're saying.
3388200	3391200	Now this doesn't make any sense because it's all abbreviated.
3391200	3397200	But it says for company marketing money show PlayStation 3 controller on TV ads.
3397200	3398200	Similar to the sports spots.
3398200	3400200	I don't even know what the hell that means.
3400200	3404200	PSP titles.
3404200	3408200	Massive franchises.
3408200	3409200	I don't know.
3409200	3414200	But get to the good stuff.
3414200	3415200	I don't know.
3415200	3416200	All this is pretty boring.
3416200	3418200	What about the Dreamcast stuff?
3418200	3419200	I remember that was in there.
3419200	3422200	Something about the Dreamcast games are going to be coming to the PlayStation 3, right?
3422200	3423200	Wasn't that something that was in there?
3423200	3424200	Yeah.
3424200	3428200	I'd rather read the abbreviated stuff here.
3428200	3433200	Definitely they were talking about the Dreamcast stuff coming in.
3433200	3438200	The possibilities of Japanese import games.
3438200	3442200	And the possibility of Dreamcast titles on the PlayStation Network.
3442200	3444200	But it was interesting because they talked about exclusive.
3444200	3448200	So that maybe that might give away that they're going to come out on Xbox 360 as well.
3448200	3451200	But that they might have kind of an exclusive window on PlayStation 3.
3451200	3452200	Yeah.
3452200	3455200	Because there was also something on here that was talking about the.
3455200	3460200	They were going to be doing a Sonic anniversary title with a bunch of the old Sonic games on one Blu-ray disc.
3460200	3465200	And they were saying the best of Sonic around $100 is what it would cost.
3465200	3467200	I wouldn't buy a game for $100.
3467200	3469200	I don't care how many Sonic games it has on there.
3469200	3474200	I just want to say, I don't think the DC Dreamcast emulator is as big of a deal as some might make it out to be.
3474200	3478200	Because there already are ways out there that you can get the Dreamcast games emulated.
3478200	3481200	Like GameTap has some of the Dreamcast games available on it.
3481200	3484200	And since the PS3 is supposed to basically be a computer, right?
3484200	3486200	And the Xbox 360 is to an extent too.
3486200	3489200	It's not surprising that they're able to emulate Dreamcast on it.
3489200	3492200	And they are giving them the option to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.
3492200	3498200	It says if we give them a long period of exclusivity, they will give us more marketing support.
3498200	3505200	And it says if we provide a list of Dreamcast titles, Sony will let us know which ones they're interested in having exclusively.
3505200	3509200	So there may be some that you see exclusive because they're going to go where the money is.
3509200	3511200	So it makes perfect sense.
3511200	3516200	How about a patch that lets my PS3 read my Dreamcast discs? Wouldn't that be amazing?
3516200	3521200	Yeah, too bad Dreamcast discs are a proprietary technology. I know that's not going to happen, but a man can dream.
3521200	3525200	Not that proprietary. I mean, shit, I can read them on my computer.
3525200	3530200	Was there something special to them, though, where you had to compress some Dreamcast games to fit on a CD?
3530200	3533200	Because they actually held somewhere between a CD and a DVD.
3533200	3535200	It was like GD-ROM or something, right?
3535200	3538200	Yeah, that was the whole thing they were saying.
3538200	3542200	Oh, I'm thinking Saturn, my mistake.
3542200	3545200	Yeah, I remember they were saying that it's unhackable and stuff like that.
3545200	3551200	I remember actually going to a thing and there was some guy from Sega there, one of the developers or something like that,
3551200	3555200	talking about how their disc format was unhackable and everything.
3555200	3563200	This was the same time I'm playing burn discs on my Dreamcast. I'm going, you're full of shit.
3563200	3567200	But anyways, yeah, interesting. All that's true.
3567200	3571200	I think a lot of it is still, you have to consider, is in negotiation.
3571200	3575200	That doesn't mean all of this is happening tomorrow or at the end of the year.
3575200	3581200	You were talking about talks between two companies and this whole leak might also change things dramatically.
3581200	3587200	Heads are rolling over this shit right now about the fact that this got out on the internet, whoever uploaded it.
3587200	3591200	Even if it was an accident. I mean, it's going to be huge.
3591200	3593200	And could actually damage the relationship between the two companies.
3593200	3598200	Although I think ultimately, you know...
3598200	3600200	Sony just can't keep a secret.
3600200	3603200	To be fair, neither can Microsoft.
3603200	3610200	Well, I know, I understand it, but a big nugget like that with backwards compatibility, or the whole PlayStation...
3610200	3613200	They really got screwed at E3 this year. Remember how Jack Trenton came out there and he was like,
3613200	3617200	Hey, there's one thing you didn't spoil, Final Fantasy XIV, huh?
3617200	3619200	You didn't see that one coming, did you?
3619200	3623200	Everything else got screwed on, but at least we got to allow you once.
3623200	3625200	That was fun.
3625200	3626200	Remember that?
3626200	3633200	Hey, speaking of Sony, it is official, there will be no UMD conversion program for the PSP Go.
3633200	3638200	Meaning, if you wanted to convert your UMD discs, they were talking about this whole, you know, you could do a kiosk and all this stuff.
3638200	3640200	Eh, not happening.
3640200	3644200	It all boils down to it, actually, the way it's phrased kind of makes sense.
3644200	3645200	Let me read the quote here.
3645200	3651200	We were evaluating a UMD conversion program due to legal and technical reasons we will not be offering the program at this time.
3651200	3655200	This was a Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson in an interview with Kotaku.
3655200	3664200	But, not surprising, the reasons that kind of when you further get into it have to do with the game distribution licensing and probably the agreements with the developers.
3664200	3666200	It actually makes sense.
3666200	3668200	I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.
3668200	3676200	I think they could go back and get a lot of these games to be transferable, but it's probably a violation of whatever contracts they have with developers.
3676200	3679200	Although it still sucks, it doesn't tell you.
3679200	3683200	That's not my problem that you have these issues with your contracts.
3683200	3684200	Exactly, exactly.
3684200	3686200	It's kind of what it boils down to.
3686200	3688200	However, it is your problem because I'm not buying your system.
3688200	3693200	Now, I do want to point out, though, that there will be doing a type of incentive program in Europe.
3693200	3707200	It's called the PSP Go Rewards, and if you get a PSP Go by March 31st, 2010, and I think you have to connect your old PSP model to the PlayStation Network,
3707200	3710200	so it's like they know you have both, basically.
3710200	3713200	It's not just for buying the machine, you have to connect your old one.
3713200	3719200	You will get three free UMD, I'm sorry, UMD-less games, but they are from a list.
3719200	3720200	You don't get any old games.
3720200	3728200	You have to pick from a list that includes Killzone Liberation, Wipeout Pure, Patapon, some of the Buzzbrain and Buzzmaster games, and so forth.
3728200	3733200	You know, it's more of an incentive than we're getting here, at least.
3733200	3738200	But still, I mean, even with the three free games, I'm kind of sitting here going, eh.
3738200	3740200	So let me get this straight.
3740200	3742200	Your system is more expensive.
3742200	3747200	There's no way for me to transfer my old games that I bought to this new system.
3747200	3750200	The system doesn't do anything differently.
3750200	3756200	I can't play my UMD games on it.
3756200	3760200	But it's chic, and it's new technology, and it fits in your pocket.
3760200	3761200	It's not really new technology.
3761200	3762200	It's like an iPhone, but no home.
3762200	3764200	But it's got PSP Minis.
3764200	3771200	Oh, wait, I can get this on the 3000, or the 2000, or any other PSP system out there.
3771200	3772200	I'm sorry.
3772200	3775200	It's just like, there's no reason for anyone to buy this.
3775200	3777200	And I'm afraid that's what's going to happen.
3777200	3783200	You're either the people that have to have every system buying it, or want this system because it's new and it has a slidy screen.
3783200	3785200	Whoop the shit.
3785200	3786200	And then that's it.
3786200	3788200	It's going to die a slow death.
3788200	3790200	I think this system is going to bomb terribly.
3790200	3792200	And I'm not saying that as a fanboy.
3792200	3796200	I'm saying that as a, I can imagine, people going into their local GameStopper game crazy,
3796200	3801200	just knowing the type of people that usually work there at the front desk making decent recommendations.
3801200	3804200	There's going to be a lot of these people that say, you know what?
3804200	3807200	They're going to be telling parents looking to buy these systems for kids.
3807200	3810200	And the parents are going to be saying, what's the difference between the two?
3810200	3816200	You know, the folks that work there, I think most of the time are going to get the honest answer of, eh, not much.
3816200	3817200	If they're smart, they'd be like this.
3817200	3818200	Okay, listen.
3818200	3823200	You can get this game, but he can't get any games unless he actually has an online account, a credit card.
3823200	3824200	That's where it comes in.
3824200	3828200	A credit card, you need a credit card or these points cards.
3828200	3830200	And the parents are going to say, fuck that.
3830200	3836200	And it's in GameStop or GameCrazy's best interest to sell the ones that require the discs anyway, right?
3836200	3842200	And on top of that, I mean, come on, on top of that, and I hope this doesn't happen over here,
3842200	3846200	because really it's just like, you did what?
3846200	3850200	On top of that, they're dropping the price of the 3,000.
3850200	3852200	What?
3852200	3854200	Are you stupid?
3854200	3856200	I mean, the system's more expensive.
3856200	3860200	Well, no, that's great, because the PSP 3,000 is the system you should be getting.
3860200	3861200	Exactly.
3861200	3862200	And I would recommend you get it.
3862200	3867200	Exactly, but it's like you're not going to sell more PSP Go's.
3867200	3872200	It's like they're putting it out there to get people to go, well, you know, hey, I want a PlayStation Portable,
3872200	3874200	but I'm not buying this Go.
3874200	3875200	I'm going to buy the 3,000.
3875200	3876200	Ha, we tricked you.
3876200	3880200	You bought a PlayStation Portable.
3880200	3886200	Seriously, yeah, I can't see any GameStop employee or whatever recommending the PSP Go when they can say,
3886200	3891200	okay, listen, you can get a 3,000 and you can get a game or two for the same price,
3891200	3897200	which would look better when they're just stocking, I think, the system with a couple games.
3897200	3901200	Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the sales figures look.
3901200	3904200	This system comes out this week, right?
3904200	3906200	It's this week that the PSP goes out, right?
3906200	3909200	Yeah, it's coming a week.
3909200	3910200	All right.
3910200	3915200	On to another story about Squeenix teaming up with PopCap.
3915200	3920200	That's right, the king company of role-playing games and the king company of casual games are teaming up.
3920200	3922200	It's a game called Gyromancer.
3922200	3926200	The interesting thing about this, Gyromancer is basically Bejeweled Twist,
3926200	3929200	which came out earlier this year from PopCap,
3929200	3933200	but Square Enix is kind of putting their own spin on it, making it kind of an RPG-ish type of game.
3933200	3937200	I would imagine to cash in on the Puzzle Quest fever a little bit,
3937200	3940200	although obviously Bejeweled Twist is a very different game.
3940200	3944200	Even though it says Bejeweled, the whole concept of you actually move the pieces around
3944200	3946200	kind of changes the whole puzzle element drastically.
3946200	3949200	Yeah, I told Nellie about this, thinking, hey, Bejeweled.
3949200	3957200	Puzzle Quest is basically Bejeweled anyways, but this is Bejeweled for reals with an RPG.
3957200	3959200	She's like, oh, that's kind of cool.
3959200	3961200	Then I said, oh, yeah, but it's Bejeweled Twist.
3961200	3962200	She's like, oh, I'm going to play in it.
3962200	3963200	She hates Bejeweled Twist.
3963200	3964200	Really?
3964200	3966200	You can't even play Bejeweled Twist online, can you?
3966200	3968200	I thought you can on Facebook, can you?
3968200	3969200	No, that's Bejeweled Blitz.
3969200	3971200	That's the one-minute version.
3971200	3972200	Oh, that's right.
3972200	3974200	I did tell her about what Bejeweled Twist was.
3974200	3977200	I'm like, well, it's different because you have to twist four things around.
3977200	3980200	She's like, oh, I'm not doing that.
3980200	3981200	Well, we'll see.
3981200	3984200	She's been playing Bejeweled Blitz like fucking crazy.
3984200	3986200	I know she's been beating my scores.
3986200	3988200	She's been just sitting there playing it all the time.
3988200	3989200	It's addictive.
3989200	3990200	It's addictive.
3990200	3995200	I'm telling you, right up with I always say don't discount iPhone gaming and all this other stuff,
3995200	3997200	don't discount Facebook gaming.
3997200	4001200	This is the future of casual gaming right there.
4001200	4008200	The casual MMOs are Mafia Wars, Vampire Wars, Sorority Life, all that crap on Facebook.
4008200	4011200	That is what all the non-gamers are playing.
4011200	4013200	Look at your friends list.
4013200	4017200	If you have non-gamers at your friends list, look at the amount of Facebook games they're playing.
4017200	4024200	And the moms playing Farm Town and Bejeweled Blitz, like, gamers, look out.
4024200	4027200	This Facebook games thing is going to be huge.
4027200	4030200	Hopefully there's some good news for us in there too, but I'm just saying.
4030200	4032200	Even I play Bejeweled Blitz.
4032200	4033200	It's fun.
4033200	4034200	It's a nice little time waster.
4034200	4037200	It's only a minute.
4037200	4039200	I can totally respect what PopCap is doing.
4039200	4043200	Actually, they're a pretty cool company all things considered.
4043200	4046200	Anyhow, moving on.
4046200	4048200	Yes.
4048200	4051200	Let's see.
4051200	4053200	Rock Band 2.
4053200	4055200	I've been waiting for a patch for this for a while now.
4055200	4059200	I remember they were talking about the Lips mic support and that kind of stuff coming.
4059200	4060200	Finally here.
4060200	4066200	Now you can actually use your Lips microphones with Rock Band 2, which is awesome.
4066200	4070200	I was thinking about getting some extra microphones for Beelz Rock Band.
4070200	4076200	Then again, I still have my old Karaoke Revolution mic.
4076200	4077200	It's funny.
4077200	4082200	We're actually clearing out some old-ass games that we've been just sitting on.
4082200	4088200	One of the games that we have is the Naked Brothers Band.
4088200	4090200	They have a Karaoke game.
4090200	4092200	We're selling it for $5.
4092200	4094200	I forgot that was even a musician.
4094200	4096200	Exactly, but it's got a USB microphone.
4096200	4101200	A lot of those USB microphones, regardless of what system they're on, will work with Rock Band 2.
4101200	4107200	We used, at my birthday party, the old PlayStation 2 Karaoke Revolution mic.
4107200	4109200	It worked flawlessly.
4109200	4115200	I noticed at Fry's, next to the Rock Band 2 games, they sell just regular USB mics in the same section.
4115200	4120200	Seriously, if you got a microphone from Karaoke Revolution, pretty much anything.
4120200	4123200	They're all using those stupid Logitech mics.
4123200	4125200	Just give it a shot.
4125200	4128200	It probably will work if you're looking for an extra mic.
4128200	4132200	Beyond all that stuff, they've also added in some new...
4132200	4143200	They tweaked the hammer-ons and pull-offs. Apparently, something that they had improved for the Beals Rock Band is now being added into Rock Band 2.
4143200	4152200	Also, audition mode, which will allow people on the Rock Band network to be able to upload the songs that they've created from their PCs to test them out in the game.
4152200	4157200	Before they upload them into Rock Band Network and stuff like that, you can actually check it out.
4157200	4159200	That's kind of cool.
4159200	4162200	Also, some other cool stuff.
4162200	4167200	You'll be able to actually download songs in the background, which is pretty cool.
4167200	4173200	I hated having to wait for songs to download while I'm sorting through stuff and listening to things.
4173200	4176200	Now, you'll be able to do that in the Rock Band store.
4176200	4180200	Also, they're going to have some enhancements for the Ion drum kits.
4180200	4186200	Now, they will have velocity-sensitive drum fills and freestyle mode, which is kind of cool.
4186200	4195200	Also, in the sort menu, you may now arrange the songs according to star rating that you've achieved in each of them.
4195200	4198200	Also, unplayed songs will be grouped together accordingly.
4198200	4201200	So, that's kind of cool.
4201200	4208200	There's another reason for me to get my Xbox 360 working again so I can patch Rock Band 2 and have fun with that.
4208200	4213200	Victoria was over the other day and wanted to play, but it couldn't happen, sadly.
4213200	4216200	Speaking of music games, this is an interesting one.
4216200	4218200	I think this is coming out of Tokyo Game Show.
4218200	4221200	I'm not sure, but this is definitely a very Japanese game.
4221200	4225200	Taiko no Tatujin, known over here as Taiko Drum Master.
4225200	4227200	They are going to be making a version for the Wii.
4227200	4232200	What I think is cute about it is that it's going to come with an inflatable drum peripheral.
4232200	4237200	The one on the PS2 had an actual little drum, but this one that's on the Wii is going to be an inflatable drum.
4237200	4242200	Despite all the fact that we give a lot of crap to all these different Wii peripherals coming out,
4242200	4245200	I think for the game this is, that's actually kind of a cute idea,
4245200	4250200	is to have a little, basically inflated like a beach ball, they're saying, little drum peripheral to come with it.
4250200	4252200	I think that helps for storage and everything.
4252200	4256200	Does it do anything? I mean, because I know, I think in the game you just use the remotes, right?
4256200	4258200	Doesn't it still have the sensors on it or what have you?
4258200	4260200	I think it's just using the Wii remote.
4260200	4266200	No, they say the Wiimote hovers inside of the inflated device and taps get registered through the vibrations on either side.
4266200	4269200	So it does kind of work with the Wiimote a little bit.
4269200	4271200	That's kind of a cute idea.
4271200	4276200	So, you know, there are some good news about peripherals and some things out there that we're not eyeing at it.
4276200	4280200	It's no right, it's, what is it, no rocking horse chair thing, you know.
4280200	4281200	Yeah.
4281200	4284200	But it kind of sounds kind of cute.
4284200	4287200	One more story for you guys and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
4287200	4292200	Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so Loki or myself gets to pick, we'll tell you who in a minute.
4292200	4293200	Scratch the Ultimate DJ.
4293200	4300200	Man, haven't heard about that game in a while, but they've announced a few more tracks coming out available now,
4300200	4309200	including, and of course this is all going to be R&B stuff, Push It, Salt-N-Pepa, Friends, Houdini.
4309200	4313200	I hope it's the Glee version of Push It.
4313200	4316200	Have you been watching Glee? Surely the wife is making you watch Glee.
4316200	4318200	She's been watching Glee, but I think...
4318200	4319200	You've been resisting.
4319200	4326200	Well, I've been working on the cabinet and other things, so, you know, the first time it was on I was making bacon for the bacon party,
4326200	4329200	and then last week I think I was working on a cabinet.
4329200	4334200	It's not bad. It's cheesy as hell, but a lot of TV should be, you know?
4334200	4335200	Yeah.
4335200	4344200	Okay, so Gifted starring NASA featuring Kanye West, Santo Gold, and Like Lee.
4344200	4350200	I'm going to let you finish, but Hip Hop Master was the best hip hop game in the US of all time.
4350200	4360200	Looking Fly by The Mers, Skanky Panky, Kid Koala, Ice Lightning by RJD2,
4360200	4365200	They Reminisce Over You by Pete Rock and Seal Smooth,
4365200	4369200	and Life in a Cage by The Nux.
4369200	4375200	And of course that also was added to the previously announced artists and license tracks,
4375200	4377200	which I'll read now since there's only four of them.
4377200	4385200	Peter Piper, Rendium C, Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz, Hot in Here by Nelly, and Mastermind by Deltron33.
4385200	4391200	As much as this isn't like my preferred genre of music, there are some very catchy, dancy party songs in here.
4391200	4394200	I am curious about this game.
4394200	4400200	This is yet another one that got pushed back to 2010, though, after the whole lawsuit and mess and studio change and all that, right?
4400200	4404200	It's probably a good thing anyways. There's too many damn music games coming out this fall.
4404200	4407200	Alright, fair enough.
4407200	4413200	Alright, well guys, we are getting towards the end of part A tonight, but not before we cover the classic video game of the week.
4416200	4422200	The classic game of the week is the part of the show where Dark Soccer gets to go into the vault and choose a video game from her archives,
4422200	4424200	that she thinks you all should be playing this week.
4424200	4426200	But guess what? She ain't here.
4426200	4429200	So that means Loki and myself get to pick.
4429200	4433200	We usually trade off, and going back to the Wikia, it looked like Loki had the last pick.
4433200	4436200	He did Super Mario Kart a couple months ago.
4436200	4439200	So tonight is my pick, and I have chosen a game.
4439200	4444200	I decided with Dark Soccer doing a lot of Sega, console kind of games lately,
4444200	4449200	I was actually going to go for a PC game tonight, so I picked a PC game as the classic game of the week.
4449200	4453200	And the game I have picked as tonight's classic game of the week is...
4453200	4457200	Railroad Tycoon.
4457200	4462200	Now look, I fucking love Railroad Tycoon because it was made by Sid Meier,
4462200	4465200	and you know he is a god amongst PC gaming.
4465200	4467200	He made the Civilization series.
4467200	4471200	He made a game I actually really like a lot on the PC that I almost picked for tonight,
4471200	4475200	but I couldn't find a good YouTube of it anywhere, called Covert Action.
4475200	4477200	And when I was thinking about it, I was like, you know what?
4477200	4482200	Railroad Tycoon, especially the deluxe version, I spent hours upon hours playing this as a kid.
4482200	4484200	So let me tell you a little bit about Railroad Tycoon.
4484200	4488200	Why, you listen to the music from Railroad Tycoon deluxe there in the background.
4488200	4491200	There were two different ones. We'll get into that in a minute.
4491200	4497200	But Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, this was basically a game where you would assume the role as the leader of a new company.
4497200	4500200	You would basically build railroads on a particular map.
4500200	4504200	You could play as the US Old West, you could play as the Midwest, the Northeast.
4504200	4507200	You could even do England, Europe, whatever.
4507200	4510200	You basically manage the business, you manage where the trains are going to go,
4510200	4514200	you build industries and basically transport goods from one end to another.
4514200	4520200	It's kind of a strategical game, but it was cool because you kind of built your own little empire
4520200	4523200	and it was very kind of single player.
4523200	4525200	You know, they didn't have a lot of multiplayer in it.
4525200	4529200	That didn't show up really until Civilization kind of a little later on.
4529200	4532200	But it was a cool little strategy game that you could kind of play on your own.
4532200	4537200	And yes, I realize the sound effects are very spotty in the back, but this game came out in 93.
4537200	4540200	There wasn't a lot on PC back then. This game did not come out on CDs.
4540200	4542200	Did the train just hit a dog in a car?
4542200	4544200	No, I think it's like cheering and stuff.
4544200	4548200	Basically you start with one million dollars, half of it is equity, half is loan.
4548200	4551200	You sell $500,000 bonds at various interest rates.
4551200	4553200	That's how you continue to make cash in the game.
4553200	4557200	By the way, the original Railroad Tycoon, and one reason I bring this up is the classic game of the week,
4557200	4563200	it is actually free because when they went back and released a sequel to the game later on called Railroads,
4563200	4565200	they actually made the original Railroad Tycoon free.
4565200	4567200	And I'm not sure if you can still get it on the website,
4567200	4571200	but it was basically free out there on the internet for you to download.
4571200	4576200	So you can hear some ambient music of building the tracks between the different towns there.
4576200	4579200	It looks like right now they're playing on a South African map,
4579200	4582200	and they're kind of connecting Johannesburg with some other towns there.
4582200	4587200	Railroad Tycoon, of course, got a reskinning and a redone version called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.
4587200	4589200	That was released in 93.
4589200	4595200	It basically upped the graphics from the 16 color level they were at in the original to more VGA graphics,
4595200	4597200	but unfortunately the game was very buggy.
4597200	4599200	I don't remember it being super buggy,
4599200	4604200	but they do say that the game ended up getting very buggy in certain parts of the ending.
4604200	4608200	Sid Meier, by the way, had nothing to do with the Deluxe version even though his name was in the game.
4608200	4611200	His name was removed from future releases of the game,
4611200	4614200	Railroad Tycoon 2 and Railroad Tycoon 3.
4614200	4619200	I think what's very notable about Railroad Tycoon 2 is that the game actually came out on the Dreamcast.
4619200	4621200	It was one of the few console versions of the game to come out.
4621200	4624200	It kind of took a more isometric perspective to the game,
4624200	4628200	but it was still basically the same thing at heart, just a little more involved and so on.
4628200	4631200	Railroad Tycoon 3 had a full 3D environment.
4631200	4634200	You could build overpasses, tunnels, totally improved graphics,
4634200	4639200	but honestly none of the sequels really kind of, I think, reached the way the original did.
4639200	4642200	Sid Meier did come back to do a sequel to the game in 2006.
4642200	4644200	It was Sid Meier's Railroads.
4644200	4648200	It was basically different scenarios and trains that you could do.
4648200	4650200	It was a little less focused on industry.
4650200	4653200	It had a more streamlined interface for doing the track laying,
4653200	4657200	but it was more focused on the full 3D graphics and some real-time gameplay.
4657200	4659200	So that is my classic game of the week.
4659200	4661200	I know there's not a whole lot else to say about it,
4661200	4663200	but I think it's a game you just kind of have to check out.
4663200	4666200	Yes, Choo Choo.
4666200	4668200	It was fun to kind of build the different buildings
4668200	4672200	and watch your station get bigger and bigger and watch the new trains
4672200	4675200	because you get to pick the cars that were with it and how much they would transport.
4675200	4677200	It's very much a micromanaging game, but it's a lot of fun
4677200	4681200	and one of my favorite strategy games of all time, Railroad Tycoon.
4681200	4685200	The one I spent the most time on was Railroad Tycoon Deluxe,
4685200	4688200	but we'll just call the whole Railroad Tycoon series my classic game of the week.
4688200	4691200	Did you ever play Railroad Tycoon, Loki?
4691200	4692200	No.
4692200	4696200	No? Did you play any of the Sid Meier games at all?
4696200	4698200	I don't think so.
4698200	4701200	It is, by the way, kind of ironic that I picked this game as the classic game of the week
4701200	4704200	because last week, while we weren't here live,
4704200	4707200	I was getting drunk in Southern California,
4707200	4711200	and I was actually at some... I wasn't at Disneyland at the time.
4711200	4713200	I was at some mall in Orange, and I don't remember.
4713200	4715200	I think it might have just been called the Mall of Orange.
4715200	4717200	Maybe some of you SoCal folks know what this is,
4717200	4721200	but I was so drunk that there's this little train that they drive around the complex
4721200	4724200	that little kids get to ride it, and it's not on a track or anything.
4724200	4726200	It just kind of drives around and takes kids on,
4726200	4729200	but I was convinced that the train was trying to run over me,
4729200	4731200	so I was like, Melody, we've got to run away from the train.
4731200	4733200	It's coming. It's coming.
4733200	4737200	And she was laughing her ass off because I was really, really drunk
4737200	4741200	at this place called the Alcatraz Brewery,
4741200	4744200	which really cracked me up because it was like...
4744200	4747200	Remember when the Simpsons went to America Town?
4747200	4750200	That's what it felt like because we're from Northern California,
4750200	4752200	and we go to San Francisco a lot, I'm sure.
4752200	4755200	It was kind of funny seeing the big replica of the Golden Gate
4755200	4757200	inside the building and just all this stuff,
4757200	4761200	all the little tie-ins with NorCal terms, so it was cute.
4761200	4765200	So there you go. Anyhow, sorry for my tangent.
4765200	4767200	That was your classic game of the week, Railroad Tycoon.
4767200	4769200	We're going to take a quick break,
4769200	4771200	but we will be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4771200	4774200	We are not done yet. We've got more news coming up in Part B.
4774200	4777200	Part B tonight we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news,
4777200	4780200	including another big game delayed until 2010.
4780200	4783200	PlayStation Room we're going to talk about after the break,
4783200	4787200	and World of Warcraft went down for a couple months.
4787200	4791200	Thank God it didn't happen here or places probably would have burned down.
4791200	4801200	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4801200	4805200	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening,
4805200	4809200	September the 27th of 2009 for the second half of our show.
4809200	4814200	The tape's live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
4814200	4818200	They've got a lot of great programming every night at All Games Radio.
4818200	4821200	I know they even have some new shows, and I think they're kind of restructuring
4821200	4824200	a lot of things over there. I don't know how much I'm allowed to say,
4824200	4829200	but I think there's going to be some new shows coming in and so forth into 2010.
4829200	4831200	It will be a lot of fun, so check that out.
4831200	4835200	A good family over there at allgames.com, All Games Radio.
4835200	4837200	We are here for Part B of our show.
4837200	4839200	It's myself and Loki here tonight holding down the fort.
4839200	4843200	DarkSakura was with us earlier, but she had to cut out a little early tonight.
4843200	4845200	She might be back if we're still taping at 9.30 Pacific,
4845200	4848200	but usually we don't go quite that late. We'll see.
4848200	4851200	We were just going to press forward, though, with our show tonight.
4851200	4854200	I just wanted to say, though, when you do listen live on All Games Radio,
4854200	4856200	we play some music during the break.
4856200	4860200	We can't do that during the podcast because we don't have the permissions to do so.
4860200	4863200	Even though live radio rules are a little different than downloading,
4863200	4866200	we are allowed to play some stuff live.
4866200	4868200	I just want to say we played the Guild Wars theme.
4868200	4870200	It was the last song we had coming out of that.
4870200	4875200	That guy Jeremy Soule, I don't know if it's Soule or Soleil,
4875200	4878200	he does some awesome orchestral music.
4878200	4881200	Between that and Oblivion, I really enjoy his stuff.
4881200	4884200	It really sounds like listening to a movie.
4884200	4886200	I want to play Guild Wars sometimes just to hear the music.
4886200	4888200	It's pretty awesome.
4888200	4892200	I just want to give him props because I think he did some really great work there.
4892200	4894200	I think he did the music for Prey, too.
4894200	4896200	That was one of the best parts of Prey was the soundtrack.
4896200	4898200	I know a lot of people didn't play that game,
4898200	4901200	but all things considered,
4901200	4905200	that was a shooting game made for people that really fucking suck at shooters.
4905200	4907200	It was perfect. It just ended abruptly.
4907200	4909200	The story kind of just cut off.
4909200	4912200	I think development was probably cut off of that game
4912200	4917200	because that game was going on Duke Nukem Forever time to make.
4917200	4919200	Anyhow, let's move on.
4919200	4922200	Let's get back into some gaming news tonight.
4922200	4925200	We're going to start off with some rapid fire stories. Loki.
4925200	4930200	Yes. Final Fantasy VIII is out on the PlayStation Network in Japan.
4930200	4935200	So you better believe that it will be out over here probably soon enough.
4935200	4938200	They did something similar with Final Fantasy VII,
4938200	4942200	but you know, of course, with the whole Tokyo Game Show thing going on,
4942200	4945200	it makes sense.
4945200	4948200	Disney. There was that rumor of the Epic Mickey game.
4948200	4954200	Well, Disney is set to make an announcement in London on the 28th of October.
4954200	4959200	People think it's going to be this announcement.
4959200	4965200	Apparently there was also a teaser in Game Informer saying that this announcement is coming as well.
4965200	4968200	Could it be something that's on the cover of the next Game Informer?
4968200	4970200	We'll have to wait and see.
4970200	4974200	Something epic will be announced probably.
4974200	4979200	God of War, the collection that's going to be coming out later this fall,
4979200	4982200	is actually going to also include the God of War 3 demo.
4982200	4985200	That makes perfect sense. You're buying the first two games again.
4985200	4987200	Let's check out the demo.
4987200	4991200	Sweep the pot a little bit for the people who already own God of War 1 and 2.
4991200	4997200	Exactly. I think you definitely owe it to yourself to play these games if you haven't yet.
4997200	5000200	That would be worth checking out, I think.
5000200	5003200	And finally, something for free.
5003200	5009200	Yes, if you have LittleBigPlanet, you will be able to soon pick up Viking costumes for your Sackboy.
5009200	5012200	These will be coming soon.
5012200	5017200	They've actually got a website that you need to go to to go through this.
5017200	5023200	It's Family Zone, which is a cross promotion with Sony Pictures.
5023200	5030200	You're going to be able to go to the website.
5030200	5032200	They actually have a link here.
5032200	5039200	Actually, the PlayStation site. US.PlayStation.com slash Sony Wonder Games.
5039200	5046200	And then you just go there. There's a button to redeem a code and you can get the free Viking costumes.
5046200	5050200	So it's not something you can just go on PlayStation Network and download, unfortunately.
5050200	5052200	No, that's stupid.
5052200	5054200	Whatever. Cross promotion, I guess.
5054200	5060200	Well, as Loki spoiled earlier in the show, there is a little bit of crossover going on between Ninja Gaiden and Dynasty Warriors.
5060200	5065200	And that's, of course, because of the Tecmo Koei merger that happened not that long ago.
5065200	5071200	Ryu Hayabusa is actually going to be an unlockable character in Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.
5071200	5073200	But that's not where the love stops.
5073200	5080200	Apparently, there's going to be unlockable Zhao Yun and Song Shang Xiang costumes in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
5080200	5083200	Yes, I'm sure I completely butchered those names. Deal with it.
5083200	5088200	So there's going to be a lot of crossover happening there, I'm sure to no one's surprise.
5088200	5095200	Blur was a racing game I was very much looking forward to this year, and I will just have to look forward to it a little longer.
5095200	5102200	It has been delayed to 2010 with a host of quite a few other games that have been delayed to 2010, which is now looking pretty full.
5102200	5107200	The delay happened because, according to Activision CEO Mike Griffith, they need to, quote,
5107200	5115200	fully optimize the vision Bazaar set out to create for Blur, including a distinctive and groundbreaking multiplayer mode that will appeal to a broad audience.
5115200	5119200	I take that to mean multiplayer was fucked and they needed to fix it.
5119200	5127200	I also take that as we're not going to compete with ourselves and decide to push Blur back a little longer since they're the ones releasing Modern Warfare 2,
5127200	5130200	and it's supposed to be coming out around the same time within a week.
5130200	5131200	That makes sense.
5131200	5136200	But, well, you know, if they did it for that reason, then F them.
5136200	5141200	But if they did it for the reason that they needed to go back and make multiplayer better, that's cool.
5141200	5145200	Because, you know, I'm sure if it came out and the multiplayer was screwed up,
5145200	5150200	bitching upon bitching on the blogs about how borked multiplayer is and we need to patch immediately, etc.
5150200	5153200	So, you know, if it's truly to fix multiplayer, then fine.
5153200	5159200	I've never remembered the multiplayer in Project Gotham being too bad, so I can't imagine that that would be really an issue.
5159200	5165200	But, hey, giving them the extra time, whether it be for, you know, competing with Modern Warfare 2,
5165200	5171200	or whether it be actually the multiplayer being a little rough around the edges.
5171200	5173200	Is it really the same audience, though?
5173200	5174200	It doesn't matter.
5174200	5178200	All the games are moving away from, you know, except for, you know, like Assassin's Creed.
5178200	5180200	They're like, eh, fuck it, we're going to go against them.
5180200	5182200	I think there's room for more than one.
5182200	5183200	Exactly. I think so, too.
5183200	5190200	But a lot of games are kind of like, you know, there's going to be a lot of people buying, you know, Modern Warfare 2.
5190200	5193200	Let's move our game a little away from it.
5193200	5195200	Like Smackdown vs Raw 2010.
5195200	5199200	Normally a title comes out in the middle of November, now coming out in the middle of October.
5199200	5205200	Which is a little bit of a surprise, but not with Modern Warfare 2 being there.
5205200	5207200	Well, moving on to another story.
5207200	5212200	You know, there were those screenshots that came out of a Final Fantasy project that Grin Studios was working on.
5212200	5219200	Apparently this game was assumed to be cancelled because Grin Studio went under, but apparently not.
5219200	5223200	It's coming from some rumblings sources, of course, that are not named.
5223200	5224200	Close to both companies.
5224200	5229200	Apparently the game is still under development, just not by Grin.
5229200	5232200	So it'll be interesting to see what becomes of that project.
5232200	5238200	But if you see a very different looking Final Fantasy game announced next year at, I don't know, E3 maybe.
5238200	5240200	That's probably what this ended up being.
5240200	5244200	One more story I'm sure tons of our listeners are interested in.
5244200	5252200	Cenet Twilight will be coming out on the Wii this autumn and, oddly enough, on the DS in 2010.
5252200	5256200	I thought that the whole point behind Cenet was that you actually saw clips of the movie in the game.
5256200	5262200	But yes, of course, with the whole New Moon franchise coming out as well, or I mean the movie as well as the old Twilight movie.
5262200	5268200	Just like they've done for Harry Potter and Friends and all these other things, there's going to be a Cenet game on the Wii.
5268200	5273200	I could give a shit, but I'm sure there's some Twilight tards out there that'll love it.
5273200	5275200	And who's cashing in on this?
5275200	5277200	Konami.
5277200	5278200	Are they the ones behind it?
5278200	5279200	Go Konami.
5279200	5281200	Oh boy.
5281200	5285200	God forbid we get a good music game from them, but Cenet, Twilight.
5285200	5287200	But we get sparkling vampires.
5287200	5289200	Hey, they go where the money is.
5289200	5293200	Not a fan. I'm sorry to be a hater. I have some friends that are into Twilight, but I just don't get it.
5293200	5297200	But honestly, it's coming out before the second movie, okay?
5297200	5301200	And granted, I'm sure people that are playing this game probably read the books.
5301200	5305200	Death Wishing in our chat room is making his thoughts very strong.
5305200	5309200	He says, kill the devs, kill them all, fucking skull fuck them.
5309200	5312200	That might be a little bit harsh. I mean, skull fucking? Come on, that's pretty harsh.
5312200	5320200	I'm just saying, how much trivia can there be for Twilight movies if there's one Twilight movie out already?
5320200	5325200	And yes, this game is slated right now I think for...
5325200	5327200	I want to say I thought it was October.
5327200	5329200	Probably around the release of New Moon.
5329200	5332200	It's supposed to be coming out until after it, so either it's going to spoil the...
5332200	5336200	Nah, it's really going to spoil the plot of the movie, because there really is no plot to the movie.
5336200	5339200	Well, and the books have been out. You know, you can go read the book, I'm sure.
5339200	5341200	I don't know, it's just crap.
5341200	5344200	Wait, hold on. I've decided this story has taken up way too much time on our show.
5344200	5346200	Sorry, sorry.
5346200	5348200	Although I do want to read this witty comment from chat.
5348200	5351200	Tigerclaw in chat says, we need a Cenet OLR.
5351200	5353200	Oh wait, no video, I guess you could call it.
5353200	5355200	Hear it, OLR.
5355200	5357200	Would anyone actually play that? I don't know.
5357200	5359200	No.
5359200	5362200	Some of the listeners know the trivia of the show better than I do.
5362200	5365200	Like, I've got this best of I've got to do, you know, next week.
5365200	5370200	You know, that we're going to be taking some parts of the show and then kind of doing some new stuff with it as well.
5370200	5373200	You know where I'm going to find out where all the good bits are?
5373200	5378200	Our Wikipedia. The OLR Wikipedia references what episode number some of the funniest stuff was in.
5378200	5383200	Like, what episode the what-they-play.com snap was in and some of these other things I'm going to kind of pull and put in there.
5383200	5386200	It's all in there, which is nice.
5386200	5389200	Anyhow, let's get to some Twitter topics tonight.
5389200	5392200	I forgot to get the theme music for Twitter topics.
5392200	5395200	I'm just so broken tonight.
5395200	5397200	I can't multitask.
5397200	5399200	Jamie and I here is ruining everything.
5401200	5403200	Hold on. I'm getting it.
5403200	5405200	Where is it?
5405200	5407200	Ah, forget it.
5407200	5412200	I'm not going to do theme music tonight. Let's just get to the Twitter topics because I don't want a dead air here.
5412200	5416200	Ah, let's see. Going to the Twitter topics.
5416200	5420200	Wow, we got quite a few tonight.
5420200	5423200	Ray Iannami says, here's a story that people might actually care about.
5423200	5427200	Mushi Misama Futari for 360 is going to be region-free.
5427200	5430200	A region-free 360 game.
5430200	5432200	They call it a bullet hell shooter.
5432200	5436200	He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about a shooting Xbox 360 game.
5436200	5438200	No screenshots from the gamers.
5438200	5440200	There's one up here in the upper right-hand corner.
5440200	5442200	It's going to be region-free.
5442200	5446200	So this game comes out in Japan, but you would actually be able to import it here in America and play it.
5446200	5450200	That's kind of cool because a lot of the 360 games that come out over there are not region-free.
5450200	5452200	Especially in Japan, man.
5452200	5455200	They're just like, fuck you guys. You ain't going to import this shit.
5455200	5458200	And Ray's in chat right now and says it is an existing arcade game.
5458200	5461200	We saw a clip of this on an earlier show because I'm looking at the screenshot now.
5461200	5463200	Yeah, it does look familiar.
5463200	5465200	And that's the thing. It sucks too because of my arcade cabinet.
5465200	5468200	I could play vertical games, but it's such a fucking pain in the ass to do it.
5468200	5472200	You have to rotate the monitor and all that shit, and I just don't want to do that.
5472200	5479200	TigerClaw305 on Twitter wants us to mention the Florida fugitive was apprehended after attempting to steal DS games.
5479200	5486200	He links us to an article on Joystiq where apparently, and that's with a Q, says apparently this guy was out there trying to steal DS games.
5486200	5494200	It was a loss prevention specialist got to stop this shoplifter.
5494200	5496200	The fugitive's name was Daniel Larson.
5496200	5504200	He was already wanted for violating probation, and apparently he shoplifted $120 worth of Nintendo DS titles from the local Walmart,
5504200	5508200	but a loss prevention officer actually caught him and stopped it.
5508200	5514200	Joystiq, the blog, goes on to joke, don't tell them about my insatiable addiction for Imagine Babies games.
5514200	5519200	I know. You could say I planned on pawning them to buy heroin. Please come on, man. This would ruin me.
5519200	5522200	You know, I think it's one of those things where I don't think that has anything to do with gaming at all.
5522200	5525200	Thieves are thieves and will steal whatever to sell.
5525200	5529200	And why are they still de- I mean, I understand that they're small, but I mean, they're not worth much.
5529200	5532200	Isn't that hard to steal from Walmart, too, because aren't they all in the glass case?
5532200	5537200	I guess not all of them. If they're on sale, or like the really cheapy ones, those aren't in the glass case, are they?
5537200	5542200	I guess because they're smaller, but I mean, I don't know.
5542200	5546200	Alright, I'm not going to be able to read all the tweets tonight, but let me get to a few others here.
5546200	5552200	Ryan Belknap on Twitter wants to know, what game coming out this fall are you looking forward to buying?
5552200	5556200	For me, it would be Dragon Age and Press Your Luck. Games this fall.
5556200	5559200	DJ Hero and Borderlands.
5559200	5566200	Oh, and of course, I mean, because it's more of a download title, but Grand Theft Auto, The Ballad of Gay Tony.
5566200	5571200	Honestly, most everything I was looking forward to got pushed back to 2010. Blur, White Knight Chronicles.
5571200	5577200	But one game that's still coming out that I am looking forward to a little bit, there was one.
5577200	5579200	I just had it, and now I just get my memory.
5579200	5581200	New Super Mario Brothers?
5581200	5583200	Dang it, no, not really interested in that one.
5583200	5584200	What kind of a game was it?
5584200	5585200	I don't remember.
5585200	5587200	Lego Rock Band?
5587200	5590200	Eh, not really. I'll check out the Rock Band Beatles.
5590200	5591200	Anti Hero?
5591200	5593200	No, that already came out. I don't know if there is a lot.
5593200	5594200	The new Tony Hawk game?
5594200	5595200	No, I don't care about that.
5595200	5596200	DJ Hero, that's what I want.
5596200	5597200	I just said DJ Hero.
5597200	5599200	I know you did, but I want that too.
5599200	5607200	Alright, obviously I'm not looking forward to it that much, if I can't even remember what it is two seconds later.
5607200	5610200	Either that or I'm getting short-term memory loss early.
5610200	5615200	Let's see, moving on.
5615200	5617200	One other Twitter here from ActDeft.
5617200	5620200	Here's a Twitter topic you would like, and links us to a story here.
5620200	5622200	Oh yeah, I heard about this.
5622200	5623200	I don't think this is in our show role either.
5623200	5624200	This just came up today.
5624200	5630200	He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about, apparently there's a crash screen in Need for Speed Shift,
5630200	5633200	that when you go into the PlayStation Store, it crashes.
5633200	5639200	Here's the funny thing, it's on the 360, with the PlayStation Store logo showing up and everything.
5639200	5644200	I don't know what the hell happened or what you do to get this, but apparently this is a really bad bug.
5644200	5649200	Let's see, when navigating menus today, when connected to Xbox Live, the game suddenly crashed again.
5649200	5653200	When my rage subsided and I got a better look at the screen, I was pretty shocked at what I saw.
5653200	5658200	Was my Xbox 360 version of Need for Speed Shift really trying to access the PlayStation Store?
5658200	5660200	Microsoft's not going to be happy about this at all.
5660200	5664200	So apparently there is a bug in the game where it tries to access the PlayStation Store.
5664200	5665200	Whoops!
5665200	5667200	There's a little screenshot and everything.
5667200	5673200	That's coming off Kotaku, but I think it's making the rounds around all the gaming blogs, I'm sure.
5673200	5675200	So there you go, there are your Twitter topics for tonight.
5675200	5677200	We always open it up before our live shows.
5677200	5680200	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
5680200	5684200	We always let you know when the new podcasts are up, because it can be a little spotty sometimes, I apologize.
5684200	5688200	And whenever fun stuff is going on here at OLR headquarters.
5688200	5692200	At least it wasn't Need for Speed Nitro on the Wii, because then you can't patch that shit.
5692200	5696200	That's true, they'll probably patch us on the 360, but that's still gotta be embarrassing.
5696200	5700200	Alright, let's get back into some long discussion news, including something that's very interesting.
5700200	5712200	Yes, well if you felt left out on the PSP that you couldn't join home, you soon will be getting your own kind of home-like service in the form of PlayStation Room.
5712200	5717200	Interesting enough, the logo for PlayStation Room is R Infinity M.
5717200	5732200	You may remember way back in the day when there was a rumor, according to a trademark, that the PlayStation DualShock 3 or 6-axis was going to be, well, Wii called the Poohs, because it was P Infinity S.
5732200	5738200	See, I did not remember this until you said like that, you joked that it was Poohs.
5738200	5740200	We did joke about this on the show a while ago.
5740200	5748200	So I'm thinking, maybe that wasn't for the controller, maybe it was like PlayStation Infinity or some crap like that, and it was actually this.
5748200	5752200	Which makes sense, because now the logo kind of looks exactly like it.
5752200	5759200	But anyways, so the PlayStation Room is actually going to be added in with an upcoming PSP firmware.
5759200	5773200	And you'll launch it straight from the cross-media bar, just like home, and it'll allow you to create a 3D avatar and kind of my room spaces, along with a blog, album, and group gatherings, chat support, that kind of stuff.
5773200	5789200	So, it's like home with a big anime flair to it, and really scaled down. So, neat, I guess.
5789200	5794200	Have they really said what the hell you're going to be able to do with it, or are we only seeing these screenshots of these chibi characters?
5794200	5801200	Which, by the way, it should be said, even though you're saying it's kind of like home, it doesn't really, I mean, it looks like a very, very, very much spin-off.
5801200	5805200	It's not your same characters, it's not that same 3D environment, it's like...
5805200	5809200	It looks like home, like, you know, the Disney's, was it, um...
5809200	5812200	Looks like some of the chat rooms I would see on Prodigy back in the day.
5812200	5826200	Like the Channel D stuff, or, I forget what they call it, on, um, DGamer, that's what it was, on the Disney's DS tiles. It's very similar to Xbox Live. It's not, but it's a similar type of service.
5826200	5833200	Funny enough, Ray Ayanami in our chat room says, wasn't that like three years ago that that joke happened? He says, wait, I've been listening to this trainwreck for three years now?
5833200	5836200	I mean, maybe it was a long, I don't think it was quite three years ago.
5836200	5838200	It was before the PlayStation 3 came out.
5838200	5839200	Oh, wow.
5839200	5842200	Because, remember, we were, like, were they going to call the controller?
5842200	5844200	Oh, that's right.
5844200	5851200	Okay, well, maybe this has been in development that long. Maybe this was originally conceived for the PlayStation 3. Who knows?
5851200	5859200	Or maybe they were like, hey, you know, that trademark looks kind of cool. Let's just do that with an infinity symbol, because, you know, we're different like that.
5859200	5870200	But what has PlayStation Home really done for PlayStation? Even though I got a plug that we do have a club on PlayStation Home, and there's got to be a good handful of people in it now. I've been getting slow requests for invites.
5870200	5879200	I don't know. Nothing. I can't imagine this would be too popular. I mean, yay, you're going to be able to run around in Avatar and stuff, but...
5879200	5885200	I did check out this week. I did sign into Home. I don't know. Home's one of those things, like, I'll just kind of poke around in if I'm really bored.
5885200	5892200	I did check out the new SingStar space in Home, and it's a little ridiculous. There's not a lot. It looks, it's not, it's, graphically, it looks pretty cool.
5892200	5898200	It looks like a nightclub, and it's laid out like a nightclub, and, like, graphically, it's kind of cool, but you log in there, there's really not a lot to do.
5898200	5904200	You do all the different dances on the dance floor, and you get, like, three shirts. That's it.
5904200	5909200	You just, I just quickly go through the character and do all three, all, like, ten dances or whatever, and you get three shirts.
5909200	5913200	And then you get shirts to pimp out their products. Awesome. Yeah. Exactly. That's it.
5913200	5919200	Yeah, that's... I gotta say, though, it was nice to look at for a few minutes. I was like, oh, hey, they put a little work into this.
5919200	5924200	This actually kind of looks like a nightclub, and I like how when you dance, the little spotlight on the floor is different colors, and it's all high def.
5924200	5933200	Looks cool. Okay, done now. Not sure exactly what I gained out of this, except, I guess, maybe knowledge of the SingStar product. I don't know.
5933200	5941200	They have a little video wall that'll circle through different music videos that are in the game, and you can actually pick which video you want to come up next on the wall.
5941200	5949200	But here's the catch. It's a 30-second clip of videos. It's not even, like, the full, like, you can't touch this or baby one more time.
5949200	5953200	You just need 30 seconds of it, not the whole clip.
5953200	5958200	That's true. J. Dizzle in chat reminds us, home give us hamsters versus humans dance-offs. How could I forget?
5958200	5965200	And now there's a whole nightclub you can do it in in the SingStar space, so how could I forget?
5965200	5973200	Moving on, another news this week about things online. China has had their access to World of Warcraft restored.
5973200	5983200	These servers are now back online. You may have heard a few months ago that the World of Warcraft servers were going dark because the game was transitioning from a company called The Nine to Netease.
5983200	5997200	World of Warcraft was down, by the way, for three and a half months. The transfer is all done now. Chinese MMO players can now get back on to World of Warcraft, which might not be the biggest game in China, but I guess it does definitely have their following over there.
5997200	6002200	I'm sure that took a big chunk out of their economy since, you know, all the gold farming and everything.
6002200	6019200	Well, Netease, well no, they'd log into the American servers to do that. It's not mixed like Final Fantasy XI is. China has their own servers, because remember they don't have undead, they have the Forsaken, which is just undead with more skin or whatever.
6019200	6037200	But anyhow, here's the other thing I want to point out. Apparently, the servers are, to give you an idea how many people are playing, the servers are expensive to maintain. They have to pay a million of their Chinese dollars a day, which boils down to about $146,000 a day to keep the servers running.
6037200	6051200	But, you know, China's a pretty big country and the game obviously is doing very well there. But then I was thinking, oh my god, three and a half months this game was down. Can you imagine what would happen if World of Warcraft, and I open this question up to chat as well,
6051200	6068200	what would happen if World of Warcraft shut down? Just all of a sudden, out of the blue, World of Warcraft shuts down for three months in America. It would rain cats and dogs. With no rhyme or reason, just blizzard, the server facility just goes kaput, I don't know what happens.
6068200	6085200	You know, nobody gets charged for it or anything, nothing malicious happens, but just World of Warcraft gets revoked for all the 11 million players or whatever for three and a half months. What would happen? The internet would be in a shitstorm. It would be just like, fucking bitch, you know, just complaining like you would not believe.
6085200	6099200	Dark Tetsuya says divorce rates go down. ActDeaf says I already said it, massive tantrums. Oh yes, there would be many a blog. Many an angry blog. People threatening to quit and never return, right?
6099200	6100200	Go to Aeon.
6100200	6116200	Ray Ayanami says whatever, I'm gonna keep on playing not MMOs. Rama says if World of Warcraft shuts down for three months, people would return to real life and shit would get done. J Dizzle says mom, bathroom.
6116200	6125200	Deathwishing says remember that episode of Robot Chicken where a virus deletes all the prawn? Could you imagine that? A computer virus that just targets World of Warcraft?
6125200	6146200	Let me go this way. If there was ever a virus out there conceivable to actually delete all the prawn on the internet at one time, who would do that? First off, who would do that? Second off, you know how fast prawn gets on the internet? It wouldn't matter. The prawn would be back up to the levels it is now in like a day.
6146200	6156200	It would just be like, porn back! Was it gone? Didn't even realize it. All new porn, sweet.
6156200	6162200	I just, do you think there would be, the sad thing is, I think for a lot of people...
6162200	6165200	They would cover this on CNN.
6165200	6172200	It would be in the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. It really would. World of Warcraft went down today and...
6172200	6176200	What about like Twitter? Like going down for like three months? Or like Facebook?
6176200	6179200	Oh fuck Twitter. I'm so over Twitter.
6179200	6188200	Friendster, remember Friendster? Friendster was what we had before Myspace, before Facebook. Apparently it's still popular in Asia, but Friendster is what we used to have.
6188200	6202200	And when that went down, people went somewhere else. But Friendster was not quite as integrated into culture as I think Facebook has become. You know, people's mothers didn't have a Friendster account. Just college kids had it.
6202200	6208200	People's mothers have Facebooks. What would happen if Facebook went down for three months?
6208200	6211200	People would go back to Myspace, maybe.
6211200	6217200	I think a lot of people would. Let's see, Baconbit says, if WoW was shut down for three months, the internet speeds would go faster.
6217200	6220200	Nice. Very true.
6220200	6226200	Deathwishing says kids would run out in the streets going, God dammit, my raid was halfway done. I lost my epics.
6226200	6232200	So a lot of people seem to speculate people would just go somewhere else.
6232200	6243200	I think that, you know, as much of fandom as World of Warcraft gets, people are fickle. If it goes away for a while, they'll leave. Then when it comes back, they'll come right back.
6243200	6251200	But, you know, it's just they need to be doing something. And if they're going to be MMO players, they're going to go play another MMO or play something else.
6251200	6256200	They're not just going to go outside and go, oh my God, there's a world out here. What have I done with my life?
6256200	6261200	They're going to go, hey, World of Warcraft is back. Oh shit. Back right into their seat.
6261200	6267200	Tigerclaw in chat says the worst case scenario would be if the internet were shut down for three months, then there would be utter chaos.
6267200	6273200	You know, what's interesting about that, though, is that the entire internet went down for three months. That's almost another whole nother thing.
6273200	6279200	Because you have to remember the internet, wasn't it originally created as like a government thing for government agencies to communicate?
6279200	6288200	I mean, you have so many businesses out there. I mean, think about the online banking that goes on and, you know, just all of the online things that so many companies that do their business online.
6288200	6295200	Yeah, the internet going down completely would be pretty chaotic. I would be a mess.
6295200	6300200	Well, there's a lot of stuff also connected with the internet, like banking, ATMs.
6300200	6302200	That's pretty big.
6302200	6303200	Yeah.
6303200	6309200	It might all be secure, but imagine if it was suddenly inaccessible. I mean, I guess that's why we still have tellers working at banks.
6309200	6314200	I've had my bank's infrastructure go down for a day. It was a pain in the ass.
6314200	6319200	Marissa Congusto in the chat says I couldn't do my job without the internet. There's a lot of people in that situation.
6319200	6328200	You know, like, you know, I work for a big call center. I think I've mentioned that before. I'm a trainer for a big call center. We actually have reps in other offices that take phone calls from their homes.
6328200	6335200	It's like a work at home program. And I believe they use the internet to do all that. When the internet goes down, those reps can't work.
6335200	6340200	There's a lot of people that really rely on the internet to do their jobs. It's pretty crazy.
6340200	6350200	So it would be a mess, that's for sure. But there was a day without internet, believe it or not. I don't know if you kids are old enough to remember, but there was a day without internet.
6350200	6355200	Back in my day, we had dial-up and BBSs. Those are the days. Trade Wars 2002 for life.
6355200	6357200	I remember BBSs.
6357200	6359200	Legend of the Red Dragon, bitches.
6359200	6361200	Wasn't that long ago, I don't think.
6361200	6364200	The pit for the win.
6364200	6366200	Alright, let's move on.
6366200	6373200	And you know what? We downloaded porn on 28 modems off of BBSs, because that's the way it was.
6373200	6381200	I remember when porn would be separated into VGA and Super VGA.
6381200	6383200	Didn't they call it XGA back then, I think?
6383200	6385200	Alright, forget it. Let's move on.
6385200	6387200	EGA.
6387200	6397200	Hooray for CGA porn. That's like those old strip poker games from the Apple IIe. Especially working with arcade monitors and stuff like that.
6397200	6402200	Yeah, arcade monitors, most of them out there, CGA is what they consider them because it's ultra low resolution.
6402200	6408200	And VGA monitors, 640x480. And that's really good for arcade stuff.
6408200	6410200	I digress.
6410200	6416200	I had a 300 baud modem on my Commodore 64 that plugged into the cartridge port in the back. It was epic. Epic.
6416200	6420200	I think the slowest modem I had was a 2400, I think.
6420200	6426200	But yeah, switching that to like 56k, oh my god, we're blazing speeds.
6426200	6433200	Dude, going onto BBSs on a 300 baud modem, it was like watching print be typed on the screen.
6433200	6435200	It was just insane.
6435200	6439200	Just to reminisce for a bit here, I'm sorry.
6439200	6445200	But there used to be a BBS here in Sacramento, and I think it was called the Open Forum or Open Mind or something like that.
6445200	6449200	All it was was really a bunch of forums.
6449200	6455200	And this was back when 2400, I think 14.4 was the speed everybody had at that point. It was 14.4k.
6455200	6458200	And really all it was was just message forums.
6458200	6461200	And it was just a cool place to just kind of meet people.
6461200	6465200	And actually, some of the greatest discussions I ever read online were on that site.
6465200	6467200	And it was all local people too.
6467200	6469200	Some days I miss the days of BBSs.
6469200	6471200	CCN, remember that magazine, California Computer News?
6471200	6473200	I do! Aren't they still around?
6473200	6475200	They used to have, I don't know, but they used to have...
6475200	6477200	They used to have the BBS listings in the back!
6477200	6478200	Exactly!
6478200	6479200	I do remember that.
6479200	6486200	And there was one BBS that was on there that you could sign into that BBS and actually get internet access for like an hour a day or something like that.
6486200	6487200	Oh my god.
6487200	6488200	It was fucking awesome.
6488200	6489200	Oh my god.
6489200	6492200	I remember I got banned from a BBS once because I pissed off the Sisop.
6492200	6493200	That was fun.
6493200	6495200	I got tied up in some drama.
6495200	6496200	I don't even remember.
6496200	6498200	Now I'm looking back on it going, this is all retarded.
6498200	6502200	But, you know, I was a dumb kid. What can I say?
6502200	6503200	Anyhow.
6503200	6504200	Alright.
6504200	6506200	Deathwishing says, LOL dial up porn.
6506200	6508200	It would be like, okay, gonna eat dinner, come back.
6508200	6510200	Damn, her tits loaded up yet?
6510200	6517200	No, seriously, it was sad because, you know, back in the day, it used to take an hour to download a mag, okay?
6517200	6518200	An hour to download.
6518200	6519200	It did.
6519200	6521200	I remember downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo.
6521200	6522200	Shareware.
6522200	6523200	Epic.
6523200	6524200	Downloading shareware.
6524200	6525200	Yes.
6525200	6528200	And, I mean, it would take an hour to download that stuff.
6528200	6532200	And, yes, if you got a porn file that was like, and this is like an image.
6532200	6533200	A GIF image.
6533200	6535200	Because JPEGs weren't really red.
6535200	6536200	Weren't out yet.
6536200	6537200	GIFs were out.
6537200	6538200	GIFs was where it was at.
6538200	6539200	Yeah.
6539200	6543200	It took like 45 minutes for that shit to download.
6543200	6547200	And, you better hope that's a good picture because you don't know what it looks like because it's just a text file.
6547200	6555200	You're just like, big boobs, sweet.
6555200	6562200	Womanhorse.gif? Wow, what could this be? Oh my god.
6562200	6564200	The stories I will tell my children.
6564200	6575200	I remember my friend had to show every kid in the neighborhood when he got the picture of the zebra fucking the woman that he found on some BBS that he got on his 2400 baud modem.
6575200	6580200	And all the kids were coming over to look at this still picture on a computer screen.
6580200	6587200	It was like Playboy, but just different. For nerds. Anyhow.
6587200	6597200	So, Summer of Arcade. You know, Microsoft's kind of big push for some good Xbox Live Arcade games coming out of course in the summer.
6597200	6603200	They had a 200% growth over last year's sales.
6603200	6611200	And this is mostly in part to, actually a good selection of games coming out, including Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
6611200	6615200	You know, even Battlefield 1943.
6615200	6617200	Lots of good stuff.
6617200	6622200	And even Shadow Complex, their kind of Metroidvania game.
6622200	6624200	Trials HD.
6624200	6634200	And basically seeing a lot of different growth in different areas, including the free entertainment department, 1 vs. 100, although not really part of the Summer of Arcade stuff.
6634200	6641200	Doing pretty well with over 3 million downloads during a 13 week period.
6641200	6649200	And also 1 vs. 100 being within the top 10 downloads of Xbox Live history.
6649200	6651200	So that's pretty cool.
6651200	6655200	And, I don't know. It's not really a surprise that it's doing well.
6655200	6659200	I mean, they had a good selection of games, so.
6659200	6661200	Wonder what next year will be like.
6661200	6667200	It's interesting though that the Summer of Arcade kind of helped the sales kind of grow.
6667200	6669200	Yeah, definitely.
6669200	6681200	So, alright. Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a story about IGN and an old website that we love here at Orange Lawns Radio, WhatTheyPlay.com.
6681200	6685200	If you've been a long time fan of Orange Lawns Radio, you'll know why this is funny.
6685200	6688200	If not, listen to the best of next week, because that clip is going to come back.
6688200	6695200	But IGN, of course, the big, huge website that's kind of like GameSpot or, you know, all those, you know, 1UP or whatever.
6695200	6698200	They actually purchased WhatTheyPlay.com.
6698200	6707200	WhatTheyPlay.com is a site that is basically, you know, it's kind of catered towards families and kind of the concerned parent about what kids are into in video gaming.
6707200	6711200	I don't know why IGN bought this, but that's what they wanted.
6711200	6720200	I guess there was a pretty big audience there, and maybe IGN kind of feels that it's a new audience that ad buyers will be interested in buying.
6720200	6724200	I don't know. They buy a lot of different websites.
6724200	6728200	But I don't see how much it was sold for. That's the part I want to see.
6728200	6731200	Two dollars.
6731200	6737200	No, apparently, in all dear fun, even though we kind of razzed the website, it wasn't really the website we made fun of in that episode.
6737200	6743200	It was just the poll and the results of the poll that was like, what do you find most offensive in a game?
6743200	6747200	And it was like, you know, gay kissing was more offensive than disembodied heads and all this stuff.
6747200	6749200	It was just ridiculous.
6749200	6751200	So we'll talk more about that a little later on.
6751200	6753200	But interesting, of course, that that kind of comes full circle.
6753200	6757200	Now IGN has bought it to conduct all the polls they want on that audience.
6757200	6759200	That happened earlier this week.
6759200	6772200	You may remember us reporting on a game announced at E3, Joyride, which is basically a game that's kind of debuting the free-to-play model on the Xbox Live service.
6772200	6776200	And Joyride is going to be kind of an Avatar-infused kart racing game.
6776200	6781200	And of course, they're going to have a little bit of an MMO twist to it as well.
6781200	6784200	They're doing some stuff too, I remember, where you can actually...
6784200	6797200	I guess it would be a little bit similar to, like, Noby Noby Boy and Battlefield 1943, where if you play the game enough that you'll actually, as a whole, unlock new levels, which is kind of cool.
6797200	6804200	And then, of course, if you want to customize your karts and whatnot, you have to pay for that, because that's what free-to-play means.
6804200	6806200	You have to pay for your premiums.
6806200	6810200	And it will be a free download coming this holiday.
6810200	6823200	And apparently, the content to buy will be available around that time as well, also including Avatar costumes and new tracks and karts.
6823200	6829200	So, what do you think about this whole new model? Is it kind of the future of Xbox Live Arcade, or what?
6829200	6836200	Well, it allows you to try out the game, and if you don't want to buy all this extra content, you don't have to, which is kind of cool.
6836200	6848200	And I think that's a lot better than, say, buying a game, or trying a demo that maybe doesn't really give you a good idea of the game, and wasting your money on a game that you end up not liking.
6848200	6856200	And hell, it can't be any worse than Yaris.
6856200	6859200	I suppose that's true.
6859200	6866200	So, as long as it's better than Yaris, I think it'll be okay.
6866200	6870200	All right, well, we're going to go ahead and open up ye old mailbag every week.
6870200	6878200	You guys send your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and we pick some of our favorites and read them right here on the air for you guys.
6878200	6884200	Unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here right now. She'll be back a little later, hopefully, before we finish up.
6884200	6894200	So I'm going to open up the mailbag right now, but I was a slacker and didn't go into it before we started this segment, because I was getting text messages on my phone.
6894200	6897200	I was answering those.
6897200	6903200	We have a lot of emails tonight. I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through all of these, but I'll try and get through as many of them as I can.
6903200	6907200	If you didn't get through tonight, I'm sorry. Try again next time.
6907200	6910200	Let's go to an email from Shook.
6910200	6911200	Starts us off tonight.
6911200	6915200	Hello, to kick off this email, I'd like to say that I am at peace with my dad.
6915200	6918200	Oh, yes, this is the emailer that was having problems with his dad. Remember that?
6918200	6921200	The dad didn't want him playing Final Fantasy X.
6921200	6925200	I talked to him about the Final Fantasy X thing, and he seemed willing when he listened to me.
6925200	6928200	I got him to try the game, and he loves it.
6928200	6929200	No more of that.
6929200	6932200	So a round of applause for the douchebag father coming around.
6932200	6934200	You did the rational thing.
6934200	6937200	You've undouched yourself. Congratulations. You did the right thing.
6937200	6939200	No more hazing for you.
6939200	6941200	So no more of that. I agree.
6941200	6942200	Now on to my main story.
6942200	6945200	The other day I had gym class, and we played football.
6945200	6950200	When a kid in my class saw the football laying there, he ran over and teabagged the ball a couple of times.
6950200	6952200	Let that sink in.
6952200	6956200	My gym coach grabs the kid by his neck, says,
6956200	6959200	Get the hell inside, and pushes the kid towards the front door.
6959200	6962200	It just goes to show how far teabagging has gone in our culture.
6962200	6966200	The kid was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, according to the superintendent.
6966200	6969200	My opinion? What the hell? This is the shit that gives gaming a bad name.
6969200	6970200	I close with that.
6970200	6972200	P.S. Pardon my French.
6972200	6975200	Forever and always. Not like anyone says to themselves anyway.
6975200	6977200	Yours truly, Shook.
6977200	6980200	I don't know if gaming is to blame for teabagging.
6980200	6982200	I mean, I would think maybe, I don't know, like,
6982200	6985200	gay culture in the 70s might be where teabagging originated.
6985200	6987200	I'm not exactly quite sure.
6987200	6990200	But, um, obviously the kid...
6990200	6992200	I don't know.
6992200	6995200	Y'all are teenagers, and hormonal, and all that stuff.
6995200	6999200	So, obviously the kid just doesn't know what's appropriate and what's not.
6999200	7002200	So, I don't think it has anything to do with gaming.
7002200	7005200	So, I like this.
7005200	7006200	Marissa in chat says,
7006200	7007200	One day I want to hear Rob go,
7007200	7009200	We got a lot of emails tonight, sorry guys,
7009200	7012200	I'm only going to get through as many as I feel like, so suck it.
7012200	7014200	Yeah, I guess you could say that too.
7014200	7019200	Um, this next email comes to us from AZHP.
7019200	7022200	Hey, OLR crew, I was listening to your last available podcast the other day,
7022200	7025200	and remember Rob saying something about a homosexual tambourine game.
7025200	7028200	I believe the game you're thinking of is
7028200	7030200	Minimoni Shikato Tambourine,
7030200	7033200	which I actually played when I went to Japan as well.
7033200	7036200	If you're not familiar with Minimoni, they're a branch of Morning Musume,
7036200	7039200	an extremely popular J-pop girl group with, get this,
7039200	7042200	23 girls, at least the last time I checked.
7042200	7044200	Minimoni is a subset of them,
7044200	7047200	four girls who are 15 to 16 and look 11 to 12,
7047200	7049200	and seeing things about telephones, rock, paper, scissors,
7049200	7054200	counting to 20 in the bathtub, in general being obnoxiously cute.
7054200	7056200	Itchy knees, unchy.
7056200	7060200	Therefore, you are most definitely correct in saying that the game you saw
7060200	7063200	slept with tambourine games of the same gender.
7063200	7066200	I don't know, it sounds like that game
7066200	7069200	sounds like it could go to jail for the things it's doing.
7069200	7071200	P.S., I recently got a new job,
7071200	7073200	by the way, I just want to say before I get into the P.S.,
7073200	7075200	I actually don't think it was the same game.
7075200	7077200	The one I saw, and this is how you could tell,
7077200	7079200	it was Samba de Amigo.
7079200	7081200	It was the exact same game as Samba de Amigo, basically,
7081200	7083200	except with a different character, not the little Samba dude,
7083200	7085200	and with a tambourine.
7085200	7088200	So if that's the game you're talking about, then it's the same game.
7088200	7090200	But I don't remember, like, a Morning Musume,
7090200	7094200	or even a Japanese pop 23 girl group being involved at all.
7094200	7097200	So, anyhow.
7097200	7100200	Let me read the P.S. here real quick.
7100200	7103200	I recently got a new job and have been listening to your podcast while at work.
7103200	7106200	I had to stop, though, because when you guys make terrible and awesome,
7106200	7109200	extremely inappropriate jokes, I can't help but burst out laughing.
7109200	7112200	Not conductive to keeping a low profile in a quiet office environment.
7112200	7115200	It's just a testament to your chemistry, I guess.
7115200	7117200	Oh, that's very kind, thank you very much.
7117200	7122200	He signs it, O.L.R.'s premier gold star recipient, A.Z.H.P.
7122200	7124200	That's right, he was a previous gold star.
7124200	7127200	That was another very worthy email there, so thank you very much.
7127200	7133200	Let's see, trying to get through some more emails here.
7133200	7141200	Let's see, this one comes to us from, they didn't sign it,
7141200	7144200	so I'm just going to say Sam is the person that sent this.
7144200	7147200	Hello, O.L.R. crew, I'm trying very hard to use the best grammar possible
7147200	7151200	so the grammar Nazi doesn't permabam me or, like, start yelling or whatever.
7151200	7152200	Well, you're lucky.
7152200	7154200	Tonight I'm reading them and I have terrible grammar, too,
7154200	7156200	so I'm not going to be too critical tonight.
7156200	7158200	But yeah, I'm Blade3.
7158200	7159200	Oh, I'm sorry, that's the name, Blade3.
7159200	7161200	I haven't emailed you guys since 2007.
7161200	7164200	Now I'm older and I slapped together a PSP website that has awesome functions
7164200	7166200	and I wanted to let you know that I put your feet on there
7166200	7169200	because everyone deserves to listen to the awesome Orange Lounge Radio.
7169200	7173200	Check it out at rmedia.webhop.net.
7173200	7175200	It will automatically route you if you are on a PSP
7175200	7177200	and if you have an iPhone it will route you to the iPhone site
7177200	7180200	and if you use a computer it will route you to the main site.
7180200	7183200	Congrats on many fantastic shows, keep up the fabulous work.
7183200	7187200	Wow, I just gave that dude free advertising for just kissing our ass in an email.
7187200	7190200	Sorry, I don't update our PSP site at all.
7190200	7193200	I'm glad someone's still developing some PSP.
7193200	7195200	It's too much work and I don't have the time to do it
7195200	7197200	and I just don't want to.
7197200	7199200	It's not that...
7199200	7201200	Yeah, it is because I don't want to.
7201200	7203200	You'd rather play video games?
7203200	7205200	I'd rather play video games, yeah, and it's just...
7205200	7206200	I don't know.
7206200	7207200	Next email.
7207200	7210200	Hey guys, JD here, long time listener, first time emailer.
7210200	7214200	Unfortunately I'm a listener from the UK so I can't really tune in live.
7214200	7216200	We do have listeners from the UK that tune in live,
7216200	7219200	but I understand, it's like 2 in the morning over there,
7219200	7221200	but those guys are just really hardcore.
7221200	7223200	Thanks for the email, anyway.
7223200	7226200	This is concerning something DarkSakra mentioned quite a while ago
7226200	7228200	when she heard the theme from Shaft in a Czech restaurant.
7228200	7230200	Remember this? She talked about this earlier.
7230200	7232200	Well, today in my college induction day,
7232200	7235200	my teacher was warning us about the dangers of leaving our phones on
7235200	7238200	and with perfect timing, his phone started ringing
7238200	7241200	and his ringtone was none other than the theme from Shaft.
7241200	7244200	Anywho, I must head off to bed now, so good night, OLR,
7244200	7246200	and Sky, you need to update the podcast on time.
7246200	7248200	Yes, I know, I'm sorry.
7248200	7252200	Bad host, bad panda, no cookie.
7252200	7255200	That email from JD reminding us of an old inside joke.
7255200	7257200	If I can find that clip, I'll have to put that in the best of two.
7257200	7259200	I just don't remember what episode that was in.
7259200	7263200	Just a couple more emails for you guys here and then I'll get to it.
7263200	7271200	Let's see, I'll get to probably just one more email here from Rob with Two Bees.
7271200	7273200	And he sent us quite a few emails this week.
7273200	7275200	I'm just going to pick a couple of these here.
7275200	7280200	Rob from Two Bees wanted to know if any of us were going to Disneyland from September 23rd to 27th.
7280200	7284200	Sadly, I went the week before and I'm going the week after.
7284200	7288200	I'm very sorry to say it, but we didn't make it to Disneyland the same week you were.
7288200	7289200	But I hope you had a ton of fun.
7289200	7292200	The good news is all the Halloween events started this weekend.
7292200	7297200	Also, send us a link to this interesting article on gamespolitik.com
7297200	7304200	about a study linking youth violence depression to peers, not video games.
7304200	7308200	Apparently, it says here, one, depression is a symptom.
7308200	7311200	It is pointing out that many of the youths surveyed have depression problems
7311200	7314200	to the point where it seems correlated to youth violence.
7314200	7317200	I'd say that the issue of depression is something that should be tackled all by itself.
7317200	7320200	Two, peer pressure is also the cause of good behavior.
7320200	7326200	It's also ubiquitous, so anything you try to link with peer pressure will seem correlated as well.
7326200	7329200	I find it interesting how game politics will suddenly credit bad science
7329200	7333200	just because it agrees with the general viewpoint of the editors and most of the readers.
7333200	7337200	I also like to qualify that these psychological studies are impossible to do scientifically,
7337200	7340200	but they still may have value to psychologists.
7340200	7343200	It adds a little postscript here that says,
7343200	7347200	to the study's credit, the name of the report admits to having many variables,
7347200	7350200	a multivariate analysis of youth violence and aggression,
7350200	7354200	the influence of family, peers, depression, and media violence.
7354200	7358200	I think we have a tendency when we see something that's kind of on our side
7358200	7360200	to rah, rah, rah around it a little bit.
7360200	7363200	And yeah, there might be a lot of variables in this study.
7363200	7368200	And I kind of agree with this whole notion that this is probably something that's way too hard to gauge.
7368200	7370200	Way too hard to gauge.
7370200	7379200	I think kids playing video games too much is usually a cause of depression,
7379200	7380200	not the other way around.
7380200	7384200	Or I should say cause from depression, not the other way around.
7384200	7387200	I don't think depression comes from playing too many video games.
7387200	7392200	I think kids who are depressed kind of drown their sorrows in video games.
7392200	7394200	Because I think what he's saying there about the whole, you know,
7394200	7396200	a lot of it has to do with peer pressure.
7396200	7400200	I think, you know, when kids don't want to go out and face the real world,
7400200	7403200	they kind of can lose themselves in a video game.
7403200	7406200	Or a video game where they might be king or queen ponying everybody,
7406200	7411200	like World of Warcraft or something in a social environment where they can be somebody else.
7411200	7416200	You know, I think the best cure to that sort of depression is to stop that behavior
7416200	7417200	and go outside.
7417200	7421200	You want to have a healthy balance of video gaming, you know, when you're that age.
7421200	7424200	But I don't think too much gaming is the cause.
7424200	7426200	I think too much gaming is a symptom.
7426200	7427200	Yeah.
7427200	7428200	If that makes sense.
7428200	7432200	Because they're trying to isolate themselves from everybody else and, you know,
7432200	7435200	sometimes games make them feel better about themselves,
7435200	7437200	especially if they're really skilled at something.
7437200	7438200	Nice.
7438200	7442200	By the way, JD is in chat right now and says it is 4.30 in the morning where he's at,
7442200	7444200	and he is listening after all.
7444200	7446200	Well, thank you very much for tuning in and listening.
7446200	7448200	That's going to do it for the mailbag tonight.
7448200	7449200	Thank you guys for the e-mails.
7449200	7452200	If you want to send us an e-mail, please do a mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7452200	7455200	We'll get to some more e-mails next week.
7455200	7459200	Now we want to get into the FUs of the week, as we always do around this point of the show,
7459200	7464200	and we have a good little inspiration story for you guys tonight.
7464200	7483200	To inspire tonight's FUs of the week, I bring you a principal from Germany who was quoted this week.
7483200	7489200	His name is Bernd Denning and said kind of maybe along this whole line with depression and so forth,
7489200	7495200	he believes that video games play a major role in a child becoming a homicidal maniac.
7495200	7501200	Quote, even if killer games are not the trigger of a killing spree, this guy said yesterday,
7501200	7506200	they still take a major part in turning minors into homicidal maniacs.
7506200	7511200	Even if there isn't a mono-casually relation between excessive playing of games leading to acts of violence,
7511200	7517200	it still provides a twisted frame of reference of solutions for their problems and hardships that they learn
7517200	7521200	may transfer to the real world under certain circumstances.
7521200	7524200	Okay, but how is that the game's fault?
7524200	7529200	You're kind of admitting that they're going to the games because they have a problem in the first place.
7529200	7534200	The game doesn't turn them into a homicidal maniac, right? Am I right?
7534200	7537200	To his defense, I think it's like this.
7537200	7539200	Do you have a crazy person already?
7539200	7548200	The games mainly give him inspiration to how, I guess, how to become an outlet for violence.
7548200	7553200	Say, for example, kids watching a kung fu movie, they're probably going to try to mimic that crap afterwards
7553200	7554200	because that's what kids do.
7554200	7559200	They're really excited about something, they see Ninja Turtles and they want to go play Ninja Turtles.
7559200	7563200	I can sign off with that, but exactly, but why single out video games then?
7563200	7568200	When movies do it, TV does it, peers do it, art does it.
7568200	7571200	It's because he got in a soapbox and wanted to say something controversial
7571200	7574200	so people would listen and people did, and then they blogged about it.
7574200	7577200	Art can be influential, period.
7577200	7580200	Anyhow, so we dedicate the FUs of the week to this guy.
7580200	7581200	Loki.
7581200	7587200	FU to my headache, and it's from sinuses, I'm guessing, because I got it when I got back here
7587200	7592200	and my eyes are burning and my head hurts, so it's got to be a sinus headache.
7592200	7593200	Maybe something in this house.
7593200	7596200	Shermie.
7596200	7600200	There's a guy down in the room, he cheated on us tonight.
7600200	7601200	No pun intended.
7601200	7606200	Hey, my FU of the week goes to the food poisoning I got from a popular sandwich chain earlier this week.
7606200	7608200	I'm not going to name them because I can't prove it, but I got sick.
7608200	7609200	Which one?
7609200	7612200	They toast their sandwiches, they're very famous for it.
7612200	7618200	I got another one from, they don't have foot lungs, but you can get stuff to go.
7618200	7622200	Ah, okay, yeah.
7622200	7623200	Interesting.
7623200	7628200	That's why, you know, I can't prove that they gave me the food poisoning, but I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.
7628200	7632200	And, man, it was hell for three days, but I lost some weight.
7632200	7638200	Oh, yeah, I had some, it wasn't really, I don't know if it was bad sushi and then bad sandwich.
7638200	7643200	So, FU to just food poisoning, because it sucks.
7643200	7645200	All right, anyhow.
7645200	7650200	Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
7650200	7652200	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7652200	7655200	We probably have time for quite a few calls tonight, so we'll try to get through everybody tonight.
7655200	7656200	Loki.
7656200	7660200	This week we got some new Xbox Live arcade games coming out, and quite a few of them.
7660200	7662200	Usually we get one or two, but we have three.
7662200	7670200	So, unfortunately, certain things often, you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the Warriors game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox,
7670200	7678200	but now we get the Warriors Street Ball, which is more of like a, I guess, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
7678200	7684200	the arcade game kind of version of the Warriors, so not as cool as unfortunately the Take-Two game,
7684200	7688200	but it is coming out for $10 or 800 Microsoft Points.
7688200	7694200	Also coming out, Zombie Apocalypse, which is kind of like a top-down version of Left 4 Dead,
7694200	7701200	and that's going to be available for 800 Microsoft Points or $10, and also Ion Assault, which I believe is a tower defense game,
7701200	7712200	and that's also available for 800 Microsoft Points or $10, and I think I'm right about the Ion Assault thing.
7712200	7718200	I can't remember. Nope, I'm wrong. It's a space shooter with an interesting twist, they say.
7718200	7725200	Basically, you can draw in energy from particles and use them to blast foes.
7725200	7731200	I've actually seen that in, like, a freeware game made by some Japanese guy. That's pretty cool.
7731200	7737200	So, I don't know, this looks neat, kind of a little bit like Geometry Wars.
7737200	7743200	Hmm. Isn't it about time for a new Geometry Wars, by the way?
7743200	7748200	Well, you would think with a new Project Gotham game you'd get something like that,
7748200	7755200	since there's not going to really be a Project Gotham game from Bazaar. I don't really know.
7755200	7757200	Maybe do it later.
7757200	7762200	Well, some rumors around the internet this week that there is a Street Fighter IV sequel in the works.
7762200	7768200	Apparently, the official Japanese Street Fighter IV blog said that there is a statement about a new Street Fighter game coming out pretty soon.
7768200	7772200	The announcement is going to come from Natsuki Shihozawa and Yoshinori Ono.
7772200	7777200	Apparently, they are going to say something about it. It would seem very early for a Street Fighter V.
7777200	7782200	Apparently, there is rumors, though, that there is a Super Street Fighter IV of sorts on the way out.
7782200	7784200	And it already kind of got leaked.
7784200	7785200	Oh, did it?
7785200	7786200	Yes.
7786200	7787200	I didn't hear the follow-up.
7787200	7794200	There was a screenshot, or not really a screenshot, but a, I guess, picture that was available on,
7794200	7801200	I'm not sure if it was on Capcom's Twitter or what, but they had a picture from GamePro Germany, I guess.
7801200	7809200	And it was Yosho, what was it, Yoshinori Ono and some other guy.
7809200	7811200	And they were kind of doing like a fireball pose.
7811200	7813200	And in the background, what is that?
7813200	7817200	It looks like Street Fighter IV, but then there is T-Hawk there.
7817200	7825200	And then also a big giant banner with what appears to look like an S from Super Street Fighter IV.
7825200	7826200	Oops.
7826200	7827200	So, yes.
7827200	7835200	Zip party, probably going to get some either, you know, download content or perhaps a re-release of the game,
7835200	7838200	you know, greatest hits type thing or something like that with new characters and whatnot.
7838200	7840200	In other words, a way to milk more money from you.
7840200	7841200	Yep.
7841200	7842200	Congratulations.
7842200	7843200	So.
7843200	7844200	All right.
7844200	7846200	Well, that is it for the stories that we have tonight.
7846200	7851200	So it's now that time for us to open up the Skype line and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7851200	7854200	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7854200	7857200	Loki, why don't you give us some last minute stories before we get to the phones.
7857200	7865200	The Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be a little bit cheaper until August, or not August, October 5th.
7865200	7874200	With a cool deal that's going on with Netflix, you will be able to buy an Xbox 360 Elite between September 22nd and October 5th
7874200	7876200	and go on to Xbox's website.
7876200	7883200	There's a link actually, you can check it out, where you can mail in for a, you know, rebate for 50 bucks.
7883200	7889200	And that's not a bad deal if you're looking to pick up a console.
7889200	7892200	All right.
7892200	7893200	Let's go to the phones.
7893200	7894200	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7894200	7897200	Who's this?
7897200	7898200	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7898200	7900200	Who's this?
7900200	7901200	Deathwishing.
7901200	7902200	Hi, there you are.
7902200	7904200	What's on your mind, buddy?
7904200	7916200	Well, did you guys hear about how, I think I read on Twitter from Inside Gaming that the arcade, the memory cap for Xbox Live arcade games being increased to two gigs?
7916200	7918200	Yeah, I did remember reading your article on that earlier this week.
7918200	7921200	Doesn't that have to do with the whole, what is it, Command & Conquer 3?
7921200	7923200	Yeah, the new Command & Conquer.
7923200	7924200	Yeah, what does...
7924200	7929200	Doesn't that kind of like defeat the purpose of games that are not that big and now you can have these two gig games,
7929200	7935200	basically, I think what they're trying to say is go buy our expensive overpriced hard drives, what I feel like they're telling me.
7935200	7942200	Not really, because when you consider now that the main system that's going to be available out there is the Xbox 360 Elite with 120 gig hard drive,
7942200	7944200	I mean, you could fit like 60 games on there.
7944200	7948200	I mean, if you were just going to, well, probably less than 60 games, but pretty close to 60.
7948200	7951200	Yeah, but what happens to all the people that didn't buy the Elite?
7951200	7958200	I know there's more people with the standard edition console that had a 20 gig hard drive.
7958200	7960200	Microsoft doesn't care about you.
7960200	7967200	They'll probably come down in price. I mean, they're doing, you know, they're having bundles available, the 60 gig and the 20 gig,
7967200	7970200	they're going to release a new bundle with that, very similar to that.
7970200	7973200	That's going to be a little bit cheaper because they're trying to clear out inventory on that,
7973200	7978200	but I'm sure that it's going to come down in price, especially if it's going to be available with all the Elite consoles now.
7978200	7981200	Well, they better hurry up because I'm buying a PS3 soon.
7981200	7985200	And they'll probably, you know, and obviously they're going to also have the 250 gigabyte bundle,
7985200	7990200	maybe they'll see that standalone because that's going to definitely be something for people that own an Elite to upgrade to.
7990200	7994200	I also want to play devil's advocate here a little bit because probably what Microsoft would tell you is that
7994200	7997200	A, not every game is going to be pushing the two gigabyte limit,
7997200	8003200	and B, that there's hundreds, literally hundreds of games already available that are very small.
8003200	8009200	Indie games, don't forget those, in addition to, you know, just the past, you know, three, four years of what's been out on the 360.
8009200	8013200	Oh, and I also picked up ODST.
8013200	8015200	And what'd you think?
8015200	8019200	I love it, but I also know a lot of people that hate it.
8019200	8021200	What do you love about it?
8021200	8025200	I know it's just been half and half. I know it's people love it or people hate it.
8025200	8028200	Which is strange for a Halo game because usually everybody's, you know, dry humping it.
8028200	8030200	What do you love about Halo 3 ODST?
8030200	8037200	I just love that it's actually a fun campaign, it's an interesting story, and the voice acting is pretty good.
8037200	8039200	Yeah, it has like Nathan filling it in right.
8039200	8041200	And the music in this game is awesome.
8041200	8046200	And Firefight's pretty fun. I played it for like three hours one day with a couple friends.
8046200	8050200	I hate to sound so ignorant, but what is Firefight mode?
8050200	8053200	I don't know enough about Halo.
8053200	8054200	What's that?
8054200	8056200	Gears of War horde.
8056200	8057200	Oh, okay.
8057200	8059200	Halo twist with skulls and stuff.
8059200	8060200	Got it.
8060200	8069200	And, yeah, it's been taking up my whole time this week, basically.
8069200	8074200	What would you say to the haters? What are the haters saying about it?
8074200	8080200	Most of the people that hate it are either A, kids that were looking for Master Chief that didn't find them, so they cried.
8080200	8086200	And maybe people that aren't fans of the Halo series looking for a different game.
8086200	8092200	And then there's the people that don't play Halo games, but they bought Halo because you know you have to have it.
8092200	8098200	And most people, I know a lot of people who did buy Halo for their Xbox because it's like a staple game, like Call of Duty and Gears of War.
8098200	8104200	Because, yes, society has grown to the point where you're cool if you buy a video game.
8104200	8106200	Do you think this was just to cash in?
8106200	8112200	Because on Bobby's show tonight, I kind of said, isn't this kind of like the guitar hero of, you know, the guitar hero Van Halen?
8112200	8118200	Not exactly, because I felt more like it was more of a tribute to the people that really cared about the series.
8118200	8126200	Like, I've read most of the books, and for what I'm seeing now is they're actually starting to care and follow storylines from the book.
8126200	8133200	Because there's a new unit in the game that's from the books, if you've read the books, you already know all about it.
8133200	8138200	And Halo Reach is a prequel to, and it's basically based off the book Fall of Reach.
8138200	8143200	You are one hardcore Halo nerd, but that's cool.
8143200	8149200	I wouldn't say hardcore, I like the story. I actually like Call of Duty 4 a lot better. I like Call of Duty.
8149200	8153200	That's cool. Hey, there's people that read the Warcraft books and some of the books based on other games.
8153200	8155200	Man, those people are nerds.
8155200	8160200	Yeah, that's right, that's right. You gotta love the video game culture. You gotta love it.
8160200	8163200	They'll look at just another subgroup and say, you guys are nerds.
8163200	8165200	Like the Star Wars guys in the Trekkies.
8165200	8169200	Exactly. Alright, well Death Wishing, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts?
8169200	8175200	I saw the former lead singer of No Doubt, or one of them, at Chain Reaction last night.
8175200	8177200	Gwen Stefani?
8177200	8178200	No, Alan.
8178200	8180200	Oh, like from the old school days.
8180200	8182200	Yeah, he has a band called Starpool.
8182200	8184200	Did you, like, get a picture?
8184200	8188200	Uh, no, but I was too busy skanking, so...
8188200	8190200	Oh, well, good luck with that. Alright.
8190200	8191200	See ya.
8191200	8192200	Alright, see ya.
8192200	8199200	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to go ahead and give us a call, we'll take some more calls.
8199200	8201200	Any other last minute stories?
8201200	8208200	EA has confirmed that they're going to be doing a Beatles Rock Band Sing Star Pack, basically Beatles Rock Band for PS3, with two Sing Star mics.
8208200	8211200	Hmm, we have another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8211200	8213200	Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.
8213200	8216200	Well, hi, Brad from Pod Culture. We haven't heard from you in a while. How are you doing?
8216200	8217200	Uh, peachy keen.
8217200	8224200	Tell the kids where you podcast at for any of our new listeners. We'll give you a plug. I know you're good to us, we'll be good to you. Tell the kids about your show.
8224200	8230200	Well, there's PodCulture.net, and then the Geek Music Podcast, Geek Spin, over at GeekSpin.com.
8230200	8235200	So, I know what I'm going to hear on Geek Spin is geek music, obviously, but what am I going to hear on Pod Culture?
8235200	8241200	Uh, well, if you can imagine OLR if it wasn't about video games.
8241200	8242200	Okay, fair enough.
8242200	8244200	Which it isn't live.
8244200	8248200	Oh, you talk about Olive Garden 2, okay.
8248200	8251200	Well, we actually usually do go out to eat before the shows.
8251200	8252200	Nice, very nice.
8252200	8257200	Alright, well, I know you didn't call in today just to plug your shows, but what's on your mind, buddy?
8257200	8259200	Oh, Halo 3 ODST.
8259200	8262200	Ah, you're another Halo 3 ODST fan, huh?
8262200	8267200	I really enjoy it. It's definitely not an F minus minus kind of a game.
8267200	8272200	Oh, a little dig there at Bobby on the earlier show. Okay, well, what grade would you give it and why?
8272200	8275200	I'd give it a good solid B.
8275200	8283200	Mainly, you know, it bounces around between the different viewpoints of the characters, which some people I can see would like.
8283200	8288200	I mean, I like a little bit more of a linear type of story.
8288200	8292200	But I dig it just for the sheer fact of the voice acting it's got in there.
8292200	8294200	I mean, it's got three of the guys from Firefly.
8294200	8299200	I was going to say, I know you're a huge fan of Firefly and just the whole Whedon universe.
8299200	8302200	Are you still doing the Dollhouse podcast?
8302200	8306200	Oh, yeah, we actually did a panel with Felicia Day at DragonCon.
8306200	8307200	Oh, nice, very nice.
8307200	8313200	So I know you guys are hardcore into that universe, so just the voice acting alone has got to sell this game to you guys.
8313200	8318200	Well, I mean, Nathan Pillion's character actually looked like Nathan Pillion.
8318200	8319200	Nice.
8319200	8324200	I'm modeling really good Alan Tudyk's character.
8324200	8328200	There's one scene where he actually flies a Covenant chip.
8328200	8330200	So you sound like you're actually into the campaign mode.
8330200	8334200	Do you play any of the multiplayer at all, or are you all about the campaign?
8334200	8339200	Every once in a while, but I usually get my ass handed to me.
8339200	8341200	Yeah, that sounds like pretty much my extent with Halo.
8341200	8342200	I'm not even good at single player.
8342200	8344200	That's how terrible I am at first-person shooters.
8344200	8346200	But hey, teach their own.
8346200	8349200	D5T in chat actually wants to know where the Dollhouse podcast is.
8349200	8352200	You know, now that season two is on, a lot of folks are coming back into that show.
8352200	8355200	It's at thedollhousepodcast.com.
8355200	8357200	You are a busy man, Brad.
8357200	8359200	How do you have time to play video games?
8359200	8362200	Well, you know, just don't sleep.
8362200	8365200	All right, fair enough. Anything else you've been playing lately, Brad?
8365200	8368200	Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5.
8368200	8371200	And what do you think about these games?
8371200	8376200	It's really, really neat. I like in Guitar Hero 5, it's kind of cheesy,
8376200	8379200	but I like the fact you can play as your avatar.
8379200	8382200	That's kind of cool.
8382200	8386200	And with the Beatles Rock Band, come on, man, it's the Beatles.
8386200	8387200	That's right, it's the Beatles.
8387200	8390200	I still have yet to get on this Beatles train.
8390200	8393200	I'm going to be late to the arrival, because I know you were making fun of me
8393200	8397200	over my 360 earlier, but I'll get on the bandwagon soon enough.
8397200	8400200	I'm fine with everybody else's hype for right now.
8400200	8403200	What do you think is going to be, I hate to make you pick,
8403200	8408200	but which game do you think is going to trump at Christmas?
8408200	8411200	I'm going to actually probably say Beatles Rock Band,
8411200	8418200	because it would appeal to more of folks who normally wouldn't pick up a video game.
8418200	8422200	Like, I took it over to my mom's to play over for my birthday,
8422200	8426200	and we played with my sister and brother-in-law and their kids,
8426200	8429200	and everybody loved it.
8429200	8431200	Interesting, all right.
8431200	8433200	Well, any final thoughts for us, Brad?
8433200	8436200	No, sir, just keep up doing the great show.
8436200	8438200	Well, thank you, I appreciate it, and you have a good one,
8438200	8441200	and good luck with your multitude of shows.
8441200	8442200	Catch you later, guys.
8442200	8443200	See ya.
8443200	8446200	He got Felicia Day on a panel?
8446200	8451200	Shit, we can't even get B and C designers to come on the show.
8451200	8452200	No, we've had a couple on the show.
8452200	8457200	Well, when you're one of Dollhouse's few fans.
8457200	8460200	Oh, stop. Rude, rude, rude.
8460200	8461200	All right, let's go to another call.
8461200	8464200	Hi, you're on Orange Blonde's radio, who's this?
8464200	8466200	None other than The Legend of Zaku.
8466200	8469200	Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?
8469200	8476200	Nothing much, just chilling right now, because the weekend that was New York Anime Fest.
8476200	8478200	Yet another damn con.
8478200	8481200	You guys are spoiled out there on the East Coast with all your cons.
8481200	8482200	Did you go to this?
8482200	8488200	Well, yeah, not only that, the creator of Gundam was one of the guests of honor,
8488200	8492200	so I went and managed to go to both of his panels,
8492200	8497200	and I had him autograph one of my copies of Zeta Gundam.
8497200	8498200	Very cool.
8498200	8499200	And a picture with him.
8499200	8503200	I'll be up on Facebook eventually, but right now I'm just tired.
8503200	8511200	I've just got to relax tonight, because I've been going through this rat race this whole weekend.
8511200	8513200	Hmm.
8513200	8519200	Well, yeah, basically I wanted to bring up a good point that I don't know if it was probably already discussed,
8519200	8526200	but the fact that the creator of Mega Man said recently in Tokyo Game Show
8526200	8532200	that pretty much Japan was finished in terms of video games and their industry.
8532200	8535200	Isn't he not the first one to say something like that?
8535200	8540200	I seem to remember a very similar quote not that long ago from another Japanese developer,
8540200	8543200	and I think it's just shock and awe quotes.
8543200	8546200	He's just sad that he didn't come up with Monster Hunter, that's all.
8546200	8549200	I think that's BS that Japanese game development is dead.
8549200	8556200	Well, that also brings me up to a discussion to one of the panels I've actually been to in the con this weekend,
8556200	8561200	which was basically a debate between Western and Japanese video games,
8561200	8565200	and they did bring up that particular rant.
8565200	8579200	From how the debate went, we pretty much settled on the fact that Japan is a clash of cultures.
8579200	8580200	You could put it that way.
8580200	8584200	In other words, where you have the Japanese with their strong work ethic
8584200	8588200	and the fact that they only help themselves, not each other,
8588200	8595200	whereas Western developers or just Western business companies for that matter,
8595200	8599200	you have to work within a team.
8599200	8602200	Isn't this just a little bit, though?
8602200	8606200	I wouldn't see it as the apocalypse that all these guys are proclaiming to me.
8606200	8607200	I know.
8607200	8611200	That says he's probably crying wolf a bit too early.
8611200	8613200	Here it is, Zaku.
8613200	8617200	American development for many years sucked balls.
8617200	8619200	Where did we get all of our games from?
8619200	8622200	All of them, Zaku, came from Japan just 20 years ago.
8622200	8626200	When American developers would do it, they would almost just fail miserably.
8626200	8628200	Remember Secret of Evermore?
8628200	8630200	I like that game, and a lot of people hated that game.
8630200	8631200	But here's the thing.
8631200	8634200	Just Japanese development has dominated for so long.
8634200	8636200	I don't think it's so much that Japanese development is dead.
8636200	8640200	Just Japanese development is having to share the spotlight a little bit.
8640200	8641200	Yeah, of course.
8641200	8649200	Right now, they have to contend with the fact that the Western video game market at this point is pretty solid.
8649200	8656200	You have the 360, which has the largest install base of any console right now on the planet.
8656200	8661200	In the U.S., Europe.
8661200	8663200	You'd be surprised.
8663200	8665200	The fact of the matter is that there are...
8665200	8669200	Actually, no, it doesn't have the largest install base because the Wii is still number one around the world.
8669200	8671200	Yeah, that's true.
8671200	8674200	Aside from the Wii, in terms of hardcore...
8674200	8683200	I consider the Wii more of the casual system, even though it hasn't really appealed that much to hardcore,
8683200	8688200	with the exception of Super Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros.
8688200	8690200	This is another reason why Japan is...
8690200	8692200	So you're just saying compare to Sony?
8692200	8694200	You're saying compare to Sony.
8694200	8696200	No, no, no.
8696200	8701200	The point that I'm trying to make is that Japan couldn't see the writings on the wall a lot sooner than later.
8701200	8705200	And now they have the deer in the headlights look all of a sudden,
8705200	8711200	even though we and most of the world already knew that they weren't the only game in town anymore.
8711200	8713200	Yeah, they give you an example here.
8713200	8723200	The Wii right now worldwide is 53.47 million units, whereas the Xbox 360 is 32.10 million.
8723200	8728200	And then, of course, the PlayStation 3, a little bit catching up now, I think.
8728200	8734200	They're down to 24.55 million.
8734200	8741200	Right. I mean, it pretty much goes back into what others...
8741200	8744200	I guess in a way he's right.
8744200	8747200	And this is what happened.
8747200	8754200	I mean, Microsoft pretty much realized that the only way to create a powerful platform,
8754200	8762200	a world-class platform, is that they have to appeal more to developers and essentially throw money at them.
8762200	8772200	I mean, that's how they managed to roll out more 360s in Japan than the original Xbox.
8772200	8780200	So even though it still hasn't beaten the PS3 yet, it's getting close.
8780200	8789200	I mean, for all intents and purposes, you could say that it's razor thin at this point, the margin between the two.
8789200	8791200	All right. Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up and let you go.
8791200	8794200	Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8794200	8802200	Worst game of all time, Final Fantasy VII. That wasn't me saying it. That was pretty much a panel that I went to today.
8802200	8806200	I think there are millions of people that would disagree with you.
8806200	8808200	All right. Take care, Zaku.
8808200	8810200	Bye.
8810200	8813200	Everybody knows that the worst game of all time is Driver 3.
8813200	8815200	I know. Please. Please.
8815200	8820200	Anybody that says that Final Fantasy VII is the worst game of all time, I laugh in your face.
8820200	8826200	Aha! I laugh in your face because I've played plenty of games this year that were worse than Final Fantasy VII.
8826200	8833200	Try this. Final Fantasy VII is not necessarily the best game of all time. I think that's what you meant to say.
8833200	8839200	Just like, you know, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is overrated.
8839200	8846200	I know. I could think of literally hundreds of games off the top of my head that are worse than Final Fantasy VII that I think we all could agree on.
8846200	8847200	Yaris!
8847200	8849200	Yes, thank you. There's plenty. There's plenty.
8849200	8852200	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
8852200	8854200	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8854200	8857200	Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind tonight?
8857200	8861200	I just had two quick questions because I know you're about to wrap up.
8861200	8863200	Yeah, what's up?
8863200	8867200	Yeah, they're kind of interrelated.
8867200	8876200	And as far as home is concerned, have you heard anything about their announced update?
8876200	8879200	I think they're calling it 1.3.
8879200	8881200	For what is this?
8881200	8884200	For PlayStation Home?
8884200	8889200	I think I saw some stuff online. I didn't think there was anything super major that I read about in it.
8889200	8894200	I mean, I don't think this is getting the showing of the trophies or any of that that we saw about.
8894200	8898200	I want to say I thought I saw something when I logged in the other day, but I don't think there was anything major, right?
8898200	8902200	Yeah, I don't think I ever saw a bullet point on there for fun.
8902200	8906200	So I wasn't really interested in it at all.
8906200	8910200	Now Spazinator, you've checked out the OLR Clubhouse, right?
8910200	8911200	Yeah.
8911200	8915200	Have I done a nice job decorating?
8915200	8925200	Yeah, in fact, since you touched on it, my second question relates to the Clubhouse.
8925200	8933200	I noticed that right behind the stage, towards near the ceiling, there looks like there's some kind of TV screen or something like that.
8933200	8934200	Yes.
8934200	8939200	Does that serve a purpose or is it just decorations?
8939200	8943200	You know what? It's there in the house when you purchase it. It's part of the default.
8943200	8946200	It's not something I added. It was just there in the house.
8946200	8950200	But you can't do anything with it. You can just look at a blank video screen.
8950200	8960200	My hope is that someday they're going to let us as the club owners put a video in there because I would love to give you an exclusive little OLR behind the scenes video or something.
8960200	8966200	I would love to put a five-minute video of us taping the show or something before or after the show in home.
8966200	8970200	That would be awesome and give people a reason to go to home.
8970200	8973200	But I can't do that yet. That's not something they're letting us do.
8973200	8976200	Yeah, they're still working out for a reason to buy the PSP Go.
8976200	8984200	Look, I'm sure that they don't want just anything on those monitors because the video I could put on there could also be me whipping it out.
8984200	8989200	I don't think they want people to be able to put that. Trust me, I don't want to put that up either.
8989200	8990200	Nobody wants to see that.
8990200	8997200	But what I'm saying is that there's no content control there and also copyright. How do they know I'm not going to put up a movie?
8997200	9005200	I could also see them using that screen as some type of, let's say there's a massive Sony event that's going to happen like another E3 press conference or something.
9005200	9010200	They could beam that to all of the clubhouses, but I don't know. I don't see them doing that.
9010200	9016200	Right now, it is 100% completely useless, Spaznator. I'm sorry to say. It's decoration only.
9016200	9020200	It's like an analog TV now. Yes.
9020200	9036200	Yeah, I was thinking. I know you guys have a whole bunch of videos on YouTube. Just recently, you put up the video of Jamie's vault along with their printball machine collection.
9036200	9045200	They would be great for the TV screen and for anyone that buys any of the content through the video section of the store.
9045200	9047200	I would imagine it's very…
9047200	9054200	Spaznator, the minute that Sony lets us put those YouTubes on that TV in the clubhouse, I am so there.
9054200	9059200	Also, I would love them to just open up the clubhouse to everybody. Why be a member of the club?
9059200	9064200	I would love to make my club public so that way lots of people can explore the clubhouse, see the video, and go,
9064200	9069200	Oh, these guys look kind of crazy. Maybe I'll listen to the show. I think it would be great promotion, but sadly…
9069200	9078200	And I understand. It's a big deal for Sony to hit the switch because if they allow people to post their own videos, there's huge copyright things they're going to have to deal with.
9078200	9087200	So I can understand why I don't get what I want, but believe me, the day they figure it all out, even if they have to review each piece of submitted content,
9087200	9091200	we don't have anything copyright in ours, so we would submit it and hopefully it will be on there.
9091200	9103200	Well, thanks for taking my call, and I want to go. Like I said, you're probably here to wrap up the show.
9103200	9109200	Yeah, pretty soon here. All right. Well, thank you, Spaz. Take care, and we'll talk to you later week, all right?
9109200	9112200	Sure. Sounds good. Later. Take care.
9112200	9117200	I don't see why we can't take a couple more calls. It's not even nine o'clock yet. We're good.
9117200	9122200	I'd like one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. The username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. Do you have any other stories you want to get to?
9122200	9135200	Yes, sure. Let's see. Frank West coming to Tatsunoko versus Capcom. Well, we already kind of knew that, but they have pictures now, and it looks like he has all sorts of crazy moves.
9135200	9139200	Oh, hello. This is DS Master 26.
9139200	9142200	Yes, I just picked up the phone, obviously. Hi, what's on your mind?
9142200	9154200	Not much. Just been playing a few new games, and lo and behold, if you were reading the chat at all, my girlfriend, who was here a while ago, she ain't here now.
9154200	9163200	We were playing Rock Band. She accidentally unplugged my 360 in the middle of achievement for Guitar Hero 2, which was watching the whole credits roll.
9163200	9176200	That bitch! I'm just kidding. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Girls 101. Don't laugh at me. Threaten to kick my ass.
9176200	9193200	Basically, then I replugged it in. It's my friend's 360, mind you, and he let me borrow it for the weekend, thank God, because I've been wanting to try a 360 for a while for one, not one of those demo kiosks.
9193200	9209200	And so, then it Red Ringed on me. And then I'm like, oh, crap. So, I have Rock Band for the Wii, and I'm like, okay, I'll put this under the TellTrix thing for the 25 minutes or whenever, and we'll play Rock Band on the Wii.
9209200	9223200	But lo and behold, it has an update, and in the middle of that, Power Outage for a second, it bricked my Wii, and now I have the Blue Light of Death. Not kidding.
9223200	9230200	The Blue Light Special Death. Hold on. Did you get to grab your girlfriend's boobies tonight?
9230200	9243200	No, but... Well, you have had a really bad day, then. I mean, I would think that at least to some type of concession for your bad day, she should be like, okay, I'll let you grab a boob. You know?
9243200	9269200	No, but we did actually kind of started crying on the point where Kairi disappears on Kingdom Hearts three and a half days. And, spoiler alert, sorry, but basically, oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, I saw an Xbox 360 console with a pay-to-play method at the arcades.
9269200	9289200	Where it's like, okay, four tokens, four minutes, eight tokens, eight minutes, so and so forth, and I saw one, it was a modded Xbox, I swear to God, with a Japanese, weak copy of BeatMania 17 2DX.
9289200	9297200	Yeah, I've seen arcades put StepMania machines in and try to make money off of it, so you know, I was part of that.
9297200	9309200	And of all things, it was jerry-rigged into an actual BeatMania cabinet with the controller and everything, which I thought was kind of cool, but it was right next door to an actual BeatMania machine.
9309200	9325200	And not only do they have that, but they also have it with DDR Universe and one with a hard pad, they have the Rock Band game there to play, and they even got some PlayStation 3's jerry-rigged up that way, too, with the token play stuff.
9325200	9327200	Where's this place at? What's it called?
9327200	9333200	Family Fun Center. It's in Omaha. FamilyFunCenter.net. Check it.
9333200	9337200	Alright, well thanks for ratting them out. The developers that listen to this show will be glad to know.
9337200	9342200	And when that place closes down, rest in peace knowing it's all your fault.
9342200	9354200	Honestly, they're not doing anything wrong. I mean, I don't think you, I'm sure that there's a fine print or something, but they do sell those actual kits that you can do pay-for-play stuff on the PS3 and all that stuff.
9354200	9359200	It hooks up via JAMA and that kind of stuff. In fact, I was actually looking into getting some JAMA connectors for my Wii and stuff.
9359200	9365200	That way I can do Tatsunoko vs Capcom on my arcade cabinet or, you know, stuff for my 360 or whatnot.
9365200	9372200	I mean, because it's all available out there. It's just pay-for-play stuff. It's annoying, I guess, because consoles aren't meant for that.
9372200	9384200	See, and I actually, I had three tokens left after the first BeatMania session, and actually it was four minutes in. I was in the middle of the hardest song, V, and I was near to tripling it.
9384200	9392200	I was at the last second of it, and then pop up and did this ten second countdown for me to put in four extra tokens. I'm like, screw this, because I only have three left.
9392200	9394200	And I popped it in the actual BeatMania machine.
9394200	9403200	You know what, that's what you get for playing V. Because seriously, that song is just overdone. Let it sit. That's what you get for playing V.
9403200	9410200	Alright, all joking aside, I know I've been rousing you tonight, but you let me. Thank you for calling in, and quick final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go.
9410200	9425200	Definitely keep the good shows rocking, and actually, I'm the one who sent that one D.S. Silver's Mire code name. I like RPGs and music titles. Give me a few quick recommendations on XPLA and normal titles.
9425200	9430200	Oh, on my Xbox? I haven't signed into my Xbox in like a week. Or, I mean, a month.
9430200	9433200	No, on just Xbox 360 itself, what would you recommend?
9433200	9437200	Oh, what would I recommend on Xbox 360? You said you're into RPGs?
9437200	9441200	Yeah, RPGs, music, and racing.
9441200	9452200	Lost Odyssey, definitely Lost Odyssey. Blur is going to be a great racing game when it comes out. As far as what's out right now, maybe, it depends what kind of racing you like.
9452200	9455200	Need for Speed Shift just came out, except it has a little game-breaking bug in it, but hey.
9455200	9459200	And then as far as, what was the other one? You said RPGs?
9459200	9460200	Burnout, Paradise.
9460200	9462200	No, RPGs, driving, and?
9462200	9463200	Music.
9463200	9464200	Music.
9464200	9476200	Oh, dude. Rock Band or Guitar Hero? Honestly, they're as good as everybody says they are. They're a little beaten into the ground, but if you don't have one yet, go get Rock Band 2, one of the Guitar Heroes, go get them.
9476200	9488200	I'm waiting for Scratch. Because that's the only thing close to BeatMania with DLC we're ever going to get here, because I figured out now they're never going to release BeatMania ever again here in the States, which sucks.
9488200	9490200	Welcome to what I told you years ago.
9490200	9498200	They might do a BeatMania on PS3, and then that way it'll be region-free, so you will be able to get a BeatMania here.
9498200	9500200	Alright, I gotta let you go, DS Master, but take care, buddy.
9500200	9503200	Alright, keep the shows rocking, and peace out.
9503200	9510200	Peace out! Alright. I give him a hard time.
9510200	9512200	Why does my head hurt more?
9512200	9515200	Alright, does your headache get worse? He's a loud caller.
9515200	9520200	Fortunately, I can't normalize the audio on Skype. I'm sorry, guys. Alright, we are going to close the Skype line, though.
9520200	9528200	We took like six calls tonight. That's a lot of calls, but we had some extra time tonight without DarkSakura here, and just not saying her, but just the fact that there's two hosts instead of three.
9528200	9537200	The show always seems to move a little faster because there's less people wanting to interject their opinions, so we get your opinions a little more, I'm sure, you guys. I appreciate it.
9537200	9542200	AJ Mixx in chat says, Konami hates America too much to release good BeatMania here.
9542200	9546200	No, instead we get Walk It Out and Twilight.
9546200	9551200	Yippie skippy. Doesn't that pop in music game on the Wii look horrendous, but granted, isn't Japan getting that too? That's not just us.
9551200	9555200	They already got it. We're getting it soon.
9555200	9560200	And we get the crappy DDR.
9560200	9563200	Which, by the way, remember how it was just Dance Dance Revolution at one time?
9563200	9564200	Yes.
9564200	9572200	They were playing out in the three different games. Now they're going to do X2, Hottest Party 3, and then whatever the fuck. They're going to call it PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.
9572200	9579200	Because the new, new one on the 360 and PS3 looked pretty sweet. It looked pretty epic, actually. I'm curious on this.
9579200	9582200	But the thing is, though, they're going to be identical games. I mean, pretty much.
9582200	9583200	That's fine.
9583200	9585200	They're just changing the names so that people don't realize it.
9585200	9596200	Well, don't we see the same game get ported to two different systems all the frickin' time? I'm okay with that. If they're combining resources to make one really fucking good game across both consoles, I'm okay with that. Especially if it's not.
9596200	9598200	We'll see. We'll see. Jury's out.
9598200	9606200	All right. We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show tonight. We're done with Skypline tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through, but consider sending us an email. We'd love to hear from you.
9606200	9614200	We're going to wrap up and get everybody's final thought tonight. Unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here right now. Maybe she'll come in during Afterbirth. I don't know. For live only folks.
9614200	9621200	But I'm sure she would say goodnight and reject fault icons or something like that. Loki, your final thought tonight?
9621200	9623200	I want my headache to go away. Now.
9623200	9629200	My final thought is I am looking at Loki's bag from McDonald's and my mouth is watering because I'm hungry.
