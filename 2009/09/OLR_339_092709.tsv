13817	25096	Tonight, September 27th, 2009, a controversial rumor hints at big Sega and Sony plans, PlayStation Home spinoff is PSP down, and is the sequel to one of this year's biggest hits already in the works?
31584	36347	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36407	43351	We are that video game program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43451	47733	So pull up a chair and join us for the next three hours as we talk about video games.
47793	52295	It'll be myself, Rob Roberts, and as always, your lovely co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53576	54657	How are you, my friend?
55866	58468	I am contemplative.
58688	59588	Contemplative?
59708	61569	Yes, that's a very good word for how I am right now.
61609	63591	Things you want to talk about on air or private things?
63611	68714	You want to have a Dr. Phil therapy session here, an Oprah moment, if you will?
69034	70715	Live on our video game program?
71315	78619	Well, I am going to only be here for about an hour, and then I'm going to a temple tonight.
78979	79540	Oh, okay.
79720	79900	For...
81563	82744	Uh, services.
83024	83904	Well, you have fun.
84284	87065	And, um, sorry that you won't be here for the whole show, but certainly understanding.
87085	88446	When you have other commitments, you have other commitments.
88566	89846	Try not to ruin my house.
89966	90467	I'll try.
90487	94988	You know, this isn't the first time we've taped a show at Studio DarkSakura without DarkSakura.
95028	95889	It's gonna be a little creepy.
96189	99530	But you will be here for a little while to, uh, give your colorful insight, as always.
100190	100290	Oh.
100931	101111	Yes.
101851	103532	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki!
103912	104532	But what are we gonna do?
104552	106513	Because I don't have Sims 3 on my laptop right now.
107825	113530	Actually, what we'll do, we'll have DarkSakura bring it up on her computer and just put the microphone kind of like at a distance from the speaker.
113550	115372	I turn off the sound during the show.
115392	116833	And it'll be like she's here.
117354	117594	Okay.
117674	120837	And then we'll hear the simlish every once in a while.
120917	122519	And that'll be her input.
123399	124180	Sounds about right.
124400	128024	So what did you think about Tokyo Game Show this year, DarkSakura?
129705	130486	I thought about it.
130726	131407	Well, actually, you know what?
131427	131807	I'll tell you what.
131827	132508	I had a friend that went.
133510	141821	One of my friends from Berkeley, she lives in Japan now, and she went to Tokyo Game Show and posted lots of pictures of the cosplay and the win.
142221	144164	I heard it was kind of a mixed bag this year.
144304	151673	Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who of course tapes before us at All Games Radio, where we always tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
151693	152073	Plug, plug, plug.
153075	170556	5 Pacific, gotta plug All Games because they let us steal their bandwidth every week but of course there's a bunch of great shows on All Games and the one before us is Bobby Blackwolf and he was kind of talking his piece and we were doing a little phone call at the end of his show as we always do and he had mentioned that some of the things he had heard on Tokyo Game Show this year, not so hot
171807	173629	I think that it depends on what you go there for.
174249	178993	I mean, I think she was just going there just to see and to look around, so I think she had a good time.
179554	187841	And I got the impression he didn't say who it was for whatever reason, which is fine, but I got the impression maybe because it was an industry person, so I didn't want to say who it was.
188242	191685	So probably maybe from the industry perspective, it's eh.
191925	195268	But the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is open to the public.
195428	196669	That's something E3 is not.
197129	197329	So...
198090	198770	There you go.
198910	199271	I agree.
199431	199731	All right.
220779	221079	DarkSakura.com
248812	253719	Join us at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat with us during the program.
254841	257244	We are back after a week off last week.
257384	261029	Unfortunately, we're a little spotty in our schedule right now.
261169	264334	We're going to be out next week as well, but I have some good news.
264674	291749	We are going to have a best of show airing next week With some new content We're going to get together next week and tape some new content So we won't be live next week sadly But you will get to hear some of our best bits Going back a little ways too So some of our new fans in the past year or two And this will actually go to the podcast feed as well So you'll be able to hear it It'll air live first of course as it always does And then go to the podcast feed a little later So if you want to be the first to hear it Just stay tuned after Bobby next week like you always are Sadly we won't be here live But um
292469	294812	Then after that, that should be it for the rest of the year.
294912	297716	We'll be here every show up through Christmas.
297736	301240	I don't think Christmas is on to Sunday this year or New Year's and all that, so I think we'll be fine.
301741	302742	So, anyhow.
304844	326319	I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says the OLR dinner table, yay I want to welcome all of our new chatters as well I'm not sure who exactly all in chat is new tonight But I do want to say welcome if you are new to the program And of course welcome to our veteran folks as well Especially those of you that have been with us for a long time Like Dark Tetsuya, I think he's been here every week since episode one You gotta love that
326519	327701	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
339398	343240	It was, um, not very eventful, I should say.
343500	346621	I really didn't play much of anything this week, Rob.
347162	349803	Except for, um, like a game of pinball.
351143	360428	And, um, because I haven't paid for my World of Warcraft account because of financial issues here at home, which hopefully I'll be able to rectify next week.
361168	362769	But, um, no, I take that back.
362809	363449	I played some Sims.
363509	365470	I actually did for about 20 minutes.
366769	372573	I have to say, as far as the pinball thing goes, one game that I played a little bit of this week, not a lot, but was Zen Pinball on PlayStation 3.
373233	376656	And I know Bobby was giving you some crap about that a while ago, saying, you gotta check it out, you gotta check it out.
376696	382300	Well, I'm gonna jump on board and say, you gotta check it out, because it is a pretty good pinball collection and some fun tables in there.
382980	384841	I was finally getting into one of them.
384881	385922	I think it's called V12.
385942	391346	It's like a racing table, and it's one of those things where there's like a field on top and then a play field underneath the glass.
391626	393407	And the way they do it on the PlayStation 3 is kind of neat.
393587	394108	Yeah.
394588	395149	It's worth checking out.
420521	420842	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
438822	442905	I didn't play a lot of games, mainly I played Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned This time though...
461846	468831	Since they went and broke our modded games, which had us depressed for a while, we didn't really know what the hell we were going to do with the game now.
469912	478359	So to kill our time until the new expansion comes out, we've been playing ranked games actually, and it's quite fun because we kick the crap out of everybody that plays with us.
480540	486285	And normally I don't talk crap during my games, but if there's someone else that's playing outside of our group, I talk shit the entire time.
487458	487998	It's awesome.
488359	489540	Wait, wait, wait.
489580	497525	So you now go, now ever since they banned your private games because you were doing the hack thing or whatever, you now go out on the public and play public matches.
497545	497686	Oh, yeah.
497706	499247	We play ranked games all the time.
499487	499987	And it's funny.
500067	501989	So will you now take challenges from all our listeners?
502529	505770	Well, ranked games, it's just kind of a matter of chance getting into the same game.
505870	508770	But honestly, right now, there's so few people playing ranked games.
509151	520333	Like, at lunch, sometimes, because we have five consoles that all happen to be gold accounts, I can literally put all five consoles in a game and just take sniper shots at heads and stuff to kind of boost my stats a bit.
520893	521894	But cheater, cheater.
522354	524914	No, I only do it for the costumes and crap.
524954	527295	Because really, there's no point in getting up the leaderboard.
527395	530596	I guess if you get ranked 10 or whatever, you get 20 points.
530656	531676	Big fucking whoop.
532156	533458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
547786	553470	I do want to say real quick before we get too far away from the topic, but Pinball FX is the name of the pinball game on Xbox 360.
554131	558233	Thank you HitStun who said it first, and BlackWolf points out it's the same company that makes both games.
558253	561416	That's why some of the tables hop across both of those games.
561696	567079	And VidPower wants to point out, if you're listening live on this Sunday night, Pinball FX is on sale for the rest of today.
567380	569361	So if you are looking for... And I do have that game on 360.
569901	571122	I just haven't played it in a long time.
571763	572503	I still have a Bork 360.
572843	575465	So I'm finally taking care of that this week.
576025	576105	Um...
577046	580269	But it's a decent pinball game as well.
580289	581970	I mean, it's pretty much the same thing that's on the PlayStation 3.
582230	584952	So I would totally urge you to check it out.
585012	585413	Sorry, Loki.
585513	587974	Yeah, but yeah, we're not really just cheating and stuff.
587994	593239	We're just doing it to kind of... Because the other thing, too, that happens a lot of times is it will roll back our stats.
593639	595100	So, like, I was ranked 4 the other day.
595180	599824	Then, like, the next day I was back $25,000 and back to rank 3 again.
599844	600024	So there...
603186	615231	Leaderboards kind of fucked up anyways, and instead of just wasting another 20 days to get the same amount of money, we're just going in there and doing headshot kills and stuff like that.
615511	620893	But yeah, actually when we get into the games with everybody else, I definitely hold my own, so that's no problem.
621453	630877	Then, on top of that, really it's not game playing, but I've been working on my arcade cabinet that I got, and it's actually pretty much done.
630957	631457	I mean, it's
632694	638696	I finished sanding the whole thing and then re-spraying it with black spray paint.
640416	643157	I got replacement buttons, replacement joysticks.
644097	648018	I actually converted the panel that I had because it was a two-player panel with three buttons each.
648579	651879	I drilled three more holes in there for the other six buttons.
651899	652640	It's
654039	655260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
672557	673257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
692452	693713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
723715	724035	That's it.
752287	752667	I have it.
752747	755108	You should come over and play with me.
755748	759049	Once my life stops being so crazy and I'm going on all these trips and stuff, I will.
759669	761429	Or I'm just going to get the damn thing at some point, too.
761509	762430	But we'll rock out.
762450	764310	A couple more weeks and DJ Hero will be out.
765270	766891	Rocket Beals will be like, whatever.
767211	767771	Well, we'll see.
768111	772512	But honestly, between that and I've been getting back into WoW lately and you all know how that goes.
772772	773252	But that's not it.
773292	774833	I actually did play some new games this week.
774853	775353	Wait, wait.
775573	777233	I got to interrupt you real quick.
777393	777553	Sure.
777733	779354	Did you see the new video for Final Fantasy XIV?
780214	780594	Yes, I did.
781055	781595	Isn't that awesome?
782075	783176	Oh, my God.
783236	784497	I cannot wait.
784757	786998	That is going to be a whole new crack right there.
787559	788499	That was the greatest thing.
788559	789740	No, I can't go back.
790320	791501	This looks amazing.
792081	792281	All right.
793742	794142	Here's the thing.
794663	797024	I want to talk about some new games I played this week.
797124	798585	Funny enough, I played some portable games.
799045	802968	I played on the PSP Phantasy Star Portable I decided to pick up because I was traveling this week.
803488	827275	and you guys know I like to play portable games the most when I'm traveling as I'm sure a lot of you do so I picked up Phantasy Star Portable which is kind of a port of Phantasy Star Universe to the PSP which is weird because Phantasy Star Universe is an online game but Phantasy Star Portable doesn't really have that it has an ad hoc mode so you can play with local people but you can't really go online and play the universe is like online as in like Phantasy Star Online was online whereas you can play it offline though
828744	833305	Um, well, Phantasy Star Universe has both a single player campaign and an online mode.
833325	835606	Phantasy Star Online was pretty much only online.
835626	836466	It was the only place you could play it.
836646	838586	I always played Phantasy Star Online offline.
839206	841347	Well, you had to have a hack disc or something to do that, I think.
841427	841567	No.
841587	843467	Or you just make your own private rooms or something, right?
843507	844688	No, you just play it offline.
845428	845948	Could you do that?
846028	846728	Yeah, you could do that.
846748	847568	I don't even remember.
847588	849209	It's been so long, I can't even remember.
849229	852469	Because I didn't want to do dialogue because that was, you know, crap.
852489	853050	Yeah, kind of slow.
853410	853910	But, um...
854890	858393	Fantasy Star Portable is kind of a port of a single player campaign.
858453	859734	It is not the same campaign.
859794	860494	I want to make that clear.
860534	863036	It's a much different story going on to the PSP.
863076	865558	But it's weird because they made some weird decisions with it.
866099	869601	A, they added voice acting, which is kind of not that great.
870622	875366	And the interesting thing that they changed when they ported Fantasy Star Universe to the PSP is that they made...
876587	878429	Space Station, Homebase, etc.
894583	899006	because it says, well, if a person's name is green, they have new information for you.
899046	902648	But I don't want to just kind of like sit there and highlight different icons on a 2D map.
902988	908531	It's like you're browsing the mall map at the mall saying, oh, I want to go to Hot Topic, I want to go to Sears, I want to go to, you know.
909612	911072	I just didn't like that design choice.
911613	913674	But that's my negative for the game.
914014	918777	The positive for the game is that they did a pretty good job porting it over to the PSP graphically.
919557	920478	The game still looks...
921058	921579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
941920	942441	All together.
943161	945043	And thusly, Phantasy Star Portable.
945364	949888	And I think I'm going to get some shit for this, but this is the reason why I couldn't continue to play the game online.
950269	951310	It's too damn repetitive.
951851	962702	It doesn't have the variety that an online game such as WoW, Final Fantasy, even some of these other MMOs we've talked about in the...
963943	964984	History of Our Gaming.
965704	972207	I'm sorry, I love the idea of an action-based MMO, but honestly, I feel so constrained as to what you really can do.
972527	974688	You do these same sword moves over and over.
974748	976408	Granted, you can pick different weapons.
976809	980810	Yes, I realize there's skill-ups, but you don't really mix and match things.
980850	989154	There's not a lot of strategy as to what you mix and match, like how you chain things in Final Fantasy based around the elements, or how you...
990715	991315	P.V.P.
991375	1017076	is very intensive in World of Warcraft and even some of the boss strategies go way beyond hack and slash I think that's part of the reason why Phantasy Star Universe just didn't end up being that fun I think a lot of people I know that played this game just played it for a little while and was like, eh, bored and I think that's why it kind of got old quick Phantasy Star Online I think was a little different because I think at the time we really didn't have anything like it I think of a game, honestly, and I know I'm going to get crap for saying this but I don't care
1018397	1027331	as much as I love Phantasy Star Online I've played both online and universe pretty extensively as much as I do love and respect Phantasy Star Online I think if that game came out now it would tank
1028399	1033102	But, granted, it's unfair to say, well, this game came out 10 years ago, let's hold it to today's standards.
1033562	1037564	It was important for what it did 10 years ago, and it's always going to hold a place in gaming history.
1037624	1042627	But I just think the problem is, Phantasy Star Universe didn't evolve on that as much as it should have.
1042827	1043568	And that's its biggest weakness.
1043588	1049371	I think they should have a Gauntlet Legends online, like a version of Gauntlet Legends where...
1050802	1057030	You can basically throw as many players as you want together and the game scales itself based on that.
1057050	1058432	That'd be pretty awesome.
1059538	1064120	X-Link in our chatroom, chat.orangelongeradio.com, says part two for the Phantasy Star Portable is coming out next year.
1064160	1067502	Yeah, that is one story that didn't make our show roll tonight, but that came out of Tokyo Game Show this week.
1067822	1071763	They are making a Phantasy Star Portable 2, and that looks pretty cool that they're doing.
1071783	1075505	And the reason why I say that's cool is because it's going to have online multiplayer.
1076085	1079067	But even then, what are they going to do to make the game not so repetitive?
1079527	1080467	That's my biggest question.
1081027	1084569	Hardcore fans of Phantasy Star Universe are going to enjoy Phantasy Star Portable 2.
1085954	1086635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1107277	1115080	Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking
1135788	1139250	It's because I haven't reached my 3,000 step goal for the day yet.
1139370	1141812	Once you hit your 3,000 step goal for the day, it turns green.
1142772	1145294	There really is no game in personal trainer walking.
1145434	1147015	All it does is that you communicate.
1147495	1151678	The pedometer has an infrared device and so does the cartridge, which I thought was very interesting.
1152078	1156260	You hold the device to the cartridge and you press a little button and it communicates like a graph.
1156581	1157661	Here's how you walk today.
1158061	1161043	Here's where the hours were that you did the most walking.
1161343	1165486	If you were an animal, you would be a night owl or you would be a morning deer or whatever it is.
1165846	1166827	Owls don't walk.
1166947	1167768	That's stupid.
1167788	1169369	Well, that's kind of smart, though.
1169449	1170750	I don't think it says like that.
1170870	1172832	It's tracking your activity in general.
1173052	1173332	It is.
1173732	1176234	But here's the thing, and I can't stress this enough.
1176375	1178516	There is really no game to this.
1178877	1179857	This is a tool.
1180638	1182820	They did add some frilly little things.
1183000	1184001	You can use your Miis.
1184041	1188864	It's actually the first DS game where you can actually take your Mii from your Wii and put it on the DS.
1190130	1191211	Take your me from your we on your d-s
1209629	1213831	or you compete because the game actually comes with two pedometers so you can compete with somebody in your own house.
1214751	1220913	The game will kind of pitch you against each other and see who's generating more power for the house.
1221414	1234779	And then the only online mode that this thing has is that you communicate with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection and it will send your steps and it will say, this is how many steps the world has walked cumulatively.
1234799	1235219	That's cool.
1235499	1242202	You can put it in this mode called Walk the World, and you can see how long it took for everybody to walk from the world to the moon.
1242702	1243962	And that took about three months.
1244042	1248764	So right now, everybody that's playing Personal Training is trying to walk to Mars, and they're about a third of the way to Mars from the moon.
1248784	1249364	That's kind of cool.
1249925	1251305	Yeah, but it's a little silly.
1251605	1253146	Well, I think it's a fun kind of silly.
1253366	1254666	That's a little noby-noby void.
1255547	1256247	I was just thinking that.
1256707	1257368	But here's the thing.
1258928	1260789	Here's the thing, is that unfortunately...
1263324	1265406	There's a lot more that could have been done here.
1266087	1268270	What about me getting to compete with my friends?
1269463	1272204	I also don't think the challenges are particularly that challenging.
1272884	1283367	3,000 steps in a day, either the device is very generous in what it's measuring, but in looking at the graphs, I can kind of remember, oh yeah, this is my lunch, this is when I was walking down to get coffee for the day.
1283487	1287989	It's kind of funny that you can remember those things, but I didn't find 3,000 steps particularly challenging.
1288069	1289429	I kind of do that in a normal day.
1289489	1291490	Maybe it's because I'm a teacher and I pace the room as I teach.
1291510	1292410	Well, can you increase it?
1292950	1293110	No.
1293750	1295011	At least I haven't seen that happen yet.
1295471	1298592	You can set your own goals for yourself, but the game always challenges you to get to 3,000.
1299452	1300474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1313860	1317342	I normally wouldn't get up and walk, except I get up and walk all the time.
1318423	1318983	You know what I mean?
1319344	1321965	It's to encourage people to have a normal amount of activity.
1322005	1323687	And I think that's what the game is ultimately trying to do.
1323747	1330311	And I think the other thing I want to point out is that the game also, you know, it gives you these little mini goals.
1330411	1334194	Like, hey, your mini goal for today, watch the number of calories you consume.
1334694	1337756	Or go for the longest walk you possibly can today.
1337796	1341859	It does give you little mini goals, but the game doesn't really reward you or punish you if you don't meet them.
1341919	1343080	You track them on a calendar, that's it.
1344080	1355406	I find this game to be an enhancement to an already... If you think this kind of information is worth it to you, like you want to be able to track your walking patterns, you want a little bit of incentive, go for it.
1355486	1358187	But I think there could have been a lot more that could have been done with this game.
1358447	1359048	I don't think it's worth $50.
1359308	1370594	What they should have done, and what I'm guessing they probably didn't do because this is Nintendo and they take the easy way out, is they should have integrated this game where you can track that data for Wii Fit+.
1372281	1377882	They probably didn't do that because then that would mean effort and they're not going to put that effort in.
1378402	1380663	Or I think a better comparison would be EA Active.
1380703	1386504	I think EA Active probably does the best job that I've seen so far out of all the games that have really given you a plan and having you stick to it.
1386924	1389665	So proceed with caution with personal trainer walking.
1389725	1393725	If you are interested in this, I don't think you absolutely need it.
1394265	1397826	And really what you need, not this game, is Walk It Out from Konami.
1398186	1401347	A game where you're not only walking, you're fake walking...
1402492	1402973	In a game.
1403594	1404475	Listening to music.
1404836	1406999	So you're basically marching in place.
1407741	1408822	This sounds idiotic.
1409203	1410004	It's a walking game.
1410044	1413250	It's a rhythm music game that's walking.
1413430	1415073	You walk to a rhythm basically.
1415421	1415801	DarkSakura.com
1432714	1435175	Do you have to leave your DS on to track it?
1457304	1462086	No, the little pedometer must have a pretty powerful battery in there because it just works.
1462386	1466889	You just communicate with your DS once a day, you know, and then you don't have to leave your DS on at all.
1466909	1468449	The little pedometer is very tiny.
1468489	1472832	It's about the size, a little larger than a silver dollar, honestly.
1472872	1473512	No, maybe not.
1473952	1476974	Maybe like a quarter of the size of the iPhone is about how big it is.
1477674	1479895	And you just leave it in your pocket and that does all the tracking for you.
1480295	1480735	So there you go.
1481156	1481396	All right.
1482216	1482617	DarkSakura.com
1500995	1501956	I do also want to say this.
1501976	1502496	This is a bit of
1519742	1549268	that's not an easy thing to have to say or do especially when you consider it's charity however there is a conflict has arisen with my day job it is one I have to do and I'm sure and as you can all understand work comes first even before some of these other things so unfortunately we will have to back out of the Extra Life event and not participate but we will make a nice donation on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio to one of the groups participating there may yet be something to be mentioned later we might do something in the future that we'll do
1551351	1559195	so but as as far as us doing our show for 24 hours and all that we're not going to be able to do that because unfortunately I'm just not going to be available I have work commitments and
1559926	1587209	yeah so that's a really sucky thing but you know best of luck to those guys I think it's for a great cause we'll certainly be donating and you know again good luck I hope we can do our own charity thing in the winter also I believe Bobby Blackwell's Friday Night Gaming is doing something in the next couple weeks I think they're doing it like two weeks after and I apologize if I'm misstating anything but I think he mentioned something about that so lots of fun charity events coming up all for good causes so keep your eyes out for that
1589155	1590697	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1606472	1623783	Okay, for our UK release dates, we have on the 29th, Jam Sessions 2 for DS, and Left 4 Dead Crash Course, and Tales of Monkey Island, Lair of the Leviathan, and on the 30th, Fate Unlimited Codes, it says.
1625163	1632888	Also, on the first Fallout 3, Operation Anchorage, Fallout 3 The Pit, and Gran Turismo for PSP, there's...
1634966	1646252	and Beater Raider on PSP and Dead Space Extraction, FIFA 10, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and Risen for PC.
1647032	1651114	I just want to quickly say Bobby in chat clarified his charity event is October 30th.
1651174	1653135	That's him and his Friday Night Gaming project.
1653375	1654516	So, keep an eye out for that.
1654836	1656496	Beater Raider, that's the Timbaland game, right?
1656757	1657277	On PSP?
1657537	1657957	Yes, it is.
1658417	1658958	Beater Raider.
1659498	1660578	That just sounds vile.
1661319	1661899	It does a little bit.
1661919	1663280	Sounds like beat it off a raider.
1664458	1665218	You had to go there.
1665738	1666319	Yes, I did.
1666819	1668259	Why don't we do US next, Loki?
1668639	1669340	Yes, US.

1867933	1868313	and DarkSakura.com
1898138	1900000	I guess it's kind of more of a light and fun.
1901141	1906145	Due to a freak accident during an important ceremony, you are turned into the puppy demon lord.
1907006	1908327	Well, that sounds unfortunate.
1909764	1910944	That's on the PlayStation 3.
1910984	1913985	It looks like it could be interesting.
1914105	1916686	Oh, it's got the Disgaea penguins in it.
1917387	1919167	What the hell are these things named?
1920088	1920568	I can't remember.
1921468	1924749	The little penguin dudes from... God damn it.
1925569	1926590	Somebody will remember in chat.
1927110	1928850	We have to say goodbye to Dark Sakura, by the way.
1928890	1929591	She's on her way out.
1929951	1931391	I think that's actually the Trinity thing.
1931471	1932992	I think that's actually one of those games.
1933052	1935173	It's a cross game where they have the characters from everything.
1935933	1937954	Thank you, Jay Dizzle, who was first to say it in chat.
1938014	1939194	God, the name was on the tip of my tongue.
1939454	1942617	I'm going to go ahead and leave my name in chat just in case anyone wants to send me a message.
1942877	1943177	All right.
1943517	1944178	Take care, DarkSakura.
1944218	1944678	Have a good night.
1945219	1946380	And hopefully we'll see you when you get back.
1946460	1948021	I don't know if we'll still be on or not, but we'll see.
1948321	1948701	Should be.
1948842	1949142	All right.
1950183	1955787	Moving on to some other releases on the Nintendo Wii on October 1st.
1957378	1958259	Dead Space Extraction Karaoke Games

1996906	1997786	I'll see you next time.
2012233	2040087	so keep an eye out for that moving on to the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS this week nothing I recognize with name stuff by name but I do notice Blue Dragon is next week there's a Blue Dragon game coming out on the DS over there coming out on the PSP if anything this week Gran Turismo comes out in Japan just like it's coming out over here on the PSP also Macross Ultimate Frontier
2042142	2047457	I actually missed quite a few titles here for the US as well.
2047537	2049523	Real quick, we're also getting...
2051957	2053537	TheBeaterRaider on PSP.
2053998	2061660	There's going to be a new Cabal's game, Big Game Hunter 2010, also on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
2062260	2065501	Sideswiped on the DS, which looks like a pretty cool full-auto game.
2065641	2067541	Rapala WeFish on the Wii.
2068582	2071322	And Obscure the Aftermath on PSP.
2074423	2076184	And then some other games, but I'm not going to mention those.
2077164	2077444	Alright.
2078206	2079609	All right, now we can get into some news.
2079870	2082014	So we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
2082516	2086605	And now it's just Loki and I just holding down the fort over the next few hours.
2086625	2088008	But you guys in chat as well.
2088962	2093484	So, Loki's gonna steal Jamie's chair so he has a better place to sit.
2093504	2096705	That chair is way uncomfortable and too small and I'm getting a headache from sitting on it.
2096865	2099366	Oh no, we'll have to figure out something in the future.
2099386	2101027	Oh yeah, that's much better.
2101047	2101667	You know what's funny?
2101888	2104369	I think I have a folding chair in my car, of all places.
2105009	2106810	I don't care, this chair is much better.
2107050	2107730	Alright, fair enough.
2108410	2109631	Well, it is her throne after all.
2109831	2111992	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?
2112552	2116735	So, in case you weren't aware, there was a wee price drop today.
2117215	2118116	It dropped down to $1.99.
2118496	2124200	It was one of those really well-kept secrets, I guess.
2125220	2129503	It's not like numerous ads leaked out and leaks everywhere.
2130003	2136808	Okay, so maybe it wasn't so secret, but it is official now, and that's kind of cool.
2138663	2143026	To kind of go along with that, though, in Europe, you don't get a price drop, sorry.
2143586	2150150	However, you do get a new bundle, and they're going to be including both Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort in that bundle.
2150670	2154793	So, I guess a little more bang for your buck, which is kind of cool.
2155473	2164419	You know what's funny is that on last week's show, I predicted that that would be a bundle, so I was kind of half right, because I kind of meant that it would be a bundle here, but it ends up that it's going to be a bundle over there.
2164919	2165920	Yeah, I mean, it's...
2167239	2194072	I don't know, we may see something like that come over here if they're really hurting for sales but I don't think that right now they're going to bring it over here I don't know if you did see though Wii Sports Resort though is going to be getting a different bundle over here actually in a few months where they're going to be including two Wii Motion Pluses with it instead of just one so you get a little bit of a savings there as well hoping to drive some more sales for that I guess
2195270	2198373	I have to read this lousy statement in chat first before we discuss this story.
2198553	2203537	I'm amazed that Suma in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, Headache for sitting in a chair.
2203937	2205579	Guess we know where Loki's brain was located.
2206720	2215888	It's a tension headache from my neck because it's bad posture in that chair and I have to sit forward and there's, I mean, literally the back of the chair comes up to like,
2216929	2217849	and I'll see you next time.
2237702	2243906	Well, right now the problem is that they've... I mean, there's already plenty of systems out there, so they're going to be the number one system.
2244086	2245046	I'm sure this will help.
2245366	2247107	The Wii's going to be popular anyways.
2248748	2252351	Software-wise, though, there's nothing really other than the new Super Mario Bros.
2252591	2255853	Wii that's that amazing.
2256093	2257033	A AAA title.
2257053	2260235	There's no real, like, must-have titles coming out this fall.
2260255	2266759	I mean, there's going to be good titles coming out, but nothing like, oh my god, it's a new Zelda game, or oh my god, you know, it's, you know...
2267679	2269641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2287873	2288654	New Super Mario Bros.
2288714	2295298	Wii just seems like, eh, let's throw a game where there's four players and stuff like that and kind of run with it.
2295518	2299621	And if I remember correctly, isn't that the one that plays the game for yourself or plays the game for you?
2299641	2303224	Yeah, it has that whole little controversial pause and skip ahead mode.
2303264	2306486	But I was just going to say, old school is new school, remember?
2307526	2310107	I'm not so hung up on the graphics and all that stuff.
2310147	2311508	I'm cool with the way they're doing the game.
2311548	2313609	I would like to see a Mario game like that.
2313649	2315110	I'm fine with the game being that way.
2315190	2316670	I'm talking about the effort put into it.
2316710	2319031	I'm not saying that they went and improved the graphics or anything.
2319071	2328916	I'm saying, I guess the example would be Mario 1 to Mario 2 in Japan.
2329056	2329296	Okay.
2330526	2335207	There was some new levels in there, but they didn't go and add anything really new as far as the game and stuff.
2335487	2340489	Whereas Mario 3 was completely new, Mario World was completely new.
2341889	2347130	It's just, I don't know, this doesn't really seem... It's like half-assed releases is what it is.
2347370	2348231	You know what's funny, though?
2348491	2349991	I think this game's still going to be huge.
2350491	2350931	You know why?
2351492	2353832	Everybody fucking loves Mario Bros.
2354032	2356493	When I say everybody, I don't mean just gamers.
2357561	2361043	Everybody knows Super Mario Bros., the old school Nintendo game.
2361063	2361983	People are retarded.
2362023	2363844	They will buy anything that has Mario in it.
2363864	2365705	That's why Mario Tennis sells well.
2366285	2367606	It's a fucking tennis game.
2368707	2371228	But it's got Mario, so I must buy it.
2371728	2375570	If they came out with like... And you know what they're going to fucking do.
2375910	2378311	This is how they're going to sell that crappy Vitality Sensor.
2378331	2382113	It's going to be Mario, like Dr. Mario's Vitality Sensor or some shit like that.
2382193	2383794	Dr. Mario Visits Trauma Center?
2383834	2384394	What is this?
2384414	2385655	No, Vitality Sensor.
2385675	2385775	What?
2386510	2389312	They're going to have like a... If Dr. Mario was a puzzle game, that doesn't get your vitality.
2389332	2389673	It doesn't matter.
2389693	2391534	The character Dr. Mario will be in there.
2391554	2391734	Oh, I see.
2391774	2391895	I see.
2391915	2394677	You know, because people are like, oh my god, Mario must buy it.
2395217	2396839	So, I don't know.
2396859	2404065	It... Well, it's, you know, effort for trying, but it's going to be hard with not that many big releases coming out.
2404085	2408068	Whereas the 360 and PlayStation 3 have a lot of releases coming out that are going to be really big titles.
2408488	2409569	But, you know, then again...
2411025	2413928	The people that buy the Wii aren't necessarily looking for the big titles.
2413948	2415269	They're just going to buy Mario games.
2416149	2420172	Honestly, I just want to go on record and say I think this new Super Mario Bros.
2420212	2422995	game is, for that audience, the game.
2423375	2423915	You know what I mean?
2424035	2426037	I don't think you're giving it enough credit.
2426117	2427858	From a gamer perspective, I get what you're saying.
2428279	2433903	But from an accessibility perspective and selling to the soccer moms of America, I totally get what they're doing here.
2434003	2435444	And I think the game will sell pretty well.
2437226	2440008	If it were Mario Galaxy 2 right now, it'd be a little bit different.
2441688	2443269	Weird that that's not out already.
2443289	2448511	I mean, they have teased that game that it is coming out, but it's surprising it's not coming out this holiday season.
2448551	2451912	Because they're first-party games now, it's only like one or two a month.
2452292	2453113	Or not even a month.
2453573	2460356	It's like, let's throw some really obscure DS games out there that suck and end up being like something else.
2460796	2462997	Like, okay, Professor Layton's pretty awesome.
2463077	2463897	Okay, that did well.
2464277	2470220	Fossil Fighters, though, is exactly the same as this other game that was put out called Fossil League DTS, I think.
2470960	2471080	And
2471681	2473043	It came out from Sega a while ago.
2473083	2475667	I mean, it's literally almost exactly the same game.
2478496	2479056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2503590	2504470	It kind of tanked.
2504691	2511834	And then Wii Sports Resort, it's doing well, but I don't think as well as someone would figure for a Wii Sports sequel.
2512174	2515756	You would think that that thing would be flying off the shelves, like selling millions of copies.
2515916	2518317	I think it's going to be a gradual sell throughout Christmas.
2518417	2521379	I think that that's going to be under a lot of Christmas trees this season.
2522219	2523580	Wii Fit Plus?
2523700	2524560	I mean, come on.
2525261	2527142	Stop re-releasing the same damn games.
2527282	2529483	Do something absolutely new.
2530263	2531204	Something groundbreaking.
2532225	2540611	Again, I think all these games, the new Super Mario Bros., the Wii Sports Resort, the Wii Fit+, these games are going to show up under many Christmas trees this holiday season.
2540671	2542432	Those games are still going to sell very well.
2542852	2546815	And I get, believe me, as a hardcore gamer, I get what you're saying.
2546835	2547475	They cashed out.
2547575	2548176	That's what they did.
2548196	2549036	They cashed out.
2549076	2549857	They sold out.
2549877	2550617	They sold out.
2550818	2551498	But you know what?
2551538	2554340	They're making, they're shitting money at this point.
2554600	2555381	Can you blame them?
2556325	2556945	Can you blame them?
2586442	2586742	Mario Hockey
2607779	2609640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2633410	2633870	Thanks for watching!
2656031	2656952	and it did okay.
2657793	2662058	But, you know, not... Well, what else to sell to soccer moms but a soccer game?
2662438	2663299	They had Mario Football.
2663920	2665561	You know, or something like that.
2665581	2666683	I don't know, maybe that'd sell better.
2666783	2668705	But, it's just...
2670589	2672890	and then again, it doesn't matter because it has Mario in it.
2672950	2682076	Seriously, when I'm selling this to my customers, if I said, hey look, it's Mario Dodgeball or something, or not even Dodgeball, let me think of a crappier sport.
2682396	2683757	Mario Curling, okay?
2683817	2685778	And they'd be like, oh Mario, I'm buying that.
2686418	2687979	It could be something completely crappy.
2690681	2691001	Wow.
2693102	2694503	You know, Mario...
2695874	2701777	Water Polo or Mario... Hey, we might have some Water Polo players that kind of resent that remark you're making.
2703918	2706319	What they need is like a Mario snowboarding game.
2706339	2709120	That'd be pretty sweet.
2709200	2710421	How about another Mario Paint?
2710441	2711161	That's what I want to see.
2711381	2712702	Oh, yeah.
2712862	2718085	And where the fuck is that damn Bob Ross game that they promised us from a long-ass time ago?
2718505	2719885	Where the hell is that shit?
2719926	2720626	Did it get canceled?
2720646	2722587	Didn't we have a story on that a while back that got canceled?
2722607	2723487	It's a painting game.
2723547	2724088	Come on.
2724248	2724888	It's perfect.
2725543	2725743	All right.
2725963	2729546	And I do know that they do have a Mario snowboarding game.
2729606	2731448	It's Mario and Sonic, but whatever.
2731768	2732008	All right.
2732849	2739073	Let's move on and talk about something besides Mario, but we will stay on the topic of price drops, and we'll talk about Microsoft.
2739474	2747180	Granted, we already know that the Xbox 360 recently got a price drop, but there, of course, is a mole out there that helps out the website Ars Technica.
2747800	2774623	and apparently they had reported earlier this week that there was going to be some other types of price drops going on and apparently there's going to be a holiday bundle that includes Pure and Lego Batman with an Xbox 360 Elite kind of like a little bundle coming out over there which apparently Joystick has their own mole, that's Joystick with a Q that got a picture of what it looks like although it looks like it might be like an Australian box because of the ratings on the cover there the other ones are U.S.
2775063	2777104	Gotcha.
2778365	2781927	Once pictures surface, you kind of know that's going to happen.
2782467	2783828	I don't think it was photoshopped either.
2783848	2785749	It looked pretty legit.
2786989	2792532	Also, supposedly getting a price drop over at Microsoft's World, the 802.11n adapter.
2793413	2796534	I'm sorry, that is the new one because it's N. That's coming out for $100.
2796614	2798495	The G is getting the price drop to $79.99.
2798595	2801397	Still way too damn expensive.
2801997	2805978	for a feature that you should consider that the PlayStation 3 has built into it.
2806959	2816982	And seriously, you could go buy a wireless switch or whatever way cheaper than that, and it would work perfectly.
2817022	2818964	Yeah, I have a non-Xbox 360 router.
2819024	2826610	I have a wireless gaming router that's supposed to work with all my systems that I just basically run a Cat5 from my box to this gaming router and it works fine.
2826630	2827250	It works perfect.
2827691	2838119	And when I had my PlayStation 2 online once in a while for the DDR games that were online and Amplitude and stuff, I would just switch out the Cat5 from the Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and it worked fine.
2838139	2840721	It worked great.
2841402	2843544	And I think the original Xbox I would use that with too.
2843764	2845005	So it worked great for all those systems.
2846517	2847098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2867294	2868094	Some comments in chat.
2868174	2874156	Actdeft says there's going to be a bundle that includes the wireless adapter, a media controller, 1,000 Microsoft points, and three months of life.
2874436	2876997	Yes, and it looks like a big box of popcorn.
2878197	2878717	How cute.
2879537	2882538	I guess is that targeted at the Netflix audience?
2883418	2883858	Probably.
2884679	2885079	Probably.
2885439	2885719	All right.
2886611	2892635	Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelantradio.com as we tape on this lovely Sunday evening at allgames.com.
2892815	2897417	Now, it's not too big of a surprise, I mean, because the Japanese love their Final Fantasy.
2897798	2899899	So, of course... I love my Final Fantasy.
2900719	2901660	I'm with Japan there.
2901740	2902280	I do, too.
2902600	2906002	And, you know, announced at Tokyo Game Show to go along with the...
2907243	2910967	Gonna be, you know, epic release of Final Fantasy XIII.
2911487	2914850	Of course, the Final Fantasy XIII PlayStation 3.
2915250	2916071	Oh, but it gets better.
2916231	2919034	It's also got a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
2919074	2919294	Yes.
2919834	2921516	Apparently the FCC doesn't lie.
2922056	2922937	Oh, but wait a second.
2923317	2925259	The FCC is only in the U.S.
2925800	2927521	So maybe that's coming out over here later on.
2927681	2929923	But it is... Oh, interesting.
2930303	2932125	But it is coming out in Japan.
2932265	2932786	It's got...
2933366	2935626	Fuck, I wish I'd waited for the PlayStation 3 then.
2935666	2939027	If they're going to release a Final Fantasy XIII one here, that sounds awesome.
2939947	2941208	And it dropped in price.
2942688	2944808	But anyways, does yours have backwards compatibility?
2945048	2947729	No, I have like the crappiest PlayStation 3 possible.
2947789	2951249	It's a fat and it doesn't have backwards compatibility.
2951289	2953330	And I bought it six months before the price dropped.
2953350	2954730	I'm just praying mine doesn't die.
2955330	2956911	Because I've got full backwards compatibility.
2957051	2957731	And I use it.
2958851	2959051	Never.
2960752	2963773	Well, you know, backwards compatibility might be coming back, but that's in the future.
2964113	2965053	We'll get to that story later.
2965953	2967033	Not a big thing.
2967393	2968574	Out of price.
2969114	2976175	Anyways, so this new system is going to be coming out for 41,600 yen.
2977935	2987317	Also, it's got... It basically looks like a white, possibly silver system with a pink silk screen on it.
2987517	2987737	So...
2988936	2989616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3009205	3013971	And to go along with that, though, there's going to be some more bundles coming out.
3014451	3017675	Of course, not in the U.S., because God forbid we actually announce something over here.
3019216	3027665	They're going to be having a 250 gigabyte system for quite a few different games, including the new Ratchet & Clank, Kraken Time.
3028927	3029427	Also...
3030529	3035633	Assassin's Creed 2, FIFA 10, Need for Speed Shift, and Uncharted 2.
3036573	3040716	And these are all kind of leaked out of a Norwegian GameStop database.
3043678	3044018	Wow.
3044299	3044559	Yes.
3045079	3051163	And so you better believe if the Norwegian... If they're getting it over there, we're probably going to get it over here.
3052284	3053605	Maybe not that many bundles.
3053625	3056067	That'd be really freaking crazy, but...
3058692	3059672	I'm sure we'll get something.
3059692	3061814	They're going to announce something in time for Christmas.
3062254	3065056	Just to cash in on that, I guess.
3066317	3066618	I don't know.
3067478	3071821	Well, you know, if you see Xbox 360 getting one, you know that PlayStation 3 is going to have one as well.
3073102	3073783	Not necessarily.
3073803	3074844	I mean, they do one every year.
3074884	3077285	They've done it for the last three years with the Xbox 360.
3079047	3084651	This year, they're actually... Because the arcade, I think, last year had one game bundled with it, and then the other ones had two.
3084771	3085852	They had the Kung Fu Panda...
3086825	3090148	and Lego Indiana Jones.
3090408	3092669	These games we had a million extra copies of sitting over here.
3094231	3095912	Actually, the Lego one sold pretty good, huh?
3095992	3097613	But that Kung Fu Panda couldn't have been a huge...
3098427	3099448	It's actually supposed to be pretty good.
3099628	3099848	Is it?
3100008	3100168	Yeah.
3100228	3101749	All right, fair enough.
3101929	3102269	I'll shut up.
3102289	3104091	It's like my kid's first action game.
3104411	3104671	All right.
3106132	3113676	Loki is now going to take us to the next story, which is probably, in my opinion, I think kind of the biggest news story this week, even though it is a huge fat rumor, right?
3114277	3115538	It's not a fat rumor.
3115598	3116758	It's absolutely true.
3116798	3120381	And the reason why it's absolutely true is it's coming from Sega's FTP site.
3120421	3122942	It just got leaked out there, and they're like, oh, shit.
3123442	3123963	Pulled it back.
3124443	3125364	But it's absolutely true.
3125424	3128345	It's their minutes from a meeting that they had.
3128645	3136129	Now, there's a few things in there that don't really make any sense, but for a while, though, they did have a link straight to that file on their FTP site.
3136149	3137530	Were you able to grab it when it was up there?
3137830	3138630	I wasn't able to grab it.
3138670	3139431	I wasn't able to get it either.
3139451	3144814	But they have it basically transposed on here, so it's everything.
3146078	3148099	But here's what it did entail, though.
3148459	3149780	Lots of new... Wait, back up.
3149820	3153982	So this was from a meeting between Sega and Sony, apparently, that occurred.
3154022	3155543	This was like the minutes... August 6th.
3155643	3156804	...we're sitting up in the FTP.
3156984	3161987	I guess August 5th was when the meeting was, and then August 6th they kind of, you know...
3163408	3164449	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3187031	3188012	So, the motion controller.
3188732	3190134	They were talking a little bit about that.
3190294	3192936	A lot of stuff that was pretty much at Tokyo Game Show.
3193256	3196279	Mentioning it's coming out in the spring, which I think they've already mentioned anyways.
3196299	3205406	You know, seeing that they can differentiate with a different PlayStation SKU or something like that with it.
3206647	3208588	Talking about Alpha Protocol, Planet 51.
3209069	3210890	Let me see here.
3210910	3211971	Let's get through the good stuff.
3212051	3212752	Do-do-do-do-do.
3215437	3216278	Uh, let's see.
3216338	3218300	PlayStation 2 emulator for PlayStation 3.
3218680	3219421	Confidential!
3219701	3220422	Don't leak this out.
3221102	3225606	Apparently they want to sell all PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.
3226066	3227087	See how that works.
3227588	3236375	Why bother giving you a free update that includes the emulator for your system when we can sell you every single game all over again for a price?
3237296	3241117	But it's weird, they're gonna, I mean, you know, we kind of saw this coming.
3241758	3247760	But isn't it weird, though, that they're gonna have some PlayStation 3s out there that can just do it, and some that can't?
3248100	3261345	I would hope that, I mean, if they were sporting like that, I would hope that they would actually update it like they did with the PlayStation... Well, actually, I think the original PlayStation 3s had the PlayStation 1 emulation already built into it, so...
3262506	3263006	They still do.
3263246	3264646	Mine will still play PS1 games.
3264666	3267207	Yeah, they'll still play it because the software emulation is built in there.
3267227	3273808	But this is something they could add with a patch if it's running through software where you could be able to play the PlayStation 2 games straight from your drive.
3275108	3276889	They're just not because they're assholes.
3276909	3277429	Well, we don't know.
3278189	3279569	But we're assuming.
3279869	3281029	You are making an assumption here.
3281149	3282149	We don't know this for sure.
3282209	3283730	And the memo's not even out.
3283910	3290471	But we're kind of making an assumption based on just how long we've been following the gaming industry and what we just kind of expect is going to happen.
3291266	3295050	Sony's going to find a way to cash in on this, and that's why.
3295190	3299775	I don't anticipate them being generous with that.
3300276	3311407	Do you remember a theory I had a while ago that the PSP Go – because I was like, why the hell – I mean, honestly, we're trying to find reasons to buy a PSP Go, and we can't think of anything –
3312068	3315370	Don't get me wrong, PSP 3000, I can think of plenty of reasons to get that.
3315690	3319412	PSP Go, can't really think of one, unless you need a smaller system.
3319592	3320272	I guess that would be one.
3320793	3324415	But I theorized a while ago, what if the PS2 games you can only play on the PSP Go?
3324755	3329597	But the thought is, no, there's no real change in the hardware on the PSP Go, so what have you.
3332428	3341255	That would make a little more sense to me and it's a little weird that they are going to lose one big perk about the PS1 games paying for them on the PlayStation Network because that is one thing you can't do.
3341396	3344838	Even if you have the PS1 disc, you can't just beam it to your PSP.
3345499	3347340	You can only do that with the downloaded ones.
3348161	3353986	And the thing I could see them adding the backwards compatibility because really the PlayStation 2 is at the end of its life cycle.
3354867	3359091	A lot of game series already have cut their PlayStation 2 versions.
3359571	3360832	It's slowly dying out.
3360892	3362414	It'll probably be gone by the end of next year.
3363014	3365136	But I don't know.
3365216	3367278	It's just interesting.
3368257	3370839	All right, and then other things that's interesting.
3370859	3376044	They were talking about the possibility of import games coming out over here, which is kind of neat.
3376804	3380107	So it might be neat to see some of those over there.
3380808	3383830	And they're saying that also with the PlayStation 2 emulation,
3387113	3400058	I guess they're saying, now this doesn't make any sense because it's all abbreviated, but it says, for company marketing money show, PlayStation 3 controller on TV ads, similar to EA Sports Spot, since you don't even know what the hell that means.
3402419	3410103	PSP titles, massive franchises, I don't know.
3410503	3411183	Get to the good stuff.
3411203	3411243	Uh,
3415011	3416652	I don't know, all this is pretty boring.
3416772	3418073	What about the Dreamcast stuff?
3418113	3419013	I remember that was in there.
3419073	3421895	Something about the Dreamcast games are going to be coming to the PlayStation 3, right?
3422395	3423336	Wasn't that something that was in there?
3423616	3426878	Yeah, I better read the abbreviated stuff here.
3429079	3432301	Definitely, they're talking about the Dreamcast stuff coming in.
3433882	3441207	The possibilities of Japanese import games and possibility of Dreamcast titles on the PlayStation Network.
3442230	3442490	X-Box 360 X-Box 360
3466289	3467229	I wouldn't buy a game for $100.
3467449	3469030	I don't care how many Sonic games it has on there.
3469410	3474771	I just want to say, I don't think the DC Dreamcast emulator is as big of a deal as some might make it out to be.
3474811	3478512	Because there already are ways out there that you can get the Dreamcast games emulated.
3478692	3481653	Like GameTap has some of the Dreamcast games available on it.
3482033	3484354	And since the PS3 is supposed to basically be a computer, right?
3484774	3486454	And the Xbox 360 is to an extent too.
3486814	3489075	It's not surprising that they're able to emulate Dreamcast on it.
3489235	3492216	And they are giving them the option to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.
3492256	3497819	It says if we give them a long period of exclusivity, they will give us more marketing support.
3498299	3504521	And it says if we provide a list of Dreamcast titles, Sony will let us know which ones they're interested in having exclusively.
3505602	3508783	So there may be some that you see exclusive because they're going to go where the money is.
3509223	3510264	So it makes perfect sense.
3511304	3514085	How about a patch that lets me on PS3 read my Dreamcast discs?
3514145	3514826	Wouldn't that be amazing?
3516574	3519335	Yeah, too bad the Dreamcast discs are a proprietary technology.
3519355	3521256	I know that's not going to happen, but a man can dream.
3521296	3522356	Not that proprietary.
3522396	3525457	I mean, shit, I can read them on my computer.
3525517	3533039	Wasn't there something special to them, though, where you had to compress some Dreamcast games to fit on a CD because they actually held somewhere between a CD and a DVD?
3533480	3534840	It was like GD-ROM or something, right?
3535280	3537961	Yeah, that was the whole thing they were saying.
3538361	3540102	Oh, I'm thinking Saturn, my mistake.
3542276	3543438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3563403	3564244	Yeah, interesting.
3564364	3565105	All that's true.
3567807	3570930	I think a lot of it is still, you have to consider, is in negotiation.
3571350	3574473	That doesn't mean all of this is happening tomorrow or at the end of the year.
3574613	3580898	A lot of this, you know, you were talking about talks between two companies, and this whole leak might also change things dramatically.
3581379	3587183	You know, heads are rolling over this shit right now about the fact that this got out on the internet, whoever uploaded it.
3588736	3589716	Even if it was an accident.
3589856	3590677	I mean, it's going to be huge.
3591257	3593519	And could actually damage the relationship between the two companies.
3593879	3600024	Although I think ultimately, you know... Sony just can't keep a secret.
3600844	3602886	To be fair, neither can Microsoft.
3603206	3603767	Well, I know.
3603827	3604387	I understand that.
3604427	3605148	But like, you know...
3606058	3609382	A big nugget like that, you know, with backwards compatibility.
3609723	3612066	They really got screwed at E3 this year.
3612126	3617633	Remember how Jack Trenton came out there and he was like, Hey, there's one thing you didn't spoil, Final Fantasy XIV, huh?
3617913	3619135	You didn't see that one coming, did you?
3619616	3622720	Everything else we got screwed on, but at least we got to wow you once.
3624981	3625681	Remember that?
3626962	3629283	Hey, speaking of Sony, it is official.
3629403	3639027	There will be no UMD conversion program for the PSP Go, meaning if you wanted to convert your UMD discs, they were talking about this whole, you know, you could do a kiosk and all this stuff.
3639247	3640108	Eh, not happening.
3640668	3644170	It all boils down to, and actually, the way it's phrased kind of makes sense.
3644210	3645030	Let me read the quote here.
3645450	3649052	We were evaluating a UMD conversion program due to legal and technical reasons.
3649092	3651033	We will not be offering the program at this time.
3651333	3655394	This was a Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson in an interview with Kotaku.
3656995	3664358	But not surprising, the reasons that kind of when you further get into it have to do with the game distribution licensing and probably the agreements with the developers.
3664839	3666179	It actually makes sense.
3666379	3667300	I mean, it does and it doesn't.
3668300	3669321	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3685257	3685817	and DarkSakura.com.
3700345	3701825	by March 31st, 2010.
3702306	3707507	And I think you have to connect your old PSP model to the PlayStation Network.
3707947	3710508	So it's like they know you have both, basically.
3710548	3711808	It's not just for buying the machine.
3711828	3713048	You have to connect your old one.
3713409	3717670	You will get three free UMD... I'm sorry, UMD-less games.
3718070	3719350	But they are from a list.
3719510	3720491	You don't get any old games.
3720511	3728073	You have to pick from a list that includes Killzone Liberation, Wipeout Pure, Patapon, some of the BuzzBrain and BuzzMaster games, and so forth.
3730809	3732949	It's more of an incentive than we're getting here, at least.
3733830	3739551	But still, even with the three free games, I'm kind of sitting here going, So let me get this straight.
3740171	3741871	Your system is more expensive.
3742291	3746272	There's no way for me to transfer my old games that I bought to this new system.
3747672	3749472	The system doesn't do anything differently.
3750773	3752673	I can't play my UMD games on it.
3756513	3759314	But it's chic, and it's new technology, and it fits in your pocket.
3760094	3760534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3786055	3786776	And then that's it.
3786836	3787977	It's going to die a slow death.
3788317	3790139	I think the system is going to bomb terribly.
3790280	3792482	And I'm not saying that as a fanboy.
3792582	3801652	I'm saying that as a I can imagine people going into their local GameStop or GameCrazy just knowing the type of people that usually work there at the front desk making decent recommendations.
3801952	3804455	There's going to be a lot of these people that say, you know what?
3804935	3805495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3823860	3824720	That's where it comes in.
3824880	3825601	A credit card.
3825641	3828442	You need a credit card or these points cards in order to get it.
3828462	3829942	And the parents are going to say, fuck that.
3830002	3836025	And it's in GameStop or GameCrazy's best interest to sell the ones that require the discs anyway, right?
3836565	3838726	And on top of that, I mean, come on.
3838946	3845528	On top of that, and I hope this doesn't happen over here because really it's just like, you did what?
3846529	3848970	On top of that, they're dropping the price to the $3,000.
3850797	3851137	What?!
3852078	3853259	Are you stupid?!
3853279	3856002	I mean, the system's more expensive.
3856142	3860525	Oh, let's... Well, no, that's great, because the PSP 3000 is the system you should be getting.
3860806	3861186	Exactly.
3861206	3862427	And I would recommend you get it.
3862647	3874557	Exactly, but it's like you're not gonna sell more PSP Go's if... It's like they're putting it out there to get people to go, well, you know, hey, I want a PlayStation Portable, but I'm not buying this Go, I'm gonna buy the 3000.
3874617	3877980	Ha, we tricked you, you bought a PlayStation Portable.
3878701	3878761	Um...
3880724	3903383	I can't see any GameStop employee recommending the PSP Go when they can say you can get $3,000 and you can get a game or two for the same price which would look better under the stocking I think the system with a couple games I'm very curious to see how the sales figures look this system comes out this week right?
3904474	3906475	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3926804	3927865	Puzzle Quest was basically Bejeweled anyways.
3927905	3928065	Right.
3954346	3956167	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3980505	3981427	Well, we'll see.
3981487	3984593	She's been playing Bejeweled Blitz like fucking crazy.
3984613	3986216	I know, she's been beating my scores.
3986516	3988700	She's been just sitting there playing it all the time.
3988720	3989041	It's addictive.
3989201	3989722	It's addictive.
3989802	3990303	I'm telling you.
3991104	3991265	Here...
3992535	3993415	Don't Discount Facebook Gaming
4012799	4013720	Look at your friends list.
4013780	4017303	If you have non-gamers at your friends list, look at the amount of Facebook games they're playing.
4017643	4020926	And the moms playing Farm Town and Bejeweled Blitz.
4022647	4024469	Gamers, look out.
4024609	4026471	This Facebook games thing is going to be huge.
4027071	4029693	Hopefully there's some good news for us in there too, but I'm just saying.
4030334	4031555	Even I play Bejeweled Blitz.
4032395	4032836	It's fun.
4033376	4034597	It's a nice little time waster.
4034637	4035298	It's only a minute.
4037185	4039007	I can totally respect what PopCap is doing.
4039147	4042149	Actually, they're a pretty cool company, all things considered.
4043670	4044171	Alright, anyhow.
4044851	4045192	Moving on.
4046193	4048034	Yes.
4048815	4049916	So, let's see.
4051735	4052135	and DarkSakura.
4076175	4082158	And it's funny, we're actually clearing out some old-ass games that we've been just sitting on.
4082498	4088020	And one of the games that we have is the Jonas Brothers, or not the Jonas Brothers, it's the Naked Brothers Band.
4088460	4092482	They had a karaoke game, but we're selling it for like five bucks.
4093242	4094423	I forgot that was even a musician.
4094443	4101426	Exactly, but it's got a USB microphone, and a lot of those USB microphones, regardless of what system they're on, will work with Rock Band 2.
4101886	4104227	We used, at my birthday party...
4104847	4108930	The old PlayStation 2 Karaoke Revolution mic worked flawlessly.
4110031	4116076	I noticed at Fry's, next to the Rock Band 2 games, they sell just regular USB mics in the same section.
4116116	4119819	Seriously, if you got a microphone from Karaoke Revolution, pretty much anything.
4120299	4123001	Because they're all using those stupid Logitech mics.
4124102	4124923	Just give it a shot.
4125223	4126064	It probably will work.
4126764	4127965	If you're looking for an extra mic.
4128765	4136090	Anyways, so beyond all that stuff, they've also added in some new... They tweaked the hammer-ons and pull-offs.
4137031	4142894	Apparently something that they had improved for the Beals Rock Band is now being added into Rock Band 2.
4143495	4152000	And also Audition Mode, which will allow people on the Rock Band Network to be able to upload the songs that they've created from their PCs to test them out in the game.
4152601	4155843	So before they upload them into Rock Band Network and stuff like that,
4156363	4157364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4186653	4197848	and also I guess in the sort menu you may now arrange the songs according to star rating that you've achieved in each of them and also unplayed songs will be grouped together accordingly.
4198949	4199530	So that's kind of cool.
4202697	4203577	Taiko no Tatoujin
4222865	4224965	Tycho Drummaster Tycho Drummaster
4251991	4252371	DarkSakura
4271769	4272710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4292617	4293858	Scratch, The Ultimate DJ.
4293958	4308944	Man, haven't heard about that game in a while, but they've announced a few more tracks coming out available now, including, and of course this is all going to be R&B stuff, Push It, Salt-N-Pepa, Friends, Houdini.
4309344	4311005	I hope it's the Glee version of Push It.
4313083	4313844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4336666	4343928	Gifted, starring NASA, featuring Kanye West, Santo Gold, and Like Lee.
4345268	4349729	I'm going to let you finish, but Hip Hop Master was the best hip hop game in the US of all time.
4350870	4359692	Looking Fly, by The Mers, Skanky Panky, Kid Koala, Iced Lightning, by RJD2,
4361723	4365290	They Reminisce Over You by Pete Rock and Seal Smooth.
4367133	4369077	And Life in a Cage by The Knucks.
4370159	4370841	And of course that...
4372415	4377557	Also is added to the previously announced artists and licensed tracks, which I'll read now since there's only four of them.
4377937	4380438	Peter Piper, Run DMC, Feel Good Inc.
4380478	4384459	by The Gorillas, Hot In Here by Nelly, and Mastermind by Deltron 3030.
4386099	4391901	As much as this isn't my preferred genre of music, there are some very catchy, dancey party songs in here.
4392301	4393962	I am curious about this game.
4394362	4400404	This is yet another one that got pushed back to 2010, though, after the whole lawsuit and mess and studio change and all that, right?
4400424	4400724	Yeah.
4401144	4402125	It's probably a good thing anyways.
4402145	4404287	There's too many damn music games coming out this fall.
4405808	4406528	Alright, fair enough.
4407309	4413454	Alright, well guys, we are getting towards the end of Part A tonight, but not before we cover the classic video game of the week.
4416437	4417597	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4440003	4440483	DarkSakura.com
4458942	4462445	I fucking love Railroad Tycoon because it was made by Sid Meier.
4462565	4465327	And you know he is a god amongst PC gaming.
4465668	4467369	He made the Civilization series.
4468010	4475095	He made a game I actually really like a lot on the PC that I almost picked for tonight, but I couldn't find a good YouTube of it anywhere called Covert Action.
4475496	4477157	And when I was thinking about it, I was like, you know what?
4477237	4481961	Railroad Tycoon, especially the deluxe version, I spent hours upon hours playing this as a kid.
4481981	4483622	So let me tell you a little bit about Railroad Tycoon.
4483642	4483843	Here we go.
4484775	4485395	SID MEIER'S RAILROAD TYCOON
4503982	4532821	You could even do England, Europe, whatever You basically manage the business, you manage where the trains are going to go You build industries and basically transport goods from one end to another It's kind of a strategical game But it was cool because you kind of built your own little empire And it was very kind of single player They didn't have a lot of multiplayer in it That didn't show up really until Civilization, kind of a little later on But it was a cool little strategy game that you could kind of play on your own
4533161	4534922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4553396	4582462	by the way the original Railroad Tycoon and one reason I bring this up is the classic game of the week it is actually free because when they went back and released a sequel to the game later on called Railroads they actually made the original Railroad Tycoon free and I'm not sure if you can still get it on the website but it was basically free out there on the internet for you to download so you can hear some ambient music of building the tracks between the different towns there it looks like right now they're playing on a South African map and they're kind of connecting Johannesburg with some other towns there um
4583422	4587565	Railroad Tycoon, of course, got a reskinning and a redone version called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.
4587605	4588666	That was released in 93.
4589467	4597633	It basically upped the graphics from the, like, 16 color level they were at in the original to more VGA graphics, but unfortunately the game was very buggy.
4598053	4603878	I don't remember it being super buggy, but they do say that the game ended up getting very buggy in certain parts of the ending.
4604238	4604838	SIDMAYER SIDMAYER
4628835	4631236	Railroad Tycoon 3 had a full 3D environment.
4631256	4639700	You could build overpasses, tunnels, totally improved graphics, but honestly, none of the sequels really kind of, I think, reached the way the original did.
4640020	4642481	Sid Meier did come back to do a sequel to the game in 2006.
4642901	4644602	It was Sid Meier's Railroads.
4645322	4647964	It was basically different scenarios and trains that you could do.
4648544	4650465	It was a little less focused on industry.
4650945	4657388	It had a more streamlined interface for doing the track laying, but it was more focused on the full 3D graphics and some real-time gameplay.
4657808	4684793	so that is my classic game of the week I know there's not a whole lot else to say about it but I think it's a game you just kind of have to check out it is very yes choo-choo it was fun to kind of build the different buildings and watch your station get bigger and bigger and watch the new trains because you get to pick the cars that were with it and how much they would transport it's very much a micromanaging game but it's a lot of fun and one of my favorite strategy games of all time Railroad Tycoon the one I spent the most time on was Railroad Tycoon Deluxe
4685794	4688839	We'll just call the whole Railroad Tycoon series my classic game of the week.
4688899	4690923	Did you ever play Railroad Tycoon, Loki?
4691584	4691925	No.
4692045	4692145	No?
4692165	4693708	Did you play any of the Sid Meier games at all?
4696258	4697499	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4719512	4723535	There's this little train that they drive around the complex that little kids get to ride it.
4723555	4724676	And it's not on a track or anything.
4724716	4726358	It just kind of drives around and takes kids on.
4726698	4728800	But I was convinced that the train was trying to run over me.
4729360	4731742	So I was like, Melody, we've got to run away from the train.
4731802	4732282	It's coming.
4733123	4733623	It's coming.
4733703	4743771	And she was laughing her ass off because I was really, really drunk at this place called the Alcatraz Brewery, which really cracked me up because it was like –
4747334	4766863	that's what it felt like because you know we're from Northern California we go to San Francisco a lot I'm sure it was kind of funny seeing like the big replica of the Golden Gate inside the building and just all this stuff all the little tie-ins with NorCal terms so it's cute so there you go anyhow sorry for my tangent that was your classic game of the week Railroad Tycoon
4767762	4771544	We're going to take a quick break, but we will be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4771584	4772744	We are not done yet.
4772764	4787030	We've got more news coming up in Part B. Part B tonight, we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news, including another big game delayed until 2010, PlayStation Room we're going to talk about after the break, and World of Warcraft went down for a couple months.
4787550	4790791	Thank God it didn't happen here, or places probably would have burned down.
4791191	4795013	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4801773	4809202	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, September the 27th of 2009 for the second half of our show.
4809242	4814387	The tape's live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
4814728	4818132	They've got a lot of great programming every night at All Games Radio.
4818252	4820554	I know they even have some new shows and I think they're...
4821035	4821776	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4849395	4850576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4871021	4877227	Dude, that guy, Jeremy Soul, I don't know if it's Soul or Soleil, he does some awesome orchestral music.
4877467	4881510	I think, just between that and Oblivion, I really enjoy his stuff.
4881550	4883432	It really sounds like kind of listening to a movie.
4883853	4886335	Sometimes, I want to play Guild Wars sometimes just to hear the music.
4886655	4887296	It's pretty awesome.
4888176	4892598	I just wanted to give him props, because I think he did some really great work there.
4892638	4894138	And I think he did the music for Prey, too.
4894458	4896759	And that was one of the best parts of Prey, was the soundtrack.
4896799	4906703	I know a lot of people didn't play that game, but it was actually... All things considered, that was a shooting game made for people that really fucking suck at shooters, and so it was perfect.
4906743	4907743	It just ended abruptly.
4907823	4909203	The story kind of just cut off.
4909443	4916146	I think development was probably cut off of that game, because that game was going on Duke Nukem Forever time...
4917086	4921247	Final Fantasy VIII is out on the PlayStation Network in Japan
4945356	4948397	Disney, there was that rumor of the Epic Mickey game.
4948717	4953619	Well, Disney is set to make an announcement in London on the 28th of October.
4954319	4959201	People think it's going to be this announcement.
4959601	4964683	And also, apparently there was also a teaser in Game Informer saying that this announcement is coming as well.
4964743	4968164	So, could it be something that's on the cover of the next Game Informer?
4969212	4969632	God of War 3 Demo
4985653	4986554	Check out the demos.
4986634	4990998	Sweeten the pot a little bit for the people who already own God of War 1 and 2.
4991298	4991718	Exactly.
4991959	4995862	And I think you definitely owe it to yourself to play these games if you haven't yet.
4997683	4998884	That'd be worth checking out, I think.
4999985	5002487	And finally, something for free.
5002928	5008452	Yes, if you have LittleBigPlanet, you will be able to soon pick up Viking costumes for your Sackboy.
5009173	5011615	And these will be coming soon.
5012975	5017138	And they've actually got a website that you need to go to to go through this.
5017578	5022802	It's Family Zone, which is, I guess, a cross promotion with Sony Pictures.
5023603	5026605	And you're going to be able to, I guess...
5029114	5031676	Go to their website, and they actually have a link here.
5032417	5033998	Actually, it's the PlayStation site.
5034198	5040662	US.PlayStation.com slash SonyWonderGames And then you just go there.
5040943	5046006	There's a button to redeem a code, and you can get the free Viking costumes.
5046827	5049709	So it's not something you can just go on PlayStation Network and download, unfortunately.
5049729	5050169	No, apparently not.
5050209	5050950	Oh, that's stupid.
5052411	5052771	Whatever.
5052791	5053652	Cross-promotion, I guess.
5054645	5060307	Well, as Loki spoiled earlier in the show, there is a little bit of crossover going on between Ninja Gaiden and Dynasty Warriors.
5060867	5065248	And that's, of course, because of the Tecmo-Koei merger that happened not that long ago.
5066208	5071370	Ryu Hayabusa is actually going to be an unlockable character in Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.
5071870	5073670	But that's not where the love stops.
5074190	5080132	Apparently, there's going to be unlockable Zhao Yun and Sung Shang Xiang costumes in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
5080492	5082313	Yes, I'm sure I completely butchered those names.
5082353	5082693	Deal with it.
5083273	5083333	Um...
5084516	5087774	There's going to be a lot of crossover happening there, I'm sure, to no one's surprise.
5089443	5119081	Blur was a racing game I was very much looking forward to this year and I will just have to look forward to it a little longer it has been delayed to 2010 with a host of quite a few other games that have been delayed to 2010 which is now looking pretty full the delay happened because according to Activision CEO Mike Griffith they need to quote fully optimize the vision Bazaar set out to create for Blur including a distinctive and groundbreaking multiplayer mode that will appeal to a broad audience I take that to mean multiplayer was fucked and they needed to fix it
5119261	5130508	I also take that as we're not going to compete with ourselves and decide to push Blur back a little longer since they're the ones releasing Modern Warfare 2 and it's supposed to be coming out around the same time, within a week.
5130768	5131328	That makes sense.
5131988	5132569	If they've
5134870	5136731	Did it for that reason, then F them.
5137051	5141252	But if they did it for the reason that they needed to go back and make multiplayer better, that's cool.
5141312	5150716	Because, you know, I'm sure if it came out and the multiplayer was screwed up, bitching upon bitching on the blogs about how borked multiplayer is and we need to patch immediately, etc.
5150796	5153217	So, you know, if it's truly to fix multiplayer, then fine.
5153417	5159319	I've never remembered the multiplayer in Project Gotham being too bad, so I can't imagine that that would be really an issue.
5159419	5163821	But, hey, give them the extra time, whether it be for, you know...
5164221	5165942	I think there's room for more than one
5184631	5190395	A lot of games are kind of like, you know, there's going to be a lot of people buying Modern Warfare 2.
5190475	5192776	Let's move our game a little away from it.
5193397	5195438	Like Smackdown vs. Raw 2010.
5195698	5197459	Normally a title comes out in the middle of November.
5197679	5199120	Now it's coming out in the middle of October.
5199741	5201002	Which is a little bit of a surprise.
5201222	5204604	But not with Modern Warfare 2 being there.
5205834	5206234	Grynn Studios
5236054	5236514	Thanks for watching!
5257020	5258281	And who's cashing in on this?
5258301	5258461	Konami
5277324	5278325	Are they the ones behind it?
5278385	5278986	Go, Konami.
5279427	5280128	Oh, boy.
5280568	5280969	Yeah.
5281750	5285434	God forbid we get a good music game from them, but seeing it, Twilight.
5285454	5286856	But we get sparkling vampires.
5287297	5288779	Hey, they go where the money is.
5289159	5289700	Not a fan.
5289720	5290601	I'm sorry to be a hater.
5290701	5293785	I have some friends that are into Twilight, but I just don't get it.
5293885	5296927	Well, honestly, it's coming out before the second movie, okay?
5297508	5300810	And granted, I'm sure people that are playing this game probably read the books.
5301271	5304693	Deathwishing in our chatroom is making his thoughts very strong.
5305074	5308076	He says, kill the devs, kill them all, fucking skull fuck them.
5308877	5309978	That might be a little bit harsh.
5310018	5310858	I mean, skull fucking?
5310898	5312019	Come on, that's pretty harsh.
5312199	5312840	I'm just saying...
5314474	5319998	How much trivia can there be for Twilight movies if there's one Twilight movie out already?
5320378	5326623	And yes, this game is slated right now I think for... I want to say I thought it was October.
5326663	5328164	Probably around the release of New Moon.
5328444	5331887	But New Moon's not supposed to be coming out until after it, so either it's going to spoil the...
5332970	5336391	No, that's really going to spoil the plot of the movie because there really is no plot to the movie.
5336571	5337731	Well, and the books have been out.
5337771	5339391	You know, you can go read the book, I'm sure.
5339531	5339851	I don't know.
5339911	5341472	It's just crap.
5341512	5341992	Wait, hold on.
5342132	5344572	I've decided this story has taken up way too much time on our show.
5344652	5345172	Sorry.
5345453	5345893	Sorry.
5346653	5348513	Although I do want to read this witty comment from chat.
5348973	5351394	TigerClaw in chat says, We need a seen it OLR.
5351614	5351954	Oh, wait.
5352074	5352574	No video.
5352654	5354374	I guess you could call it hear it OLR.
5355094	5356295	Would anyone actually play that?
5356515	5356855	I don't know.
5357275	5357335	No.
5358673	5362035	Some of the listeners know the trivia of the show better than I do.
5362255	5370379	I've got this best of I've got to do next week that we're going to be taking some parts of the show and then kind of doing some new stuff with it as well.
5370960	5373261	You know where I'm going to find out where all the good bits are?
5373861	5374622	Our Wikipedia.
5374862	5378343	The OLR Wikipedia references what episode number some of the funniest stuff was in.
5378824	5386268	Like what episode the whattheyplay.com snap was in and some of these other things I'm going to kind of pull and put in there is all in there, which is nice.
5387148	5389351	Anyhow, let's get to some Twitter topics tonight.
5390172	5392154	I forgot to get the theme music for Twitter topics.
5393576	5395318	I'm just so broken tonight.
5395979	5397121	I can't multitask.
5397581	5399203	Jamie and I here is ruining everything.
5401506	5401847	Hold on.
5402247	5402688	I'm getting it.
5404089	5404490	Where is it?
5406084	5406565	Ah, forget it.
5407205	5408387	I'm not going to do theme music tonight.
5408407	5411711	Let's just get to the Twitter topics because I don't want a dead air here.
5412792	5413233	Let's see.
5413353	5414454	Going to the Twitter topics.
5416256	5417398	Wow, we got quite a few tonight.
5420290	5423251	Ray Ayanami says, here's a story that people might actually care about.
5423671	5427592	Mushi Misama Futari for 360 is going to be region-free.
5427772	5429372	A region-free 360 game.
5430153	5431953	They call it a bullet hell shooter.
5431993	5436674	He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about a shooting Xbox 360 game.
5436734	5437855	No screenshots from the gamers.
5437875	5439175	This one up here in the upper right-hand corner.
5439515	5440395	Yeah, it looks like one there.
5441116	5446117	It's going to be region-free, so this game comes out in Japan, but you would actually be able to import it here in America and play it.
5446277	5446677	That's kind of cool.
5446697	5452022	That's kind of cool because a lot of the 360 games that come out over there are not region-free, especially in Japan, man.
5452062	5454804	They're just like, fuck you guys, you ain't gonna import this shit.
5455405	5457967	And Raisin Chat right now says it is an existing arcade game.
5458007	5461610	I want to say, we saw a clip of this on an earlier show, because I'm looking at the screenshot now.
5462170	5463011	Yeah, it does look familiar.
5463031	5468836	And that's the thing that sucks, too, because my arcade cabinet, I could play vertical games, but it's such a fucking pain in the ass to do it.
5469096	5472379	You have to rotate the monitor and all that shit, and I just don't want to do that.
5473396	5479418	TigerClaw305 on Twitter wants us to mention the Florida Fugitive was apprehended after attempting to steal DS games.
5479538	5486881	He links us to an article on Joystick where apparently this guy was out there trying to steal DS games.
5487061	5489322	It was a loss prevention specialist.
5491463	5518843	got to stop this shoplifter the fugitive's name was Daniel Larson he was already wanted for violating probation and apparently he shoplifted $120 worth of Nintendo DS titles from the local Walmart but a loss prevention officer actually caught him and stopped it joystick the blog goes on to joke don't tell them about my insatiable addiction for Imagine Babies games I know you could say I planned on pawning them to buy heroin please come on then man this would ruin me
5519838	5520318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5543501	5546584	I'm not going to be able to read all the tweets tonight, but let me get to a few others here.
5546685	5552131	Ryan Belknap on Twitter wants to know, what game coming out this fall are you looking forward to buying?
5552912	5555456	For me, it would be Dragon Age and Press Your Luck.
5556036	5556637	Games this fall.
5556897	5559000	DJ Hero and Borderlands.
5560302	5561103	Oh, and of course...
5561713	5566596	I mean, because it's more of a download title, but Grand Theft Auto, The Ballad of Gay Tony.
5566976	5579724	Honestly, most everything I was looking forward to got pushed back to 2010, Blur, White Knight Chronicles, but one game that's still coming out that I am looking forward to a little bit, there was one, I just had it, and now I just get my memory.
5580444	5581525	New Super Mario Bros.?
5581545	5583266	Dang it, no, I'm not really interested in that one.
5583286	5584166	What kind of a game was it?
5584426	5585027	I don't remember.
5586188	5586928	Lego Rock Band?
5588180	5589862	DJ Hero DJ Hero DJ Hero
5603479	5603719	Actdeft.com
5621315	5622556	Oh yeah, I heard about this.
5622596	5623957	I don't think this is in our show role either.
5623997	5624837	This just came up today.
5625198	5633823	He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about apparently there's a crash screen in Need for Speed Shift that when you go into the PlayStation Store, it crashes.
5633903	5634664	Here's the funny thing.
5634744	5635104	It's on the 360.
5636465	5639145	with the PlayStation Store logo showing up and everything.
5639526	5644466	I don't know what the hell happened or what you do to get this, but apparently this is a really bad bug.
5644486	5644826	Let's see.
5645147	5648847	When navigating menus today, when connected to Xbox Live, the game suddenly crashed again.
5649147	5652608	When my rage subsided and I got a better look at the screen, I was pretty shocked at what I saw.
5653048	5657849	Was my Xbox 360 version of Need for Speed Shift really trying to access the PlayStation Store?
5658269	5659969	Microsoft's not going to be happy about this at all.
5660349	5664210	So apparently there is a bug in the game where it tries to access the PlayStation Store.
5664410	5664790	Whoops!
5665270	5665950	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5691923	5692624	360 can be fixed PlayStation Room
5712546	5716972	Interesting enough, the logo for PlayStation Room is R-Infinity-M.
5717533	5728028	You may remember way back in the day when there was a rumor, according to a trademark, that the PlayStation DualShock 3 or 6-axis was going to be, well...
5729109	5732471	We called the poos because it was P-Infinity-S.
5732872	5736834	See, I did not remember this until you said like that.
5736894	5738495	You joked that it was poos.
5738696	5740557	We did joke about this on the show a while ago.
5740977	5743599	So I'm thinking maybe that wasn't for the controller.
5743639	5748042	Maybe it was like PlayStation Infinity or some crap like that and it was actually this.
5749420	5750201	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5776294	5785198	It's like home with a big anime flair to it and really scaled down.
5786859	5788400	Neat, I guess.
5789926	5794530	Have they really said what the hell you're going to be able to do with it, or are we only seeing these screenshots of these kind of chibi characters?
5794590	5801815	Which, by the way, it should be said, even though you're saying it's kind of like Home, it doesn't really, I mean, it looks like a very, very, very much spin-off.
5801855	5804938	It's not your same characters, it's not that same 3D environment.
5805038	5812424	It looks like Home, like, you know, the Disney's, was it, um... Looks like some of the chat rooms I would see on Prodigy back in the day.
5812684	5817367	Like the Channel D stuff, or, I forget what they call it, on, um...
5818248	5821789	D-Gamer, that's what it was, on the Disney's DS titles.
5822009	5823790	It's very similar to Xbox Live.
5824030	5826311	It's not, but it's a similar type of service.
5826631	5830832	Funny enough, Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, wasn't that like three years ago that that joke happened?
5831272	5833493	He says, wait, I've been listening to this train wreck for three years now?
5833853	5836514	I mean, maybe it was, I don't think it was quite three years ago.
5836534	5837975	It was before the PlayStation 3 came out.
5838075	5838555	Oh, wow.
5839115	5841676	Because, remember, we were, like, were they going to call the controller?
5843014	5843976	The Poohs The Poohs
5859892	5863215	But what has PlayStation Home really done for PlayStation?
5863275	5868500	Even though I got a plug that we do have a club on PlayStation Home, and there's got to be a good handful of people in it now.
5868580	5870161	I've been getting slow requests for invites.
5871122	5871562	I don't know.
5872143	5872463	Nothing.
5873444	5874926	I can't imagine this would be too popular.
5874946	5877468	I mean, yay, you can be able to run around in Avatar and stuff, but...
5879818	5880798	I did check out this week.
5880838	5881779	I did sign into home.
5881819	5882159	I don't know.
5882259	5884900	Home's one of those things I'll just kind of poke around in if I'm really bored.
5885620	5889782	I did check out the new SingStar space in home and it's a little ridiculous.
5890942	5892423	Graphically, it looks pretty cool.
5892503	5895304	It looks like a nightclub and it's laid out like a nightclub.
5895664	5898485	Graphically, it's kind of cool, but you log in there, there's really not a lot to do.
5898945	5902287	You do all the different dances on the dance floor and you get three shirts.
5902847	5903207	That's it.
5904268	5908409	I just quickly go through the character and do all ten dances or whatever.
5908489	5910310	And then you get shirts to pimp out their products.
5910590	5910950	Awesome.
5911250	5911650	Exactly.
5912831	5913131	That's it.
5914631	5917052	I gotta say though, it was nice to look at for a few minutes.
5917072	5919053	I was like, oh hey, they put a little work into this.
5919073	5924155	This actually kind of looks like a nightclub and I like how when you dance, the little spotlight on the floor is different colors and it's all high def.
5924535	5925055	Looks cool.
5925075	5926176	Okay, done now.
5928069	5932932	Not sure exactly what I gained out of this, except I guess maybe knowledge of the SingStar product.
5933012	5933412	I don't know.
5933912	5941516	They have a little video wall that'll circle through different music videos that are in the game, and you can actually pick which video you want to come up next on the wall.
5941756	5942457	But here's the catch.
5942617	5944278	It's a 30-second clip of videos.
5944678	5948960	It's not even like the full, like, you can't touch this, or baby one more time.
5950081	5951822	Just these 30 seconds of it, not the whole clip.
5953868	5954229	That's true.
5954269	5957976	Jay Dizzle in chat reminds us, Home gave us hamsters versus humans dance-offs.
5957996	5958597	How could I forget?
5958878	5961924	And now there's a whole nightclub you can do it in, in the SingStar space.
5962185	5963267	So, how could I forget?
5965816	5967657	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5987150	5988471	The transfer is all done now.
5988591	5996938	Chinese MMO players can now get back on to World of Warcraft, which might not be the biggest game in China, but I guess it does definitely have their following over there.
5997218	6002122	I'm sure that took a big chunk out of their economy since all the gold farming and everything.
6002782	6006124	Well, NetEase, by the way... Well, no, they'd log into the American servers to do that.
6006725	6008526	It's not mixed like Final Fantasy XI is.
6008886	6010508	China has their own servers.
6010528	6012289	Because remember, they don't have Undead.
6012709	6019134	They have the Forsaken, which is just the unskinned Undead with more skin or whatever.
6019694	6021996	But anyhow, here's the other thing I want to point out.
6022216	6027339	Apparently, the servers are... To give you an idea how many people are playing, the servers are expensive to maintain.
6027700	6029121	They have to pay a million...
6030316	6037359	of their Chinese dollars a day, which boils down to about $146,000 a day to keep the servers running.
6038199	6042440	But, you know, China's a pretty big country, and the game obviously is doing very well there.
6042841	6046442	But then I was thinking, oh my god, three and a half months this game was down.
6046782	6054165	Can you imagine, what would happen if World of Warcraft, and I opened this question up to chat as well, what would happen if World of Warcraft shut down?
6054345	6054525	Just...
6055265	6060007	All of a sudden, out of the blue, World of Warcraft shuts down for three months in America.
6060148	6061388	It would rain cats and dogs.
6061688	6067151	With no rhyme or reason, just Blizzard, the server facility just goes kaput.
6067471	6068972	I don't know what happens.
6069012	6070453	Nobody gets charged for it or anything.
6070493	6076276	Nothing malicious happens, but just World of Warcraft gets revoked for all the 11 million players or whatever for three and a half months.
6076396	6077356	What would happen?
6077396	6079137	The internet would be in a shitstorm.
6079177	6081758	They'd be just like, fucking bitch!
6081798	6084680	Just complaining like you would not believe.
6086616	6088638	DarkTetsuya says, divorce rates go down.
6090319	6092741	Actdeft says, I already said it, massive tantrums.
6092901	6094062	Oh yes, there will be many a blog.
6094462	6095563	Many an angry blog.
6097164	6099105	People threatening to quit and never return.
6099646	6101127	Go to Aeon.
6101227	6102428	Go to Aeon, possibly.
6104029	6108092	Ray Ayanami says, whatever, I'm going to keep on playing not MMOs.
6108853	6113997	Rama says, if World of Warcraft shuts down for three months, people would return to real life and shit would get done.
6114977	6116620	Jay Dizzle says, Mom, bathroom.
6117882	6121609	Deathwishing says, remember that episode of Robot Chicken where a virus deletes all the prawn?
6122630	6123372	Could you imagine that?
6123412	6125736	A computer virus that just targets World of Warcraft?
6126477	6127078	Let me put it this way.
6127748	6135294	If there was ever a virus out there, conceivable, to actually delete all the porn on the internet at one time, who would do that?
6135875	6137736	That's just mean.
6138217	6141359	Second off, you know how fast porn gets on the internet?
6141499	6142180	It wouldn't matter.
6142380	6145903	The porn would be back up to the levels it is now in like a day.
6147824	6149346	It would just be like, porn back!
6149366	6152248	It's like, was it gone?
6152648	6153429	Didn't even realize it.
6153569	6154710	Oh, all new porn, sweet.
6157204	6164021	Do you think there would be... The sad thing is, I think for a lot of people... They would cover this on...
6164884	6165425	CNN.
6165605	6167646	It would be in the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.
6168387	6169008	It really would.
6169728	6171690	World of Warcraft went down today.
6172170	6174673	What about Twitter going down for three months?
6174853	6175974	Or Facebook going down for three months?
6175994	6176414	Fuck Twitter.
6176454	6179477	I'm so over Twitter.
6179897	6181058	Remember Friendster?
6181539	6184441	Friendster was what we had before MySpace, before Facebook.
6184461	6185963	Apparently it's still popular in Asia.
6186903	6188265	Friendster is what we used to have.
6189306	6191728	When that went down, people went somewhere else.
6193109	6197390	But Friendster was not quite as integrated into culture as I think Facebook has become.
6197770	6200731	You know, people's mothers didn't have a Friendster account.
6200791	6202111	Just, you know, college kids had it.
6203432	6204872	People's mothers have Facebooks.
6204912	6208173	You know, what would happen if Facebook went down for three months?
6209473	6211073	People would go back to MySpace, maybe.
6211814	6212794	I think a lot of people would.
6213654	6217575	Let's see, BaconBits says, if WoW was shut down for three months, the internet speeds would go faster.
6219727	6219987	Nice.
6220307	6220687	Very true.
6221127	6224869	Deathwishing says kids would run out in the streets going, God damn it, my raid was halfway done.
6224909	6226549	I lost my epics.
6229970	6232611	So a lot of people seem to speculate people would just go somewhere else.
6233071	6239533	I think that, you know, as much of, you know, fandom as World of Warcraft gets, people are fickle.
6239793	6242174	If it goes away for a while, they'll leave.
6242514	6243935	Then when it comes back, they'll come right back.
6244275	6245155	But, you know, it's just...
6246246	6247427	They need to be doing something.
6247527	6251730	And if they're going to be MMO players, they're going to go play another MMO or play something else.
6251750	6254732	They're not just going to go outside and go, Oh my God, there's a world out here.
6255032	6256173	What have I done with my life?
6257959	6258859	Hey, World Warcraft's back!
6258980	6259280	Oh shit!
6280280	6282141	You have so many businesses out there.
6282181	6286762	Think about the online banking that goes on and just all of the online things.
6286982	6288722	So many companies that do their business online.
6289082	6292023	Yeah, the internet going down completely would be pretty chaotic.
6293844	6295104	That would be a mess.
6295704	6300405	Well, there's a lot of stuff also connected with the internet like banking, ATMs.
6300786	6301766	That's pretty big.
6302086	6302226	Yeah.
6303228	6306035	I might all be secure, but imagine if it was suddenly unaccessible.
6306476	6308921	I mean, I guess that's why we still have tellers working at banks.
6308941	6311707	I've had my bank's infrastructure go down for a day.
6311828	6312930	It was a pain in the ass.
6315049	6317751	Marissa Congusto in the chat says, I couldn't do my job without the internet.
6317771	6319732	There's a lot of people in that situation.
6319852	6321733	I work for a big call center.
6321753	6322593	I think I've mentioned that before.
6322613	6323654	I'm a trainer for a big call center.
6323694	6327976	We actually have reps in other offices that take phone calls from their homes.
6328076	6329237	It's like a work at home program.
6330318	6332439	And I believe they use the internet to do all that.
6332779	6335320	When the internet goes down, those reps can't work.
6335561	6338862	There's a lot of people that really rely on the internet to do their jobs.
6339022	6339743	It's pretty crazy.
6341573	6343795	So, it'll be a mess, that's for sure.
6343855	6345696	But there was a day without internet, believe it or not.
6346336	6351060	I don't know if you kids are old enough to remember, but there was a day without internet.
6351100	6353381	Back in my day, we had dial-up and BBSs.
6353441	6354002	Those were the day.
6354062	6355863	Trade Wars 2002 for life.
6355983	6357324	I remember BBSs.
6358085	6359646	Legend of the Red Dragon, bitches.
6360026	6361467	Wasn't that long ago, I don't think.
6362748	6363829	The pit for the win.
6365131	6366232	Alright, let's move on.
6366292	6366952	And you know what?
6367432	6373335	We downloaded porn on 28 modems off of BBSs, because that's the way it was.
6373435	6381319	I remember when porn would be separated into VGA and Super VGA.
6381599	6383280	Didn't they call it XGA back then, I think?
6383300	6384620	Alright, forget it.
6384760	6385300	Let's move on.
6385601	6387742	EGA.
6388422	6390203	Anyways, hooray for CGA porn.
6391325	6394126	That's like those old strip poker games on the Apple IIe.
6394346	6401908	Especially working with arcade monitors and stuff like that, yeah, arcade monitors, most of them out there, CGA is what they consider them because it's ultra-low resolution.
6402488	6407790	And VGA monitors, 640x480, and that's really good for arcade stuff.
6407990	6409370	Anyways, I digress.
6409930	6414731	I had a 300 baud modem on my Commodore 64 that plugged into the cartridge port in the back.
6414791	6415392	It was epic.
6416172	6416432	Epic.
6416712	6418633	I think the slowest modem I had was a 2400, I think.
6420854	6426360	But yeah, switching that to like 56k, oh my god, we're blazing speeds!
6427501	6432886	Dude, going onto BBSs on a 300 baud modem, it was like watching print be typed on the screen.
6433347	6434948	Like, it was just insane.
6435349	6435849	But dude, I...
6437291	6438992	Just to reminisce for a bit here, I'm sorry.
6439492	6441814	But there used to be a BBS here in Sacramento.
6441834	6448858	And I think it was called like the Open Forum or Open Mind or something like that, which was this – all it was was really a bunch of forums.
6449158	6454302	And this was back when like 2400 – I think 14.4 was like the speed everybody had at that point.
6454322	6455222	It was 14.4K.
6455683	6457684	And really all it was was just message forums.
6458184	6460786	And it was just like a cool place to just kind of meet people.
6460846	6464869	And I actually – some of the greatest discussions I ever read online were on that site.
6464909	6466090	And it was all local people too.
6466850	6467271	I don't know.
6467331	6468912	Some days I miss the days of BBS.
6468932	6469253	CCN.
6469293	6470053	Remember that magazine?
6470093	6471074	California Computer News?
6471134	6471555	I do!
6471955	6472956	Aren't they still around?
6472976	6476620	They used to have, I don't know, but they used to have... They have the BBS listings in the back.
6476660	6477200	Exactly.
6477501	6478401	I do remember that.
6478442	6485628	And there was one BBS that was on there that you could sign into that BBS and actually get internet access for like an hour a day or something like that.
6485809	6486189	Oh my god.
6486209	6487050	That was fucking awesome.
6487370	6487991	Oh my god.
6488531	6491654	I remember I got banned from a BBS once because I pissed off the sysop.
6492315	6492835	That was fun.
6492876	6494037	I got tied up in some drama.
6494517	6495278	I don't even remember.
6495318	6497820	Like, now I'm looking back on it going, this is all retarded.
6498201	6499942	But, you know, I was a dumb kid.
6499982	6500383	What can I say?
6502560	6502820	Anyhow.
6503361	6503741	All right.
6503981	6506102	Deathwishing says, LOL, dial-up porn.
6506523	6508584	It would be like, okay, gonna eat dinner, come back.
6508964	6510365	Damn, her tits loaded up yet?
6510986	6517010	No, seriously, it was sad because, you know, back in the day, it used to take an hour to download a make, okay?
6517030	6517350	It did.
6517570	6520893	I remember downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo.
6521913	6522373	and DarkSakura.
6543482	6547487	and you better hope that's a good picture because you don't know what it looks like because it's just a text file.
6547847	6549610	You're just like, big boobs, sweet.
6555196	6556738	Womanhorse.gif?
6556838	6557639	Wow, what could this be?
6557779	6558480	Oh my god!
6562827	6564007	The stories I will tell my children
6589494	6597477	So, Summer of Arcade, you know, Microsoft's kind of big push for some good Xbox Live Arcade games coming out, of course, in the summer.
6598337	6612382	They had a 200% growth over last year's sales, and this is mostly in part to, actually, a good selection of games coming out, including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, you know, even Battlefield 1943.
6616104	6624455	lots of good stuff you know and even you know Shadow Complex their kind of Metroidvania game Trials HD and
6626055	6626735	Thanks for watching!
6653064	6654266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6670512	6681359	All right, well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a story about IGN and an old website that we love here at Orange Lounge Radio, whattheyplay.com.
6681379	6684922	If you've been a longtime fan of Orange Lounge Radio, you'll know why this is funny.
6684982	6687543	If not, listen to the best of next week because that clip's going to come back.
6687884	6691406	But IGN, of course, the big, huge website that's kind of like game...
6693087	6695208	All those, you know, one up or whatever.
6695668	6698229	They actually purchased WhatTheyPlay.com.
6698529	6707213	WhatTheyPlay.com is a site that is basically, you know, it's kind of catered towards families and kind of the concerned parent about what kids are into in video gaming.
6707553	6711254	I don't know why IGN bought this, but that's what they wanted.
6711294	6719678	I guess there was a pretty big audience there and maybe IGN kind of feels that it's a new audience that can, that ad buyers will be interested in buying.
6719698	6721178	I don't know.
6721198	6722579	They buy a lot of different websites.
6724770	6730299	$2.00
6732148	6733989	IGN has bought it to conduct all the polls they want on that audience.
6758211	6759212	That happened earlier this week.
6760152	6772921	You may remember us reporting on a game announced at E3, Joyride, which is basically a game that's kind of debuting the free-to-play model on the Xbox Live Service.
6773021	6777064	Joyride is going to be kind of an avatar-infused kart racing game.
6777104	6781427	Of course, they're going to have a little bit of an MMO twist to it as well.
6781667	6782747	They're doing some stuff, too.
6782787	6787250	I remember where you can actually... I guess it would be a little bit similar to Noby Noby Boy.
6788972	6805809	and Battlefield 1943 where if you play the game enough that you'll actually as a whole unlock new levels which is kind of cool and then of course if you want to customize your carts and what not you have to pay for that because that's what free to play means you have to pay for your premiums
6806669	6820679	and it will be a free download coming this holiday and apparently the content to buy will be available around that time as well also including avatar costumes and new tracks and cars
6823624	6826045	So, what do you think about this whole new model?
6826105	6829186	Is it kind of the future of Xbox Live Arcade, or what?
6829486	6835568	Well, it allows you to try out the game, and if you don't want to buy all this extra content, you don't have to, which is kind of cool.
6836429	6846912	And I think that's a lot better than, say, buying a game, or trying a demo that maybe doesn't really give you a good idea of the game, and wasting your money on a game that you end up not liking.
6848153	6848393	Hmm.
6849033	6850934	And hell, it can't be any worse...
6856243	6857164	I suppose that's true.
6859046	6863289	So, you know, as long as it's better than Yaris, I think it'll be okay.
6878604	6880645	Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here right now.
6880765	6883166	She'll be back a little later, hopefully, before we finish up.
6884507	6893851	So I'm going to open up the mailbag right now, but I was a slacker and didn't go into it before we started this segment because I was getting text messages on my phone.
6894912	6895812	I was answering those.
6898153	6899314	We have a lot of emails tonight.
6899334	6903676	I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through all of these, but I'll try and get through as many of them as I can.
6903736	6905536	If you didn't get through tonight, I'm sorry.
6905616	6906537	Try again next time.
6907912	6909413	Let's go to an email from Shook.
6910673	6911433	Starts us off tonight.
6911794	6915135	Hello, to kick off this email I'd like to say that I'm at peace with my dad.
6915215	6918056	Oh yes, this is the emailer that was having problems with his dad, remember that?
6918456	6920817	The dad didn't want him playing Final Fantasy X, remember that?
6921417	6924819	I talked to him about the Final Fantasy X thing and he seemed willing when he listened to me.
6925479	6927400	I got him to try the game and he loves it!
6927920	6929060	So no more of that.
6929100	6931101	So a round of applause for the douchebag father.
6931121	6932762	Yay, yay!
6932882	6933842	The rational thing.
6933922	6935202	You've unduced yourself.
6935262	6936063	Congratulations.
6936083	6936943	You did the right thing.
6937083	6938103	No more hazing for you.
6938543	6938784	All right.
6939284	6939984	So no more of that.
6940064	6940384	I agree.
6941204	6942265	Now on to my main story.
6942325	6944505	The other day I had gym class and we played football.
6945066	6949527	When a kid in my class saw the football laying there, he ran over and teabagged the ball a couple of times.
6951024	6951945	Let that sink in.
6952545	6958648	My gym coach grabs the kid by his neck, says, get the hell inside, and pushes the kid towards the front door.
6959149	6962050	It just goes to show how far teabagging has gone in our culture.
6962430	6966153	The kid was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, according to the superintendent.
6966513	6967693	My opinion, what the hell?
6967753	6969554	This is the shit that gives gaming a bad name.
6969715	6970535	I close with that.
6970995	6977179	P.S., pardon my French, forever and always, not like anyone censors themselves anyway, yours truly, Shook.
6978447	6979687	I don't think it has anything to do with gaming.
6979727	6979787	So...
7006427	7011562	One day I want to hear Rob go, we got a lot of emails tonight, sorry guys, I'm only going to get through as many as I feel like, so suck it.
7012574	7013754	Yeah, I guess you could say that too.
7015695	7018415	This next email comes to us from AZHP.
7019316	7020236	Hey, OLR crew.
7020276	7025377	I was listening to your last available podcast the other day and remember Rob saying something about a homosexual tambourine game.
7025777	7033079	I believe the game you're thinking of is Minimoni Shakato Tambourine, which I actually played when I went to Japan as well.
7033539	7036500	If you're not familiar with Minimoni, they're a branch of Morning Musume.
7036940	7042544	An extremely popular J-pop girl group with, get this, 23 girls, at least the last time I checked.
7043085	7053773	Minimoni is a subset of them, four girls who are 15 to 16 and look 11 to 12 and sing things about telephones, rock, paper, scissors, counting to 20 in the bathtub, and in general being obnoxiously cute.
7056975	7063300	Therefore, you are most definitely correct in saying that the game you saw slept with tambourine games of the same gender.
7064628	7069832	I don't know, it sounds like that game sounds like it could go to jail for the things it's doing.
7070312	7070612	P.S.
7070652	7071713	I recently got a new job.
7071733	7075315	By the way, I just want to say before I get into the P.S., I actually don't think it was the same game.
7075435	7078717	The one I saw, and this is how you could tell, it was Samba de Amigo.
7078818	7084481	It was the exact same game as Samba de Amigo, basically, except with a different character, not the little Samba dude, and with a tambourine.
7084922	7087783	So if that's the game you're talking about, then it's the same game.
7087804	7094208	But I don't remember a Morning Musume or even a Japanese pop 23 girl group being involved at all.
7094849	7096977	So, anyhow.
7098956	7100237	Let me read the PS here real quick.
7100297	7103059	I recently got a new job and have been listening to your podcast while at work.
7103359	7109443	I had to stop, though, because when you guys make terrible and awesome, extremely inappropriate jokes, I can't help but burst out laughing.
7109763	7112845	Not conductive to keeping a low profile in a quiet office environment.
7113166	7115067	It's just a testament to your chemistry, I guess.
7115547	7116348	Oh, that's very kind.
7116388	7116948	Thank you very much.
7117869	7118389	He signs it.
7118509	7122091	OLR's premier gold star recipient, AZHP.
7122492	7122852	That's right.
7122872	7123933	He was a previous gold star.
7123953	7127215	That was another very worthy email there, so thank you very much.
7129005	7129545	Let's see.
7130326	7132928	I'm trying to get through some more emails here.
7137230	7137831	Let's see.
7138071	7144134	This one comes to us from... They didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say Sam is the person that sent this.
7144575	7145695	Hello, OLR crew.
7145775	7151179	I'm trying very hard to use the best grammar possible so the grammar Nazi doesn't permabam me or start yelling or whatever.
7151539	7152299	Well, you're lucky.
7152400	7156182	Tonight I'm reading them and I have terrible grammar too, so I'm not going to be too critical tonight.
7156642	7157763	But yeah, I'm Blade3.
7157823	7158884	Oh, I'm sorry, that's the name.
7158924	7159344	Blade3.
7159424	7160445	I haven't emailed you guys since 2007.
7161085	7169630	Now I'm older and I slapped together a PSP website that has awesome functions and I wanted to let you know that I put your feed on there because everyone deserves to listen to the awesome Orange Lounge Radio.
7169951	7173033	Check it out at rmedia.webhop.net.
7173193	7177496	It will automatically route you if you are on a PSP and if you have an iPhone, it will route you to the iPhone site.
7177916	7180117	And if you use a computer, it will route you to the main site.
7180177	7182159	Congrats on many fantastic shows.
7182199	7183259	Keep up the fabulous work.
7183599	7185541	Wow, I just gave that dude free advertising.
7186209	7187611	for just kissing our ass in an email
7202833	7205934	I'd rather play video games, yeah, and it's just, I don't know.
7206194	7210414	Next email, hey guys, JD here, long-time listener, first-time emailer.
7210474	7213795	Unfortunately, I'm a listener from the UK, so I can't really tune in live.
7214195	7220716	We do have listeners from the UK that tune in live, but I understand, it's like two in the morning over there, so those guys are just really hardcore.
7221596	7222357	Thanks for the email, anyway.
7223017	7228558	This is concerning something DarkSakura mentioned quite a while ago when she heard the theme from Shaft in a Czech restaurant.
7228578	7228978	Remember this?
7229018	7229858	She talked about this earlier.
7230458	7240926	Well, today in my college induction day, my teacher was warning us about the dangers of leaving our phones on, and with perfect timing, his phone started ringing, and his ringtone was none other than the theme from Shaft.
7241467	7245850	Anywho, I must head off to bed now, so goodnight, OLR, and Sky, you need to update the podcast on time.
7245890	7246371	Yes, I know.
7246611	7246991	I'm sorry.
7248452	7248872	Bad host.
7248993	7249453	Bad panda.
7249953	7250314	No cookie.
7252120	7268499	that email from JD reminding us of an old inside joke if I can find that clip off to put that in the best of too I just don't remember what episode that was in just a couple more emails for you guys here and then I'll get to it let's see I'll get to probably just one more email here from Rob with 2B's
7271787	7273328	and he sent us quite a few emails this week.
7273348	7274769	I'm just going to pick a couple of these here.
7275690	7280252	Rob from 2B's wanted to know if any of us were going to Disneyland from September 23rd to 27th.
7280853	7283995	Sadly, I went the week before and I'm going the week after.
7284595	7288377	I'm very sorry to say it, but we didn't make it to Disneyland the same week you were.
7288678	7289678	But I hope you had a ton of fun.
7289898	7292960	The good news is all the Halloween events started this weekend.
7293120	7293401	Also...
7294600	7303702	Send us a link to this interesting article on GamesPolitik.com about a study linking youth violence depression to peers, not video games.
7305282	7308543	Apparently, it says here, one, depression is a symptom.
7308863	7314344	It is pointing out that many of the youths surveyed have depression problems to the point where it seems correlated to youth violence.
7314785	7317865	I'd say that the issue of depression is something that should be tackled all by itself.
7318185	7320906	Two, peer pressure is also the cause of good behavior.
7321266	7322327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7342102	7355012	I think we have a tendency when we see something that's kind of on our side to rah rah rah around it a little bit and yeah there might be a lot of variables in this study and I kind of agree with this whole notion that this is probably something that's way too hard to gauge way too hard to gauge I think
7373266	7374526	Thanks for watching!
7389878	7390939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7412020	7417381	I think the best cure to that sort of depression is to stop that behavior and go outside.
7417661	7420782	You want to have a healthy balance of video gaming when you're that age.
7421382	7424723	But I don't think too much gaming is the cause.
7425023	7428244	I think too much gaming is a symptom, if that makes sense.
7428304	7431045	Because they're trying to isolate themselves from everybody else.
7432965	7436926	Sometimes games make them feel better about themselves, especially if they're really skilled at something.
7437645	7437845	Nice.
7438686	7444191	By the way, JD is in chat right now and says it is 4.30 in the morning where he's at and he is listening after all.
7444852	7446433	Well, thank you very much for tuning in and listening.
7446833	7448295	That's going to do it for the mailbag tonight.
7448335	7449456	Thank you guys for the emails.
7449556	7452779	If you want to send us an email, please do a mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7452799	7454881	We'll get to some more emails next week.
7455721	7464089	Now we want to get into the FUs of the week as we always do around this point of the show and we have a good little inspiration story for you guys tonight.
7476974	7482918	To inspire tonight's FUs of the week, I bring you a principal from Germany who was quoted this week.
7483218	7494646	His name is Bernd Denning and said, kind of maybe along this whole line with depression and so forth, he believes that video games play a major role in a child becoming a homicidal maniac.
7495146	7505273	Quote, even if killer games are not the trigger of a killing spree, this guy said yesterday, they still take a major part in turning minors into homicidal maniacs.
7506093	7520060	Even if there isn't a mono-casually relation between excessive playing of games leading to acts of violence, it still provides a twisted frame of reference of solutions for their problems and hardships that they learn and may transfer to the real world under certain circumstances.
7520941	7523002	Okay, but how is that the game's fault?
7524102	7528565	You're kind of admitting that they're going to the games because they have a problem in the first place.
7528865	7531086	The game doesn't turn them into a homicidal maniac.
7532427	7532687	Right?
7534376	7536818	To his defense, I think it's like this.
7537199	7543946	If you have a crazy person already, the games mainly give him inspiration to how, I guess,
7545424	7546465	DarkSakura.com
7567186	7567966	Art does it.
7568106	7573588	It's because he got in a soapbox and wanted to say something controversial so people would listen and people did and then they blogged about it.
7573948	7575289	Art can be influential.
7575789	7576129	Period.
7576909	7579470	Anyhow, so we dedicate the FUs of the week to this guy.
7580090	7580430	Loki.
7581251	7591194	FU to my headache and it's from sinuses I'm guessing because I got it when I got back here and my eyes are burning and my head hurts so it's got to be a sinus headache.
7591994	7592854	Maybe someone in this house.
7593514	7593834	Shermie.
7595819	7596600	Shermie's not in the room.
7596780	7600163	She has to get out of here tonight.
7600243	7600804	No pun intended.
7601104	7605929	Hey, my FU of the week goes to the food poisoning I got from a popular sandwich chain earlier this week.
7605969	7607550	I'm not going to name them because I can't prove it.
7608311	7608832	Which one?
7609672	7610974	They toast their sandwiches.
7611014	7612055	They're very famous for it.
7612175	7618041	I got another one from... They don't have footlongs, but you can get stuff to go.
7618661	7619182	Ah, okay, yeah.
7622125	7622526	Interesting.
7622966	7628031	No, I, you know, I can't prove that they gave me the food poisoning, but I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.
7628492	7631455	And, man, it was hell for three days, but I lost some weight.
7632776	7637101	Oh, yeah, it wasn't really, I don't know if it's bad sushi and then bad sandwich.
7639003	7642326	F you to just food poisoning, because it sucks.
7643905	7644385	Alright, anyhow.
7645326	7651991	Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7652011	7655533	We probably have time for quite a few calls tonight, so we'll try to get through everybody tonight.
7655573	7655794	Loki.
7655994	7659696	This week, we've got some new Xbox Live Arcade games coming out, and quite a few of them.
7660037	7661938	Usually we get one or two, but we have three.
7662198	7672686	So, unfortunately, starting things off, and you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the Warriors game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox, but now we get the Warriors Streetball, which is...
7673823	7674443	Zombiapocalypse
7690973	7706112	which is kind of like a top down version of Left 4 Dead and that's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 and also Ion Assault which I believe is a tower defense game and that's also available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 and um
7710114	7711855	I think I'm right about the ion assault thing.
7711875	7712575	I can't remember.
7713836	7714716	Nope, I'm wrong.
7714896	7718118	It's a space shooter with an interesting twist, they say.
7718658	7724721	Basically, you can draw in energy from particles and use them to blast foes.
7725121	7729923	I've actually seen that in a freeware game made by some Japanese guy.
7730063	7730684	That's pretty cool.
7731384	7732404	So, I don't know.
7732424	7734505	This looks neat.
7735106	7736566	Kind of a little bit like Geometry Wars.
7737667	7737827	Hmm.
7740185	7742306	Isn't it about time for a new Geometry Wars, by the way?
7743046	7754970	Well, you would think with a new Project Gotham game you'd get something like that, but since there's not going to really be a Project Gotham game from Bazaar, I don't really know.
7755470	7756331	Let me do it later.
7757706	7758967	And it already kind of got leaked.
7758987	7759227	Oh, did it?
7785469	7786389	I didn't hear the follow-up.
7805794	7811717	Yosho, what was it, Yoshinoro Ono, and some other guy, and they were kind of doing like a fireball pose.
7812578	7813959	And in the background, what is that?
7814119	7824925	It looks like Street Fighter 4, but then there's T-Hawk there, and then also a big giant banner with what appears to look like an S from Super Street Fighter 4.
7825005	7825305	Oops!
7827392	7838085	So yes, you're probably going to get some either download content or perhaps a re-release of the game, you know, greatest hits type thing or something like that with new characters.
7838285	7840908	In other words, a way to milk more money from you.
7841028	7841289	Yep.
7841349	7842330	Congratulations.
7844592	7844932	All right.
7844992	7846993	Well, that is it for the stories that we have tonight.
7847053	7851776	So it's now that time for us to open up the Skype line and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7852196	7854297	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7854358	7856779	Loki, why don't you give us some last-minute stories before we get to the phones?
7857239	7863043	The Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be a little bit cheaper until October 5th.
7865604	7876432	With a cool deal that's going on with Netflix, you will be able to buy an Xbox 360 Elite between September 22nd and October 5th and go on to Xbox's website.
7876452	7877332	There's a link, actually.
7877352	7882236	You can check it out where you can mail in for a rebate for $50.
7883917	7887219	And that's not a bad deal if you're looking to pick up a console.
7889741	7890041	All right.
7892202	7892943	Let's go to the phones.
7893003	7894044	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7894064	7894384	Who's this?
7897475	7898416	Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.
7898436	7898796	Who's this?
7899937	7900577	Deathwishing.
7900637	7901318	Hi, there you are.
7901358	7902018	What's on your mind, buddy?
7904100	7909523	Well, did you guys hear about how I think I read on Twitter from Inside Gaming that...
7911790	7915331	The memory cap for Xbox Live arcade games is being increased to 2 gigs.
7916032	7918153	Yeah, I did remember reading an article on that earlier this week.
7918173	7921315	Doesn't that have to do with the whole, what is it, Command & Conquer 3?
7921375	7923656	Yeah, the new Command & Conquer.
7923816	7929399	Doesn't that kind of like defeat the purpose of games that are not that big and now you can have these 2 gig games which basically...
7930019	7935141	I think what they're trying to say is go buy our expensive overpriced hard drives, is what I feel like they're telling me.
7935161	7945484	Not really, because when you consider now that the main system that's going to be available out there is the Xbox 360 Elite with a 120GB hard drive, I mean, you could fit like 60 games on there.
7945624	7947985	Well, probably less than 60 games, but pretty close to 60.
7948185	7951746	Yeah, but what happens to all the people that didn't buy the Elite?
7951966	7957408	I know there's more people with the standard edition console that had a 20GB hard drive.
7958308	7959969	Microsoft doesn't care about you.
7978935	7979616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7999854	8003838	There's hundreds, literally hundreds of games already available that are very small.
8004279	8009123	Indie games, don't forget those, in addition to just the past three, four years of what's been out on the 360.
8011185	8013528	Oh, and I also picked up ODST.
8014549	8015129	And what did you think?
8016731	8019534	I love it, but I also know a lot of people that hate it.
8020809	8021971	What do you love about it?
8022031	8023272	I notice it's been half and half.
8023332	8025034	I notice people love it or people hate it.
8025314	8028578	Which is strange for a Halo game because usually everybody's dry humping it.
8028959	8031081	What do you love about Halo 3 ODST?
8031241	8033684	I just love that it's actually a fun campaign.
8033884	8035886	It's an interesting story.
8036086	8037328	The voice acting is pretty good.
8037528	8039550	The music in this game is awesome.
8041592	8043733	and Firefight's pretty fun.
8043793	8046235	I played it for like three hours one day with a couple friends.
8046795	8049777	I hate to sound so ignorant, but what is Firefight mode?
8050237	8052618	Firefight is... I don't know enough about Halo.
8053479	8053819	What's that?
8054359	8055099	Gears of War Horde.
8056920	8057361	Oh, okay.
8057401	8058941	Halo twist with skulls and stuff.
8059682	8060022	Got it.
8061243	8067326	And yeah, it's been taking up my whole time this week, basically.
8070219	8071520	What would you say to the haters?
8071580	8074342	What are the haters saying about it?
8074562	8098162	Most of the people that hate it are either A, kids that were looking for Master Chief and didn't find them so they cried and maybe people that aren't fans of the Halo series looking for a different game and then there's the people that don't play Halo games but they bought Halo because you know you have to have it and most people, I know a lot of people who did buy Halo for their Xbox because it's like a staple game like Call of Duty and Gears of War
8099585	8102106	I've read most of the books.
8121943	8123384	Halo Reach is a prequel to Fall of Reach.
8140839	8142600	You are one hardcore Halo nerd.
8143761	8144721	I wouldn't say hardcore.
8144741	8146062	I like the story.
8146082	8148443	I actually like Call of Duty 4 a lot better.
8148683	8149364	I like Call of Duty.
8149804	8150264	That's cool.
8150284	8153886	Hey, there's people that read the Warcraft books and some of the books based on other games.
8153926	8155027	Man, those people are nerds.
8155127	8156828	Yeah, that's right.
8157228	8158869	You gotta love the video game culture.
8159289	8159930	You gotta love it.
8159950	8162951	They'll look at just another subgroup and say, you guys are nerds.
8163092	8164812	Like the Star Wars guys and the Trekkies.
8164993	8165473	Exactly.
8165833	8168915	Alright, well, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts?
8170659	8175322	I saw the former lead singer of No Doubt or one of them at Chain Reaction last night.
8176062	8176722	Gwen Stefani?
8177242	8177723	No, Alan.
8178583	8180044	Oh, like from the old school days.
8180184	8181904	Yeah, he has a band called Starpool.
8182945	8183965	Did you get a picture?
8185606	8187687	No, but I was too busy skanking.
8188527	8189848	Oh, well, good luck with that.
8191188	8191389	See ya.
8194274	8201082	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you'd like to go ahead and give us a call We'll take some more calls Any other last minute stories?
8202063	8211234	EA has confirmed that they're going to be doing a Beatles Rock Band SingStar Pack Basically Beatles Rock Band for PS3 With two SingStar mics We have another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Who's this?
8211991	8213332	Hey, it's Brad from PodCulture.
8241863	8242585	Okay, fair enough.
8242605	8244769	Which it isn't.
8244829	8247053	Oh, you talk about Olive Garden 2, okay.
8248938	8251179	We actually usually do go out to eat before the shows.
8251319	8252119	Nice, very nice.
8252520	8256781	Alright, well, I know you didn't call in today just to plug your shows, but what's on your mind, buddy?
8257482	8259102	Oh, Halo 3 ODST.
8259543	8261563	Ah, you're another Halo 3 ODST fan, huh?
8262364	8263604	I really enjoy it.
8263904	8267266	It's definitely not an F minus minus kind of a game.
8267886	8269927	Oh, a little dig there at Bobby on the earlier show.
8269967	8272308	Okay, well, what grade would you give it and why?
8272948	8277530	I'd give it a good solid B. Mainly, you know, it
8278291	8283085	Bounces around between the different viewpoints of the characters which some people I can see would like.
8283766	8285953	Me, I like a little bit more of a linear type of story.
8288499	8292520	I know you guys are hardcore into that universe so just the voice acting alone has got to sell this game to you guys.
8313188	8317789	Well, I mean, Nathan Fillion's character actually looked like Nathan Fillion.
8318349	8318649	Nice.
8318749	8320810	They did some of the modeling really good.
8321670	8327231	Alan Tudyk's character, there's one scene where he actually flies a Covenant ship.
8328032	8330152	So you sound like you're actually into the campaign mode.
8330212	8333673	Do you play any of the multiplayer at all, or are you all about the campaign?
8334773	8337474	Every once in a while, but I usually get my ass handed to me.
8338737	8339657	You are a busy man, Brad.
8339678	8340898	How do you have time to play video games?
8340918	8342259	Well, you know, you just don't sleep.
8363109	8363709	All right, fair enough.
8363909	8365250	Anything else you've been playing lately, Brad?
8366191	8368412	Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5.
8368852	8370333	And what do you think of both these games?
8371833	8373254	It's really, really neat.
8373294	8378857	I like in Guitar Hero 5, it's kind of cheesy, but I like the fact you can play as your avatar.
8380157	8380798	That's kind of cool.
8382783	8386324	and with the Beatles rock band, come on man, it's the Beatles.
8386765	8387705	That's right, it's the Beatles.
8388005	8390146	I still have yet to get on this Beatles train.
8390186	8396528	I'm going to be late to the arrival because I know you were making fun of me over my 360 earlier, but I'll get on the bandwagon soon enough.
8397749	8399949	I'm fine with everybody else's hype for right now.
8401290	8406552	What do you think is going to be, I hate to make you pick, but which game do you think is going to trump at Christmas?
8408495	8417938	I'm going to actually probably say Beatles Rock Band because you have more of the, it would appeal to more of folks who normally wouldn't pick up a video game.
8418679	8427921	Like I took it over to my mom's to play with my, over for my birthday and we played with my sister and brother-in-law and their kids and everybody loved it.
8429462	8429862	Interesting.
8430382	8430702	Alright.
8431422	8432983	Well, any final thoughts for us, Brad?
8433928	8434309	No, sir.
8434349	8435953	Just keep up doing the great show.
8436093	8436614	Well, thank you.
8436634	8437376	I appreciate it.
8437436	8438118	And you have a good one.
8438138	8440142	And good luck with your multitude of shows.
8441872	8442653	Catch you later guys
8469331	8474735	Nothing much, just chilling right now because the weekend was New York Anime Fest.
8476316	8477917	Yet another damn con.
8477957	8481039	You guys are spoiled out there on the East Coast with all your cons.
8481079	8481839	Did you go to this?
8482039	8484061	Well, yeah, not only that.
8484421	8496649	The creator of Gundam was one of the guests of honor, so I managed to go to both of his panels and I had him autograph one of my copies of Zeta Gundam.
8498339	8499100	and a picture with him.
8500081	8503443	It'll be up on Facebook eventually, but right now I'm just tired.
8503483	8510488	I gotta relax tonight because I've been going through this rat race this whole weekend.
8513911	8523057	But yeah, basically I wanted to bring up a good point that I don't know if it was probably already discussed, but the fact that the creator of Mega Man
8524884	8526165	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8555085	8560395	The Con this weekend, which was basically a debate between Western and Japanese video games.
8561075	8564738	And they did bring up that particular rant.
8565939	8578949	And from how the debate went, we pretty much settled on the fact that Japan is a clash of cultures.
8579289	8580410	You could put it that way.
8580470	8587396	In other words, where you have the Japanese with their strong work ethic and the fact that they only help themselves, not each other.
8588373	8595965	Whereas Western developers, or just Western business companies for that matter, you have to work within a team.
8600193	8605755	I mean, isn't this just a little bit, though, I wouldn't see it as the apocalypse that all these guys are proclaiming.
8605795	8607396	I know, I know.
8607756	8610677	And that says he's probably crying wolf a bit too early.
8611277	8616879	Because I think, here it is, Zaku, American development for many years sucked balls.
8617279	8619020	Where did we get all of our games from?
8619440	8622341	All of them, Zaku, came from Japan just like 20 years ago.
8622701	8626422	Like when American developers would do it, they would almost like just fail miserably.
8626502	8628003	Like remember Secret of Evermore?
8628846	8630527	I like that game, but a lot of people hated that game.
8630887	8634128	But here's the thing, just Japanese development has dominated for so long.
8634228	8639810	I don't think it's so much that Japanese development is dead, it's just Japanese development is having to share the spotlight a little bit.
8640790	8641351	Yeah, of course.
8641411	8649333	I mean, right now, they have to contend with the fact that the Western video game market at this point is pretty solid.
8649934	8655796	I mean, you have the 360, which has the largest install base of any console right now on the planet.
8656756	8659640	In the US, the Wii is still number one.
8659680	8662964	In the US, Europe, I mean, you'd be surprised.
8663865	8669251	The fact of the matter is that there is... And actually, no, it doesn't have the largest install base because the Wii is still number one around the world.
8669271	8669792	Yeah, that's true.
8670232	8675619	Well, alright, aside from the Wii, but I mean, in terms of hardcore, I mean, I consider the Wii more of a...
8676918	8687443	You know, more of the casual system, even though it hasn't really appealed that much to hardcore, with the exception of Super Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros.
8688244	8691826	And this is another reason why... So you're just saying compared to Sony?
8691866	8692906	You're saying compared to Sony?
8694327	8694967	No, no, no.
8695547	8698469	I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that Japan...
8698985	8701446	I couldn't see the writings on the wall a lot sooner than later.
8701766	8705727	And now it's just, they have the deer in the headlights look all of a sudden.
8706307	8711429	Even though Wii and most of the world already knew that they weren't the only game in town anymore.
8712029	8717391	Yeah, I mean, to give you an example here, the Wii right now worldwide is 53.47 million units, whereas the Xbox 360 is 32.10 million.
8717931	8719391	And then, of course, the PlayStation 3...
8726544	8728606	A little bit catching up now, I think.
8728906	8731668	They're down to 24.55 million.
8732209	8743098	Right, I mean, it pretty much goes back into what others... I guess in a way he's right.
8744480	8747662	And this is what happened.
8747702	8750625	I mean, Microsoft pretty much realized that
8751311	8761956	The only way to create a powerful platform, a world-class platform, is that they have to listen, appeal more to developers, and essentially throw money at them.
8763357	8772044	That's how they managed to roll out more 360s in Japan than the original Xbox.
8772705	8780211	So even though it still hasn't beaten the PS3 yet, it's getting close.
8780251	8788678	I mean, for all intents and purposes, you could say that it's razor thin at this point, the margin between the two.
8789690	8791619	Alright, well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up and let you go.
8791639	8793468	Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8795005	8801950	Um, worst game of all time, Final Fantasy VII, and that wasn't me saying it, that was pretty much a panel that I went to today.
8803131	8805673	I think there are millions of people that would disagree with you.
8806774	8808915	Alright, take care, Saku.
8809135	8809576	Bye.
8810236	8812878	Everybody knows that the worst game of all time is Draft 3.
8813078	8813819	I know, please.
8814159	8814679	Please.
8815220	8819963	Anybody that says that Final Fantasy VII is the worst game of all time, I laugh in your face.
8820424	8820804	Ah-ha!
8821169	8822430	I think that's what you meant to say.
8822450	8822751	Just like...
8834865	8838546	The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is overrated.
8839226	8839486	I know.
8839586	8846447	I could think of literally hundreds of games off the top of my head that are worse than Final Fantasy VII that I think we all could agree on.
8846707	8847367	Yes, thank you.
8848287	8848828	There's plenty.
8849028	8850788	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8850808	8851148	Who's this?
8852608	8854129	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8854369	8854969	Hi, Spazinator.
8854989	8855809	What's on your mind tonight?
8857389	8860910	I just had two quick questions because I know you're about to wrap up.
8861230	8861590	Yeah, what's up?
8863177	8866941	Yeah, they're kind of interrelated.
8867481	8876229	And as far as home is concerned, have you heard anything about their announced update?
8876249	8877851	Because they're calling it 1.3.
8879312	8880333	For what is this?
8882035	8883376	For PlayStation Home.
8884903	8886744	I think I saw some stuff online.
8886824	8889945	I didn't think there was anything super major that I read about in it.
8889985	8894166	I mean, I don't think this is getting the showing of the trophies or any of that that we saw about.
8894266	8898527	I want to say I thought I saw something when I logged in the other day, but I don't think there was anything major, right?
8898728	8901788	Yeah, I don't think I ever saw a bullet point on there for fun.
8902009	8902349	Stop.
8902729	8905350	I wasn't really interested in it at all.
8906530	8909191	Now, Spazinator, you've checked out the OLR Clubhouse, right?
8910771	8911031	Yeah.
8911291	8912752	Have I done a nice job decorating it?
8914624	8916085	Oh, yeah.
8916105	8921788	Yeah, in fact, since you touched on it, I did have a question.
8921808	8925190	My second question relates to the clubhouse.
8925350	8933734	I noticed that, you know, right behind the stage, you know, near the ceiling, there looks like there's some kind of TV screen or something like that.
8933774	8934295	Yes.
8934715	8938697	Does that, like, serve a purpose, or is it, like, just, like...
8939178	8939679	DarkSakura.com
8954833	8960636	because I would love to give you an exclusive little OLR behind the scenes video or something.
8960716	8966779	I would love to put a five minute video of us taping the show or something before or after the show in home.
8966859	8970281	That would be awesome and give people a reason to go to home.
8970702	8972262	But I can't do that yet.
8972302	8973463	That's not something they're letting us do.
8973483	8976605	Yeah, they're still working out for a reason to buy the PSP Go.
8977385	8978086	and DarkSakura.com
8997364	8997924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9020871	9047050	Yeah, yeah, I was thinking, I know you guys have a whole bunch of videos on YouTube, you know, like just recently you put up the video of Jamie's, you know, vault, and along with their pinball machine collection, that would be great for the TV screen, and for anyone that buys any of the content through the video sector in the store, you know, I would imagine in the 30s,
9047791	9054236	Spazinator, I would, the minute that Sony lets us put those YouTubes on that TV in the clubhouse, I am so there.
9054336	9056818	Also, I would love them to just open up the clubhouse to everybody.
9057459	9058940	Why be a member of the club?
9058980	9065665	I would love to make my club public so that way lots of people can explore the clubhouse, see the video and go, oh, these guys look kind of crazy.
9065705	9066666	Maybe I'll listen to the show.
9066806	9075253	I think it would be great promotion, but sadly, you know, and I understand, you know, it's a big deal for Sony to hit the switch because if they allow people to post their own videos and
9075513	9103725	there's huge copyright things they're going to have to deal with so I can understand why I don't get what I want but believe me the day they figure it all out even if they have to review each piece of submitted content we don't have anything copyright in ours so we would submit it and hopefully it'll be on there well thanks for taking my call and I'll want to go like I said you're probably going to wrap up the show pretty soon here
9104690	9105750	All right, well, thank you, Spaz.
9106210	9108871	Take care, and we'll talk to you later week, all right?
9110092	9110812	Sure, sounds good.
9110972	9111192	Later.
9111232	9111572	Take care.
9113633	9115213	I don't see why we can't take a couple more calls.
9115373	9116433	It's not even 9 o'clock yet.
9116473	9116793	We're good.
9116853	9117794	We can do, like, one more call.
9117814	9118414	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9118434	9121035	Use the name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio.
9121055	9122195	Do you have any other stories you want to get to?
9122695	9124176	Yes, you want to.
9124656	9125216	Let's see.
9126872	9130014	Frank West, coming to Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
9130855	9132797	Well, we already kind of knew that, but they have pictures now.
9133077	9135199	And it looks like he has all sorts of crazy moves.
9135459	9136419	Oh, hello!
9136640	9138921	This is DSMaster26.
9139102	9140643	Yes, I just picked up the phone, obviously.
9140683	9141624	Hi, what's on your mind?
9143033	9143873	That bitch!
9165850	9167552	I'm just kidding.
9167732	9169954	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
9170194	9172596	Girls 101, don't laugh at me.
9172756	9173977	Threaten to kick my ass.
9176419	9181422	Basically, then I replugged it in.
9182043	9183724	It's my friend's 360, mind you.
9184825	9187307	And you can borrow it for the weekend, thank God.
9187667	9190830	Because I've been wanting to try a 360 for a while, full one.
9190950	9192311	Not one of those demo kiosks.
9193497	9221552	and so then it red ringed on me and then I'm like oh crap so I have Rockman for the Wii and I'm like okay I'll put this under the tell trick thing for the 25 minutes or whatever and we'll play Rockman on the Wii well lo and behold it has an update and in the middle of that power outage for a second it bricked my Wii and now I have the blue light of death not kidding
9223763	9225484	BlueLateSpecialDeath Hold on.
9225984	9228385	Did you get to grab your girlfriend's boobies tonight?
9230586	9233728	No, but... Well, you have had a really bad day then.
9233768	9241752	I mean, I would think that at least to some type of concession for your bad day, she should be like, okay, I'll let you grab a boob.
9242192	9242632	You know?
9243793	9252217	We did actually kind of started crying on the point where Kairi disappears on Kingdom Hearts.
9254324	9272724	358 and a half days and spoiler alert sorry but um basically oh yeah and I forgot to mention I saw an Xbox 360 console with a pay-to-play method at the arcades where it's like okay four tick
9273388	9277651	4 Tokens, 4 Minutes, 8 Tokens, 8 Minutes, so on and so forth.
9278512	9288899	And I saw one, it was a modded Xbox, I swear to God, it was a Japanese weak copy of Beatmania 17 2DX.
9290741	9296665	I've seen arcades put Stepmania machines in and try to make money off of it, so you know, I was part of that.
9297867	9303851	And of all things, it was jerry-rigged into an actual Beatmania cabinet with the controller and everything.
9304511	9309235	Which I thought was kind of cool, but it was right next door to an actual Beatmania machine.
9310673	9316919	And not only do they have that, but they also have it with DDR Universe in there, one with the hardpad.
9317439	9319982	They have the Rock Band game there to play.
9321022	9325927	And they even got some PlayStation 3s jerry-rigged up that way, too, with the token play stuff.
9326067	9327108	Where's this place at?
9327148	9327668	What's it called?
9328509	9330110	Family Fun Center.
9330190	9330931	It's in Omaha.
9331331	9332913	FamilyFunCenter.net.
9333113	9333493	Check it.
9333754	9333974	All right.
9333994	9334995	Well, thanks for ratting them out.
9335015	9336856	The developers that listen to this show will be glad to know.
9338037	9342480	And when that place closes down, rest in peace knowing it's all your fault.
9342500	9344061	Honestly, they're not doing anything wrong.
9344321	9354347	I mean, I don't think he... I'm sure that there's some fine print or something, but they do sell those actual kits that you can do pay-per-play stuff on the PS3 and all that stuff.
9354407	9356148	It hooks up via JAMMA and that kind of stuff.
9356348	9359430	In fact, I was actually looking into getting some JAMMA connectors for my Wii and stuff.
9359650	9363513	That way I can do Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on my arcade cabinet or, you know...
9364253	9365676	stuff for my 360 or whatnot.
9365757	9366999	I mean, because it's all available out there.
9367039	9368823	It's just pay-for-play stuff.
9369184	9372390	It's annoying, I guess, because consoles aren't meant for that.
9373860	9375622	You know what?
9375662	9379225	That's what you get for playing V. Because seriously, that song is just overdone.
9379245	9379405	It's...
9401783	9402324	Let it sit.
9402404	9403544	That's what you get for playing me.
9403584	9403824	All right.
9404664	9407125	All joking aside, I know I've been rousing you tonight, but you let me.
9407786	9408526	Thank you for calling in.
9408626	9410467	Any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?
9410487	9413428	Definitely keep the good shows rocking.
9413568	9416149	And actually, I'm the one who sent that one.
9416589	9416909	D.S.
9416929	9417989	Silver's my code name.
9419150	9420830	I like RPGs and music titles.
9420850	9425252	Give me a few quick recommendations on XPLA and normal titles.
9426408	9427789	Oh, on my Xbox?
9427849	9429290	I haven't signed into my Xbox in like a week.
9429611	9430791	Or, I mean, a month.
9431532	9433954	On just Xbox 360 itself, what would you recommend?
9434494	9436356	Oh, what would I recommend on Xbox 360?
9436536	9437717	You said you're into RPGs?
9439339	9442200	RPGs, Music, and Racing RPGs, Driving, and
9462728	9463048	Music.
9463229	9463409	Music.
9463469	9463890	Music.
9476798	9488606	I'm waiting for Scratch, because that's the only thing close to Beatmania with DLC we're ever going to get here, because I figured out now they're never going to release Beatmania ever again here in the States, which sucks.
9488766	9490267	Welcome to what I told you years ago.
9490287	9497833	They'll probably do a Beatmania on PS3, and that way it'll be region-free, so you will be able to get a Beatmania here.
9498253	9498473	All right.
9498653	9500435	I've got to let you go, DS Master, but take care, buddy.
9500455	9500775	All right.
9501175	9502936	Keep the shows rocking, and peace out.
9503116	9503777	Peace out.
9504537	9504838	All right.
9508865	9509926	I give him a hard time.
9510607	9511629	Why does my head hurt more?
9511869	9513311	Alright, it makes your headache get worse.
9513331	9514653	He's a loud caller.
9515976	9517677	No, I said we could walk it out in twilight.
9546172	9546773	Yippee skipy.
9546933	9549035	Doesn't that poppin' music game on the Wii look horrendous?
9549075	9550556	But granted, isn't Japan getting that too?
9550756	9551257	It's not just us.
9551277	9551958	They already got it.
9552218	9553019	We're getting it soon.
9554000	9558204	And we get the crappy DDR.
9559977	9563239	Which, by the way, remember how it was just Dance Dance Revolution at one time?
9563299	9563499	Yes.
9563639	9565420	Now they're breaking it out into three different games.
9565500	9569563	Now they're going to do X2, Hottest Party 3, and then whatever the fuck.
9569583	9571924	They're going to call it PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.
9572584	9576106	Because the new, new one on the 360 and PS3 looked pretty sweet.
9576166	9577167	It looked pretty epic, actually.
9577927	9578668	I'm curious on this.
9578688	9580409	But the thing is, though, they're going to be identical games.
9580909	9581609	I mean, pretty much.
9581930	9582410	That's fine.
9582510	9585011	They're just changing the names so that people don't realize it.
9585312	9585492	Well...
9586485	9589689	Don't we see the same game get ported to two different systems all the frickin' time?
9589769	9590330	I'm okay with that.
9590350	9594755	If they're combining resources to make one really fucking good game across both consoles, I'm okay with that.
9595095	9596016	Except it's not.
9596797	9597137	We'll see.
9597338	9597638	We'll see.
9597738	9598139	Jury's out.
9598479	9601623	Alright, we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show tonight.
9601663	9602824	We're done with Skypline tonight.
9602864	9605327	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but consider sending us an email.
9605347	9606028	We'd love to hear from you.
9607049	9608991	We're going to wrap up and get everybody's final thought tonight.
9609711	9611453	Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here right now.
9611513	9612794	Maybe she'll come in during Afterbirth.
9612874	9613455	I don't know.
9613555	9614496	For live only folks.
9615597	9619921	But I'm sure she would say goodnight and reject fault icons or something like that.
9620282	9621603	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9621823	9622884	I want my headache to go away.
9623264	9623505	Now.
9625261	9629462	My final thought is I am looking at Loki's bag from McDonald's and my mouth is watering because I'm hungry.
9629483	9630923	There's fries in there.
9630983	9632483	They're cold by now.
9632503	9635144	They weren't good to begin with.
9635224	9636265	I'll stop by on the way home.
9636485	9637705	There's a pretty good McDonald's by my house.
9637985	9638445	Alright, that's it.
9638765	9639066	We're done.
9639106	9639626	We're out of here.
9640166	9643087	We will not be here next week, but we will have a best of.
9643307	9645007	So stay tuned to All Games Radio.
9645608	9648929	We'll have a best of on the network next week and with some new content.
9649149	9652070	So I don't want you to think it's simply old rehashed stuff.
9652890	9655253	We're going to give some new stuff for our faithful listeners too.
9655593	9656975	We will be back in two weeks live.
9657295	9659177	I apologize for all the time off recently.
9659217	9662241	It's totally my fault, but I'm in it for the rest of the year.
9662841	9664663	It just so happens that October is a crazy month.
9664703	9665264	What can I say?
9666145	9666846	Have a good night, everybody.
9666866	9668287	We'll see you in two weeks.
9668973	9669693	Here on Orange Lounge Radio
9698881	9699705	See you next week!
