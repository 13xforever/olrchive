13851	19618	Tonight, September 13th, 2009, you can emulate Commodore 64 on your iPhone, then you can't.
20018	25825	An intentional glitch outs pirates of a popular game, and a popular franchise's sequel gets canned in Japan.
32113	36415	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36475	42159	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42219	48162	Here with you over the next three hours, live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
48582	54385	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you for the next few hours, also with me as well, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54585	54826	Beer.
55346	55726	How are you?
55886	56346	Beer fiend?
56667	56887	Beer.
57207	57727	Beer-licious?
58087	59588	What kind of beer tonight?
59868	60749	250th Anniversary Guinness.
61124	62405	And what makes it so dang special?
62745	64486	Because it's 250th anniversary Guinness.
65246	65346	Oh.
65946	67567	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
68988	69428	Hello.
69528	70129	How are you, Loki?
70289	70789	I'm good.
70969	71369	All right.
71749	77232	Now, of course, before we get into gaming weeks, usually, we somehow start off the show as Orange Lounge Radio Foodio.
77612	81154	And tonight is no exception to the cause here.
81294	83415	Loki, what the hell did you bring with you tonight?
83495	86597	Because I have to admit, it actually looks kind of disgusting.
87915	92578	I brought parts of Bacon Fest 2009, as Nelly would call it.
92638	94339	It was the bacon-themed birthday party.
94919	101924	Some of the food that we served there, including bacon muffins, which they're cornbread muffins.
103835	107499	I'm seriously looking at all this food.
107579	108160	Oh my god.
108841	111364	It's just too much.
111925	112505	Don't get me wrong.
113126	116750	I love bacon, but this is too much bacon.
116770	118092	Bacon is meat candy.
118693	119514	Okay, sorry to interrupt.
120175	122217	Anyways, so it's...
123238	125780	Okay, let me just run down the list here.
125940	126660	The bacon muffins.
126680	135066	They're basically cornbread muffins with... Well, initially it had a little bit of reserved bacon fat in there to give it the kind of bacon flavor, and there's bacon inside of it.
136326	141490	And then Nellie decided that they didn't quite taste like enough bacon, and she...
142130	143271	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
171555	172718	Green Onion and Bacon.
173881	175025	It's kind of like a spicy...
176644	177404	DarkSakura.com
204735	205216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
221531	222492	What about the jelly bean?
222692	225354	I don't see enough appreciation for jelly beans out there.
225374	226234	It has to be jelly bellies.
226815	227916	Alright, forget it.
228436	237783	And then the last one is, it's shrimp wrapped in bacon with barbecue sauce and mozzarella cheese broiled on top of it.
238123	239964	But it's actually, the shrimp's pretty good.
240044	241565	We ate mostly the shrimp.
242006	243887	And then it had candied bacon.
244167	244608	It was with...
246277	247157	Thank you for watching!
274469	280091	And then Irene and Nathan brought these mashed potato ball things that have bacon and stuff.
280611	283332	So I haven't tried those, but everyone liked those, I think.
283432	284412	All right, let's go to our chat room.
284452	286873	Yes, we do talk about video games occasionally on this show.
287173	288954	But let me go to the chat room and introduce them.
289134	291535	Howdy, guys, at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
291555	294115	They're always with us, the ever-present fourth guest on the show.
294856	298557	Tiger Claw says, you guys should take a picture of this and post on the OLR gallery.
298957	300277	We are one step ahead of you, sir.
300537	302078	Dark Sakura, I think, already did that.
302398	328955	They should be on their way up to the OLR Gallery So if you want to check out the food Go to orangelaunchradio.com Click on, I think it's galleries And you'll see If you're smart, you'll figure it out Click on pictures or galleries I don't have it in front of me And then you can find the bacon stuff Sadly, the one thing that wasn't there was Super Bacon Just because I thought I had plenty of bacon And I actually ran short of bacon I had bought like five packages of bacon And it was still not enough
330356	331517	All right.
331597	337021	Salacious Pop in chat says popcorn jelly bellies equal vom.
337361	338802	The chat room, by the way, is called Kevin.
339203	345587	I just want to point out, though, that I actually like the popcorn jelly beans quite a bit, but my favorite is toasted marshmallow.
345887	348650	Jelly belly makes a toasted marshmallow jelly bean that is delicious.
348830	353233	In honor of Bacon Fest, the chat room is called Kevin.
353253	353353	Kevin.
354657	356799	I'm very sorry, I did not refer to them by their proper name.
356819	360761	I still don't understand this whole renaming the chatroom to names of people you know.
360881	361641	You are Kevin!
362542	362782	Fine.
364342	366283	Alright, um, there you go.
366383	371366	So, okay, I'm going to try one of these bacon shrimp things, even though my pancreas hurts just looking at it, dear God.
371726	372427	Well, that's two of them.
372447	373147	There's two of them.
373447	374628	You need to separate that.
376409	376909	Okay, here we go.
379810	382732	Careful, and chew carefully because, like you said, it's a little choky.
385862	386843	Thank you for watching!
402000	404342	It's good, but damn.
404642	406644	This is probably all I'm going to have.
406764	408886	I'm going to have another piece of shrimp.
408926	412789	You guys can see in the picture gallery, and even if you're listening on the podcast, you can go on the website.
412809	413609	I'm sure it'll still be there.
414090	416352	You can go in that picture gallery and look, and it's too much.
416992	417492	It's too much.
417532	420855	Yes, there is such a thing as too much bacon, and it is sitting in front of us tonight.
420875	425399	The important thing today, Rob, is that all I've had is a salad, so I could safely eat this bacon.
426092	428673	DarkSakura, what type of video games have you been playing this week?
428733	429994	I don't know what the hell this is.
456952	458074	Enough with the bacon.
458675	459977	Put the bacon down.
460037	461039	Step away from the bacon.
461059	462421	Do you want me to have Loki go first?
463162	464364	Okay, Loki, how was your gaming week?
465286	467369	My gaming week was awesome.
468711	469513	Well, you know.
470037	472599	Played the usual stuff, New Grand Theft Auto, whatnot.
473599	483686	Also got around to playing a little bit of Scribblenauts, which... It's alright, but I haven't really gotten past the tutorial stuff yet because I've only played it for a little bit.
483726	489310	I've been busy messing with the little front-end thing where you can spawn wherever you want and stuff.
489730	493413	And let me tell you, and I know this really sucks to say it, but...
494460	496481	Oh my god, does it get old after five minutes.
497121	498861	And, you know, that is really sad.
499001	499421	I knew it.
499621	501342	I knew that's what was going to happen with this game.
501842	507763	I haven't played it yet, so I just... You know, it's one of those things, I think it's like the Nintendogs of this year.
507823	513925	It's like one of those things that's going to be cute as hell for 30 minutes, and then you're going to be like, okay, I did all the lulzy things I wanted to do, and...
514810	515210	Pretty much.
515450	519571	And, you know, I'm sure the puzzles and stuff are going to be fun.
519631	524153	I haven't quite gotten there yet because I'm still doing the fucking tutorial stuff, which is annoying.
524673	530035	But just as far as messing with stuff, it's kind of boring.
530155	533596	And the other thing that I don't really care for in it is the control.
533656	537377	The control, you have to use the stylus and you click to where you want Maxwell to go.
537837	540738	And it's so non-responsive.
540798	541178	It's just...
542267	546931	So Loki played with the playground and not the actual game and called it old.
572523	573884	Well, I'm telling you what I played.
574684	575405	I'm just saying.
575425	580809	I thought I'd be able to play this playground part and just, you know, have a lot of fun with it for quite a while.
580829	583190	Because, I mean, dude, I made a cat.
583871	590735	Well, first thing I did was I did what the ESRB had, you know, where they said you can lure a lion with meat strapped to a baby.
591155	594057	So I strapped meat to a baby and, you know, lured a lion with that.
594077	594678	And that was kind of funny.
595939	599881	And then I strapped a laser to a cat and tried to make a laser cat, but that didn't work.
600001	602363	Because, you know, it just didn't know what I wanted it to do.
603337	616223	Um, but yeah, I'm sure the puzzles are fun, but like I said, I haven't played there yet, and I'm just saying what, this is my impression so far, it's a really quick impression, but yeah, it's not as much fun as I thought it would be.
617624	618264	Fair enough, I guess.
619743	627167	Um, now, the other thing, too, uh, this week is I finally, finally, finally got my arcade cabinet.
627608	635532	So I went down to the, um, San Jose and picked up my Astro City candy cab and brought it home.
636353	638314	And also with that, I got a...
639767	666732	was it um an MVS um Neo Geo board a single slot with a 48 in one which I'm sure is absolutely not legit one bit um 48 in one Neo Geo cart that's got a lot of King of Fighters and Metal Slug and whatnot on there but um you know basically I have that to hold me over until I finish my main computer and all that stuff um but it's kind of cool so I'm putting that all together and um
668231	673314	Actually going to be painting the whole thing black, so I'm going to have to do that as well because it's kind of scuffed up.
674375	683920	I tried to find a white paint or something that might match it, but you can't match the color of the plastic there, so it's just easier to paint the whole thing black.
687182	689784	I've got some pics on my LiveJournal right now of just the cabinet.
689844	691004	It's kind of taken apart a little bit.
691024	692145	The control panel wasn't on there.
692425	694506	I had to re-screw that back on there because they gave me...
695580	696521	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
716291	717091	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
734000	746610	This was $22.38, so I had to go order that specially online from Atlanta, and they had apparently some of these Toshiba fluorescent lights, so I had that.
746770	749172	Now, you are still taking late donations for your cabinet.
749192	749853	Oh, yeah, definitely.
750033	751094	Okay, good, because I never donate.
751754	755017	I was going to do it on Friday, but I got sidetracked, so I'm going to give you a late donation.
755057	757299	I still got lots of stuff I got to get online.
757379	758820	I'm planning on refurbing my...
759861	771424	I'm actually rebuilding my DDR pads and I have an email into Channel Beat about Dance Maniacs sensors because I have the actual Dance Maniacs machine.
771464	776685	I have two upper sensors but I need two lower sensors and if I can get them for a good price I'm going to buy them from them.
777065	778206	Now where did you put all these machines?
778226	779106	Are you putting them in your garage?
780109	782891	Well, I don't have a Dance Maniacs machine.
782931	784633	I have the motherboard inside of it.
784713	785954	Right, but you used to have your candy cab.
785994	786554	Where's that going?
786694	789537	The candy cab's in the garage right now, but it's going to go in the middle room.
790157	790598	Oh, okay.
790618	799205	I'm taking the TV, the HDTV, and there's an HDTV and a Stanford in the room right now, and that's leaving our room, going into our bedroom.
799225	802027	So you have to put the toys in the middle bedroom so the wife can close the door and not see it.
802952	803792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
831604	838908	My gaming week was a marathon session of Beatles Rock Band, which I really loved.
839228	847252	I had a great time playing, especially doing harmony, because everybody doesn't have to do all the harmony, but you get more bonuses if you harmonize properly.
848373	850454	And I had a really good time with that.
850494	854976	That was a lot of fun, except that my hand started hurting after a while playing some of the guitar.
855717	855877	Yeah.
856457	859839	I was going to say, I forgot, I also did play Beal's Rock Band and Rock Band 2.
860179	869504	Did you know, actually, and this is kind of neat, I just tried it because I wasn't sure if it worked, that the old Karaoke Revolution mics from the PlayStation 2 actually work on the 360 version of Rock Band?
869884	871965	Did you know the Lips mics also work on it?
872674	877539	I didn't know if they patched that stuff in yet, but I know they were supposed to be getting patched in soon.
878280	888911	Well, Dan made it out of his conference with a double set of Lips mics, and so we used those.
889172	890013	We had a really good time.
890273	891174	I thought it was great.
891314	900801	So you guys both feel... No, you kind of already gave your review last week, Loki, and you said, I'm not a fan of the Beatles, so I'm not as yippy about this, but I see where people are getting excited about it.
900941	919874	Yeah, it was alright, but I think we came away with it like, wow, the Beatles had some really tripped out shit in there, and their songs were weird, because we had Nathan singing the stuff, and he's just like, holy crap, I didn't know that they had these weird songs, but after about maybe 10 minutes of it, we're just like, okay, let's go to Rock Band 2, because we just got tired of it.
920174	920994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
944740	966956	and which is actually really easy and fun to sing it's the only one I beat on expert and then something was on there which is another one I like and we also the the theme was we had a discussion on who had the better hair and we all agreed that George Harrison had better hair and um now quick question have you explored download content because you know some of the okay because some of it's there we just rented it because Dan was a button didn't pre-order it for me I see
967336	967837	I, I, I, I, I
986931	995677	There were really some fun ones in there, like Taxman was in there, and I think I saw She Came In Through the Bathroom Window, which is a cool song.
998419	1002822	A lot of stuff, you know, but of course then I had to go and listen to all the stuff that Tiare gave me.
1003923	1006605	I actually listened to Rubber Soul like three times all the way through.
1007335	1008156	I feel so uncool.
1008176	1010817	I'm like the only person that didn't play Beatles Rock Band this week.
1011418	1012639	And granted, it's my own damn fault.
1012679	1016682	My Xbox 360 is still broke and I need to go get it fixed.
1017422	1022686	I've just been complacent doing all this other stuff and I've just been busy with some other things in my personal life so I haven't really gotten out to get it fixed.
1023066	1027049	But I'm not going to re-buy the instruments just for the PS3 version.
1027129	1029771	No, I have all these money invested in instruments on the 360.
1030351	1031692	That's where I want to get Beatles Rock Band.
1031732	1032813	So I'm just a little behind.
1033273	1035935	And by the time I'm ready to play it, there'll probably be nobody left playing it online.
1037506	1067079	well um I also um like I'm doing right now play Sims 3 because I love Sims 3 and um it's actually really easy to uh run it during the show cause I have to always be doing something um I also um what else did I play no I don't think I played I was gonna play a Dreamcast game and I didn't you know thought about it didn't do it played some pinball
1068641	1070482	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1092409	1093690	I've played twice!
1094291	1099175	Clearly I have issues because I'm already like level 24, but I have some friends that are playing, so whatever.
1099235	1100135	It makes it go by faster.
1100796	1106281	And I'm sure there's people that are going to be like, you could have gotten your Xbox fixed, but you've been playing World of Warcraft.
1106321	1106961	Don't judge me!
1109583	1110264	Let's see, what else?
1111045	1114227	I've been playing... I have been playing some stuff on the PlayStation as well.
1115448	1117030	Just kind of mostly the same stuff.
1117090	1118070	Wipeout and...
1120146	1126736	Home, even I got some more invites to the club on there taken care of, so if you were waiting for that, then you probably got that.
1127317	1128378	And yeah, just kind of...
1129448	1130088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1150476	1154722	After having been missing frequency and amplitude for so long, it's kind of cool to have this.
1155082	1159448	I do miss the techno music, but Rock Band Unplugged has a decent song list.
1160990	1161831	I'm satisfied.
1162833	1163814	So, all right.
1163974	1165856	Well, that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.
1165996	1168739	So let's get into our housekeeping tonight.
1169279	1172963	In tonight's housekeeping, there may or may not be a show next week.
1173043	1175826	I'm thinking, and I kind of have to ask this live on air.
1176166	1176386	No?
1176827	1177207	No show?
1177547	1178248	Are you out?
1178568	1178909	I'm out.
1179349	1180610	Okay, so then we're not going to do it.
1181531	1184392	I have stuff that needs to get done on Sunday night.
1184532	1185092	Okay, then fine.
1185112	1188813	Because I was going to suggest we do it late because my flight gets in at 5.30 so maybe we can start the show at 7.
1189333	1191754	But we'll just not do it then if you have stuff going on too.
1192094	1193194	So free night for Loki, woo!
1193675	1194835	I get to work in the cabinet, woo!
1195915	1198376	But the problem is I am also going to be out
1198956	1200037	The First Weekend of October
1216892	1218633	That's it, I guess, for housekeeping.
1218673	1220133	Otherwise, you can always follow us on Twitter.
1220213	1222674	We're Orange Lounge on... I'm sorry, OLR on Twitter.
1223154	1225155	We're OLRmy on Facebook.
1225215	1232438	It's a club, so you have to search for OLRMY and Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, although I don't think we've posted to LiveJournal in about a year, but it's there.
1233218	1235019	I should cross-post some of mine.
1235319	1237640	You should actually cross-post some of it to Orange Lounge.
1237660	1238980	It'd be nice to see that being updated.
1239040	1239601	So there you go.
1239621	1240261	Okay.
1240421	1241362	Thank you for watching.
1241382	1241762	See you next time.
1256673	1260715	regarding Kurt Cobain's appearance in Guitar Hero 5, apparently.
1261155	1263476	And this is her two posts that she had on Twitter.
1263957	1274782	For the record, this Guitar Hero shit is breach of contract on Bully's part, and there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction.
1275402	1278884	And then she followed up with, we are going to sue the shit out of Activision...
1279345	1287326	We being the Trusty Estates, the LLC, and the various LLCs, Cobain Enterprise.
1288638	1292760	This is going to be a completely unrelated statement, but I just have to get this off my chest.
1293281	1298403	Isn't this fascinating that we live in a world now where Twitter is like a late-breaking news source?
1298844	1302326	And a lot of the reason why is because celebrities on Twitter are unfiltered.
1302346	1305327	They're not going through their publicists and writing things like this.
1305627	1309670	I don't know why, but seven years ago when we started this show, we would never have a story like this.
1310010	1311471	But now it's kind of weird that...
1312811	1316093	We're reading about Courtney being pissed off, like, through her Twitter.
1316513	1319454	It's just weird that Twitter is, like, this news source all of a sudden.
1319494	1320135	Here's my thing.
1320195	1320515	It's weird.
1321315	1324177	Why the hell is anyone reading Courtney Loves Twitter?
1324797	1326078	I mean, seriously.
1326118	1326698	She has fans.
1328399	1328879	Who?
1328899	1329379	She does?
1329399	1330940	Like, convicts?
1331120	1331820	I mean, who?
1331961	1332181	I mean...
1333254	1334155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1353570	1355411	Violet by Hole Violet by Hole
1381246	1392260	Lip Sync Thingy because everybody else was doing lollipop, lollipop and all this stupid shit and all dressed and clear cut and here we are going out on stage and drag singing Violet and it was all kinds of awesome.
1392580	1393361	You know how we did?
1393762	1395404	We got last place.
1396325	1397467	Last place.
1398087	1399069	Thank you, Courtney Love.
1400049	1403072	I mean, okay, they had a... I was a hot-ass Courtney Love, though.
1403092	1404833	I will just put that out there.
1404853	1408116	Well, they did have a picture of Courtney Love on Kotaku during one of the stories.
1408136	1409937	It actually was one of the good pictures of her.
1409957	1412159	I'm like, wow, she was hot at one time.
1412499	1413720	What the fuck happened there?
1414441	1416723	I'm guessing a lot of drugs, but, you know, hey.
1417343	1418584	Anyways, back to the story.
1419045	1422588	So, she was pissed off that, you know, Kurt Cobain is...
1425897	1432239	And I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos regarding this.
1432779	1441162	Apparently, these artists can be unlocked as playable characters in the game, so therefore you can make them sing any retarded song that's in this game.
1442623	1445044	Including, I think they had one that had Flava Flav in it.
1445104	1449886	So they had the clip, of course, of Kurt Cobain lip-synced to...
1450706	1454092	Flava Flav, and I mean, that's just blasphemy right there.
1455173	1462906	Activision responded, of course, after these stupid Twitter updates saying that Courtney Love signed a, you know, contract for this and, you know,
1463933	1465054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1481929	1482530	Thanks for watching!
1501702	1507986	While we are aware of Kurt's image being used with the two Nirvana songs, we didn't know that the players had the ability to unlock the character.
1508006	1512950	This feature allows the character to be used with any kind of song the player wants.
1513330	1519974	We urge Activision to do the right thing in relocking Kurt's character so that this won't continue in the future.
1520435	1526659	It's hard to watch an image of Kurt pantomiming other artists alongside cartoon characters.
1526959	1531062	Kurt Cobain wrote songs that hold a lot of meaning to people all over the world.
1531682	1532563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1553857	1554617	Thanks for watching!
1575871	1582256	They said that they, you know, of course, they know that they signed the agreement, but they didn't know that he was going to be used in that way.
1582536	1583136	That kind of thing.
1583997	1585198	This says it all right here.
1585598	1587520	Exactly where this whole thing is coming from.
1587920	1590922	They signed the agreement, but didn't know that it was going to be used in that way.
1591382	1592663	And here's the thing.
1592683	1592964	I'm sorry.
1593024	1593344	Go ahead.
1593584	1595025	Because I have a rant on this.
1595666	1595966	Go ahead.
1596827	1598008	I think that's actually it.
1598148	1598348	Good.
1600390	1600951	Here's the thing.
1601811	1609799	Obviously, there's multiple sides to every story, but having covered this crap as long as we have, I think I have a pretty good idea what's going on here.
1610119	1612141	And I'm probably wrong, and I'm pulling this out of my ass.
1612181	1614183	It's complete speculation, but here's my thought.
1615000	1621704	When this was shown to the people that it needed to be shown to, they didn't show the clip of Kurt Cobain doing Flava Flav.
1622084	1625746	They didn't say anything about Kurt Cobain being an unlockable character in the game.
1626206	1634050	They probably showed clips of Kurt Cobain doing the actual Nirvana songs, and then the proper signatures were obtained or what have you.
1634310	1637752	Although I hear that Courtney Love, she signed it, then she resisted it.
1638252	1638752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1656755	1657815	Thanks for watching!
1671980	1672160	Oh yeah.
1672180	1672320	Oh yeah.
1694298	1699659	You know, motion capture data that they basically collected for these different songs.
1699920	1706441	Going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com and reading comments, DarkTetsuya says, I could understand him having a problem with him singing stuff from other artists.
1706961	1709982	I don't see why they couldn't just lock him to only the Nirvana stuff.
1710282	1711583	See, well, A, there's two things to that.
1711803	1714804	A, you can't patch games on the Wii, and you can't patch games on the PlayStation 2.
1715264	1716944	So, it's done.
1717264	1719465	I mean, they could recall the game, but what's...
1720245	1723227	I don't mean to be disrespectful but I guess I am
1741049	1742190	You're putting him in a video game.
1742210	1742991	What do you expect?
1743051	1745412	I mean, this isn't... This is Guitar Hero.
1745613	1750156	I mean, if you want respectful treatment of artists, you need to go to Rock Band.
1750196	1750576	I'm sorry.
1752218	1754299	Burn.
1754359	1757522	Does Rock Band really... They don't have artist likeness in the games, do they?
1757762	1758202	No, they don't.
1758302	1760264	Except for the Beatles Rock Band, but that's the way you do it.
1760404	1761385	But I mean, I'm sorry.
1761485	1764647	It's just... God, it's Guitar Hero.
1764727	1766129	I mean, get over it, people.
1766429	1769211	If you don't like his likeness in the game, don't buy the game.
1770212	1770472	There you go.
1771758	1776130	or if you bought the game and it's too late return it at the same time
1777535	1778515	Isn't it just a game?
1779195	1781936	Isn't this just a type of artistic impression?
1782376	1796658	I mean, what's to stop me from going on YouTube and making a sock puppet effigy of Kurt Cobain singing whatever songs I want and then pretending to have that sock puppet effigy put a shotgun in his mouth and do away with himself?
1797058	1798079	Is it in bad taste?
1798299	1798599	Yes.
1798939	1800839	But can Courtney Love really sue me over that?
1800919	1801799	No, because it's art.
1802099	1803700	And I can kind of do whatever the fuck I want.
1803780	1805560	Well, keep in mind, though, her perspective, too.
1807157	1816878	She is his widow, and that's going to put a different emotional push on it for her than it would for anyone else.
1817930	1819130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1847700	1851701	I mean, in my opinion, before I signed, that's what I would have wanted to see.
1853441	1854902	But I have a feeling that didn't happen.
1855462	1856282	So, I don't know.
1858023	1860103	Azure Edge in a chat says, you should do that.
1861223	1863204	I'm not going to do that.
1863724	1870446	Look, I may not be the biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but that is extremely disrespectful, what I just suggested doing, and I'm not going to do it.
1871366	1872786	That's time out of my day.
1873086	1873387	Exactly.
1873447	1874387	I could be playing WoW.
1874467	1874787	Come on.
1875714	1876776	I'm not gonna make a mess.
1877318	1879462	Hey, do you know how much red corn syrup that would take?
1880284	1883351	At least, at least it's not Revolution X, okay?
1883411	1884713	I mean, they could have had it worse.
1887189	1890412	Um, Frisbee says even if it's not art, lol, freedom of speech.
1890692	1898458	You know, I suppose the difference though is that if I were to make that whole YouTube as disrespectful as it might be, I'm not charging for it and I'm not making money off of it.
1898658	1903121	And that's probably the big difference is that, you know, Activision makes a ton of money off Guitar Hero.
1903621	1908685	No offense, I'm sorry, but I can't see people going, oh my god, Kurt Cobain's in this game, I must buy it.
1909426	1911187	I don't think so.
1911247	1911567	I mean...
1912819	1915641	I'm sure maybe there is one or two, but I mean, come on.
1916001	1918943	I don't think people are going to buy a game just because an artist is in it.
1920304	1923407	Unless it's like the Beatles rock band where it's all about the artist.
1923447	1927429	Yeah, I can understand if it's Guitar Hero Navarro or something like that.
1927449	1929551	Or even the Metallica Guitar Hero, the Van Halen.
1929851	1938097	There are going to be people, as much as we've kind of made fun of Van Halen, Guitar Hero, there's going to be people that really want that because they're just diehard Van Halen fans.
1938537	1938958	I get that.
1940879	1941259	Yes, ma'am.
1941439	1942280	We need Van Hagar.
1943902	1945705	Different topic altogether.
1946366	1949831	GS68 in chat says, Kurt Cobain confirmed for Super Smash Bros.
1949851	1949831	4.
1949971	1953396	How about Silent Hill?
1953436	1954598	Now that's bad taste.
1957141	1961703	SalaciousPop says, when he finds his way into Space Channel 5-3, I'll be impressed.
1964124	1965905	Wouldn't it be funny if she just didn't realize?
1965925	1969986	I would like to see people make YouTubes of Kurt Cobain in other video games now.
1970006	1974248	This should become the new meme or whatever you want to call it that's out there.
1974428	1976089	Somebody should do that.
1976509	1980751	Put Kurt Cobain's face on Ulala's head and have him doing the choo-choo and all that.
1980791	1985873	Wouldn't it be funny, though, if she accidentally signed off on his appearance being
1986733	2000580	In any Activision game, like Call of Duty or, you know, some Madagascar game or... Well, the other thing to consider, too, is how intoxicated was she when she signed?
2001621	2002041	Because now...
2004022	2005443	That's her own fucking fault then.
2005584	2005744	No.
2006544	2014830	If she can prove that she was sufficiently drunk enough or intoxicated enough, then it actually could be considered null and void under federal business law.
2014950	2016211	You have got to be kidding me.
2016491	2017852	Even if witnesses signed it too?
2019053	2019814	I took business law.
2019914	2021575	Why should that be an excuse?
2021895	2024137	Sober the fuck up before you sign something.
2024557	2026799	The same thing applies to weddings too.
2027998	2028438	Thanks for watching!
2048516	2056181	Well, they shouldn't have got her to sign it, but, you know, she can say, Hey, I was really drunk at the time, then... And who wouldn't believe her?
2056362	2059083	Then there is cause to take it to court.
2060544	2063587	I don't know if she'd be smart enough to realize that, but... You wouldn't be able to prove that.
2063807	2069010	It would be... Salacious Poppinchat says, It is not legal to enter contract with an impaired person.
2069050	2070812	Then how did they ever get her to sign?
2072333	2072553	Ever.
2073654	2074394	Hey, she's drunk.
2074434	2075235	Let's get her to sign.
2076636	2080477	I mean, isn't there... Surely... I don't know.
2081117	2083218	I'm thinking, does she have soul... We can't tell the difference.
2083238	2085719	Does she have soul power of attorney over everything?
2086859	2087339	Probably.
2087819	2088580	She probably does, huh?
2088920	2091200	There wouldn't be like a lawyer involved or anybody else that signs off, right?
2091220	2092841	I think she was listed full executor, wasn't she?
2093501	2095282	And I don't think their daughter's 18 yet.
2095562	2095722	No.
2095762	2096402	So, no.
2097002	2098443	Although she's an attractive young lady.
2098463	2099623	I don't know if you've seen pictures of her.
2099643	2101183	She's aging very well.
2101484	2102364	That's just after her dad.
2102704	2102824	Mm-hmm.
2104093	2112878	Alright, anyhow, sorry, we're talking a bit too much about this, and I think everybody's got their thoughts out on this, but yeah, honestly, I don't think there's anything that can be done.
2112938	2119422	I think the stink is out there, I don't think her lawsuit is going to hold much weight unless, maybe DarkSakura's onto something, honestly.
2120202	2126846	It could be very interesting if that is the defense that comes up in court, is that she was too high to sign the documents.
2126866	2132409	She's a drugged up bitch, and that's, clearly, she can't enter into any contracts.
2134582	2137083	I'm fucked up Frisbee says zombies ate my cart
2157881	2158502	Alright, shush.
2159703	2162945	Let's move on to some more news and talk about zombies of a different sort.
2163506	2165728	And the type of zombies that are in Left 4 Dead 2.
2166508	2169271	Now, you know we've been talking about the boycotts of Left 4 Dead 2.
2169531	2174555	I know we've talked about it previously on this show about how there was this thing out there where all these people were signing it.
2174936	2179119	Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't be making Left 4 Dead 2 because you haven't supported Left 4 Dead 1 enough.
2179760	2184384	And I think the agreement among us here in studio was get over it.
2184604	2185104	Because...
2185925	2186726	Thanks for watching!
2215806	2218248	Well, here's an interesting tactic by Valve.
2218568	2219569	I actually have to hand it to them.
2220009	2223832	They actually invited the two Steam users who started the boycott.
2223852	2227235	Their online names are WalkingTarget and AgentOfChaos.
2227775	2235521	Right after the game was announced at E3 2009, they invited these guys to Valve's offices to play the game, interview members of the development team.
2236022	2241626	Now, the interesting thing is that the resolution of this is that these two guys say they're going to continue boycotting the upcoming title.
2241986	2248203	But at the same time, reported that the game seemed balanced and tight and did not feel like a rush jobs.
2249344	2274565	Now, of course, the people that all signed this petition, there's a lot of them saying, it's corrupt, you guys are corrupt, and now you guys should step down, you should no longer be admins of this, and the guys that went say, hey, what we did, we did way more than most people thought we'd get done, meaning they have over 40,000 members in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group on Steam.
2275266	2275486	Well...
2275706	2283913	and they are still demanding that Valve release this as a low-cost expansion pack to the original F for Dead is what the community is bitching for.
2284513	2289558	What I think... I really don't think that it's in any way kind of selling out.
2289818	2293061	It's that Valve offered an olive branch.
2293641	2297344	Yeah, I don't think these guys sold out by any means.
2298125	2301267	I think that they, out of...
2303803	2305967	I actually think it's a very mature thing that they did.
2308031	2311077	Humoring them, looking at it, trying to see if maybe...
2312330	2314191	They were justified or not, you know what I mean?
2315251	2322773	But doesn't that strike you as weird that on one hand they're saying we're going to continue the boycott and on the other hand they're saying, but the game doesn't feel rushed, it does feel pretty complete.
2323093	2327034	Like, don't you get the sense that they're only continuing the boycott because they don't want to have that perception?
2327254	2329815	Like, imagine they come home and drop the boycott.
2330175	2331516	Like, what's that going to make them look like?
2331616	2333776	It's going to make it look like their silence was bought, right?
2334477	2334717	No.
2334757	2339038	Don't you wonder if that's coming into play, that they just don't want their integrity questioned?
2341636	2353266	See, if they came out and said, we played the game, and, you know, we'd like to retract our position, everything that we complained about, we were wrong.
2354327	2357449	I think that is bigger balls and shows more integrity.
2358430	2363354	But if they're, if they, have they provided a reason that they're still going to continue their boycott?
2364415	2366877	Do they say it still doesn't feel like a sequel?
2367418	2367738	You know...
2369162	2375904	To be fair, I'm reading this off of another news release, so I don't have their full statement on whatever it is they went and visited.
2375924	2378625	We need to wait to see if they say why they're continuing.
2378645	2379685	Let me see if I can find that.
2379705	2383026	Chatters, feel free to help out if you have a link to something that they said.
2383306	2384946	It's just a safe face on their part.
2384986	2385827	That's all it really is.
2385867	2391128	Because, like you said, if they came back and said, oh, the game's awesome, we should drop our boycott, then...
2394908	2396569	39,998 people go, you're fucking retarded.
2396709	2398970	Okay, here's another quote from them I found on another news source.
2399370	2404814	What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question and it will only get better.
2405734	2409736	But they will continue the boycott until their, quote, individual concerns are addressed.
2411478	2413519	Which, you know, I don't... Big fat paycheck.
2414059	2415620	No, I don't think it has anything to do with that.
2415660	2421924	I think, again, it's that they've dug themselves in too deep in this boycott now.
2423943	2426684	I don't think Valve was under any obligation to do what they did.
2426724	2433305	I think that was actually kind of nice of Valve and sets kind of a sad precedence is that if you bitch enough about something, they'll fly you out to fix it.
2433585	2435766	It almost kind of makes me go, hmm, where do I want to travel?
2436586	2437966	Oh, I would like to kind of go to Boston.
2438246	2442888	Hey, Beatles' Rock Band blows, and it was released way too soon after Rock Band 2.
2443808	2445088	And you know they're going to release Rock Band 3.
2445268	2445528	You know what?
2445588	2450909	Rock Band 3 needs to be an expansion to Rock Band 2, a cheap upgrade.
2451169	2451870	Yeah, that's right.
2452010	2452570	I said it.
2452710	2453250	It sucks.
2453550	2454650	Come sign my petition.
2454710	2455851	Yeah, free trip to Boston.
2455911	2456311	Yeah.
2458972	2460693	I'm just worried about the precedent that sets.
2461653	2464074	But again, I'm not blaming Valve.
2464094	2464954	It was very cool of them.
2465414	2467275	Well, but this has been a very big thing.
2467295	2468876	They've got a big gathering.
2468936	2474518	Like, you may have people go... If you had like a hundred people or so, that would be big enough.
2475238	2481180	But they've got, you know, in the tens of thousands, you know, they've got a big following.
2483692	2493375	I almost kind of think that hits the nail on the head.
2493415	2504939	If these guys feel that strongly about it, you know, and I realize we've debated this topic to death on the show, and I really don't want to rehash the whole damn thing, but if you really feel that strongly about it, the best message you could send is don't buy it.
2506423	2512927	Honestly, at the end of the day, no petition you sign or anything like that is going to have the impact that your wallet has at the store.
2514868	2515348	So there it is.
2517710	2518530	And let's see.
2519871	2523873	GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 exists because what Valve wants to do requires a sequel.
2524554	2530377	SalaciousPop says Valve has already done a ton of stuff that is anthema to pretty much every other developer.
2530397	2530637	Anathema.
2530858	2531358	Anathema.
2533348	2534530	using big words in my chat.
2534570	2534991	How dare you?
2535111	2535512	I'm just kidding.
2537175	2539840	By the way, there was a somewhat related story going on.
2541455	2553541	I guess there's a campaign going on to fly the Valve boss, Gabe Newell, over to Australia to actually look at a Left 4 Dead campaign that was made called Shotgun Sunrise.
2553581	2561045	It's a custom campaign that they want to fly the guy out there to release this.
2562226	2563446	They raised $3,000 in donations and...
2567483	2568304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2591445	2591965	People suck.
2618963	2619304	I don't know.
2619344	2625938	I think the Left 4 Dead community, some of them, I think they should be happy where they're being angry.
2626219	2627402	I think that's a waste of money.
2628203	2628384	What?
2628854	2642839	Well, I mean, I can understand if you feel passionately enough about something, especially if you put a whole lot of work into it, and you have enough other people that enjoy your work that they are willing to contribute to that, yeah, but in the end, it's a game, you know?
2643439	2648941	Why not save that $3,000 for, you know, people who need it, you know?
2650441	2652002	Aren't we in a global recession?
2652022	2654403	God damn, they raised that much money over this?
2655543	2657303	I'm just kind of surprised.
2657623	2660884	You know, that could go into an arcade cabinet.
2660924	2664545	Shush.
2664585	2671026	TheRobD in chat says, I would love, love for Valve to cancel Left 4 Dead 2 just to see how they would react.
2671566	2675827	I don't think that's going to happen, and I don't think you should let a few bad apples spoil the barrel, so to speak.
2676387	2680728	Again, I don't see how this is different from the sports games that come out every year.
2681668	2685771	and the DDRs and music games that get re-released every year that people buy.
2686212	2693297	You know, I don't see how this is that much different except it actually sounds like Valve is doing more than what a lot of these other games that come out every year do.
2693458	2694959	It actually sounds like there's more to it.
2695399	2697561	So, I don't know.
2697581	2698702	I think they should be happy.
2700283	2701924	I think some people just need to get over themselves.
2702044	2702665	Alright, let's move on.
2702685	2703005	More news.
2703646	2705547	Well, guess what came out for iPhone?
2706428	2707749	Commodore 64 emulator.
2708996	2709697	Isn't that great?
2709937	2710357	Awesome.
2710377	2711138	Where can I download it?
2711178	2711578	You can't.
2711899	2712919	Don't.
2713020	2719425	Because they have found problems that will be problems for Apple, actually.
2720766	2727672	Yeah, there were ways to access basic programming, like the language basic.
2728253	2730915	And so Apple's like, no, and stopped it.
2731687	2737711	Yeah, isn't there some type of clause that you can't release an application that it programs or something like that?
2737751	2743415	Like you can't have an application on the iPhone that can program the iPhone to do anything you want?
2743855	2750780	All they have to do is edit the emulator just to disinclude the basic...
2751892	2756295	What's funny is I think people are going to constantly find ways to get to BASIC.
2756315	2759417	Because obviously they figured out a way to abort the game somehow and get into BASIC.
2759857	2762059	So I would think they're going to keep doing this somehow.
2762159	2765741	But I guess if they patch this to keep Apple happy, then that's kind of cool.
2766022	2768903	Because I grew up on the Commodore 64.
2769644	2772986	That was my gaming system until our family had an NES.
2773026	2775128	That was my gaming system from ages like 5 to 10.
2775668	2779871	So I would love to relive some of those games for my youth, but...
2781212	2784688	Well, it's been resubmitted so we'll see if it hangs around.
2786687	2787587	That would be kind of cool.
2789088	2792510	I wonder, though, if the games that are being released on this emulator are legal.
2793170	2796612	Like, I know they say that they have kind of like this mix of games.
2796632	2800154	Like, is the guy getting permission from these companies, or does he have to?
2800234	2805457	Maybe copyright laws are up, because it's been about 25 years since most of these games were released.
2805637	2805937	What, like 84?
2805977	2808658	Yeah, about 25 years since most of these games came out.
2808698	2811900	Maybe copyright law comes into play if none of these companies got their... It's only a handful.
2812040	2815062	Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Jupiter Lander, Arctic Shipwreck, and Jack Attack Early JogCon
2837499	2842021	You held down the little fire button to drive and you turned the paddle back and forth to kind of move back and forth on the track.
2842061	2843401	It was a lot of fun.
2843661	2846422	You had to avoid other cars and so forth and you could race forever.
2847943	2853825	Even though that's the type of game I think would throw me for five minutes now, like hours I played this game as a kid.
2854285	2857506	But it was like I guess you could call it a first party or whatever.
2857546	2858947	It was actually put out by Commodore.
2859247	2863428	So I'm wondering if all these games don't have Commodore's sort of blessing or what's going on.
2864028	2864129	So...
2866321	2870865	Frisbee in chat says, Dear Apple, what about some open source on the iPhone?
2872587	2879273	I just don't think you're going to see that happen because what they're probably worried about is people getting into the phone aspect of it.
2879794	2887020	Using all these programming, hacking it so that the phones get open and suddenly you can make phone calls without having to pay for it and so on.
2887140	2890383	I just think they're really worried about how far you can hack these devices.
2891444	2894507	GS68 says, I want to see MSX games on the iPhone.
2894607	2894948	Damn it.
2895628	2895968	Oh, wait.
2896048	2897810	Americans don't care about MSX.
2898411	2901433	I'd like to see the original Metal Gear Solid 2.
2901473	2904676	The original Metal Gear, for one, before it was Nintendo-fied.
2905097	2907179	And the original Metal Gear 2.
2907979	2909481	And I wouldn't mind seeing Gartic.
2910021	2913584	But the problem is, who's going to translate those?
2913825	2914545	Fans!
2914645	2916147	You better learn how to speak Japanese.
2916987	2917468	Something like that.
2918666	2921530	Well, coming to the PSP is yet another firmware.
2921590	2922592	Of course, why not?
2923373	2925397	They have plenty of other firmwares.
2926258	2928121	Like all the other firmwares, it's been cracked already.
2928402	2929463	Not that that's really important.
2930484	2938626	But what this firmware does hint at, though, is some things that possibly will be coming out later on, including game rentals.
2939146	2946528	Apparently, as part of the changelog, they have ways that you can now group different folders.
2946808	2951949	It says games now can be grouped and displayed in folders based on their expire dates under game.
2952669	2958791	So that means that there's going to be some sort of trials or something that's going to expire after a certain amount of time.
2960302	2978370	And then of course, some other stuff, you know, they changed, you know, settings, network updates have been changed to system update, the number of colors that can be selected on our settings has been increased, and revisions to strengthen security, of course, with the internet browser.
2982936	2990206	The others, of course, before they already have support now for video rentals, so maybe now they're going to do it with games.
2991380	2995161	I think it has to be something big like that because what else justifies the 6.0?
2995941	2997121	I mean, it's not like 5.3 or 5.0.
2997981	3001902	This is a major release or they wouldn't call it 6.0.
3002542	3004483	It's a PSP Go because it's coming out in like two weeks.
3005083	3005963	Oh, that makes sense too.
3006183	3007143	Okay, fair enough.
3007823	3009804	Do you think though that game rentals is something?
3009824	3020266	I mean, it's nothing I ever thought of before, but then when I thought, oh my gosh, like companies get mad at the game rental industry because they don't see any of those profits.
3021570	3023291	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3046047	3048069	I mean, you know how bad the PSP is doing.
3048109	3050030	I mean, it's hardly selling anything.
3050050	3051631	There's not a lot of good games out for it.
3052052	3056555	Most stores do not bring in PSP as a rental category.
3056955	3060178	Okay, but only a matter of time then before it's on PlayStation 3.
3061779	3065802	Although those games are ginormous, I don't know the feasibility of that, but...
3067803	3070344	We're years away from that being possible.
3070464	3072945	I mean, technology gets better, data moves faster.
3073326	3080609	We're five years away from a PS3 game being downloadable as fast as a Super Nintendo ROM is these days.
3080629	3087132	Yeah, but in five years it's going to be a PlayStation 4 and no one's going to give a crap about PlayStation 3 titles that are downloadable.
3087552	3089853	Just like PlayStation 1 titles that come out now.
3090533	3094615	Yeah, that's kind of cool that they're re-releasing them again, but really, is it such a big deal?
3094735	3096996	I mean, is it even something that you would go rent?
3097296	3101839	I mean, especially when the titles are like $10, what are they going to charge for rentals?
3101859	3101839	$2?
3101959	3104520	I mean, it's just not really...
3106087	3106827	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3131052	3135975	We could put out demos for free so that you can test our products and see if it's something that you want.
3136235	3137696	But no, we're going to be assholes about it.
3137756	3143379	We're going to allow you to buy a demo, basically, of this game, rent it for a little bit, and decide if you want it.
3143479	3145780	And that way, if you don't like it, hey, we still got some of your money.
3147441	3152584	But at the same time, what about we drop $60 on a game that we play for a week and then never play again?
3152784	3155106	I mean, imagine if we could spend only $10.
3155366	3158067	You know, $9.99 to rent the game for a week.
3158588	3159048	That would be...
3160532	3162593	Maybe something I'd rather do for a lot of games.
3163713	3166153	I would go rent them at your mom and pop rental store.
3166173	3167014	But they're always out!
3168014	3171675	Imagine if I can go onto this digital thing, click a button, it's downloading, I got it.
3172855	3175556	Well good, if that's an option for you, I mean, that's awesome.
3175616	3190079	But the thing is, I mean, it's always good to have more options, but I don't want them to forego demos for this rental stuff because they feel that they can make more money if you don't have a way to try out this game.
3191175	3192256	without paying money.
3193697	3198121	I just think, especially PSP games, I think you're going to see, and you're right, I may...
3199355	3207881	I don't think PSP games are really rented at stores, so I don't think you're going to see this dig into the real rental market right now, but it's about setting a precedent.
3208202	3215367	Especially with PSP Go being digital download only, and that they think this thing's going to be huge, although I don't think it is.
3216368	3222813	I think they're setting the stage for this whole rental thing that is first party, and we haven't seen anything like it before.
3224393	3252224	I think this is a pretty big deal on what's coming and I think probably it sounds like by the holidays this is going to be something that's launched oh man the PSP Go is going to be it's going to fail so bad don't get me wrong I like the PSP 3000 I just yeah well I hate going over the same territory but still I mean there's other stories I'm sure we have coming up um
3253806	3261588	It's like, what exactly are you doing different with the PSP Go other than charging me a lot more money and not having the ability to play UMD games?
3262128	3265249	I mean, there's really nothing that's going to be exclusive to that.
3266049	3268170	Maybe rentals are exclusive to the PSP Go?
3268370	3268490	No.
3268650	3269130	Question mark?
3269250	3270230	It won't be, because you know why?
3270791	3275732	Because if they do it exclusive to the PSP Go, then they lose out on all the PSP 3000 stuff.
3276492	3277452	Yeah, I don't know.
3277933	3280413	Deathwishing in chat says, I love renting PSP games.
3280493	3282854	Renting PSP games are awesome when you go on trips.
3284329	3285170	It makes sense.
3285230	3287412	I mean, if you're going to go on a long road trip, why not rent a game?
3287872	3295518	They do have PSP rentals and NDS rentals with the kiosks and airports and stuff like that.
3295558	3296119	You can do that.
3296159	3301063	There's a place in the airport here that has a rental thing and you drop it off in the box.
3301143	3303304	Oh good, I'm going to LA next week and I'm flying.
3303344	3304365	Maybe I'll have to utilize that.
3304906	3305806	Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.
3305826	3310790	You rent it where you're flying out of and you can drop it off.
3310971	3313973	They have one in every single airport, major airport, yeah.
3314531	3316012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3335620	3338863	Hello, there's still quite a few people that are very into their PC gaming, love it.
3339323	3345028	And Batman Arkham Asylum, of course, was released on the Games for Windows platform so that those folks could play it there as well.
3345148	3349192	But, of course, where there is PC gaming, there is piracy.
3349612	3360501	So I guess an early version of this game leaked out, and there was a user that actually posted on the official Eidos forums with a post that went something like this, that he had a glitch with his PC version of the game.
3360601	3360841	Quote,
3361542	3362283	I've got a problem.
3362603	3375936	When it's time to use Batman's glide in the game, when I hold the comma like it's said to to jump from one platform to another, Batman tries to open his wings again and again instead of gliding, so he falls down into poison gas.
3376357	3378119	If somebody could tell me what should I do here?
3378759	3384445	And it was actually replied to by an admin on the forums, Kier, responded to the thread and said...
3384665	3385245	Isn't that Entrapment?
3413753	3434274	um no because they're not really implicating them it's just so that they have an unplayable copy of it if they but here's the thing here's the funny thing about it one they've done this before with Grand Theft Auto um if you pirated Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC they had this thing basically it was drunk cam all the time it was shaking around making it really hard to play um
3435731	3440721	And then the other thing is this problem with Batman Arkham Asylum got patched within like a day.
3441583	3443868	It was only effective for about a day and then that was it.
3445331	3449235	And that's what Tigerclaw says in chat as well, is that the glitch was later fixed.
3449295	3451837	And yeah, I think we're all not surprised to hear that.
3452318	3456722	But how many people do you think think to find the fix?
3457582	3467532	Do you think that maybe this does still defeat a lot of pirates because they'll get the game, play it, go, this sucks, and delete it without ever thinking to look for a patch?
3467552	3467872	Yeah.
3469074	3469755	Um, no.
3469935	3482927	Maybe stupid people that, you know, are not really normally pirating games, but a lot of people will get frustrated with it, and then, like, a week later, they'll read on the forums that this was intentional, and then they'll redownload it again.
3483027	3483488	I mean, it's...
3484048	3489790	El no nombre hombre in our chatroom says, No, it's not entrapment because they're A, not law enforcement, and B, they aren't asking them to pirate.
3514246	3519690	Well, I meant that I thought that they had called the police on them, but no, they haven't.
3519751	3522553	No, it looks like they just banned this guy from their forums or what have you.
3522633	3525815	I mean, well, to be fair, couldn't they report it?
3526096	3529679	They could report it, but they sort of set him up.
3530976	3549366	I don't know, I'm kind of reminded of, and this is going to make me sound super gay But Madonna, when one of her albums was leaked to the internet It was actually something Madonna's record label released themselves And it would start the song and you would hear the first 15 seconds And then you would hear Madonna's voice come on and go, what the fuck are you doing?
3551027	3558091	So she basically put out all these bogus mp3s that started off like the real thing And then would just cut off and it would be her going, what the fuck are you doing?
3560349	3561631	I'm kind of reminded of that.
3561671	3567316	This is essentially the video game equivalent of that, except the game doesn't taunt you.
3567657	3571941	Well, it taunts you without directly taunting you, if that makes sense.
3573663	3576786	I don't know if entrapment would be the word I would use, though.
3576946	3578688	Yeah, that wasn't quite what I was thinking of.
3580174	3590598	I don't know what legal recourse they could seek with this because, yeah, but I certainly think it's a good way to out the people that aren't supporting them.
3590638	3595539	I mean, to go so far, it's pretty bold to download a pirated copy of the game and post on the forums about it.
3595960	3605303	That is kind of a stupid thing to do, in my opinion, is that if you're going to steal... But I don't think that they had any way of knowing that it was an intentional glitch.
3608137	3613939	Salacious Pop in chat says that it would defer anyone, even the idiot makes it worth it, in my opinion.
3614099	3628725	I kind of tend to agree with that statement because, you know, even if it took a day for that patch to come out that fixed it, that was still one day where you might have some of these pirates get fed up with waiting and go, I'm just going to buy it.
3629565	3630746	It looked cool enough from what I saw.
3630786	3632347	I'm just going to buy it.
3632727	3639011	And even if that drove sales, it did curb a low percentage of the piracy and had more of an impact than not doing anything at all.
3639972	3640372	True.
3641153	3641433	I guess.
3645142	3648885	TheRobD in chat says the best part would be if the game crashed before the final boss.
3648945	3650786	That would be the best middle finger to the pirates.
3651727	3652668	Remember Earthbound?
3653108	3663516	Yeah, but the problem with Earthbound is one thing, but I think the problem with what RobD is suggesting, as funny and clever as that is, I think that most people would say at that point, I played enough of the game, forget it.
3664056	3665476	I mean, I love the Earthbound thing.
3665516	3666897	We talked about it a couple weeks on the show.
3667697	3672178	It doubled the number of monsters and would crash your game, delete the save and everything.
3672258	3675719	But I think there's a lot of people that at that point would just go, Ah, fuck it.
3675779	3677280	I don't need to worry about this game anymore.
3677300	3678580	I'm going to move on and steal something else.
3678600	3686182	Also, after having seen the last boss and ending of the game, first of all, the last boss is actually kind of easy.
3688583	3689143	Uber Joker.
3690143	3693164	And the ending was less than a minute long.
3694244	3694584	Really?
3694644	3695385	For Arkham Asylum?
3695905	3698547	Well, it was short.
3699047	3700268	Spoiler free, please.
3700428	3704310	Less than five minutes is fair, although I don't remember it even being that long.
3704690	3704990	Wow.
3705551	3706191	Okay, fair enough.
3708941	3713103	Rob D in chat says, I think that if they played that long, they would be really frustrated with the inability to finish it.
3713163	3714144	Yeah, to some extent.
3714464	3728291	But I do think – I think Eidos did a funny thing here because I think people that are going to be bold enough to steal and then complain about their stolen game on the official forums, I think they deserve to kind of be made a mockery of.
3728791	3729271	You know what I mean?
3729892	3734734	So he kind of got us just desserts, and I think that's where a lot of us are doing the Nelson here going –
3737022	3737502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3768425	3772649	LucasArts is actually working on a new game.
3774451	3774931	Loom 2!
3776092	3776653	I wish.
3777274	3777974	I so wish.
3778355	3783459	But this is actually kind of cool because they said that they took their inspiration from games that are like Braid.
3784640	3786803	And of course Braid was pretty freaking cool.
3787123	3789245	Which, by the way, has gone down in price on Steam.
3790326	3790806	It's on sale.
3792248	3792328	Um...
3794448	3798331	It's called Lucidity, which is supposed to be an Xbox Live arcade game.
3799712	3803154	There's rumors of a PC version, but they didn't say anything about that.
3803614	3808657	It's a 2D side-scrolling platformer, but it has puzzle elements.
3809598	3814261	We play as a girl called Sophie, and she keeps moving.
3814281	3816102	You just have to move things out of her way.
3817363	3818904	Kind of Lemmings-ish, right?
3819244	3820745	That's kind of what it sounds like to me a little bit.
3821539	3826383	But I guess your goal is to get her from point A to point B. But is she stupid?
3826743	3828104	Like, you know, lemmings were stupid.
3828124	3828985	That was the whole point of the game.
3829005	3832928	They would just keep walking right off a cliff if they, you know, needed to.
3832948	3836451	They said that she's like in her abstract dream world.
3837632	3839553	So maybe she's just dreaming.
3840454	3841655	You know, kind of out of it.
3842135	3846799	But the art style is supposed to be the cut paper look of a pop-up book.
3847679	3848639	Oh, that's going to sound neat.
3848659	3851340	So it's going to look like an old school children's book.
3851720	3851940	Hmm.
3852220	3852960	Or Paper Mario.
3854521	3855801	She's dreaming stupid.
3856801	3864683	When was the last time we got a game from LucasArts that wasn't Star Wars related?
3865323	3866084	Lego Indiana Jones?
3866644	3866864	Yeah.
3866884	3868484	Oh, I didn't realize they were buying the Lego games.
3868704	3869465	It is LucasArts.
3869505	3870065	Indiana Jones.
3870585	3871185	Oh, gotcha.
3873528	3875992	Well, this sounds like it could be cool, but I'll wait to see if there's a demo.
3876012	3878015	And then before that, there was Fracture.
3879518	3881361	Alright, so there's just games I missed somehow.
3881381	3882262	There's too many video games.
3882282	3882883	You can't play them all.
3883484	3884045	I think that was them.
3884105	3884686	Yeah, Fracture.
3884967	3885568	Fracture sucked.
3885628	3886329	You can.
3886930	3887551	Underachiever.
3888689	3893651	I want to go back for a minute because I think this chat room comment bears repeating to Arkham Asylum.
3893691	3896232	TigerClaw wanted to clarify something on the ending of Arkham Asylum.
3896692	3898633	He says, Arkham Asylum continues on though.
3898853	3908136	After you beat the game, you can still click on continue story and you have free roaming of the entire game so you can go and find those Riddler trophies, the alignment puzzles, and interview tapes.
3908900	3909981	Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2
3936994	3939755	Yes, which will be coming out on pretty much everything.
3941356	3952041	Need for Speed Shift will be coming out this week as well on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PSP, and I believe the PC version as well.
3953922	3957564	Scribblenauts will be making its way out on DS this week.
3958084	3960926	Actually, I believe like a week from today, I think.
3962246	3963687	No, Tuesday, my mistake.
3965368	3965468	Um...
3966954	3971217	Actually, tomorrow, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story on the DS.
3972899	3974320	Some other crappy games on the DS.
3974500	3977963	My Boyfriend and Princess in Love on DS.
3979484	3980004	Woo-hoo.
3980525	3981746	Yeah.
3983287	3984007	Let's see.
3984848	3986089	Animal Planet, Vet Life.
3986770	3992874	I just want to say, though, I saw a commercial for Need for Speed Shift the other day on TV, and it looked pretty hot, because it was in high def.
3993235	3994155	It's like Project Gotham, yeah.
3994175	3994756	It looks kind of neat.
3994996	3996037	Yeah.
3998880	4002381	And speaking of piracy, Batman Arkham Asylum on PC.
4002521	4004622	So if you're complaining about it now, you don't have it yet.
4005482	4005762	Liars.
4006982	4008983	Bleach the Third Phantom on DS.
4009863	4011924	Chicken Blaster on DS and Wii.
4013284	4018186	Another movie tie-in game, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on pretty much every system except for the PlayStation 2.
4020767	4023808	Heroes Over Europe on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4025526	4036310	NHL 10 from EA on PS3 and Xbox 360 NHL 2K10 on PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360 People Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360 Red Faction Guerrilla finally making its way out on PC as well as Resident Evil 5
4055226	4058648	Time of Shadows I didn't even know they were giving that a PC release.
4059329	4060109	Yeah.
4060149	4061510	Time of Shadows, also on PC.
4062351	4073298	This week, that really crappy game they played on Konami's booth at E3 this year, Tornado Outbreak, formerly known as Zephyr Rise of the Elementals on PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
4073858	4076900	You remember that as kind of the Tornado Katamari type of game.
4077600	4081643	Toy Story Mania, based off the ride and in 3D, coming to the Wii.
4083055	4084396	Madballs and Babbo Invasion
4102448	4115571	And then finally, on Xbox 360, the Q Entertainment Trilogy on Xbox 360 Cubed, which features Rez, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and of course, Luminous Live.
4116192	4117632	And they left out 99 Nights.
4119372	4120913	Well, that's not Xbox Live.
4121053	4121833	I know, but still.
4124407	4125688	is there anything extra in this though?
4126328	4150047	you know what's funny besides some of their misfires like 99 Nights I really love Q Entertainment Tetsuya Mizuguchi is the man he's one of my favorites most of the games he puts out I love so I'm kind of curious if there's anything extra in the collection that would make it worth getting probably the download content is probably in there I'm not positive but it would make sense um
4151792	4152892	Oh, and how did I miss this?
4153493	4155734	Naruto Shippuden, Ninja Destiny 2.
4155814	4156334	Oh, who cares?
4156674	4157434	Who cares about Naruto?
4159135	4165777	Going over to Japan, September 17th, Fuel, the localized version for Japan, finally hits on September 17th.
4165877	4167498	Also, Left 4 Dead gets a price drop.
4167518	4168779	It moves into the Platinum Collection.
4168839	4170219	These are both on the Xbox 360.
4170619	4179483	Terminator Salvation from Squeenix is putting it out over in Japan, also on the Xbox 360, and a game called Velvet Assassin from Ubisoft makes its way to the Xbox 360.
4180623	4182866	PS3, Makai Senki Disgaea 3, Appendisk, Raspberry Hen Hajime Mashita
4196485	4199887	Tales of Vesperia makes its way out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
4200768	4207813	And then lastly, Terminator Salvation and Wet, both on the PlayStation 3 this week as well in Japan on the 17th.
4208213	4210415	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, checking out the games there.
4210495	4215558	Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean comes out from Nintendo in Japan this week.
4215878	4219701	House of the Dead Overkill, that comes by itself, and a version with the Wii Zapper.
4220041	4221702	The Wii Zapper's not dead in Japan, apparently.
4222483	4223964	It's coming out with that little bundle out there.
4225519	4227461	or they're just trying to unload the remaining supply they had.
4228282	4231184	PlayStation 2 sees some price reductions this week.
4231245	4240833	Bully the Scholarship Edition and Biohazard Code Veronica which of course is Resident Evil Code Veronica in a bundle with Resident Evil 4 or Biohazard 4 as it is in Japan.
4241434	4244316	And lastly on the handhelds
4246378	4251500	Saga 2, Hyou Densetsu, Goddess of Destiny
4260734	4264355	So maybe there'll be some folks wanting to import that, although they'll have to try and read it.
4264815	4268236	And Idolmaster, Dearly Stars, DS, get it?
4268856	4270677	Idolmaster definitely has its fans in Japan.
4270797	4272717	That is coming out on the Nintendo DS this week.
4273197	4275438	Do you think that's a franchise we will ever see happen over here?
4275778	4276458	Probably not.
4277238	4277579	Why not?
4278319	4280139	Because it's too Japanese.
4280519	4280999	Exactly.
4281440	4282520	I hate to say it because I...
4283308	4284689	Yeah, sounds weird, but yeah.
4285249	4288311	Quite a few games to pick from on the PSP this week in Japan.
4288611	4290372	Ys VII comes out this week.
4290792	4291572	Yu-Gi-Oh!

4304419	4307120	I'm assuming that is just the Mega Man games all packaged together.
4308421	4309582	And lastly...
4310262	4314204	and Ikiutsun Eloquent Fist gets a price reduction this week.
4314244	4315465	I'm trying to see what game that is.
4315685	4317246	I don't think that's one we have over here.
4318487	4318667	No.
4318847	4322049	No, one of the characters looks just like Sakura, though, but like an older version.
4322069	4322409	Look at that.
4322449	4323970	She's like wearing the same outfit and everything.
4324290	4326732	Well, it is a, you know, high school uniform.
4327112	4327452	I guess.
4328272	4329493	That's just what it makes me think of, though.
4329513	4330234	And it's Ys.
4331574	4332075	Chatroom.
4333155	4333676	Ys.
4335116	4335236	Ys.
4336477	4337138	Okay, there you go.
4337178	4338358	There's your release dates for Japan.
4338398	4339259	Dark Sakura, how about the U.K. ?
4340219	4346163	For the UK, we have on the 15th, as we discussed last week, Azuma's Revenge.
4347264	4349726	And then on the 18th, the whole crap ton of stuff.
4350206	4352408	We have Batman Arkham Asylum for PC.
4352528	4355330	Don't pirate it, or you'll get laughed at.
4356591	4369041	Blood Bowl, Katamari Forever for PS3, One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2 for Wii, Order of War, Raven Squad, Red Gorilla Faction, I'm sorry, Red Faction Gorilla, sorry.
4370109	4371830	I was reading Gorilla and thinking beer.
4373111	4382559	Resident Evil 5, Spectrobes Origins, The Humans for DS and PC, Wacky World of Sports for Wii, and WET.
4383179	4389944	Also, Yamaha Supercross for DS, and Need for Speed Shift on McCrap Tennis Systems.
4392006	4392306	Very cool.
4394871	4398876	So there's some new stuff finally making its way to home.
4399296	4400117	And this is kind of cool.
4400217	4401339	I fully endorse this.
4401799	4404602	Robot Chicken is coming to the PlayStation Home Theater.
4408107	4409088	I did that off camera, sorry.
4410309	4412091	DarkSakura's making sound effects in the studio.
4412191	4414214	I'm singing the Robot Chicken theme.
4414505	4415346	It was actually really funny.
4415406	4416887	It's a bummer you couldn't hear her.
4417708	4418528	I'm stealing a cookie.
4418909	4430359	So now they will actually have a bunch of different clips available on their theater screen that once played Twilight's... I remember when they were playing the Twilight trailer on there.
4430379	4431600	Well, thank God they got rid of that.
4432220	4432440	Yes.
4432941	4440187	So you'll be able to watch Robot Chicken for free, even though you can pretty much on your TV as well.
4441994	4443335	But neat, I guess.
4443995	4446276	Something else to watch while you're doing The Running Man.
4447857	4451699	Well, I think it's nice they're putting more useful things in home.
4451860	4452640	Does that make sense?
4453521	4459344	You know, trailers are one thing, but it's kind of nice that they're actually giving those theaters something a little more...
4461221	4462662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4484080	4489803	I think it's just a matter of time before you start seeing like the first episode of TV shows that they're trying to get you hooked into.
4489903	4494285	Like, you know, the Glee pilot or what other pilots they've been trying to sell this year.
4494785	4496786	There are other science fiction, Caprica's pilot.
4497066	4503089	You know, some of these shows that are coming out in 2010, you know, trying to kind of push those in Sony home.
4503329	4506030	I bet, you know, especially for the next fall season, you start seeing more of that.
4506310	4507171	Yeah, we'll see.
4508291	4509292	But that's kind of cool.
4509452	4511133	I think that's a good use of a PlayStation Home.
4511413	4514815	By the way, there's some free stuff on Home this weekend, too, if you haven't logged in.
4515295	4516676	And search for the OLR Club.
4516776	4517956	I don't actually have to invite you.
4518016	4521838	If you want to join the Orange Lounge Radio, just search for it in Clubhouses.
4521878	4526801	Either search for Orange Lounge Radio or OLRMY is like the keyword for it.
4526881	4530403	So search for either of those and you'll find the Clubhouse and I'll invite you in.
4532287	4542353	One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do with Penny Arcade Expo and some unfortunate kind of side effect of so many folks being all contained in one place.
4542934	4552039	PAX organizers did report this week that a confirmed swine flu case did break out at the show and unfortunately this has grown into about 100 cases of swine flu.
4552440	4558804	Of course H1N1 is the real name for it but everybody calls it swine flu coming out of Penny Arcade Expo so
4559284	4562426	Kind of scary that you get all those people together and these types of things break out.
4562907	4568551	Now, it's not just the swine flu, but of course the regular flu is showing up as well, as is various types of con things.
4569032	4575577	Now, this came up, and we talked about this for a little bit on our phone call with Bobby Blackwolf that we do on his show right before we go on the air tonight.
4575597	4583663	So we talked a little bit about this, and a couple bottom lines that come out of this is that A, this is just an unfortunate circumstance of cons.
4583703	4588847	And Jamie, you said something very smart about the fatigue that goes on at cons and why this happens a lot.
4589810	4593493	Well, and keep in mind, I was a long-time con-goer ever since I moved out here.
4593953	4598196	And before I moved out here, you know, my first convention, I slept like three hours.
4598677	4599597	It was a three-day convention.
4600638	4602319	So, yeah.
4603200	4604321	A lot of people will do that.
4604501	4605642	It's a big thing.
4605822	4610065	Like, for people who don't, you know, buy their hotel room and sleep in the lobby, people do that.
4610265	4610545	Sorry.
4611366	4615009	You are typically saving the typical con-goer.
4616471	4617492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4641825	4646468	I even ran away and got Moroccan food once at AX one year.
4649289	4653652	But people don't really think in terms of their health and the precautions they should be taking.
4654852	4660235	At least have a couple of good decent meals with vegetables.
4660675	4661916	Bring your vitamins with you.
4661976	4664397	Take a good supplement in the morning.
4664538	4668019	All of that contributes to your level of fatigue.
4668700	4669440	And sleep.
4669920	4670441	Please sleep.
4673101	4678062	The con is a few days, but you've got to live with your health for the rest of your life.
4679763	4690184	Now, I know that some people have kind of been wondering what my piece is going to be on this, because if you were listening to the show a couple months ago, you know I have been very personally affected by swine flu.
4690224	4692745	I lost a good friend of mine who is only 24 years old.
4692785	4698146	She passed away of H1N1 a couple months ago on June 23rd, right before my birthday.
4700286	4705729	I realize that what happened to her is not going to happen to everybody, okay?
4705829	4708890	So I don't think there needs to be paranoia out there about the swine flu.
4709351	4713172	But it pisses me off when people don't take this shit seriously.
4713793	4717895	And I don't think that people have to like, you know, oh my god, mass hysteria.
4717935	4719355	Like, no, nobody wants that.
4719696	4722217	But at the same time, don't belittle...
4722817	4723999	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4734766	4741033	and I don't want people because I actually know people like on Twitter that apparently caught this at PAX and I don't want people to freak out like, oh my gosh, am I going to die?
4741614	4742174	Probably not.
4742715	4747660	It's, you know, what happened with Beth was certainly an isolated circumstance.
4747760	4749022	There's still many questions.
4749042	4751084	We're never going to get answers to as to what happened there.
4751925	4752866	My point is, though,
4754434	4755155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4777472	4778312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4798081	4803266	If you suspect, whether you have PPO, HMO, whatever, it will pay for urgent care if you have symptoms.
4803306	4805287	So you don't have to go to the ER because you have a high fever.
4805508	4806629	You can go to an urgent care center.
4806829	4808030	You can make an appointment with your doctor.
4808610	4809611	Just go get checked out.
4809711	4810572	Get told it's nothing.
4810612	4811653	Get told it's the common cold.
4811733	4813615	It's better you do that than the alternative.
4813915	4823163	And if you don't have coverage, still a lot of those urgent care places will treat you for – the last one I ever went to was $75, I think.
4824224	4828166	If you're uninsured... They're there for that reason.
4828186	4830268	Yeah, go to an urgent care center, not the ER for this.
4830648	4833429	But get checked out for heaven's sake.
4833550	4835070	Don't sit on it and don't wait on it.
4835331	4842315	And the other side I want to do with this is that when you go to cons and when you go...
4843462	4846224	To these places, please be hygienic.
4846404	4854309	I know a lot of people make jokes about this stuff, the whole con funk and all that stuff, but that is a very real thing that can continue to spread disease.
4854950	4862935	And I want to reiterate one thing that Beth's mom, Lynn, said to the media when she was interviewed because Beth was the first person to die in this county from H1N1.
4863355	4869860	And the one thing that her mom said to me, and I will never forget this for the rest of my life, is her on the news saying this, and I want you all to remember this.
4870620	4871480	Wash your hands.
4871960	4872781	Wash your hands.
4873261	4873961	Wash your hands.
4875341	4876462	I am not fucking around.
4876522	4884544	When you go to these conventions and you're touching these controllers that hundreds of people have touched before and so forth, wash your hands.
4885124	4887564	Please help stop the spread of disease.
4887684	4889025	And wash your body while you're at it.
4890645	4897752	I remember, I don't actually know if you remember this Rob, the last time that we went to E3 together.
4898332	4899834	What did I have on me all the time?
4899894	4900754	Probably hand sanitizer.
4900774	4901795	Hand sanitizer.
4901975	4905078	I also had antibacterial lotion on hand.
4905639	4906840	I had band-aids.
4908561	4910783	Now this is something else I learned being a massage therapist.
4911604	4912124	DarkSakura.com
4927452	4928372	Active, live.
4928532	4933274	Even if you think you've wiped up all the blood, it'll still live on the surface of anything.
4933314	4936115	It's touched unless you wipe it off really good.
4936135	4941497	That's why they always say if you're going to be around someone who's bleeding, you put on latex gloves and then you take care of them.
4941638	4944259	Put on your own mask before.
4945139	4948140	Speaking of latex, if you're going to have con sex, use a condom.
4951021	4952922	Use a full body condom if you're having con sex.
4954048	4981131	um but I'm saying you know you may not think about this and the average person doesn't but there are so many different ways to get sick and I'm not saying be paranoid but if but really take precaution if you're going to be around that many people and at least always keep hand sanitizer around you and if at least be considerate to other people if you've got like a paper cut or a cut on your arm or something put a good watertight bandage on it so that you don't you know if you've
4981791	4989098	I've got, for example, and no, I've never had it, but I have antibodies for hepatitis because I inherited it from somebody.
4990138	4995283	But that still puts me at danger for exposing other people.
4995723	4997865	So that's why I'm always extra careful.
4997985	5000147	I always bandage up my cuts and things.
5000487	5001588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5027448	5033630	take a precaution that you don't share it and honestly, it's not worth it stay home, there'll be another convention
5034558	5047267	I'm hoping you're sitting there on your chair going, okay, get on with it, OLR, I know this crap, but please understand if one person's kind of sitting there going, oh yeah, maybe I should take extra soap to the next con I go to, then this whole little rant was worth it.
5047487	5051770	Because I see a comment in chat, Frisbee says, OLR-common sense.
5052230	5059335	I really hope to everybody it is common sense, but if you've ever made the con funk joke, then you know it's not common sense to everybody.
5060335	5063958	So just please, from your friends at OLR, wash your damn hands.
5064535	5082556	and again I do see I see the confunk around two particular groups the really young and the I have no life I've never you know been on a date you know 50 year old con fanboy that's probably why they never had a date
5082944	5086227	SJ100 Matt also wants to put out, and don't pee on the seat when you use the toilet.
5086267	5086947	Yeah, don't do that.
5087107	5087227	Nope.
5087828	5088668	I will say something to this.
5089069	5090610	Do not be afraid of urine on a seat.
5090990	5092351	It is sterile.
5092671	5094152	Just wipe it off.
5094633	5097535	But, I'm telling you, if you see poop on the seat, that's different.
5098356	5098656	No.
5098676	5099937	Okay, this is too much.
5100097	5100477	I'm done.
5100757	5101158	I'm done.
5101198	5102439	Rob, it actually is true.
5102499	5103119	Urine is sterile.
5104000	5106542	You have more germs on your hands and mouth than you do on your butt.
5107222	5107422	Nope.
5107582	5107983	Too much.
5108243	5108523	Done.
5110044	5111085	Just wash your hands, okay?
5111105	5112166	That was the point I wanted to make.
5113479	5113739	True, though.
5113799	5114120	I know, I know.
5126263	5129085	Somehow we always end up with the show in the toilet, even literally.
5129466	5136091	Hey, every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we urge you kids to go visit the archives and check out a classic video game of years past.
5136452	5137432	And tonight is no different.
5137452	5141096	DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and pick out a game she thinks you all should be playing.
5141136	5143417	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5144158	5145519	It's Pissarama.
5146020	5146740	No, I'm kidding.
5147141	5147621	I hate you.
5149242	5150323	Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
5150664	5151905	Okay, no, Space Harrier.
5151925	5154507	About damn time I did Space Harrier.
5156651	5163037	I actually just got an IM from Becky saying that she thinks it's funny whenever I go off about pee being sterile.
5163418	5164499	Will you get to the game?
5164679	5168943	No, go back, go back, because people have to hear that part.
5169243	5169704	Alright.
5171545	5172967	We're looking at an arcade version of the game here.
5173007	5173147	Yeah.
5173167	5175008	It has my catchphrase on it.
5175048	5175289	Here we go.
5179184	5181105	Now everyone knows where that comes from.
5181886	5184467	That has been, like, what, my catchphrase as long as you've known me?
5184547	5187789	It's been your little quote on forums, like, ever since I've known you.
5187829	5190150	Why that quote of the thousands of quotes out there?
5190190	5191511	Why this quote do you love so much?
5191531	5192251	Because it's just cool.
5192391	5193532	Welcome to the fantasy zone.
5193612	5193972	Get ready.
5194573	5194973	All right.
5194993	5196874	It's like, it really makes no sense.
5196974	5203718	Space Harrier is my third favorite video game ever, which is me, which means I have now covered...
5204498	5207422	All three of my top three favorite video games.
5208163	5213549	The first being The Guardian Legend, the second being Fantasy Zone, and the third being Space Harrier.
5214030	5217113	Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone.
5218115	5226178	So, moving forward, it is a game that was produced by Yu Suzuki, who did a lot of Sega's really good games.
5226258	5230840	And sitting right next to me is a picture of my husband shaking hands with Yu Suzuki.
5231600	5232320	That was pretty cool.
5232840	5236522	So, Space Harrier is a...
5238556	5240897	It's sort of a fake 3D type of game.
5241057	5249481	It is a sprite-based game, and it scrolls towards you from an over-the-shoulder... Well, not kind of like a real over-the-shoulder cam, but it's from behind you.
5250242	5257725	And it has 18 levels, each with a boss, and you have to shoot everything that gets in your way before it shoots you.
5258546	5258706	And...
5259693	5263237	You can run on the ground or you can fly in the air with a jetpack.
5264058	5266400	And everything really does come at you very quickly.
5266460	5267862	It's brightly covered levels.
5269063	5275850	Even for as old as it is, because it came out in 1985, it is a fantastic game.
5275890	5280014	And it's one of the early games to use digitized voices in it.
5282002	5284443	And after you beat a boss, it tells you that you're doing great.
5285183	5286664	It constantly encourages you.
5286684	5288025	I mean, how many games do that?
5288505	5288766	Anyway.
5289066	5300392	By the way, I just want to point out, and I'm sorry, DarkSakura, if you were going to get to this, but since I was a Nintendo kid and not a Sega kid growing up, there was a game on Nintendo called 3D World Runner that was a direct ripoff of this game.
5301173	5302814	I was going to get to it.
5303094	5303834	Sorry.
5304055	5305615	Actually, that game was put out by Square, by the way.
5306896	5314422	and there was also Pony Canyon did a parody called Animal Attack Academy that had a Japanese schoolgirl fighting Australian animals.
5317628	5332532	But yeah, the game is also... That along with Afterburner was one of the first cabinets that had you in a seat and the whole cabinet would move along with your joystick movement.
5333152	5337113	There also is one that doesn't move that sits down and an upright version.
5337713	5339674	So it was really, really cool to play.
5339854	5346196	I haven't played a Space Harrier with the full motion sit-down cabinet in ages.
5347476	5354420	Um, it also, it used the same music for the most part over and over again, but I really love the music.
5355321	5358223	Um, I put up a link also to just the music.
5360664	5365167	I will bring that up so you can hear just the music without all the explosion noise.
5365187	5366148	Let's listen to a little bit of that.
5366168	5368529	Not bad for a game from 85.
5368669	5368990	Yeah.
5377672	5378893	It really is one of my favorites.
5380754	5385898	Now, as far as other releases, we got a... There was a home computer version.
5386358	5387959	There was also the 32X version.
5388019	5392282	And one thing I will say is that the 32X version is a direct rip from the arcade.
5393423	5408819	um in fact you actually have a little trick that you can do with it where it changes from press start to insert coin so that in space uh not space area um well space area of course but uh after burner we're both direct to arcade courts
5410255	5411697	There was a Sega Saturn version.
5411897	5415923	There was a Sharp X86000.
5417865	5421630	It only came out in Japan.
5423773	5425476	All of those are supposed to be the most arcade faithful.
5426136	5431299	Dreamcast, Shenmue, Shenmue 2, Yu Suzuki Gameworks Vol.
5431319	5441906	1, Xbox, Sega Arcade Gallery for Game Boy Advance, and Sega Classics Collection for the PS2.
5442006	5449450	Space Harrier 2 was the Genesis version, which actually also just came out on Virtual Console December 2 years ago.
5450291	5452452	I had to say it just came out.
5452772	5453893	In Europe it came out in October 2008.
5453933	5453973	Um...
5455974	5458375	and over here on November 13,008 for the Master System thing.
5467040	5474483	Also, the arcade version is unlockable in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3.
5475243	5479385	And apparently it has sound issues by everything being just off-pitch.
5479485	5480326	That means I couldn't play.
5480826	5485628	Actually, I know that firsthand because I tried to play Space Harrier and the music sounded wrong to me.
5485728	5492330	But I also have this thing where I hear anything off-pitch really strongly.
5492651	5493631	Perfect pitch for listening.
5493691	5494391	I can't do it.
5494992	5495072	Um...
5496592	5499974	There's also the Space Hero Complete Edition.
5500554	5502415	But you know what?
5503296	5508399	They've done the series an injustice because they didn't release the sequel at home.
5508979	5510520	The sequel being Planet Harriers.
5511320	5512681	Have you played Planet Harriers?
5512801	5513241	I've heard of it.
5513481	5514562	I've heard you talk about it before.
5514642	5515202	Actually, you know what?
5515262	5520005	I think that you've seen me play it because they had it at Great America.
5520689	5522950	I probably have just seen it and don't really remember it.
5523631	5530915	Well, I don't know if they still have it at Great America, but that one was pretty much a fantastic follow-up to a great series.
5531535	5538139	I think this game, and again, sorry if I'm covering something you're about to get to, but I'm pretty sure this game's in that Sonic Genesis Collection that just came out.
5538159	5538640	That's what I just said.
5538680	5539000	Oh, sorry.
5539660	5545264	I said it was Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection, but it suffered from... Oh, I was zoning reading the Twitter, so okay, yeah.
5545404	5545744	It's there.
5546280	5550026	Yeah, the reason why I couldn't play it is because it had pitch problems.
5551248	5554553	All the voice and sound was just off.
5554653	5555013	Gotcha.
5555113	5555895	Enough to drive me nuts.
5558106	5560788	I have the same problem with music on the radio too if they play it too fast.
5561648	5562169	I hear the pitch.
5562489	5563930	But anyway, I digress.
5564831	5567672	But yeah, go out and play Space Harrier.
5567732	5568613	It's a lot of fun.
5569734	5575077	It's one of the few games of that perspective that doesn't make me utterly motion sick either unless I'm playing it in the cabinet.
5575558	5576238	The motion cabinet.
5576258	5578039	Then I will get very sick and throw up all over you.
5579020	5579760	Which is not sterile.
5579981	5580301	Lovely.
5581322	5581822	So that's your game.
5582981	5583501	All right, there it is.
5583521	5586442	Your classic game of the week is Space Harrier.
5586922	5588903	And I think DarkSakura prefers the arcade version.
5589403	5590224	But there are some other places.
5590344	5595126	Actually, if I'm going to play it at home, I'm going to play it on the 32X.
5595666	5598847	Just so I have a reason to play a good game on the giant mushroom of death.
5599167	5600268	All right, then there you go.
5600748	5603209	Space Harrier on the 32X is your classic game of the week.
5603810	5605971	Something non-Sega next week, DarkSakura.
5606051	5615216	I tried to pick something non-Sega, and then it occurred to me that I have done dozens of other games that are among my favorites and have not done Space Harrier.
5615456	5616056	All right, fair enough.
5616076	5616596	But next week.
5616676	5617457	Next week.
5617857	5621359	I got them on a month streak of Sega, so next week we'll have to do something non-Sega.
5621379	5622339	Next week, something non-Sega.
5622459	5622740	All right.
5623280	5624440	Maybe I'll do something on the Atari 2600.
5626142	5627183	That would be cool, actually.
5627223	5628124	I would love to see some Atari 2600 games.
5628144	5631566	Because I'm actually just looking at a game on the Atari 2600 we have sitting around.
5631986	5632246	All right.
5632667	5634728	Anyhow, we'll get into that next week.
5634768	5635689	For now, we're going to take a break.
5635769	5640092	We will be back, though, in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B tonight, Twitter topics.
5640332	5647396	We're also going to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XIII, some more Sony news, including news about the minis and some PlayStation 3 bundles.
5648117	5650659	And we're going to talk about a possible Wii price cut.
5650679	5653140	We'll get to all that and rapid-fire news after this.
5653260	5655622	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5655742	5655964	Thanks for watching!
5661889	5664491	And welcome back, everybody, to this Orange Lounge Radio.
5691952	5693593	The Zero Punctuation Reviews
5718866	5719346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5745914	5771677	that we have so many similarities yet differences but anyway I wasn't meaning to plug them as much although they are a good show I want to plug the Escapist show that's brand new that's coming to all games as well just you know what I say just go to all games on Tuesday just leave it running throughout the day and you're going to hear a lot of great radio that's just what you need to do and then don't forget on Sunday nights come back and listen to Bobby Blackwolf and ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio alright
5772512	5773453	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5793730	5794871	Oops, it's down here a little bit.
5794891	5795892	He wrote like five tweets.
5795952	5796312	Good lord.
5796992	5803457	How about either home, upcoming 1.3 update, and OLR Club, as well as sale on the PSN Video Store?
5804827	5831881	I don't know what they put for sale on the PSN video store it's funny enough because I was actually looking at what kind of offerings were in the video store this week because since my Xbox 360 is broken I can't do Netflix right now it's kind of too bad though because a lot of stuff that is available on the PSN store and not to say the 360 is any different but it's a lot of movies I'm just not interested in it's all like slasher flicks and action packed which I understand who their target audience is but
5832741	5836343	Forgive me if I like a good chick flick or arthouse film every once in a while.
5836363	5838784	I don't really find those on either network, to be honest.
5840465	5842426	But then also the OLR Club.
5842706	5849390	I did plug that at the top of the show, but if you haven't joined the Orange Lounge Radio Club in Sony PlayStation Home, we do have one.
5849850	5850631	So check that out.
5850951	5852072	Search for Orange Lounge Radio.
5852653	5854695	R-M-Y is our little buzzword.
5855115	5859459	And we have some arcade cabinets that I got from the Namco Collection demo that we put there.
5859819	5861901	So you can play like Dig Dug and stuff in our home.
5861941	5864043	And I'm trying to get other furniture as I find it.
5864984	5867386	But I don't really want to pay for a lot of furniture.
5867727	5869628	But I guess there's some free stuff this weekend.
5869828	5873332	So if you go into the stores, you can find some new shirts and things like that.
5873752	5874052	DarkSakura.com
5898056	5901659	Yes, of course, rock bands got new stuff coming out each week.
5901919	5908104	And this week, we've got some new songs, including Tenacious D. Yes, that's right.
5908144	5916711	Tenacious D will be getting a couple individual tracks with Rock Your Socks and Tribute, both available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft points.
5916911	5917852	I'm totally getting Tribute.
5919507	5925332	Also part of the individual songs, The Guess Who with Hand Me Down World and No Time.
5926012	5928114	And then finally, Dinosaur Jr.
5928935	5930696	with Pick Me Up and The Wagon.
5931377	5935300	All those available as individual song downloads of $2 each or 160 Microsoft points.
5937918	5938198	Anvil Pack $5.50
5956527	5960610	Included with that is 666, Metal on Metal, and this is $13.
5961931	5966534	And those are also going to be purchased individually for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.
5967215	5974780	And then finally, coming to the PSP, we've got Evanescence with Bring Me to Life and Spinal Tap with Back from the Dead.
5976441	5976521	Um...
5977654	5978054	Forza 3 Going Gold
6003816	6019610	The Audi R8 5.2, the Ferrari California, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, and the Mini John Cooper Works.
6021672	6022152	Interesting.
6023097	6029842	And finally, a game I'm quite excited about, DJ Hero will be getting its healthy dose of Daft Punk.
6030482	6037447	And they will be contributing 11 unique mixes for the game, as well as being playable characters in the game as well.
6037947	6043070	Included with that would be Daft Punk, Rattle the World vs. Young MC, Bust a Move.
6044111	6049475	DaFunk vs. NASA's Strange Enough featuring Karen, ODB, and Fatlip.
6050580	6054203	Daft Punk, DaFunks, with Queen, another one bites dust.
6055124	6062089	Robot Rock, with Hashim Al Naifish, I guess it's translated to the soul.
6062750	6066032	I'm glad I'm not the only one that horribly butchers pronunciations on this show.
6068307	6070648	Robot Rock vs. Queen, We Will Rock You.
6070948	6072549	I guess that's kind of appropriate.
6073470	6077251	Short Circuit vs. the Boogie Down Productions Jack of Spades.
6078192	6080873	Technologic vs. Gary Newman's Cars.
6081293	6083434	I think there's too many tracks mixed with cars.
6084575	6085255	That's just my guess.
6085675	6089797	And then Television Rules the Nation vs. No Doubt, Hella Good.
6090298	6094720	And I'm very disappointed to see that there's not anything for like...
6096769	6098610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6127585	6128045	On WiiWare though...
6154488	6156590	ColorZ, Contra Rebirth Hit for 1,000 Wii Points
6173546	6178470	Super Nintendo-ish looking newer version of Contra, which funny enough, our caller last week nailed it.
6178711	6182113	Said that they thought Contra was going to be out on Labor Day and they were correct.
6182534	6183254	So good job on that.
6184275	6190821	Hey, Capcom versus Tatsunoko has some new apparently leaked characters.
6191221	6192902	Joe Asukara Joe Asukara Joe Asukara
6218983	6221104	She should have been in it to begin with, yes.
6222385	6224126	He's always the one that wants to push the button.
6224686	6229069	Now see, I don't know dick about anime, so I guess Jamie's excitement has me excited too.
6229149	6229669	Woo!
6231270	6232251	I guess that's good news, right?
6233873	6236495	The Pac-Man world record was broken.
6236676	6243861	Apparently the kill screen was reached in 3 hours, 42 minutes, and 4 seconds.
6244302	6246723	I'm sorry, that was the old record from Chris Ira.
6247324	6251847	Now it has been beat by David Race, I think is his name.
6252568	6256811	3 hours, 41 minutes, and 22 seconds is the new time.
6258192	6258413	Wow.
6259113	6261435	Billy Mitchell once held that spot, but no longer has it.
6261455	6262356	Billy Mitchell's a dick.
6264838	6265278	I don't know.
6265999	6266539	It's a movie.
6267160	6269362	I'm not gonna... He really is.
6269842	6270142	I don't know.
6270243	6270883	I don't know the guy.
6271003	6271664	I'm not gonna bother.
6272224	6275307	Alright, let's finish off the rapid fire news, DarkSakura.
6275787	6278249	Well, let's see what else that we've got going on.
6279370	6284694	There's actually an ESRB rating for Castlevania The Adventure on Wii.
6286616	6288157	Which really wasn't that good of a game.
6289698	6292341	It was, you know, the Game Boy when they came out.
6293381	6298183	Also, and I mentioned this earlier, Braid is cheaper now on Steam.
6299043	6303004	It's $5 now, or $3.39.
6305405	6307205	And it's a pretty cool game.
6307745	6315008	And also, Final Fantasy VII on Wii has more download content.
6315368	6318249	Chapter 9, The Crystals, which is the final part of the story.
6318649	6319069	That's 800 Wii points.
6321633	6322734	I need to finish up that game.
6323294	6324715	Yep, I thought you'd be interested in that one.
6324915	6328897	Yeah, I kind of stopped playing, but it was a really good Wii download game.
6328917	6349209	A little other news in WiiWare is that for 800 Wii points, Spaceball Revolution, not to be confused with Spaceballs, then 2-in-1 Solitaire, which is Spider and Klondike, and then Solomon's Key and Rygar for 500 and 600 Wii points, respectively.
6350779	6353642	Alright, let's get back into some long discussion topics tonight, Loki.
6354182	6367215	Yes, the music game sales are down, but even though they are down 46%, it is still the third best-selling genre among video games.
6367575	6373741	And of course, this is coming from the NPD group that, you know, they do all the sales tracking and whatnot, and...
6374722	6386869	I guess year-to-date sales have declined quite a bit, but when you look at it, I mean, they're pretty much calculating stuff from, you know, up until, you know, up to Guitar Hero 5 and the Beatles Rock Band.
6386909	6388890	I mean, I think a lot of people were anticipating those two games.
6388910	6399797	I was going to say, isn't this, these, because I've seen this story spread like wildfire through blogs this week, and I'm like, this is completely misleading, in a way, because the big music games for the year haven't even come out yet, or just came out.
6399817	6401978	Well, yeah, I mean, they're a little bit, I mean...
6402698	6406601	You obviously can't have that data right away.
6406661	6411764	They usually release the previous month's data halfway through the next month.
6412164	6415467	I think that it's even selling half of what it used to is pretty damn impressive.
6415507	6419189	When you consider a year ago we had Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2.
6419689	6420710	Those are both huge titles.
6420770	6422972	The DS games were just coming out too.
6423272	6423672	Exactly.
6423892	6424853	Those are all huge stuff.
6425934	6427335	I'm not surprised.
6428115	6435543	I mean, since I don't really think that Smash Hits and Metallica sold... I mean, they sold alright, but not like, you know, a Guitar Hero 5 or a World 4 or something.
6435563	6439247	They're just not gonna sell the way a Guitar Hero 4 or a Rock Band 2 does.
6439448	6442371	Exactly, and the trackpacks, I mean, that doesn't really count, so...
6444219	6445019	It's a little misleading.
6445900	6448821	It'd be more interesting to see what happens after the holiday.
6448881	6449421	At the end of the year.
6449601	6452222	I would like to see an end of the year wrap up as compared to last year.
6452363	6453623	You think it'll be kind of in the same?
6454003	6455944	I think you'll still see a little decline.
6456484	6460566	I don't think the Beatles rock band is going to sell quite the way Rock Band 2 did.
6460606	6461106	Don't get me wrong.
6461126	6462387	I think it'll still sell pretty big.
6463167	6470670	And I think Guitar Hero 5 will probably be on par with Guitar Hero World Tour, which, if I'm not mistaken, didn't Guitar Hero beat Rock Band last year in terms of sales?
6472071	6472331	Yes.
6472682	6475385	Guitar Hero still sells better because they have more releases.
6475446	6477548	I would say they have better peripherals too.
6490532	6493473	I wouldn't call their drum set better than the Rock Band.
6516280	6528296	you can't compare the two because one has way more releases than the other because they refuse to embrace download content on a regular basis I mean they do have download content on a regular basis but nowhere near what Rock Band has
6530339	6531640	Final Fantasy XIII
6554474	6557635	But, I will say this, don't forget the PlayStation 3 is region free.
6557915	6560295	This game is not coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
6560335	6562316	That was not something they said as part of the announcement.
6562356	6564176	So it is only PS3 in Japan.
6564997	6567237	And I bet you, you're going to have a lot of folks that import this.
6567577	6571238	Although, it's going to be very Japanese heavy still.
6571258	6571858	That's the problem.
6572058	6572939	I don't think I will though.
6573479	6574659	I mean, I've done that in the past.
6574679	6578380	I've played Final Fantasy games in Japanese and never had a problem.
6579223	6581887	Well, look, I don't know Japanese like you guys do.
6582008	6583971	I wouldn't get nothing from this.
6584071	6587778	I print out a nice little fan translation of everything and that works.
6587938	6590783	That's how I played through Final Fantasy VIII when I originally imported that.
6591906	6594227	It would be cool if they had English subtitles, but they won't.
6594247	6595348	They don't want to dip into the U.S.
6595368	6595688	sales.
6595888	6596949	Naturally, it's not going to be there.
6597289	6603793	However, though, that doesn't happen until the international versions that they have English subtitles.
6604134	6610337	My copy of Final Fantasy X-2, my Japanese one, I have the international version.
6611358	6613680	It has subtitles.
6614560	6620444	No, but I haven't heard of any type of extras that we're going to get in Final Fantasy XIII here in the U.S.
6620504	6622825	with the exception of the fact that we have a 360 version.
6623125	6625347	So do you think there will even be an international version this time?
6627008	6627268	Maybe.
6627968	6630030	Or maybe, I guess they could always do like a remixed version.
6630070	6638255	Like, you know how like Final Fantasy X, I don't think there were a whole lot of differences there either, but like the international version had the different, what was the name of the board where you leveled?
6638575	6643038	You know, you filled in the spots on the board, that was how you leveled your characters, remember that?
6643058	6643538	Yeah.
6643973	6644594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6665748	6683597	Actdeft points out in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com the international version would probably be on the 360 I don't think it will in Japan I see where your logic is going and that's a logical thought but again you have to remember the 360 has not penetrated the Japanese marketplace the way it has here
6684537	6685498	Sony is still on top.
6685518	6687959	Well, Nintendo is still on top in Japan, if I'm not mistaking.
6688280	6689861	But Sony has a clear second place.
6690581	6692642	And I think Microsoft's gained some ground.
6692903	6695344	They're not a laughing stock in Japan at this point.
6695705	6700087	But they're even further back than where Sony is here.
6700468	6705551	I mean, at least Sony has been gaining a lot of ground here in this generation.
6706592	6708193	But I think in Japan, it's a whole different story.
6709053	6709334	Yeah.
6710274	6712776	And GameGuru says the 360 version is your extra.
6712816	6720362	Keep in mind, 360s aren't region-free, so if you live in Japan and for whatever reason have a 360, you're out of luck unless you can figure out a way to mod or whatever.
6721723	6725506	Also, I wanted to kind of point out one thing this had me thinking about was Final Fantasy XIV.
6726747	6729549	When do you think we're going to start seeing more of Final Fantasy XIV?
6729589	6730669	Do you think it's going to come out?
6730909	6736553	Well, I don't know if the game itself will come out next year, but do you think we're going to see a lot more information start to spill out really quick?
6736873	6742316	Like, it seems to me like we're going to have our shortest window between Final Fantasy games with this and XIV.
6743077	6745478	Being that we already know there's a playable alpha out there.
6745498	6748940	I mean, that's that they demoed at a show.
6749580	6752262	I'm wondering if XIV's not going to show up at Tokyo Game Show as well.
6752742	6753122	It might.
6753383	6755364	I mean, they may have a little bit there, but I don't, you know.
6756323	6757063	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6785984	6786244	DarkSakura
6799398	6800639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6818133	6837828	and a retail sourced to a quote Eurogamer that said that there was supposed to be three different bundles with different games as in Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, Gran Turismo 5 and Assassin's Creed 2 and they were supposed to sell for £299 which over here would be £494.
6838068	6843492	And there's of course no statement made to the rumour.
6846357	6846737	I don't know.
6846777	6849919	Are all these different bundles necessary?
6850359	6850899	I guess so.
6851079	6852980	I guess bundles help drive sales.
6853260	6855821	There's a ton of different PSP bundles here in the States.
6856181	6861923	There's the Hannah Montana OMG Girls one and the Rock Band one.
6861983	6864944	No, I think that's seriously what it's called.
6864964	6867205	Like OMG Girls Play 2 or something like that.
6868066	6873748	Kind of their way of getting girls to get Sony PSPs because right now they all have DSs.
6877070	6888669	um that's funny I don't know if we'll probably see something over here too as far as US bundles I'm guessing because in time for the holidays certainly definitely um
6889528	6897634	So to kind of go back to something we were talking a little bit about, or complaining about I guess in Part A, was the PSP Go.
6897714	6909583	And one of the things that they were kind of showing off during E3, well actually not so much E3, but during Gamescom was the PSP Minis.
6910403	6910544	And
6911164	6920033	They said that there is a possibility, though, we will see collections of these minis available on a single UMD at a later stage, later on.
6920574	6924798	So where maybe a publisher or whatever can put out a bunch of these little games.
6924858	6932726	I guess like you see right now on the Xbox 360 every now and then you'll see an Xbox Live
6933578	6934179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6951730	6959237	But at the same time, and to kind of go back to what we were saying before, what exactly does PSP Go have going for other than it's more expensive and slightly smaller?
6960137	6960778	I mean, nothing.
6960798	6962119	It's new.
6963140	6963640	Oh, goody.
6964101	6969906	So, you know, if Nintendo came out with the Wii Gold or something like that, it's a gold-colored Wii, but it's $500.
6970306	6972388	Does that mean I have to go buy it?
6972728	6974470	I mean, that's stupid, but...
6976758	6985430	Oh well, I mean, to me, seeing that they're going to re-release these on UMD later on makes me feel that they're not really confident in the PSP Go.
6988074	6992180	And that they will need to supplement their sales by other means.
6993385	6996666	I thought it was interesting that they were talking about putting these on the PS3 as well.
6996686	6997426	I mean, it makes sense.
6997726	7002708	But then again, you know, we kind of talk about this, oh, you know, they're going to do all this with the minis, but we don't really know what they're going to be yet.
7002748	7005488	We haven't seen what the minis are, right?
7005508	7008409	Like, I know that little picture you have there looks like a little bejeweled thing.
7008449	7010210	Well, they have, like, Tetris and stuff.
7010270	7011550	Do they already have some minis out there?
7012370	7013591	Tetris is supposed to be one of the minis.
7014691	7022781	I heard, by the way, that there was somebody was, I was trying to get them to tweet us about it because I didn't have a story on it, but I heard about it, that there's like a new Tetris in development right now.
7022861	7024563	Not the Nintendo one, but like a new Tetris.
7024683	7026045	There's one for the DS, I think.
7026285	7026766	Maybe the Wii.
7026946	7029429	No, there's a different one even outside of that, but yeah.
7031932	7034635	Is it now going to have like more blocks?
7036283	7037704	Tetris, now with more blocks.
7037724	7039905	Tetromino is made out of five cubes instead.
7040106	7043528	No, I imagine it's probably more competitive in internet things.
7043928	7047350	I'm sure there's some people out there that are like, how many times can you do Tetris?
7047671	7048271	A million.
7048331	7049412	Realistically, yes, you can.
7053014	7054154	Look at Tetris DS.
7054274	7056335	That was an awesome version of Tetris.
7056695	7063997	You know, one series they've managed to re-release several times and actually do a pretty good job with every time is Tetris.
7064337	7076121	Like, if you look at the original PC game, then you look at the NES Tetris, even Tenjin Tetris versus Nintendo Tetris, and then Game Boy Tetris with its whole link play was revolutionary.
7076481	7078221	And then Nintendo DS is awesome.
7078241	7080122	I mean, Tetris is kind of...
7081082	7084423	actually one game that they've done right many, many times.
7085003	7093946	Not to say it's been perfect, because there was a Tetris on the PlayStation by Jellico, I think it was, Tetris Plus, that was awful.
7094486	7096146	It was an awful, awful game.
7096766	7097667	So it's just kind of interesting.
7097687	7098487	Agreed.
7098547	7103208	It's kind of interesting that you can take a game that's essentially the same and do it so many different ways.
7103528	7107949	And sometimes it's very, very good, like Tetris DS, and sometimes it's very, very sad, like Tetris PlayStation.
7108410	7109690	So, anyhow.
7112218	7112798	Let me move on.
7112818	7115159	I didn't mean to get into a different topic, but I did.
7115659	7127761	I want to talk about Silent Hill Homecoming, which was the fifth game in the series, even though it didn't carry the number five on it, and was somewhat razzed here in the States because it was by an American developer and so forth.
7128281	7131122	Well, the game was set to make its way to Japan, but guess what?
7131502	7133042	The website was updated this week.
7133342	7136103	The Japanese Silent Hill Homecoming website was updated to say...
7136863	7138385	The game has been cancelled.
7139165	7141428	Silent Hill Homecoming will not be out in Japan.
7141928	7143670	No reason was given for the decision.
7144010	7148875	It just said on the website, simply, quote, Please look forward to future titles in the series.
7150357	7157764	Kind of interesting that this game was developed in the West, took some shit for that, and now the Japanese aren't even going to release it at all.
7158795	7159695	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7181335	7186880	Given the reviews that it got here, though, that's really not very surprising.
7187140	7195808	The biggest complaint about it was that it didn't have the same kind of scare factor that appealed to Japanese players.
7195908	7198390	It wasn't the same type of scary game.
7199631	7200752	I don't think the game was terrible.
7200792	7201473	It was different.
7201573	7202333	I also like Silent Hill 4.
7202373	7208819	I didn't say it was bad, but I'm saying that it wasn't what was up to snuff for that series.
7210242	7210963	It's just interesting.
7212263	7214304	I wonder if that's because of sales figures here.
7214384	7216365	I wonder if that game just didn't sell well here.
7216465	7219066	I don't know, Loki, from your inside perspective, I don't know if you would know this.
7219386	7220446	It didn't sell that well here.
7220926	7222547	It sold well in the beginning, but that's it.
7222687	7225148	It's not something that's constantly being reordered or anything.
7225368	7226309	That's too bad.
7228789	7240831	Alright, let's get into tonight's mailbag, a part of the show where you can interact with us by sending us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura is going to dive in headfirst into the mailbag and find some emails to read for us.
7242228	7242929	I am.
7243049	7243709	You are.
7244109	7244730	You is.
7245070	7245510	I is.
7245670	7246751	Okay.
7247171	7249213	Greetings, Rob, Loki, DarkSakura.
7249413	7250133	Here's the dilemma.
7250193	7261161	I'm a hardcore PC gamer and want a PS3, but can't justify buying one because any of the games I like for it I can buy for the PC and play with better graphics cheaper and less hassle.
7261541	7264403	But I like the idea of having one if only for Gran Turismo and Blu-ray.
7264723	7271067	To get a system, I would have to buy an HDTV, which is expensive, and I don't know whether I should wait for the 3D TVs.
7273309	7292684	so many questions in a little time are there any good PS3 exclusives that would justify me buying this system and should I wait for 3D TVs also, how do I vote for your show without going through iTunes, I hate Apple the turtle wait, just wait and you can get a Blu-ray player for your PC so wait, they're getting cheaper
7295413	7305724	The one thing that I kind of have to say on this though is that, you know, one thing to consider and has always kind of been a drawback of PC gaming is that you have to constantly upgrade your PC.
7306325	7313773	And I realize there's PC gaming fans that are going to hate me for kind of calling that out a little bit because there's a lot of people that do spend the kind of money to keep on tip-top shape.
7314213	7316756	But the nice thing about console games is that...
7317617	7320539	The metrics are already established on console games.
7320739	7326882	And that, you know, the game is always going to play the way it was meant to be played on a certain console.
7326902	7331264	Whereas on the PC, sometimes you have to deal with frame rate issues and so forth if your PC is not up to par.
7331624	7335686	But it sounds like you are an established PC gamer and you have a lot of games on PC.
7335726	7337287	You probably have a top of the line computer.
7337887	7338968	You may have hit the nail on the head.
7339408	7342010	If every game you want to play is coming out on PC...
7343151	7343651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7368157	7371181	The only other thing I do want to say though, Sony exclusives, keep that in mind.
7371441	7375185	There are certain games that will not come out on the PC, period.
7375385	7378008	Games like LittleBigPlanet, which are pretty awesome, I gotta say.
7378449	7381132	MAG, the Mod Nation Racers.
7381232	7386398	These games are not going to ever come out on PC because they're made by Sony and they want you to have a PlayStation to play it on.
7387379	7404455	so if those games are worth it to you then you're going to have to take the plunge but if the types of games you're getting are Batman Arkham Asylum Call of Duty and the games that do come out on PC then you might be right you don't need a Playstation 3 so don't spend money on one um
7405894	7412036	I personally just love the controls and sitting on my couch and all that, you know, but that's, I realize it's not for everybody.
7412136	7413576	That's, that's why we have choices.
7414056	7419118	As far as the other part of your question about iTunes and you want to leave a review that is not on an Apple place, that's fine.
7419478	7421979	We always ask, look, just tell a friend about the show.
7421999	7423299	You don't even have to leave a review.
7423799	7425640	I think there are other places that take them.
7425680	7427220	I don't know of any other big, big site.
7427300	7431001	Like I know of one called Podcast Alley that has some reviews like podcastalley.com.
7431021	7432922	You can always use that or dig.com.
7433522	7434323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7449722	7452863	I'm going to ban you so that you can never download this show and listen to it again.
7453323	7459944	It's not that I can't take criticism of the show, but this person is probably jacking off right now to listening to me talk about them on the air.
7460024	7465965	This is why you would write a negative review of a show over and over again that says nothing constructive about the show.
7466385	7469206	So if this is you, I want you to know you're banned from this program.
7469246	7474327	We do this for free out of our spare time because we like to do it.
7474807	7475668	Thank you for watching!
7490253	7491274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7508382	7530874	when we need to be critical and especially tonight we've barely had any Microsoft news and maybe a little bit of Sony news so it's kind of unfortunate because that person clearly based their review off one episode of the show I'm not mad at that person I just wish they would have tried a little more before writing that but I'm not going to say oh I'm going to ban you because you don't like the show that's ridiculous but if you're trolling that's the difference that other guy needs to go get fucked
7531823	7534304	and I wish... More people need to report that to Apple too.
7534344	7534925	That's what I did.
7534985	7538226	So hopefully... I hate that you can't review reviewers.
7538707	7539467	You kind of can.
7539787	7541288	You can put, was this review helpful?
7541328	7542449	And I just click no all the time.
7542729	7549593	But the problem is when he rewrites a new review complaining about something in the show this week that didn't even happen, then...
7550788	7551709	It just gets rewritten.
7552209	7553750	So, there you go.
7555431	7557292	And I'm looking at chat.org.com.
7558313	7560535	Actdeft says, SkyRant and FU is incoming.
7560615	7561455	No, not yet.
7562296	7562696	Not yet.
7563436	7568120	Ssh100Matt says, The Troll is a former All Games listener that one-stars every show, including Bobby's.
7568400	7570001	That guy needs to go get fucked.
7570601	7580488	And like I said, he's probably jacking off right now because I'm talking about him on the air and he got the attention he looked for, so I'm going to stop talking about him and just hope that a meteor falls on his head.
7581709	7582509	Next email, please.
7583470	7583911	Okay.
7586813	7588074	Next email.
7590316	7595319	Okay, I guess this was sent out to multiple people, but I'm going to use the part that's addressed to us.
7596600	7597621	I know what you're thinking.
7597721	7601504	DS Lover, the person who despises 360, wants one.
7602365	7603146	I can't read this.
7605367	7609450	Why is the grammar... Okay, almost no...
7610336	7611997	I'll go read it if you need somebody.
7612378	7613258	I have bad grammar.
7613298	7613819	I can understand it.
7613839	7614820	No, Rob, it's not just that.
7615100	7618542	They hardly use any punctuation, so it's hard for me to get phrasing on this.
7618863	7619523	All right, just go slow.
7622786	7623526	Gosh.
7625242	7630523	Okay, well, if you were wondering why, here's the things that pushed me over the edge.
7630983	7634624	During my Boy Scout, oh, that's it, you're a Boy Scout, you know, funded by the Mormons.
7635284	7645386	During a Boy Scout Troops holiday party where we stay up all night playing games, I saw one of my friends playing Guitar Hero 2, and we played over 13 songs, then we played Thunder Horse.
7645786	7649327	Okay, you use a hyphen in a song that doesn't even have a hyphen in the name.
7649927	7658152	Okay, then at the end of the song, I saw an achievement unlocked, and then I saw another one of my friends playing Burnout Revenge after he left his 360 in my hands.
7658192	7674361	I plugged in my MP3 player to the 360 and started using my own music like Dragon Force and Anthrax while doing takedowns and crash events made my eyes open, and especially when I started playing with my friend online communication, flawless, comma, finally, compared to the PS... It doesn't even...
7675462	7676063	Need a comma.
7676143	7676323	Okay.
7676803	7679106	Compared to the PS3, it can suck my balls, Sony.
7679146	7680547	I ain't buying your stupid PS3.
7680667	7681128	Period.
7682089	7689135	I need some recommendations on games and accessories to buy with my system, and I'm needing one on should I buy it used or new.
7689175	7690537	I've been waiting for a price drop on 360.
7691318	7691718	Comma.
7691898	7692619	Doesn't need to be there.
7693059	7697023	I'm wondering which W-I-T-C-H, by the way, configuration I should start off with.
7697283	7698745	Sincerely, DSLoverPS.
7698885	7699806	Keep the shows rocking.
7701872	7702573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7722249	7724631	I don't know what type of games to recommend when I don't know what type of games you like.
7724891	7726312	Did he say what type of games he likes to play?
7726372	7726813	Guitar Hero 2?
7726853	7727913	I guess.
7727933	7728234	I don't know.
7728274	7729134	Get Rock Band Beatles?
7729214	7729655	Guitar Hero 3?
7730315	7733197	What game has takedowns in it?
7734018	7734378	Madden?
7734938	7735499	Oh, Burnout!
7735579	7738201	He said Burnout Paradise.
7738641	7742644	Okay, Burnout Paradise and Split Seconds is going to be very cool when that comes out.
7742744	7743405	Need for Speed?
7743845	7744145	Fuel?
7744265	7747167	I liked Fuel, even though a lot of people gave it kind of mediocre reviews.
7747848	7747908	Um...
7749110	7749830	Yeah, I don't know.
7749930	7754211	But when you say... See, when you say what PlayStation 3 game should I get, I go LittleBigPlanet.
7754311	7755491	I think that game's amazing.
7755831	7758592	And I think everybody should... This person asked about Xbox 360.
7759192	7759852	I thought they said PS3.
7759872	7761032	That was the previous one.
7761352	7761452	Oh.
7761792	7763332	They want Xbox 360 games they should have?
7763392	7767013	No, they want... They're thinking about getting an Xbox 360.
7767593	7768813	I thought they said PS3 at the end.
7768953	7773394	I want to know... I want to know which version of the Xbox 360 to get.
7774574	7778155	It was the last one that asked about what PS3 games were exclusive and what to buy.
7780424	7782306	You need to find one that matches what needs.
7782326	7785368	Do you have an HDTV that can benefit from HDMI?
7785808	7791173	Do you have, you know, I don't think you need all the frills, but I think you do need a hard drive.
7791393	7792874	So I wouldn't get the one that doesn't come with a hard drive.
7792914	7795456	I think that you need to stop thinking about an Xbox 360.
7795496	7798318	You need to sell your DS and you need to freaking hire a tutor.
7801120	7801461	Wow.
7802422	7805344	If you would like DarkSakura to criticize your emails, please send us an email.
7805384	7807365	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7808223	7810045	Deathwishing Beatles Rock Band Beatles
7824296	7825056	Or pay for the new albums.
7825076	7826597	My favorite song by them is Here Comes the Sun.
7843351	7843951	And you know what?
7844031	7854274	I think that's the part that makes Harmonix and the surviving Beatles and relatives of the deceased ones very happy is that it's like a whole new generation discovering the Beatles.
7854334	7857535	And I think what they would say to your email is, mission accomplished.
7858316	7859416	I think that's a very good thing.
7859935	7864739	So congrats to you discovering your love for Beatles music.
7865040	7868222	I always kind of respect the Beatles.
7868683	7875129	I don't love them or foam in the mouth about them or even really buy a lot of their albums, but I respect them.
7875209	7877991	I really understand what they did for music and why they were so popular.
7878552	7881995	But I'm thinking that maybe playing this game will kind of open up the catalog.
7882836	7885258	I also like the movie Across the Universe somewhat.
7885858	7887038	Dude, I love that movie.
7887058	7890680	I didn't like the movie, but I liked the parts of the movie.
7891060	7891780	It had nice parts.
7891800	7893080	So you give it the Xanity rating?
7893360	7893740	I do.
7894301	7895521	That's a perfect comparison.
7895561	7898342	It has nice parts, but the whole it adds up to is WTF.
7898662	7900923	Well, therefore the Xanity rating.
7901083	7902203	I actually love the whole movie.
7904624	7906164	I was going to say something else too.
7906224	7908665	If you had to say you had a favorite song by them, Rob, what would it be?
7910447	7911408	William Shatner version?
7911688	7911788	No.
7911949	7913350	And I like Strawberry Fields Forever.
7930127	7933828	And I've been to Strawberry Fields and it's beautiful in New York City where the Imagine Memorial is.
7934148	7936248	So I think Strawberry Fields forever.
7936388	7940129	And it does make me think of that scene in Across the Universe, which I think is one of the better scenes in the movie.
7940449	7942090	That seriously is my favorite scene in the movie.
7942270	7944570	So I would say that's definitely one of my top songs.
7945370	7947491	I met the guy that was in the movie.
7947751	7948031	Oh, really?
7948211	7948971	Yeah, I got his autograph.
7949091	7949511	How random.
7949911	7950111	I know.
7950251	7950611	There you go.
7950671	7951932	Well, do you have a favorite song?
7952412	7952792	In what?
7952812	7953492	Across the Universe?
7953612	7954112	No, Beatles.
7954292	7955052	Beatles song in general.
7956012	7956132	No.
7957073	7958853	Strawberry Fields isn't in the rock band, is it?
7960866	7961067	No.
7961747	7962307	It should be.
7964309	7974835	I did want to say, though, probably my favorite, favorite song of the Beatles as a, not just the band itself, but all the members, was Imagine by John Lennon.
7975175	7981078	I mean, that is a song that will live on forever, and it rightfully should.
7981199	7986522	I mean, I think that song, to me, even transcends anything the Beatles ever did.
7987574	7987974	DarkSakura.com
8023300	8026003	DarkTetsuya in chat says, less Sims, more show, please.
8027445	8030509	I can do both at the same time, and you are totally not one to talk, okay?
8030969	8031450	Addict.
8031770	8034994	That's right, I can text message and drive at the same time, so she can play Sims.
8035134	8035414	Rob.
8037068	8038129	You saw the video, didn't you?
8038149	8038870	Yes, I saw the video.
8038890	8040091	That was fantastic.
8040391	8041652	It was stupid.
8041812	8042453	It was great.
8042533	8045235	It was the most over-the-top thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
8045275	8046316	I know, but it was gorgeous.
8046496	8047517	It was the gore.
8047637	8052761	And I've been to the Rocky Horror Picture Show 300 times, and that text messaging crash video was the most over-the-top thing.
8052781	8053582	Yay, my Sim is drowning!
8053602	8054282	Alright, shut up.
8054883	8056444	Why'd you build a wall around the pool?
8056524	8057365	So that he couldn't get out.
8058344	8059744	You're killing your dick, Sim.
8059844	8060184	Hold on.
8060585	8066026	So Sims and The Sims 3 have learned that they can pull themselves out of the pool without the ladder?
8066186	8066406	Yeah.
8066806	8067186	Damn it!
8068086	8069506	They're always getting smarter.
8069526	8070947	She built walls around the pool.
8071667	8072487	As you should.
8073147	8080669	Well, you can't put a fence around him, but what I could do is the move objects on, and then I put the little sign, neighborhood sign.
8080689	8082269	Can you douse him with gasoline?
8082609	8082729	No.
8082749	8084389	Alright, can we get to the FUs of the week?
8084409	8084929	DarkSakura.
8085069	8085710	I guess.
8087450	8087530	Um...
8089822	8093763	Um, F you to, um, going back to work.
8094663	8095003	Loki!
8097224	8101905	Um, huh, I had something, and I don't remember what it was.
8101965	8108547	I guess F you to having a bunch of new locks for my arcade cabinet, but not any of the keys.
8110848	8111168	That's it.
8112408	8114329	I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.
8114409	8118811	I think I've actually been in somewhat of a good mood, so I don't know.
8119812	8123194	FU to the fact that I'm not already at Disneyland, because that's where I'm going to be in a few days.
8123274	8126255	I'm so freaking excited I need to be there.
8127836	8130297	Oh, did Death show up to get your little... Yep.
8131558	8132699	And Death can't get to the person?
8133099	8134359	Oh yeah, Death can do anything.
8134600	8135220	Alright, anyhow.
8135300	8135880	He's dead!
8136320	8138001	See how Sims is derailing the show?
8138141	8141083	Now you need to drown Death in a pool too, because that'd be ironic.
8143484	8144605	Back to games, Loki
8169256	8178264	Bethesda has the rights to Fallout right now, and Interplay infringed on its trademark.
8182087	8187152	I'm surprised if we did see a Fallout MMO that it wouldn't be coming from Bethesda.
8187372	8189414	I would think that would be right up their alley.
8192190	8198795	I think Bethesda's got to be working on some MMO right now, but it's probably in the Elder Scrolls universe, not Fallout.
8199135	8199976	But who knows?
8200036	8200776	Anything's possible.
8200796	8202017	I mean, both those games are huge.
8202258	8203138	How about combining them?
8205220	8207601	Nuclear Holocaust in the medieval times?
8207662	8213186	A nuclear holocaust hits the world of... What's the name of the world that Elder Scrolls is set in?
8213266	8213806	I can't remember.
8214146	8215167	But that's what we need.
8215187	8217949	We need a crossover game of the two, and it's an MMO.
8218430	8218810	There you go.
8220535	8226162	or that they've turned nomadic and they're back now to medieval technology.
8227268	8228809	I still haven't played Fallout 3.
8229570	8231892	It's oblivion with guns.
8231932	8235235	I don't know how I wouldn't like this game, but I just somehow haven't played it.
8235335	8236536	I'm too addicted to Warcraft.
8236556	8238657	I have Fallout 3 and I've still not played it.
8238958	8241039	I also have Left 4 Dead and still have not played it.
8241059	8243982	Can I borrow your Fallout 3 if you're not going to play it?
8244022	8244962	Fallout 3 is pretty cool.
8245283	8245543	Is it?
8245823	8251408	Well, Becky's husband was playing quite a bit of it and it just looks really cool.
8251428	8251868	I liked it.
8252108	8253728	No, I've never heard anything but good things about it.
8253768	8255749	And even when I've watched it, it looks like a lot of fun.
8255889	8261410	And, you know, just remember, guys, I don't have time to play every game, especially when you're addicted to an MMO.
8261570	8262711	Actually, no, I take that back.
8262771	8264111	I think I did sell it already.
8264591	8264711	Oh.
8265371	8268032	Because I don't have a lot of games anymore.
8269553	8271453	Wow, you unloaded all your games?
8271533	8271733	Why?
8272573	8273293	Different reasons.
8274914	8277395	All right, well, do you think Bethesda has any ground to stand on with this?
8277475	8279055	I mean, do you think they'll win, Loki?
8279420	8281041	Yeah, if they have the rights for it right now.
8281101	8288526	I mean, I know Interplay, I think, was the one that actually came out with the original Fallout, but I don't know.
8288566	8297492	They're saying that this has caused immediate, substantial, and irreparable harm, I guess.
8299193	8299513	I don't know.
8300634	8302755	It probably wasn't going to end up working out for them anyways.
8304986	8311048	Okay, well, I want to move on to one more story before we get to your phone calls tonight, and it has to do with the Nintendo Wii.
8311529	8316271	Apparently, Nintendo is going to price drop the Wii.
8317091	8322573	Rumor is that the Wii is going to get its price drop the first week of October, which makes sense, because the machine still costs $250.
8322773	8325854	And, you know, isn't the Xbox 360 now $199?
8326335	8326655	Yep.
8327255	8333077	So, you know, and it has been for a while, so I think the Wii is probably going to have to move to a price drop.
8333097	8334778	Their sales have been kind of slowing down, too.
8334838	8337760	Well, plus it's time to update the pack, too.
8338080	8339701	You know, I think it's inevitable.
8339801	8345264	They're going to put Wii Motion Plus in it and Wii Sports Resort, I think, is what you're going to find in the new pack.
8345505	8345685	No?
8345965	8346965	No, it's going to stay the same.
8347846	8348226	Really?
8348406	8348907	I think it is.
8350167	8351648	You don't think they'll bundle in an extra game?
8352189	8354490	No, because you can't get Wii Sports by itself.
8356671	8359073	What about a Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort bundle?
8359113	8360654	What about it comes with Wii Sports?
8361474	8363716	No, because that would impact their sales of Wii Sports Resort.
8364292	8364572	Really?
8364893	8365033	Yeah.
8365433	8365834	Alright.
8366875	8367335	Well, we'll see.
8367936	8373742	By the way, the rumor comes from an early version of a Walmart ad, but apparently it is coming soon.
8373902	8375924	I don't see the exact price, though.
8375964	8378647	It's just apparently the ad says that it's coming.
8379468	8381631	So we don't know exactly what the new price is.
8382271	8382552	But...
8383901	8410946	now Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show but they will be participating in a thing called Kyoto Cross Media Experience 2009 but that's at the end of September September 26th to October 4th so if they're going to announce a price drop that's when it's kind of expected to happen because Nintendo never does Tokyo Game Show I don't know what, I don't remember the reason behind it but they just don't they kind of do their own media thing in Japan so very interesting
8412605	8417106	I wonder if there will be a fitness thing, like maybe the original Wii Fit or something.
8417146	8417486	I don't know.
8417526	8419187	But again, Loki seems to think it won't cut in.
8419207	8422548	Because then you'd have to throw in the Wii Fit balance board.
8422988	8425368	I mean, I could see maybe some holiday bundles.
8426029	8432790	If they're going to do anything, what they're going to do is some crappy holiday bundle later on that it's going to have new Super Mario Bros.
8432830	8434611	Wii bundled in it, and maybe that's it.
8435171	8435391	But...
8436238	8437638	I kind of wish, I was just thinking the other day
8460919	8461419	Super Mario Bros.
8461639	8462280	4 Super Mario Bros. 4
8485728	8489389	That kind of does away with a lot of the changes to the Mario universe over time.
8489409	8490890	That might be too difficult for Grand Moff.
8491570	8491890	Maybe.
8492550	8499513	Maybe I just live in this weird fanboy bubble, or I just miss the old school days of Nintendo, but it'd be kind of cool.
8501161	8504362	Alright, I guess it's time for us to open up the Skype line.
8504402	8505422	We're ready to take some calls.
8505442	8509063	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8509463	8515345	Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like to give a comment on any topic that you've heard about tonight and we'll take some calls.
8516285	8516985	See what's on your mind.
8517825	8520646	I'll ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio because we have a delay.
8520666	8522787	Oh, no, we're getting our first call.
8522807	8523687	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8523707	8524007	Who's this?
8524773	8525373	X-Link, Half Minute Hero
8542779	8543400	Final Fantasy 1, Dragon War 1
8556192	8559255	from the time you start to get to the boss, to beat the boss.
8559355	8564419	But in order to do this, you like really, it plays like basically you're playing the game and fast forward.
8564679	8565660	I heard about this.
8565760	8566361	Isn't this the one?
8566381	8567762	Doesn't it switch genres too?
8567802	8568583	Like every 30 seconds?
8569043	8571445	I remember there's a demo for that out now.
8571986	8572246	Yes.
8572506	8573427	Is that on PSP?
8573667	8574268	It's coming soon.
8575766	8580508	Yeah, it's coming on, it's supposedly October 20th is the release date for it.
8581128	8583268	Is that on PSP or PS3?
8584189	8584609	PSP.
8585169	8586169	Oh, I want to check that out.
8586570	8594392	I remember when we reported on that game and I was like, oh, it's kind of like WarioWare, but like, it sounds even cooler than, what was the WarioWare clone we got on PSP?
8594692	8595372	WTF, right?
8595773	8597073	Even though WTF was kind of funny.
8597753	8598653	This sounds even cooler.
8598733	8600114	Like, I definitely want to check this out.
8600174	8603055	So, did it feel like WarioWare to you, Xlink?
8603115	8603395	Was it...
8603615	8613532	Kind of, yeah, but it had more of a, when I played it, it had more of the role-playing type deal, so it's more like playing Final Fantasy 1 on fast-forward, like I said before, so it was really good, though.
8615711	8616571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8636616	8639399	Demo was cool enough for you to go pre-order the game?
8655498	8655918	Oh, definitely.
8655958	8657540	I would definitely pre-order it.
8658841	8660182	A big role-playing type thing.
8660242	8667188	It had other elements I saw from the trailer, which really piqued my interest, like shootings and stuff like that, and summons.
8669031	8670052	A successful demo.
8670072	8674894	Thank you for calling me to tell me about it because I'm going to go put that in my queue to download my PSP.
8675155	8676175	No, no problem.
8676275	8688542	Now that I've learned how to get my PS3 and PSP to work together and I got a better memory card for my PSP, I'm all about checking out all the latest demos and so forth because I know I've been critical of the PSP as a gaming device, but there are some gems out there.
8688562	8689583	There are some real gems out there.
8689803	8693365	Definitely, and I'm looking forward to 2% which comes out in about two weeks too.
8693465	8695326	I already had that pre-ordered and paid for.
8696146	8696467	Awesome.
8696747	8698088	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?
8699028	8699849	Nah, not really.
8699889	8706413	I've been too busy doing my LiveJournal game, so I've been really trying to catch up back on the news here during the weekend.
8706613	8708355	Alright, well good.
8708475	8711717	I know what you're talking about, and I hope it's fun for you.
8711737	8717701	In fact, I'm going to be talking about LiveJournal games on this show in a couple weeks, because I'm going to be hosting another one, and I want people to sign up and play.
8719142	8726749	Real quickly, it was very unique the way some of you guys approached me and told me, oh, hey, if you like doing this kind of stuff, you might like doing this, so I signed up for it.
8726829	8735757	It was very unique and very fun, and I got to meet a lot of new people through it, and if anybody hasn't done it or wants to do it, I suggest to do it.
8736217	8738539	I'll give you more details in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8738599	8740121	All right, thank you so much, X-Links, for calling in.
8740161	8740721	No, no problem.
8740801	8741182	Take care, buddy.
8742677	8749338	by the way, I just want to point out to everybody out there that was a perfect phone call that was a wonderful phone call because dude knew
8750627	8752648	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8752668	8752968	Who's this?
8753629	8754929	Hey, it's Ranma, the second guy.
8754969	8755330	Hold on.
8755370	8759392	I know you wanted to talk, but I just wanted to praise X-Link a little more here for that call.
8759652	8763854	That was a perfect phone call because he knew exactly what he wanted to talk about.
8764194	8766255	He kind of already had it lined out.
8766335	8771978	He spoke very well, obviously tested his connection before, and just kind of laid it all out there.
8771998	8775640	When I asked him if there was anything else, he kind of added a little more, and I just...
8776440	8776880	Very good.
8777040	8778641	Everybody take notes from that last call.
8778922	8780082	Sorry about that.
8780483	8782524	Ranma, now you have to follow that.
8784085	8785846	I'm not trying to say we get bad calls.
8785886	8790289	I'm just saying that if you want to know what I think a perfect phone call is, that last call was great.
8790729	8791970	So now you have to follow it, Ranma.
8791990	8792730	What's on your mind tonight?
8793311	8794652	Well, I will do my best.
8794952	8800795	But first off, me and Judea, we went to a classic gaming convention yesterday called GameCore.
8802437	8803197	First off, I'm going to
8803854	8805535	Post a link in the chat.
8805775	8806995	Makes for great radio, doesn't it?
8807355	8808356	Yes, exactly.
8808416	8808936	That's okay.
8808976	8809496	I forgive you.
8810316	8810776	Thank you.
8811117	8814858	The pictures are on small and large size because it was a lot of stuff.
8815198	8820540	I would call this convention like Jamie's Vault x6.
8820700	8822420	That's how much stuff was there.
8822720	8827062	You had a lot of classic arcade machines there that were for sale, such as
8827418	8829960	The Simpsons arcade machine for like 400 bucks.
8830060	8831801	Oh my god, I would have went home with that.
8832182	8832842	Seriously?
8833223	8836145	Even though I'm supposed to be saving for a new car right now, I would have went home with that.
8836485	8838587	Dude, it was cash and carry.
8838807	8839447	Do they really?
8839668	8840068	Yeah.
8840088	8842530	Oh my god, I should get an arcade machine for my house.
8842550	8843010	You should.
8843070	8844952	Wouldn't my roommate fucking love that?
8846813	8847033	Sorry.
8847274	8849115	By the way, Ranma, I'm at your picture gallery.
8849135	8850296	There's a lot of broken pictures.
8850977	8851757	You might want to check that out.
8851817	8852278	I don't know if it's...
8853098	8858021	It's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on the broken link, the picture will actually show up.
8858221	8858481	Okay.
8858801	8861583	I probably shouldn't look at them all during the show, but I am looking at some of these things.
8861603	8865485	So, yeah, I see some things that are reminiscent of Classic Gaming Expo, certainly.
8865525	8867186	Did they have a lot of playable stuff out there?
8868607	8869267	Pretty much they did.
8869307	8870848	It was a lot of arcade machines.
8870868	8876151	They had a row of Dreamcasts set up to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast.
8876571	8879353	There was an actual Neo Geo MVS machine set up.
8879413	8881214	Not the whole arcade unit, but the actual...
8881792	8883252	console, and board, you know?
8884513	8886133	I have an MVS board now.
8887133	8887553	Sweet.
8887873	8891094	Dude, what is up with everybody getting fucking Neo Geo MVS boards?
8891274	8892734	You, Bobby, Jamie?
8892874	8893554	Okay, here's the thing.
8893614	8907357	They threw it in with my cabinet because I was testing, to test my cabinet, they plugged an MVS board in there and they're like, okay, hey, you want this board for 60 bucks and I'll throw in this bootleg 48-in-1 cart with it.
8907377	8908537	I'm like, what?
8908577	8908837	What?
8911303	8912264	I am so uncool.
8913164	8913744	I have to get one.
8914965	8916626	I have to fit in with everybody else.
8916666	8919288	I'm going to have to get a fucking Neo Geo now just so I can feel cool.
8920028	8920709	Sorry, Ranma.
8920789	8921829	I didn't mean to derail your call.
8922049	8927132	See, this is an example of where the hosts derail your call, which happens.
8927413	8928933	What town was this convention in again?
8929854	8930815	Oaks, Pennsylvania.
8930875	8933116	It was about 20 minutes outside of Philly.
8934397	8939740	I wonder, was it at like an actual classic gaming store or is there one like right nearby?
8941095	8941956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8968240	8970081	MC Lars, YT Cracker, 8-Bit Brothers, Armadillo Tank
8991206	8992747	Did you go to the concerts at all?
8992867	8994648	I went to a couple of the concerts.
8994708	8999770	I walked in on Super 8-Bit Brothers, and since I was dressed as Luigi, I got a lot of props and shoutouts.
9000050	9000590	Very nice.
9002711	9005833	There was actually a couple of classic cars there, such as the DeLorean and Kit.
9009417	9011619	Well, sounds like you had a lot of fun at the convention.
9011719	9014903	So is this something that travels or was it just at the one place?
9015603	9016745	It was at this one place.
9016885	9022751	I was talking to some of the people that helped create it and they were seeing some ups and downs they had with it.
9022791	9027175	So they're looking to do things a little bit differently for next year.
9028857	9030859	And also I have a bit of a game review too.
9031159	9031800	Oh, please.
9032401	9032521	Yes.
9033112	9037674	There was a company there called Storm City Games, independent publishing group.
9038014	9041955	They had a game they were demoing out called Hands-On Tangrams.
9043696	9046637	Like the tangrams we used to play with in junior high school?
9046657	9048597	That game came out a long time ago.
9050078	9050558	Interesting.
9051358	9052399	Alright, well, how was it?
9052539	9054139	Did you get your tangram on?
9054659	9057580	Yes, I did, and for $20, I think it was well worth it.
9057660	9062062	This is like a perfect time waster if you need to kill 10-20 minutes while you're waiting for something.
9062574	9064074	I came out back in spring.
9065155	9066095	Okay, Debbie Downer.
9066555	9067935	Hands on tangrams.
9067975	9072136	They said they had the demo and this is actually coming out October.
9072296	9074137	Maybe it's a new platform or a new version.
9074417	9074757	Maybe.
9074857	9076137	Maybe that's what's going on.
9076257	9076957	Probably so.
9077417	9080638	All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but I'm glad you had fun at the convention.
9080718	9081318	One more thing.
9081338	9081978	Sure, sure.
9081998	9083899	Can we talk to Jamie for one quick second, please?
9084119	9084899	I suppose.
9085059	9085339	All right.
9085599	9085979	Hold on.
9085999	9086499	Hello.
9088620	9089020	Hello.
9089420	9089800	Hello.
9090868	9091268	Hi.
9091608	9092068	Hi.
9093149	9102471	While we were there, they were actually doing viewings for Nerdcore Rising, which is the film by MC Frontalot.
9102571	9102911	Yeah.
9103611	9106091	And they were actually giving a couple of them out.
9107672	9112593	I had asked Rama to go up there and see if he could win one, and he did.
9114073	9116094	So we're going to be giving it to you, Jamie.
9116534	9116774	What?
9116794	9117294	Yes.
9117574	9117834	Yes.
9118879	9126162	It's a copy of Nerdcore Rising, and if you open it up on the DVD itself, it is signed by MC Frontalot.
9126482	9127462	Oh, that is so cool!
9128562	9130983	And it says Win Win Win on there.
9131083	9135445	We don't know exactly who wrote that on the DVD, but we think it was Lars.
9135885	9136185	Sweet!
9136920	9139921	We're not exactly sure, but yeah, just wanted to let you know that.
9140061	9141282	And who is this on the phone right now?
9141962	9143642	This would be Giove Day, Patty.
9144063	9145403	Hello, well, welcome to the show.
9145423	9148444	I don't think you've ever called in before, but what a great first call.
9148504	9151045	We like when new people on the show give stuff away.
9151065	9152306	She's talked before on the show.
9152406	9153446	I don't remember her talking.
9153466	9155367	I know she's been in chat and Twitter and all that.
9155607	9159748	Yeah, but she's called in like a couple times with Ranma before.
9159848	9160889	Well, that's awesome.
9160909	9161349	That's so cool.
9161389	9163830	And then you have to deliver it to me in person.
9165226	9165727	DarkSakura.com
9191089	9191949	Yeah, we're great people.
9192069	9193690	And how did you like the con, Giovedeo?
9193990	9194510	How did you like it?
9195271	9196151	I liked it a lot.
9196271	9200353	I'm not really big into loud, crazy conventions.
9200413	9200913	It was nice.
9200993	9201653	It was mellow.
9202114	9205175	But there was enough stuff there to do that you didn't feel that you were bored.
9206516	9206836	All right.
9207736	9208136	Very cool.
9208176	9212078	And any favorite classic game that you discovered or something that you played that you really enjoyed?
9213601	9225744	now I was actually in the booth most of the time chatting with the guy next to us who was selling all the D&D stuff and he sold me D&D dice for two bucks so that made me happy cool
9226178	9227198	Hey, nerds need their dice.
9227858	9228679	Yes, we do.
9229459	9229799	All right.
9230099	9233039	Well, we're going to let you go so we can roll the dice on another phone call.
9233099	9234200	But thank you so much, you guys.
9234220	9236360	That sounds like an awesome present and you guys didn't have to do that.
9236420	9239701	So I know DarkSakura is bouncing as she's playing The Sims.
9240081	9243101	Hey, I'm bouncing in like most of my parts.
9243141	9244182	They're quivering with joy.
9244342	9244642	All right.
9246162	9248062	Before this gets dirty, I'm going to have to let you go.
9249223	9249703	Night, guys.
9249723	9249963	All right.
9249983	9250323	Take care.
9252042	9253542	We've had some good phone calls.
9253722	9257663	Any call that gives DarkSakura something free is always going to be a good call.
9257964	9259164	That makes my liver quiver.
9259284	9261264	There's just no way that that's going to be a bad call.
9261324	9262525	Hi, you're on Orange Launch.
9262785	9263645	Wait, did I answer this one?
9264085	9264385	There we go.
9264405	9265385	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9265405	9265746	Who's this?
9266626	9267486	This is Cheeseburger.
9267746	9268806	Hi, Cheeseburger.
9268906	9270247	Have you been on the show before?
9270347	9271367	I don't think you've ever called.
9272168	9272688	No, I haven't.
9272808	9273489	I've been in chat.
9274009	9275750	You've got a deeper voice than I imagined.
9275830	9285014	I've heard your name before as we've, like, you know, reading the Twitters and the chat and all that, but I just, and I just want to point out the icon on Skype is a picture of a cheeseburger.
9286355	9287475	Why do you go by cheeseburger?
9287495	9289536	I know why he goes by cheeseburger because I read his emails.
9290297	9292238	Are you just a big fan of cheeseburgers?
9292978	9295119	No, it's extremely similar to my last name.
9295700	9300083	I know you played WoW for a while, and I just want to know why you got back into it.
9300583	9301524	I didn't know you got back into it.
9314108	9318650	I'm trying to think how far I want to get into this on a public radio show.
9319271	9328636	The reason why I had to stop playing WoW was I found myself kind of getting too involved with some of the stuff that was going on in the guild.
9328916	9338201	And unfortunately, as seems to always happen in various guilds in WoW, there was some very unfortunate guild drama where people went their separate ways.
9338741	9359422	and it really kind of turned me off to the game because part of me actually all of me felt it was very unnecessary and that I think if people across the board had been a little more more reasonable and open-minded and hadn't reacted and I think some very selfish things were done by certain people and god I hope I'm gonna get in deep hot water for getting into this on my radio show but
9360102	9361083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9385333	9395622	Well, I found a new group of people to play with that have different goals in the game that aren't so focused on the endgame rating and so forth, and just kind of rediscovering what makes WoW fun.
9396182	9403048	And also, I dumped the guy I was seeing, so I have a little more spare time now.
9405851	9407532	It's kind of like what I told one of my friends.
9407592	9411095	I said, when she criticized me, she's like, I can't believe you went back to Warcraft.
9411135	9412877	I said, this is what depressed people do!
9414929	9416069	I wouldn't really say I'm depressed.
9416550	9417290	It's a time waster.
9417610	9424392	But like I said, I think real life, if there's stuff going on in real life, it will always be better than WoW.
9425132	9426253	And this is kind of what I tell people.
9426413	9427773	I don't watch a lot of TV.
9428053	9431154	There's some things I watch, but I don't watch as much as probably most people do.
9431614	9433835	When I'm playing WoW, I'm not playing as many console games.
9433935	9435276	It's just my entertainment of choice.
9435836	9438037	But finding a balance is important.
9440277	9442238	What realm do you play on?
9442913	9446076	Right now I am playing Alliance on Blade's Edge is the server I'm playing on.
9447176	9448257	Is it alright if I join your guild?
9449158	9449698	Possibly.
9449758	9451139	Send me an email after the show.
9451180	9453361	It's not my guild that's the difference this time.
9454222	9458906	Actually, I wasn't in charge of the guild before, but I knew the people in charge more than I know the ones here.
9459866	9465731	But as long as you're not a dick, which you don't sound like from your phone call, I don't see why not.
9468133	9468453	Cool!
9468933	9470034	Alright, well you take care of yourself.
9470074	9470835	Thanks for the call, okay?
9471544	9471984	All right, you too.
9472145	9472465	All right.
9472725	9472965	See ya.
9473286	9473626	Take care.
9473906	9476208	See, I was going to say at the end of that phone call, for the Horde!
9476288	9477830	But then I was like, oh shit, I'm Alliance now.
9477890	9478390	I can't say that.
9478410	9479251	I'm playing one of each.
9480532	9481013	You're playing what?
9481253	9481633	One of each.
9481994	9482314	One of each?
9483395	9484416	You're on a different server, right?
9484576	9485677	I am, but I'll play on another.
9485757	9487899	I mean, I think I'm actually going to pay for it.
9488860	9493704	But I'm playing a blood elf, and I'm playing a goat girl.
9494865	9495606	All right, fair enough.
9495626	9496567	You know what I mean by goat girl.
9497745	9498565	Yes, Dranai.
9499106	9499346	All right.
9500006	9500487	Drano.
9500967	9501327	Drano.
9501467	9501667	All right.
9501687	9503148	Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9503188	9505189	And those were all excellent calls tonight, so thank you very much.
9505449	9508211	And I think we'll leave it at that.
9508891	9511313	I do still see calls coming in, but no offense.
9511473	9514575	All those guys that are calling in have been on the show before, so we're going to leave this as a...
9515703	9516523	Week of new callers.
9516743	9518163	Well, even though Ranma's not a new caller.
9519044	9520404	So, two out of three.
9520424	9521224	That makes Angus excited.
9521404	9521644	All right.
9523204	9524405	Plus about three phone calls a night.
9524425	9524725	It's good.
9524905	9525665	So, all right.
9525705	9526745	Yeah.
9526865	9529226	If you didn't get through tonight, though, Twitter topics next week.
9529246	9530066	We didn't get a lot tonight.
9530226	9531486	And don't forget, you can always interact.
9531526	9531886	Chat room.
9531906	9532326	Mailbag.
9532366	9533746	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
9534507	9536387	Always plenty of ways to interact with the program.
9536887	9539247	So, let's get into some last-minute stories.
9539668	9541228	I never allowed Loki the chance.
9542199	9544120	I'm going to steal one more cookie because they're delicious.
9544440	9544960	That's fine.
9545000	9546001	They're there for stealing.
9547101	9550723	And we can throw away all the bacon stuff, except for my plate.
9550783	9552583	Why don't we feed all the bacon stuff to Dan?
9553344	9553984	If he wants it.
9556018	9557720	What the hell is this crap?
9559121	9563626	Sonic is possibly going to come back in the way that it should have been coming back in the first place.
9564127	9569773	None of these 3D crap fests with were-hedgehogs and that kind of stuff.
9570414	9575259	No, we're actually going to get a brand new 2D HD Sonic the Hedgehog game.
9575340	9575860	It's going to be...
9576881	9577682	Sky Stage Xbox Live Arcade
9602915	9605959	Well, now it's also making its way to arcades as well.
9606619	9609182	And I don't know, man.
9610204	9611826	I've seen screenshots and video of this.
9611966	9612767	It just looks weird.
9613728	9619034	I mean, I don't think King of Fires really translates itself well into... It's one of those things I want to see just once, though.
9619655	9621337	Just like for the WTF value.
9621858	9622058	Yeah.
9623355	9627218	By the way, the Sonic 2D thing, I'm a little nervous about that.
9627498	9633402	And I'm with everybody else in the camp of OMG awesome Sonic 2D.
9633502	9637485	Hopefully it's kind of influenced by Mega Man 9, just to go back to your damn roots.
9638025	9642869	But I am a little worried because this is like the third time Sonic has been reinvented.
9643489	9645331	And the last few have not been that great.
9645711	9646772	So I really hope...
9647512	9648152	This one's good.
9648432	9653094	I'm hopeful, but I'm a little apprehensive, and I think I have the right to be, as do all the rest of you.
9654794	9656115	Yeah.
9657415	9670620	And then, also to kind of go along with some stuff we were talking about before, you may remember that porn has been kind of making its way to the PlayStation 3 PlayStation Network in Japan.
9671348	9675670	Well, now apparently Vivid Entertainment is hoping to do the same thing in the U.S.
9676250	9685073	They are making a stand trying to convince Sony that their porn should be on the PlayStation Network.
9686133	9687034	Bravo, I say.
9687614	9689454	So that'll be kind of interesting.
9690575	9693416	And apparently...
9695418	9698341	Go back to some of the piracy stuff we were talking about.
9699202	9707108	We may have talked about this in the past, but yes, they have finally released the sequel, the official sequel to Don't Copy That Floppy.
9707909	9709090	Don't Copy That 2.
9709970	9712913	And let me tell you this much, I watched it and it's horrible.
9712933	9714334	And then promptly copied a floppy.
9715075	9715515	It's horrible.
9715715	9717977	If I still had a floppy, I would copy it.
9719324	9723848	And my favorite thing about this is they're talking about how, oh, copying is a crime and stuff.
9723888	9726430	And yeah, piracy is a crime, whatever.
9726850	9734477	But the guy that they show at the very end, there's like a real pirate, I guess, who... He was selling copies of stuff, okay?
9734737	9738039	I think that's something that's gonna probably land you in jail more than...
9738740	9740441	Pirating games for your own use It's a YouTube clip
9764111	9768013	I think they want it freely distributed everywhere.
9768073	9769494	Even if we're critical of it?
9769774	9770594	Even if we're critical of it.
9770614	9774656	So are we going to copy the thing?
9775176	9776197	Read that in a minute, DarkSakura.
9776217	9778277	I know what you're looking at, and it's related.
9779198	9779758	Where is it here?
9779798	9780899	Who linked it in chat here?
9781099	9783080	It's this, right?
9783260	9783620	Yes.
9783960	9784440	Okay, hold on.
9784480	9785361	I'm bringing it up in studio.
9785381	9785581	Sorry.
9785621	9786181	Okay, here it is.
9786521	9787522	Don't copy that floppy 2.
9789745	9792686	Welcome back to 90s Time Trip.
9792926	9796127	It's that anti-piracy classic, Don't Copy That Floppy.
9796767	9797867	Can I just skip ahead here?
9797927	9799347	I don't want to watch this whole damn thing, okay?
9799667	9802768	I just want to see what the song sounds like, and I want to see that bit at the end.
9803228	9805749	He looks kind of like Max Headroom, but black.
9805969	9806529	Like, is it just me?
9806549	9808189	But that's kind of what it looks like.
9819312	9819733	Sorta.
9819753	9820514	Don't copy it!
9820574	9821014	Oh, he does.
9821034	9821274	See?
9821314	9821415	Yeah.
9840296	9840756	I don't know.
9840997	9843259	It's not as funny as the other one was.
9843359	9848983	I think the old 90s value of the first one is what made it so funny and catchy.
9849023	9853847	But this one is like, ironically enough, is a copy of a copy.
9854968	9858151	And you know how copies of copies lose quality over time?
9858571	9859692	That's what I feel this is.
9860373	9862695	Like an unnecessary sequel.
9862775	9863655	Okay, I want to see the bit.
9864056	9864636	Whoa, what happened?
9864796	9865357	The thing stopped.
9866057	9866498	Don't do that.
9868339	9869464	Don't stop me, my floppy.
9869524	9869806	All right.
9870830	9871694	Let me see the bit at the end.
9871714	9873602	What, it's about the last minute is where the pirate shows up?
9874330	9881211	Um, yeah, even... I want to see... I want to see the little, like, message to kids.
9881792	9886272	My name is Jeremiah Mondello, and I want you to know that pirating software is no joke.
9886933	9890613	I'm serving four years for selling pirated software on the web.
9890753	9894774	And now, for the rest of my life, I'll be labeled a felon and an ex-con.
9895054	9896534	Don't make the same mistakes I did.
9896894	9899275	It's not just a copy, it's a crime.
9899775	9901516	Would I be immature for making fun of his voice?
9902457	9905620	Because... I wondered if that was a woman.
9907181	9912826	I don't mean to sound rude and or petty and I should really not be the first to talk, but like...
9914611	9916291	He doesn't sound like he's ever gone through puberty.
9917212	9918732	Is that a disease?
9918772	9920132	See what happens when you copy?
9921273	9930455	Does selling pirated games cause your balls to go back into your body or something?
9930595	9934475	I think being in prison causes your balls to go back into your body.
9934615	9936756	Actually, Rob, I had to look at his neck.
9936816	9939817	I guess it's okay for me to make fun of him because he is a felon, right?
9940017	9941037	I had to look at his neck.
9941769	9943350	to see if there was an Adam's apple?
9943851	9947473	Oh, he's got too much facial hair, even if that was drugs.
9947593	9950816	A woman can grow that much facial hair with hormonal therapy.
9950856	9951696	Yes, really.
9952457	9955199	Can I see the rest of this uplifting message here?
9957841	9959342	Oh, he's just a sad face.
9959602	9960903	It was just a sad face.
9960943	9961564	That was the end of it.
9961604	9961984	Never mind.
9964315	9966196	So now he's serving four years in jail.
9966476	9967676	I learned my lesson.
9968397	9974979	And now he's being made fun of on the internet by... Well, how about you don't sell pirated copies of stuff, stupid?
9976440	9983323	Of course, see, that's the people they go after is the big piracy rings that, you know, cause companies money because they're actually selling bootleg copies.
9984423	9987404	AmazeSatsuma in chat says, his body copied too much estrogen.
9990606	9993527	And Rama says, and people wonder why software is so fucking expensive.
9994631	9996274	By the way, that's a free download at iTunes.
9998518	9999179	Yeah, better be.
9999199	10002264	It wouldn't be worth... Someone should go copy it.
10004487	10005689	Oh, you gotta love irony.
10006551	10008153	Guess who's never gonna download that?
10008714	10008834	Me.
10009315	10013056	DarkSakura, you had a last-minute story, and then we'll let Loki finish up if he has anything else.
10013196	10020797	Yeah, it's actually somebody... To quote Silent Scope, let's play Metal Gear for real.
10021557	10037080	A guy in France who was accused of killing... There's an actor, Roland Gerard, he was convicted with... Well, supposed to be going, actually, in jail, waiting trial for killing the guy's daughter and her friend.
10037880	10037980	Um...
10039644	10042014	He escaped from jail in a box.
10043871	10044271	In a box.
10045092	10046713	Playing Metal Gear-ish.
10047334	10047694	Not really.
10047954	10057663	But he had put himself in a box that was being loaded onto a truck to take to southeast of Paris.
10058543	10061826	And he broke free and the driver didn't even figure it out until later.
10062046	10065189	And so the guy, from what I can see, is still at large.
10066410	10070553	His name is Jean-Pierre Trebert, I think.
10070834	10071034	So...
10071855	10073657	Trebek It's myself in a box
10087133	10087673	Anyhow, sorry.
10087693	10089534	Well, like Solid Snake, you know.
10090074	10090535	By the way.
10090695	10091655	Oh, no.
10091735	10094896	Because you know in the game he was in a box and he moved the box in the truck.
10095237	10096857	It says, oh, no, the truck have started to move.
10096877	10098018	The truck have started to move.
10098078	10098658	I love that.
10098978	10100199	So, yeah, the truck have started to move.
10100219	10101899	I need to play through old school NES Metal Gear.
10101980	10102600	I'm out of jail.
10102620	10106782	Hey, that gaming marathon we're doing on the 17th, I want to play Metal Gear for an hour.
10107162	10107462	Yeah.
10107582	10107982	Old school.
10108402	10108602	Rob.
10108803	10109003	What?
10109143	10109503	Yeah.
10109683	10109963	Yeah.
10110563	10110703	Rob.
10111324	10111544	What?
10111964	10112464	Yeah.
10113264	10113865	Hey, by the way.
10114065	10114245	What?
10115526	10115926	I hate you.
10131056	10133638	There was actually one funny thing they had on Saturday Night Live last night.
10133678	10136039	It was a repeat, but I never watched Saturday Night Live, so it was new to me.
10136519	10142002	But they had a sequel to the Dick in the Box thing with Justin Timberlake and whoever that guy, Andy Samberg, is that his name?
10143123	10147665	It was something like, we're gonna fuck each other's moms for Mother's Day or something like that.
10147745	10148926	It was actually really funny.
10149246	10150126	I hadn't heard that one.
10150146	10151747	That was the one funny thing I saw on that show all night.
10151807	10152748	It's not on the album.
10153291	10153531	Sarah Palin
10176721	10177281	I thought it was...
10202657	10203057	I guess that's it.
10203077	10203737	Good night!
10203917	10205978	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10206938	10211699	But before we close the door on tonight's program, we do have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10212039	10213299	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10214919	10215379	Bacon.
10217100	10219520	I have now officially given up pork.
10220440	10220980	Good luck with that.
10222380	10224961	Well, I'm going to be very sick tonight, so it's fine.
10225741	10228602	Have you ever talked about why you're doing that, or is that not something you want to get into on Oil Arm?
10228622	10229502	I don't want to get into it.
10229702	10230522	Okay, that's fine.
10231348	10232849	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
10233549	10237431	My final thought is I'm going to be working on my cabinet all week.
10237451	10237511	Yay!
10239732	10243394	My final thought is Disneyland!
