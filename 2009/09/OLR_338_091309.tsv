68000	69000	Hello
69000	70000	How are you, Loki?
70000	71000	I'm good
71000	74000	Alright, now of course before we get into gaming weeks usually
74000	77000	We somehow start off the show as Orange Lounge Radio Foodio
77000	81000	And tonight is no exception to the cause here
81000	84000	Loki, what the hell did you bring with you tonight because
84000	87000	I have to admit it actually looks kind of disgusting
87000	91000	I brought parts of Bacon Fest 2009
91000	94000	As Nellie would call it, it was the bacon themed birthday party
94000	96000	Some of the food that we serve there
96000	100000	Including bacon muffins
100000	102000	Which they're cornbread muffins
102000	104000	That have a little
104000	108000	I'm seriously looking at all this food, oh my god
108000	111000	It's just too much, it's too much
111000	114000	Don't get me wrong, I love bacon
114000	116000	But this is too much bacon
116000	118000	Bacon is meat candy
118000	120000	Ok, sorry to interrupt
120000	122000	Anyways, so it's
122000	125000	Ok, let me just run down the list here
125000	128000	The bacon muffins, they're basically cornbread muffins
128000	132000	It initially had a little bit of reserved bacon fat in there
132000	134000	To give it the kind of bacon flavor
134000	136000	And there's bacon inside of it
136000	140000	And then Nellie decided that they didn't quite taste like enough bacon
140000	142000	And she
142000	145000	Originally when I made them, I bought the wrong size tins
145000	147000	So I only made like 10 muffins
147000	150000	And I'm like, you can't eat any of those because we only have 10 muffins
150000	154000	So there's a piece of the muffin mix or whatever that had fallen into the bacon grease
154000	156000	And she snatched it up and ate it
156000	159000	And she's like, mmm that's good, you should rub all of them into the bacon grease
159000	163000	So we rolled the top of them really quickly into the bacon grease
163000	165000	To give it a little bit of extra bacon flavor
165000	173000	And then on top of it is like cream cheese, hot sauce, green onion, and bacon
173000	179000	It's kind of like a spicy, I don't know, frosting almost
179000	183000	And then we made these pancetta cups with mac and cheese inside of them
183000	186000	Just mainly because we couldn't think of anything good to fill inside of them
186000	187000	Ok
187000	189000	And they're ok
189000	192000	I'm about to eat one and just for the record
192000	194000	I have yet to touch the bacon food
194000	196000	This is actually funny because I was going to be
196000	200000	I had said I was giving up bacon and I had decided I'm going to do it tomorrow
200000	204000	So this is great because I can now make myself completely sick of bacon
204000	206000	Why give it up now when you can procrastinate to tomorrow
206000	208000	Especially with all these bacon temptations in front of you
208000	210000	Nom nom nom
210000	212000	I don't know, I've got to admit
212000	214000	I'm a little over bacon being the food of worship
214000	217000	Like, you know, bacon's kind of been the in-food for years and years now
217000	220000	I think we need to move on to a new food of worship
220000	222000	Like, what about the jelly bean?
222000	225000	I don't see enough appreciation for jelly beans out there
225000	227000	It has to be jelly bellies
227000	229000	Alright, forget it
229000	234000	And then the last one is shrimp wrapped in bacon with barbecue sauce
234000	238000	And mozzarella cheese broiled on top of it
238000	240000	But it's actually, the shrimp's pretty good
240000	242000	We ate mostly the shrimp
242000	244000	And then I had candied bacon
244000	247000	It was with, you know, brown sugar
247000	250000	You know, kind of caramelized on top of it and stuff
250000	253000	That I meant to put on ice cream so we'd have bacon ice cream
253000	256000	But everybody ate the bacon, you know, the candied bacon
256000	259000	Before I got a chance to bring out the ice cream
259000	263000	Now sadly I missed Bacon Fest because it conflicted with my dad's birthday
263000	266000	And I had a friend from out of town who I hadn't seen in years who was visiting
266000	269000	But thank you to Loki and Nellie for bringing a little piece of it here
269000	270000	It was very nice
270000	272000	I will try at least one of the bacon shrimp things
272000	273000	That looks kind of good
273000	274000	They're pretty good
274000	280000	And then Irene and Nathan brought these like mashed potato ball things that have like bacon and stuff
280000	282000	So I don't, I haven't tried those
282000	283000	But everyone liked those I think
283000	284000	Alright let's go to our chat room
284000	287000	Yes we do talk about video games occasionally on this show
287000	289000	But let me go to the chat room and introduce them
289000	291000	Howdy guys at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
291000	294000	They're always with us, the EverPresence fourth guest on the show
294000	298000	Tigerclaw says you guys should take a picture of this and post on the OLR Gallery
298000	300000	We are one step ahead of you sir
300000	302000	Dark Sakura I think already did that
302000	304000	They should be on their way up to the OLR Gallery
304000	306000	So if you want to check out the food
306000	308000	Go to orangelaungeradio.com
308000	310000	Click on I think it's galleries and you'll see
310000	312000	If you're smart you'll figure it out
312000	314000	Click on like pictures or galleries
314000	315000	I don't have it in front of me
315000	319000	And then you can find the bacon stuff that Loki brought
319000	321000	Sadly the one thing that wasn't there was super bacon
321000	323000	Just because I thought I had plenty of bacon
323000	325000	And I actually ran short of bacon
325000	327000	I had bought like five packages of bacon
327000	329000	And it was still not enough
329000	336000	Salaciouspopnchat says popcorn jelly bellies equal vom
336000	339000	The chat room by the way is called Kevin
339000	343000	I just want to point out though that I actually like the popcorn jelly beans quite a bit
343000	345000	But my favorite is toasted marshmallow
345000	348000	Jelly Belly makes a toasted marshmallow jelly bean that is delicious
348000	351000	In honor of Bacon Fest
351000	353000	The chat room is called Kevin
353000	356000	I'm very sorry I did not refer to them by their proper name
356000	360000	I still don't understand this whole renaming the chat room to names of people you know
360000	362000	You are Kevin!
362000	364000	Fine
364000	366000	Alright there you go
366000	368000	So okay I'm going to try one of these bacon shrimp things
368000	370000	Even though my pancreas hurts just looking at it
370000	371000	Dear God
371000	372000	Well that's two of them
372000	373000	There's two of them
373000	375000	You need to separate that
375000	377000	Okay here we go
379000	383000	Careful and chew carefully because like you said it's a little choke-y
383000	387000	This is not good radio
387000	388000	Sorry
388000	390000	It's delicious radio
390000	394000	It takes a while to chew through because unfortunately the bacon did not crisp up as well as I'd like to
394000	396000	It's pretty darn good
396000	398000	It's pretty darn good
398000	400000	But no one seemed to care because you know
400000	402000	It's delicious
402000	404000	It's good but damn
404000	407000	This is probably all I'm going to have
407000	409000	I'm going to have another piece of shrimp
409000	413000	You guys can see in the picture gallery and even if you're listening on the podcast you can go on the website
413000	414000	I'm sure it'll still be there
414000	417000	You can go in that picture gallery and look and it's too much
417000	418000	It's too much
418000	421000	Yes there is a such a thing as too much bacon and it is sitting in front of us tonight
421000	426000	The important thing today Rob is that all I've had is a salad so I could safely eat this bacon
426000	428000	But tomorrow no more pork
428000	433000	See I'm already a little full because I had wings topped today which is not good
433000	437000	Oh my God all the weight I've worked so hard to lose I'm getting right back today
437000	439000	Alright
439000	441000	I'll move it out of here if you'd like
441000	443000	At some point we're going to need to do that
443000	445000	That's right not right now
445000	447000	Let's get into our gaming week
447000	450000	We should talk about video games that is what we do here on this show
450000	453000	Dark Sakura what type of video games have you been playing this week?
453000	455000	I don't know what type of games
457000	459000	Enough with the bacon
459000	461000	Put the bacon down step away from the bacon
461000	463000	Do you want me to have Loki go first?
463000	465000	Loki how was your gaming week?
465000	467000	My gaming week was awesome
467000	473000	Well you know played the usual stuff New Grand Theft Auto what not
473000	480000	Also got around to playing a little bit of Scribblenauts which it's alright
480000	484000	But I haven't really gotten past the tutorial stuff yet because I've only played it for a little bit
484000	489000	I've been busy messing with the little front end thing where you can spawn wherever you want and stuff
489000	496000	And let me tell you and I know this really sucks to say it but oh my god does it get old after 5 minutes
496000	499000	And you know that is really sad
499000	501000	I knew it I knew that's what was going to happen with this game
501000	507000	I haven't played it yet so I just you know it's one of those things I think it's like the Nintendogs of this year
507000	510000	It's like one of those things is going to be cute as hell for 30 minutes
510000	513000	And then you're going to be like okay I did all the lolsy things I wanted to do
513000	519000	And pretty much and you know I'm sure the puzzles and stuff are going to be fun
519000	524000	I haven't quite gotten there yet because I'm still doing the fucking tutorial stuff which is annoying
524000	530000	But just as far as messing with stuff it's kind of boring
530000	533000	And the other thing that I don't really care for in it is the control
533000	537000	The control you have to use the stylus and you click to where you want Maxwell to go
537000	544000	And it's so non-responsive it's just ah it really bugs me
544000	549000	But it's cool I guess you know that you can spawn all these different things
549000	554000	But like you know they've got like 2200 words or something in this
554000	557000	But a lot of the other words just you know create the same thing
557000	561000	If you type in any type of dog it just makes this generic looking dog or something
561000	564000	Now you're getting called out a little bit in chat from our good friend Bobby
564000	567000	Who's on Before Us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights
567000	572000	Black Wolf says so Loki played with the playground and not the actual game and called it old
572000	574000	Well I'm telling you what I played
574000	578000	I'm just saying I thought I'd be able to play this playground part
578000	581000	And just you know have a lot of fun with it for quite a while
581000	584000	Because I mean dude I made a cat
584000	587000	Well first thing I did was I did what the ESRB had
587000	591000	You know where they said you can lure a lion with you know meat strapped to a baby
591000	595000	So I strapped meat to a baby and you know lured a lion with that and that was kind of funny
595000	599000	And then I strapped the laser to a cat and tried to make a laser cap
599000	603000	But that didn't work because you know it just it didn't know what I wanted to do
603000	608000	But yeah I'm sure the puzzles are fun but like I said I haven't played there yet
608000	611000	And I'm just saying what this is my impression so far
611000	617000	It's a really quick impression but yeah it's not as much fun as I thought it would be
617000	619000	Fair enough I guess
619000	627000	Now the other thing too this week is I finally finally finally got my arcade cabinet
627000	634000	So I went down to the San Jose and picked up my Astro City candy cab
634000	639000	And brought it home and also with that I got a
639000	646000	Was it an MVS Neo Geo board a single slot with a 48 in one
646000	649000	Which I'm sure is absolutely not legit one bit
649000	656000	48 in one Neo Geo cart that's got a lot of King of Fighters and Metal Slug and whatnot on there
656000	662000	But you know basically I have that to hold me over until I finish my main computer and all that stuff
662000	665000	But it's kind of cool so I'm putting that all together
665000	670000	And actually going to be painting the whole thing black
670000	673000	So I have to do that as well because it's kind of scuffed up
673000	677000	And I tried to find a white paint or something that might match it
677000	683000	But I mean you can't match the color of the plastic there so it's just easier to paint the whole thing black
683000	689000	So yeah and I've got some pics on my live journal right now of just the cabinet
689000	692000	It's kind of taken apart a little bit the control panel wasn't on there
692000	696000	I had to re-screw that back on there because they gave me like two different control panels
696000	700000	None of which were the one I wanted but you know it's fine for now
700000	707000	And then I plan on getting the correct one later because I wanted a two player both with six buttons
707000	711000	But I have a two player with three buttons on each and a one player with six buttons
711000	714000	So whatever it'll work for now
714000	717000	And what other stuff did I have to do
717000	722000	Oh yeah I had to get a new halogen or not halogen a fluorescent light for the marquee
722000	728000	And of course it's some special fluorescent light that they don't make over here in the United States
728000	734000	You know because most of them are standard size like 12 inch, 18 inch, 24
734000	740000	This was 22 and 3 eighths so I had to go order that specially online from Atlanta
740000	746000	And they had apparently some of these Toshiba fluorescent lights so I had that
746000	749000	Now you are still taking late donations for your cabinet
749000	750000	Oh yeah definitely
750000	752000	Okay good because I never donated
752000	755000	I was going to do it on Friday but I got sidetracked so I'm going to give you a late donation
755000	758000	I still got lots of stuff I got to get online
758000	763000	I'm planning on actually rebuilding my DDR pads
763000	769000	And I have an email to channel Beat about Dance Maniacs sensors
769000	771000	Because I have the actual Dance Maniacs machine
771000	774000	I have two upper sensors but I need two lower sensors
774000	777000	And if I can get them for a good price I'm going to buy them from them
777000	780000	Now where did you put all these machines are you putting them in your garage?
780000	784000	Well I don't have a Dance Maniacs machine I have the motherboard inside of it
784000	786000	Right but you used to have your candy cab where's that going?
786000	789000	The candy cab is in the garage right now but it's going to go in the middle of the room
789000	797000	I'm taking the HDTV and there's an HDTV and a Stanford in the room right now
797000	802000	So you have to put the toys in the middle of the bedroom so the wife can close the door and not see it?
802000	806000	Well she doesn't close the door I just wanted it in there because that's where I'm going to put my DDR pads
806000	808000	And that's going to take up a lot of space
808000	811000	I could put it in the garage and that would be fine going through the winter
811000	817000	But in the summer fuck no it's like 100 degrees inside there I'd die
817000	821000	Yeah it's even worse than the studio where we were taping at my house
821000	823000	It's quite pleasant today though
823000	824000	Yeah it's nice today
824000	826000	Alright so that's it for your gaming week
826000	827000	That's it
827000	829000	Dark Sakura now that she's done with her bacon
829000	831000	Mmm bacon
831000	836000	My gaming week was a marathon session of Beatles Rock Band
836000	842000	Which I really loved I had a great time playing especially doing harmony
842000	848000	Because everybody doesn't have to do all the harmony but you get more bonuses if you harmonize properly
848000	856000	And I had a really good time with that that was a lot of fun except that my hands started hurting after a while playing some of the guitar
856000	860000	I was going to say I forgot I also did play the Beatles Rock Band and Rock Band 2
860000	864000	Did you know actually and this is kind of neat I just tried it because I wasn't sure if it worked
864000	870000	That the old Karaoke Revolution mics from the Playstation 2 actually work on the 360 version of Rock Band
870000	872000	Did you know the Lips mics also work on it?
872000	878000	I didn't know if they patched that stuff in yet but I know they were supposed to be getting patched in soon
878000	887000	Well we cause Dan made it out of his conference with a double set of Lips mics
887000	891000	And so we used those we had a really good time I thought it was great
891000	895000	So you guys both feel, no you kind of already gave your review last week Loki and you said
895000	901000	I'm not a fan of the Beatles so I'm not as yippy about this but I see where people are getting excited about it
901000	907000	Yeah it was alright but I think we came away with it like wow the Beatles had some really tripped out shit in there
907000	914000	Their songs were weird because we had Nathan singing this stuff and he's just like holy crap I didn't know that they had these weird songs
914000	920000	But after about maybe 10 minutes of it we were just like ok let's go to Rock Band 2 because we just got tired of it
920000	924000	But Dark Sakura is someone who is more of a Beatles fan you were like yay I'm in heaven
924000	933000	I was like dude I want my other songs in here because like the songs that I most wanted in there weren't there
933000	939000	Well a lot of the ones that I really liked like some of my favorite songs are like
939000	946000	Dear Prudence was in there which is one of my favorites and which is actually really easy and fun to sing
946000	951000	It's the only one I beat on Expert and then Something was on there which is another one I like
951000	958000	And we also the theme was we had a discussion on who had the better hair and we all agreed that George Harrison had better hair
958000	964000	Now quick question have you explored download content because you know some of it's there
964000	967000	We just rented it because Dan with a button didn't pre-order it for me
967000	972000	But the one song that I would have most liked in there I know it would make zero sense to put it in there
972000	979000	Because the only thing you could do on it would be vocals unless you could mimic violin on the guitar controller
979000	984000	Or something would be Eleanor Rigby which is my favorite Beatles song
984000	994000	There were really some fun ones in there like Taxman was in there and I think I saw She Came in Through the Bathroom Window
994000	997000	Which is a cool song
997000	1003000	A lot of stuff you know but of course then I had to go and listen to all the stuff that Tiare gave me
1003000	1007000	So I actually listened to Rubber Soul like three times all the way through
1007000	1010000	I feel so uncool I'm like the only person that didn't play Beatles Rock Band this week
1010000	1016000	Because my ex and granted it's my own damn fault my Xbox 360 is still broke and I need to go get it fixed
1016000	1021000	I just you know I've just been complacent doing all this other stuff and I've just been busy with some other things in my personal life
1021000	1027000	So I haven't really gotten out to get it fixed but I'm not gonna re-buy the instruments just for the PS3 version
1027000	1031000	No I have all these money invested in instruments on the 360 that's where I want to get Beatles Rock Band
1031000	1036000	So I'm just a little behind and by the time I'm ready to play it there'll probably be nobody left playing it online
1036000	1045000	Well I also like I'm doing right now play Sims 3 because I love Sims 3
1045000	1052000	And it's actually really easy to run it during the show because I have to always be doing something
1052000	1062000	I also, what else did I play? No I don't think I played, I was gonna play a Dreamcast game and I didn't
1062000	1067000	You know, thought about it, didn't do it, played some Pinball
1067000	1070000	I go back to work Monday
1070000	1071000	Sucks to be you
1071000	1074000	Oh I played Peggle, lot of Peggle, lot of Peggle
1074000	1079000	My gaming week was not quite as exciting as Dark Soccer or Loki's, I had pretty mellow
1079000	1083000	I played a lot of World of Warcraft, don't judge, haters gonna hate
1083000	1086000	But I'm playing Alliance this time because I was Horde for years
1086000	1087000	Yeah I played that too
1087000	1091000	Good, I'm glad now instead of calling me an addict you're like oh okay yeah I'm addicted too
1091000	1094000	I'm not addicted, I played twice
1094000	1099000	Clearly I have issues because I'm already like level 24 but I have some friends that are playing so whatever
1099000	1104000	It makes it go by faster, and I'm sure these people are gonna be like you could have gotten your Xbox fixed
1104000	1109000	But you've been playing World of Warcraft, don't judge me
1109000	1115000	Let's see what else, I've been playing, I have been playing some stuff on the Playstation as well
1115000	1124000	Just kind of mostly the same stuff, Wipeout and Home, even I got some more invites to the club on there taken care of
1124000	1130000	So if you were waiting for that then you probably got that, and yeah just kind of playing that stuff
1130000	1135000	Oh and also Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP, that's probably been the game I've been playing more than any other console game
1135000	1140000	Is that, and it's difficult, it's way harder than regular Rock Band
1140000	1144000	I'm sorry some of those note patterns are really tough to do with the four buttons
1144000	1149000	So I can see where Rock Band Unplugged definitely polarizes audiences
1149000	1155000	But I'll tell you what, after having been missing frequency and amplitude for so long it's kind of cool to have this
1155000	1160000	I do miss the techno music, but Rock Band Unplugged has a decent song list
1160000	1163000	So I'm satisfied
1163000	1169000	Alright well that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into our housekeeping tonight
1169000	1173000	In tonight's housekeeping, there may or may not be a show next week
1173000	1178000	I'm thinking, and I kind of have to ask this live on air, no? No show? Are you out?
1178000	1179000	I'm out
1179000	1181000	Okay so then we're not gonna do it
1181000	1184000	I have stuff that needs to get done on Sunday night
1184000	1189000	Okay then fine, cause I was gonna suggest we could do it late cause my flight gets in at 5.30 so maybe we could start the show at 7
1189000	1192000	But we'll just not do it then if you have stuff going on too
1192000	1195000	So free night for Loki, woo, I gotta work in the cabinet, woo, woo
1195000	1200000	But the problem is I am also going to be out the first weekend of October
1200000	1203000	So I'll have to figure something out for that, where you guys can do it without me or something
1203000	1207000	Cause we don't want to miss too many shows, or we pre-taped that week or something, maybe we can do that
1207000	1208000	Yeah
1208000	1214000	Alright so yeah, there's gonna be no show next Sunday so just brace yourself for that and have a good week without us here
1214000	1220000	Alright, that's it I guess for housekeeping, otherwise you can always follow us on Twitter
1220000	1227000	We're OLR on Twitter, we're OLRME on Facebook, it's a club so you have to search for OLRMY
1227000	1232000	And Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, although I don't think we've posted to LiveJournal in about a year, but it's there
1232000	1235000	I should cross post some of mine
1235000	1240000	You should actually cross post some of it to Orange Lounge, it'd be nice to see that being updated, so there you go
1240000	1244000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news already and some long discussion tonight
1244000	1247000	Loki's gonna start us off with a four part story
1247000	1251000	Yes, well speaking about Twitter, apparently Courtney Love has one
1251000	1256000	And she wasn't too happy about some stuff that went down with a deal that she had with Activision
1256000	1260000	Regarding Kurt Cobain's appearance in Guitar Hero 5
1260000	1264000	Apparently, and this is her two posts that she had on Twitter
1264000	1270000	For the record, this Guitar Hero shit is breach of contract on Bully's part
1270000	1275000	And there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction
1275000	1279000	And then she followed up with, we're gonna sue the shit out of Activision
1279000	1288000	We being the trusty estates, the LLC, and the various LLCs, Cobain Enterprise
1288000	1293000	This is gonna be a completely unrelated statement, but I just have to get this off my chest
1293000	1298000	Isn't this fascinating that we live in a world now where Twitter is like a late breaking news source
1298000	1302000	And a lot of the reason why is because celebrities on Twitter are unfiltered
1302000	1305000	They're not going through their publicists and writing things like this
1305000	1309000	Like I don't know why, but like seven years ago when we started this show we would never have a story like this
1309000	1316000	But now it's kind of weird that we're reading about Courtney being pissed off like through her Twitter
1316000	1319000	It's just weird that Twitter is like this news source all of a sudden
1319000	1321000	Here's my thing
1321000	1324000	Why the hell is anyone reading CourtneyLovesTwitter?
1324000	1326000	I mean seriously
1326000	1328000	She has fans
1328000	1329000	Who?
1329000	1330000	She does?
1330000	1332000	Like convicts? I mean who?
1332000	1334000	I don't know
1334000	1336000	You know what? I will say this
1336000	1338000	When I was in high school, I was a senior in high school
1338000	1341000	We participated in the lip sync contest
1341000	1343000	You know how they do the lip sync contest at high school?
1343000	1346000	I'm sure your high school did one, like all high schools did this right?
1346000	1349000	So we decided to make a mockery of the whole thing, me and my two friends
1349000	1351000	And I dressed up as Courtney Love
1351000	1354000	And we did what's the song called?
1354000	1356000	Violet by Hole?
1356000	1358000	Go on take everything
1358000	1361000	And you know I had a wig and I wore this really trashy outfit and everything
1361000	1366000	Yes it's like one of the few times in my life where I've cross dressed outside of Rocky Horror
1366000	1368000	And let's see
1368000	1372000	Then one of my other friends put his long hair in pigtails and pretend to play the bass
1372000	1377000	And then our other friend dressed up like a Japanese schoolgirl and ran out on stage with these random signs
1377000	1382000	Like it was the most random anti lip sync thing you did
1382000	1385000	Because everybody else was doing like lollipop lollipop
1385000	1388000	And all this stupid shit and all dressed and clear cut
1388000	1391000	And here we are going out on stage in drag singing Violet
1391000	1393000	And it was all kinds of awesome
1393000	1396000	You know how we did? We got last place
1396000	1398000	Last place
1398000	1400000	Thank you Courtney Love
1400000	1403000	I was a hot ass Courtney Love though
1403000	1405000	I will just put that out there
1405000	1408000	Well they did have a picture of Courtney Love on Kotaku during one of the stories
1408000	1410000	It actually was one of the good pictures of her
1410000	1412000	I'm like wow she was hot at one time
1412000	1414000	What the fuck happened there?
1414000	1417000	I'm guessing a lot of drugs but you know
1417000	1419000	Anyways back to the story
1419000	1425000	So she was pissed off that you know Kurt Cobain is totally
1425000	1429000	Mainly the thing that they're pissed off about is
1429000	1432000	And I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos regarding this
1432000	1436000	Apparently these characters or these artists can be unlocked
1436000	1438000	As playable characters in the game
1438000	1441000	So therefore you can make them sing any retarded song that's in this game
1441000	1445000	Including I think they had one that had Flava Flav in it
1445000	1448000	So they had the clip of course of Kurt Cobain
1448000	1451000	You know lip sync to Flava Flav
1451000	1454000	And I mean that's just blasphemy right there
1454000	1458000	Activision responded of course after these stupid Twitter updates
1458000	1462000	Saying that Courtney Love signed a contract for this
1462000	1465000	And you know tough luck
1465000	1469000	Because they aren't in breach of contract
1469000	1473000	And then of course then her publicist I guess
1473000	1476000	Released a statement I guess it was
1476000	1478000	Oh I'm sorry then I have publicist
1478000	1481000	Other band members from Nirvana
1481000	1484000	They said this is a statement regarding Nirvana
1484000	1486000	Guitar Hero and the likeness of the late Kurt Cobain
1486000	1489000	We want the people to know that we are dismayed and very disappointed
1489000	1495000	In the way a facsimile of Kurt is used in Guitar Hero
1495000	1499000	The name and likeness of Kurt Cobain are sole property of his estates
1499000	1501000	We have no control whatsoever in that area
1501000	1505000	While we are aware of Kurt's image being used with the two Nirvana songs
1505000	1508000	We didn't know that the players have the ability to unlock the character
1508000	1513000	This feature allows a character to be used with any kind of song the player wants
1513000	1517000	We urge Activision to do the right thing in relocking Kurt's character
1517000	1520000	So that this won't continue in the future
1520000	1526000	It's hard to watch an image of Kurt pantomiming other artists alongside cartoon characters
1526000	1531000	Kurt Cobain wrote songs that hold a lot of meaning to people all over the world
1531000	1533000	We feel he deserves better
1533000	1538000	You read that about as enthusiastically as I feel about it
1538000	1540000	Just so you know
1540000	1543000	Well here's the thing, they have no say in it
1543000	1546000	They didn't sign any contracts, they're just giving their piece about it
1546000	1549000	They're just throwing gasoline on the fire basically
1549000	1553000	And then of course Cobain's attorney
1553000	1558000	Basically saying the same thing that they want them to kind of
1558000	1562000	Relock the character so that he can only sing certain songs or something like that
1562000	1564000	Which I can tell you right now is not going to happen
1564000	1567000	It's not going to happen because Guitar Hero 5 is out on the Wii right?
1567000	1570000	Whoops! We can't patch games on the Wii
1570000	1572000	You're fucked
1572000	1575000	So it's just not going to happen
1575000	1580000	They said that they, you know, of course they know that they signed the agreement
1580000	1582000	But they didn't know that he was going to be used in that way
1582000	1584000	That kind of thing
1584000	1586000	This says it all right here
1586000	1588000	Exactly where this whole thing is coming from
1588000	1591000	They signed the agreement but didn't know that it was going to be used in that way
1591000	1594000	And here's the thing, I'm sorry, go ahead
1594000	1596000	Because I have a rant on this
1596000	1598000	I think that's actually it
1598000	1600000	Good
1600000	1602000	Here's the thing
1602000	1604000	Obviously there's multiple sides to every story
1604000	1606000	But having covered this crap as long as we have
1606000	1608000	You know, I think, I think
1608000	1610000	I have a pretty good idea what's going on here
1610000	1612000	And I'm probably wrong and I'm pulling this out of my ass
1612000	1614000	It's complete speculation
1614000	1615000	But here's my thought
1615000	1619000	When this was shown to the people that it needed to be shown to
1619000	1622000	They didn't show the clip of Kurt Cobain doing Flavor Flav
1622000	1626000	They didn't say anything about Kurt Cobain being an unlockable character in the game
1626000	1631000	They probably showed clips of Kurt Cobain doing the actual Nirvana songs
1631000	1634000	And then, you know, the proper signatures were obtained or what have you
1634000	1638000	Although I hear that Courtney Love, like, she signed it then she resisted it
1638000	1640000	You know, even before this
1640000	1642000	That she didn't want to approve the likeness of the character and all this other stuff
1642000	1645000	So she was, she was kind of resistant to the whole thing to begin with
1645000	1648000	I don't know how much ultimate control she has over his likeness or what have you
1648000	1650000	But here's what it boils down to
1650000	1653000	You cash the check, it's done
1653000	1660000	You know, whether this was not an intended purpose of his likeness when they signed off on it
1660000	1664000	They probably should have thought about that a little harder or read the fine print
1664000	1668000	Because obviously they saw him being used in the Nirvana things
1668000	1671000	And that's probably the footage that Activision showed to them
1671000	1672000	Oh yeah
1672000	1675000	But didn't realize when they signed the contract that he was also going to be a character
1675000	1678000	Just like Slash was in Guitar Hero 3
1678000	1680000	Just like, you know, and so forth these other characters
1680000	1682000	Just like Johnny Cash is
1682000	1686000	I mean Johnny Cash can very well do the Flavor Flav stuff in this game as well
1686000	1694000	I mean, it's, it's, it's just, you know, a model of a person being thrown on top of these
1694000	1700000	You know, motion capture data that they basically collected for these different songs
1700000	1702000	Going to chat.orangelandradio.com and reading comments
1702000	1706000	Dark Tetsuya says, I could understand him having a problem with him singing stuff from other artists
1706000	1710000	I don't see why they couldn't just lock him to only the Nirvana stuff
1710000	1712000	See, well A, there's two things to that
1712000	1715000	A, you can't patch games on the Wii and you can't patch games on the Playstation 2
1715000	1717000	So, it's, it's done
1717000	1721000	I mean, they could recall the game, but what's the point, honestly
1721000	1724000	In my opinion, B, the damage is done
1724000	1727000	The YouTubes are out there and it's done
1727000	1731000	And even if they were to recall the game, people aren't going to send it back because they think this shit is funny
1731000	1732000	So
1732000	1734000	Exactly, I thought it was funny
1734000	1736000	Exactly, I kind of think it's funny too
1736000	1740000	I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I guess I am
1740000	1743000	You're putting him in a video game, what do you expect?
1743000	1745000	I mean, this isn't, this is Guitar Hero
1745000	1751000	I mean, if you want respectful treatment of artists, you need to go to Rock Band, I'm sorry
1751000	1753000	Burn
1753000	1757000	Does Rock Band really, they don't have artist's likeness in the games, do they?
1757000	1760000	No, they don't, except for the Beatles Rock Band, but that's the way you do it
1760000	1764000	But I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, God, it's Guitar Hero
1764000	1769000	I mean, get over it people, if you don't like his likeness in the game, don't buy the game
1769000	1771000	There you go
1771000	1774000	Or if you bought the game and it's too late, return it
1774000	1778000	At the same time, isn't it just a game?
1778000	1782000	Isn't this just a type of artistic impression?
1782000	1789000	I mean, what's to stop me from going on YouTube and making a sock puppet effigy of Kurt Cobain
1789000	1794000	Singing whatever songs I want, and then pretending to have that sock puppet effigy
1794000	1797000	Put a shotgun in his mouth and do away with himself
1797000	1799000	Is it in bad taste? Yes
1799000	1802000	But can Courtney Love really sue me over that? No, because it's art
1802000	1804000	And I can kinda do whatever the fuck I want
1804000	1807000	Well, keep in mind though, her perspective too
1807000	1810000	She is his widow
1810000	1818000	And that's gonna put a different emotional push on it for her than it would for anyone else
1818000	1821000	And why in the hell did she ever allow this in the first place?
1821000	1822000	Because she's stupid
1822000	1827000	If she's that passionate about it, why did she ever sign off to his likeness being in the game in the first place?
1827000	1830000	And B, why wasn't everybody more educated on what was going on?
1830000	1834000	I mean, you know, the Beatles were involved with Beatles Rock Band like the whole way through
1834000	1840000	Why didn't at some point someone send Courtney the game or send the lawyers the game and say
1840000	1844000	Here it is, here's your final review copy before we send it out
1844000	1847000	If you have a problem, speak now or forever hold your peace
1847000	1853000	I mean, in my opinion, before I signed, that's what I would have wanted to see
1853000	1855000	But I have a feeling that it didn't happen
1855000	1857000	So, I don't know
1857000	1861000	As your edge in the chat says, you should do that
1861000	1863000	I'm not gonna do that, that's kinda, that's like
1863000	1868000	Look, I may not be the biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but that is extremely disrespectful
1868000	1871000	What I just suggested doing and I'm not gonna do it
1871000	1873000	That's time out of my day that I don't want to
1873000	1875000	Exactly, I could be playing WoW, come on
1875000	1877000	I'm not gonna make a mess
1877000	1880000	Hey, do you know how much red corn syrup that would take?
1880000	1883000	At least, at least it's not Revolution X, okay?
1883000	1885000	I mean, they could have had it worse
1887000	1890000	Frisbee says, even if it's not art, lol, freedom of speech
1890000	1892000	You know, I suppose the difference though is
1892000	1896000	That if I were to make that whole YouTube as disrespectful as it might be
1896000	1898000	I'm not charging for it and I'm not making money off of it
1898000	1901000	And that's probably the big difference is that, you know
1901000	1903000	Activision makes a ton of money off Guitar Hero
1903000	1906000	No offense, I'm sorry, but I can't see people going
1906000	1909000	Oh my god, Kurt Cobain's in this game, I must buy it
1909000	1912000	I don't think so, I mean
1912000	1916000	I'm sure maybe there is one or two, but I mean, come on
1916000	1919000	I don't think people are gonna buy a game just because an artist is in it
1919000	1923000	Unless it's like the Beatles rock band where it's all about the artist
1923000	1926000	Oh yeah, yeah, I can understand like if it was, you know
1926000	1927000	Guitar Hero Navar
1927000	1930000	Or even the Metallica Guitar Hero, the Van Halen
1930000	1934000	There are gonna be people, as much as we've kind of made fun of Van Halen Guitar Hero
1934000	1938000	There's gonna be people that really want that because they're just diehard Van Halen fans
1938000	1940000	You know, I get that
1940000	1941000	Yes ma'am
1941000	1943000	We need Van Hagar
1943000	1945000	Different topic altogether
1945000	1951000	Alright, GS68 in chat says, Kurt Cobain confirmed for Super Smash Brothers 4
1951000	1953000	How about Silent Hill?
1953000	1955000	Now that's bad taste
1955000	1962000	Salacious Pop says, when he finds his way into Space Channel 5-3, I'll be impressed
1962000	1966000	It wouldn't be funny if she just didn't realize
1966000	1970000	I would like to see people make YouTubes of Kurt Cobain in other video games now
1970000	1975000	Like this should become the new meme or whatever you wanna call it that's out there
1975000	1980000	Somebody should do that, put Kurt Cobain's face on Ulala's head and have him doing the choo choo
1980000	1989000	Or would it be funny though if she accidentally signed off on his appearance being in any Activision game
1989000	1997000	Like Call of Duty or some Madagascar game
1997000	2001000	The other thing to consider too is how intoxicated was she when she signed
2001000	2003000	Because now
2003000	2006000	Well I'm sorry, that's her own fucking fault then
2006000	2010000	If she can prove though that she was sufficiently drunk enough or intoxicated enough
2010000	2015000	Then it actually could be considered null and void under federal business law
2015000	2016000	You have got to be kidding me
2016000	2018000	Even if witnesses signed it too
2018000	2020000	I took business law
2020000	2024000	Why should that be an excuse? Sober the fuck up before you sign something
2024000	2027000	The same thing applies to weddings too
2027000	2029000	Like I was too drunk to marry him?
2029000	2030000	Well no like
2030000	2033000	Isn't that why the annulment process is there? Like if you change your mind
2033000	2034000	That's what annulments are for
2034000	2035000	But it's the same thing
2035000	2039000	There's a big fucking difference though between a wedding and a likeness in a video game
2039000	2044000	But it's still considered business contract
2044000	2045000	I don't know
2045000	2047000	I just think if you're high you shouldn't sign things
2047000	2048000	Call me crazy
2048000	2050000	Well they shouldn't have got her to sign it
2050000	2052000	But you know she can say
2052000	2054000	Hey I was really drunk at the time then
2054000	2056000	And who wouldn't believe her
2056000	2060000	Then there is cause to take it to court
2060000	2062000	I don't know if she'd be smart enough to realize that
2062000	2064000	You wouldn't be able to prove that
2064000	2065000	Maybe
2065000	2069000	Salacious pop and chat says it is not legal to enter contract with an impaired person
2069000	2071000	Then how did they ever get her to sign?
2071000	2073000	Ever
2073000	2076000	Hey she's drunk let's get her to sign
2076000	2078000	I mean isn't there
2078000	2080000	Surely
2080000	2081000	I don't know
2081000	2082000	I'm thinking does she have soul
2082000	2083000	We can't tell the difference
2083000	2086000	Does she have soul power of an attorney over everything?
2086000	2088000	Probably
2088000	2089000	She probably does huh
2089000	2091000	There wouldn't be like a lawyer involved or anybody else that signs off right
2091000	2093000	I think she was a full executor wasn't she
2093000	2095000	And I don't think their daughter is 18 yet
2095000	2096000	No
2096000	2097000	So no
2097000	2099000	Although she's an attractive young lady I don't know if you've seen pictures of her
2099000	2101000	She's you know aging very well
2101000	2103000	Got stuck after her dad
2103000	2107000	Alright anyhow sorry we're talking a bit too much about this
2107000	2109000	And I think everybody's got their thoughts out on this
2109000	2113000	But yeah I honestly I don't think there's anything that can be done
2113000	2114000	I think the stink is out there
2114000	2116000	I don't think her lawsuit is going to hold much weight
2116000	2119000	Unless maybe Dark Soccer is on to something honestly
2119000	2123000	It could be very interesting if that is the defense that comes up in court
2123000	2127000	Is that she was too high to sign the document
2127000	2129000	She's a drugged up bitch
2129000	2132000	Clearly she can't enter into any contract
2132000	2136000	Which makes me wonder
2136000	2138000	That might violate other terms though
2138000	2141000	Because doesn't she have some sort of custody term with her daughter
2141000	2143000	For having to be clean or something
2143000	2144000	Oh maybe
2144000	2145000	Oh that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it
2145000	2146000	So then she couldn't say
2146000	2147000	Ah her answer ties
2147000	2148000	I'm fucked up
2148000	2151000	You know what I'm placing my bet on out of court settlement
2151000	2153000	That's the way these things always end up
2153000	2155000	Out of court settlement more money
2155000	2157000	Frisbee says zombies ate my cart
2157000	2159000	Alright shush
2159000	2161000	Let's move on to some more news
2161000	2163000	And talk about zombies of a different sort
2163000	2166000	And the type of zombies that are in Left 4 Dead 2
2166000	2169000	Now you know we've been talking about the boycotts of Left 4 Dead 2
2169000	2171000	I know we've talked about it previously on this show
2171000	2173000	About how there was this you know thing out there
2173000	2174000	Where all these people were signing it
2174000	2177000	Wah wah wah you shouldn't be making Left 4 Dead 2
2177000	2179000	Because you haven't supported Left 4 Dead 1 enough
2179000	2183000	And I think the agreement among us here in studio was
2183000	2184000	Get over it
2184000	2189000	Because you know tons of games are re-released every year
2189000	2191000	With different types of skins and everything
2191000	2194000	And you don't see hundreds of thousands of people bitching about that
2194000	2197000	And Valve's done a pretty good job supporting Left 4 Dead 1
2197000	2198000	As it is
2198000	2199000	Like those
2199000	2201000	They got a heck of a lot more support
2201000	2203000	Than I think people do for their maddens
2203000	2205000	For their DDR's
2205000	2207000	For their what other games do they re-release every year
2207000	2210000	You know those are two of the big ones I can think of
2210000	2211000	But you know what I mean right
2211000	2213000	Guitar Heroes
2213000	2214000	And so forth
2214000	2215000	Okay
2215000	2218000	Well here's an interesting tactic by Valve
2218000	2219000	I actually have to hand it to them
2219000	2223000	They actually invited the two Steam users who started the boycott
2223000	2227000	Their online names are Walking Target and Agent of Chaos
2227000	2229000	Right after the game was announced at E3 2009
2229000	2233000	They invited these guys to Valve's offices to play the game
2233000	2235000	Interview members of the development team
2235000	2238000	Now the interesting thing is that the resolution of this
2238000	2241000	Is that these two guys say they're going to continue boycotting the upcoming title
2241000	2243000	But at the same time
2243000	2246000	Reported that the game seemed balanced and tight
2246000	2248000	And did not feel like a rush jobs
2248000	2250000	Now of course
2250000	2253000	The people that all signed this petition
2253000	2254000	There's a lot of them saying
2254000	2255000	It's corrupt
2255000	2256000	You guys are corrupt
2256000	2258000	And now you guys should step down
2258000	2260000	You should no longer be admins of this
2260000	2264000	And the guys that went say
2264000	2266000	Hey what we did
2266000	2269000	We did way more than most people thought we'd get done
2269000	2274000	Meaning they have only over 40,000 members in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group on Steam
2274000	2282000	And they are still demanding that Valve release this as a low cost expansion pack to the original Left 4 Dead
2282000	2284000	Is what the community is bitching for
2284000	2290000	What I think, I really don't think that it's in any way kind of selling out
2290000	2293000	It's that Valve offered an olive branch
2293000	2296000	Yeah, I don't think these guys sold out
2296000	2298000	By any means
2298000	2302000	I think that they out of
2302000	2306000	I actually think it's a very mature thing that they did
2306000	2309000	Going, you know, humoring them
2309000	2312000	Looking at it, you know, trying to see if maybe
2312000	2315000	They were justified or not, you know what I mean?
2315000	2317000	But doesn't that strike you as weird that on one hand they're saying
2317000	2319000	We're going to continue the boycott
2319000	2320000	And on the other hand they're saying
2320000	2323000	But the game doesn't feel rushed, it does feel pretty complete
2323000	2325000	Like, don't you get the sense that they're only continuing the boycott
2325000	2327000	Because they don't want to have that percent
2327000	2330000	Like, imagine they come home and drop the boycott
2330000	2331000	Like, what's that going to make them look like?
2331000	2334000	It's going to make it look like their silence was bought, right?
2334000	2335000	No
2335000	2337000	Don't you wonder if that's coming into play
2337000	2341000	That they just don't want their integrity questioned?
2341000	2344000	See, if they came out and said
2344000	2346000	We played the game
2346000	2350000	And, you know, we'd like to retract our position
2350000	2352000	Everything that we complained about
2352000	2354000	We were wrong
2354000	2358000	I think that is bigger balls and shows more integrity
2358000	2364000	But have they provided a reason that they're still going to continue their boycott?
2364000	2367000	Do they say it still doesn't feel like a sequel?
2367000	2369000	You know
2369000	2372000	To be fair, I'm reading this off of another news release
2372000	2376000	So I don't have their full statement on whatever it is they went and visited
2376000	2379000	We need to wait to see if they say why they're continuing
2379000	2380000	Let me see if I can find that
2380000	2383000	Or chatters, feel free to help out if you have a link to something that they said
2383000	2385000	It's just a safe face on their part
2385000	2386000	That's all it really is
2386000	2388000	Because, like you said, if they came back and said
2388000	2391000	Oh, the game's awesome, you know, we should drop our boycott
2391000	2395000	Then, you know, 39,998 people would go
2395000	2397000	You're fucking retarded
2397000	2399000	Here's another quote from them I found on another news source
2399000	2404000	What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question
2404000	2406000	And it will only get better
2406000	2411000	But they will continue the boycott until their, quote, individual concerns are addressed
2411000	2413000	Which, you know, I don't
2413000	2414000	Big fat paycheck
2414000	2416000	No, I don't think it has anything to do with that
2416000	2424000	I think, again, it's that they've dug themselves in too deep in this boycott now
2424000	2427000	I don't think Valve was under any obligation to do what they did
2427000	2429000	I think that was actually kind of nice of Valve
2429000	2431000	And sets kind of a sad precedence
2431000	2433000	Is that if you bitch enough about something they'll fly you out to fix it
2433000	2435000	It almost kind of makes me go
2435000	2436000	Hmm, where do I want to travel
2436000	2438000	Oh, I would like to kind of go to Boston
2438000	2440000	Hey, Beatles Rock Band blows
2440000	2443000	And it was released way too soon after Rock Band 2
2443000	2445000	And you know they're going to release Rock Band 3
2445000	2449000	You know what, Rock Band 3 needs to be an expansion to Rock Band 2
2449000	2451000	A cheap upgrade
2451000	2453000	Yeah, that's right, I said it
2453000	2455000	Come sign my petition
2455000	2457000	Yeah, free trip to Boston, yeah
2459000	2461000	I'm just worried about the precedent that sets
2461000	2463000	But, again, I'm not blaming Valve
2463000	2465000	It was very cool of them
2465000	2467000	Well, but this has been a very big thing
2467000	2469000	They've got a big gathering
2469000	2471000	Like, you may have people go
2471000	2473000	If you had like a hundred people or so
2473000	2475000	That would be big enough
2475000	2479000	But they've got, you know, in the tens of thousands
2479000	2481000	You know, they've got a big following
2481000	2486000	TheRobDeeInChat, chat.orangelandradio.com says
2486000	2488000	The gamers who support this boycott in the first place
2488000	2490000	Have way too large of a sense of entitlement
2490000	2493000	I almost kind of think that hits the nail on the head
2493000	2495000	If these guys feel that strongly about it
2495000	2497000	You know, and I realize we've debated this topic to death on the show
2497000	2499000	And I really don't want to rehash the whole damn thing
2499000	2502000	But if you really feel that strongly about it
2502000	2505000	The best message you could send is don't buy it
2505000	2507000	Honestly, at the end of the day
2507000	2509000	No petition you sign or anything like that
2509000	2511000	Is going to have the impact that your wallet has
2511000	2513000	At the store
2513000	2515000	So there it is
2517000	2519000	And let's see
2519000	2521000	GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 exists
2521000	2523000	Because what Valve wants to do requires a sequel
2523000	2525000	SalaciousPop says
2525000	2527000	Valve has already done a ton of stuff
2527000	2529000	That is anthema to pretty much every other developer
2529000	2531000	Anathema
2531000	2533000	Using big words in my chat
2533000	2535000	How dare you, I'm just kidding
2535000	2537000	By the way, there was a somewhat related story
2537000	2539000	Going on
2539000	2541000	Where I guess there's a campaign
2541000	2543000	Going on to fly the
2543000	2545000	Valve boss
2545000	2547000	Gabe Newell over to Australia
2547000	2549000	To actually look at a
2549000	2551000	Left 4 Dead campaign
2551000	2553000	That was made called Shotgun Sunrise
2553000	2555000	It's a custom campaign
2555000	2557000	That he basically
2557000	2559000	Wanna fly the guy out there
2559000	2561000	To release this
2561000	2563000	They raised $3,000
2563000	2565000	In donations
2565000	2567000	And
2567000	2569000	I don't know how they raised all that money
2569000	2571000	Just trying to get this guy to fly out there
2571000	2573000	And look at this expansion or whatever
2573000	2575000	I think he actually made like a quote
2575000	2577000	Kind of tongue in cheek that
2577000	2579000	Oh well I'll go look at it if they fly me out there
2579000	2581000	And they actually raised the money
2581000	2583000	But now he's kind of backing down or whatever
2583000	2585000	So
2585000	2587000	Hopefully they donate the money somewhere
2587000	2589000	Or something
2589000	2591000	I just
2591000	2593000	But again it kind of goes back
2593000	2595000	To that entitlement thing
2595000	2597000	Okay yay for you you made a mod and spent a lot of time
2597000	2599000	Making the mod but why did you
2599000	2601000	Do that? Did you feel entitled
2601000	2603000	To the fact that Valve should release that as an
2603000	2605000	Official expansion? I mean
2605000	2607000	You know
2607000	2609000	Don't mod if you're not gonna be
2609000	2611000	Content with getting nothing
2611000	2613000	For what you did
2613000	2615000	That's what I don't understand
2615000	2617000	So
2617000	2619000	People suck
2619000	2621000	I don't know I think the Left 4 Dead community
2621000	2623000	Some of them
2623000	2625000	I think they should be happy
2625000	2627000	Where they're being angry
2627000	2629000	I think that's a waste of money
2629000	2631000	What? Well I mean I can understand
2631000	2633000	If you feel passionately enough about something
2633000	2635000	Especially if you put a whole lot of work into it
2635000	2637000	And you have enough other people that
2637000	2639000	Enjoy your work that they're willing to
2639000	2641000	Contribute to that yeah
2641000	2643000	But in the end it's a game
2643000	2645000	You know why not
2645000	2647000	Save that three thousand dollars for
2647000	2649000	You know people who need it
2649000	2651000	Aren't we in a global recession?
2651000	2653000	God damn they raised that much
2653000	2655000	Money over this
2655000	2657000	I'm just kind of surprised
2657000	2659000	You know that could go into an
2659000	2661000	Arcade cabinet
2661000	2663000	Shush
2663000	2665000	The Rob D in chat
2665000	2667000	Says I would love love
2667000	2669000	For Valve to cancel Left 4 Dead 2
2669000	2671000	Just to see how they would react
2671000	2673000	I don't think that's gonna happen and I don't think
2673000	2675000	You should let a few bad apples spoil the barrels
2675000	2677000	So to speak
2677000	2679000	I don't see how this is different from
2679000	2681000	The sports games that come out every year
2681000	2683000	And the DDR's and music
2683000	2685000	Games that get re-released every year
2685000	2687000	That people buy
2687000	2689000	I don't see how this is that much different except it actually
2689000	2691000	Sounds like Valve is doing more
2691000	2693000	Than what a lot of these other games that come out every year
2693000	2695000	Do it actually sounds like there's more to it
2695000	2697000	So
2697000	2699000	I don't know I think they should be happy
2699000	2701000	I think some people just need to
2701000	2703000	Get over themselves
2703000	2705000	Well guess what came out for
2705000	2707000	iPhone
2707000	2709000	Commodore 64 emulator
2709000	2711000	Isn't that great?
2711000	2713000	Awesome where can I download it?
2713000	2715000	You can't
2715000	2717000	Because they have found
2717000	2719000	Problems that will be problems
2719000	2721000	For Apple actually
2721000	2723000	Yeah there were
2723000	2725000	Ways to access
2725000	2727000	Basic programming
2727000	2729000	Like the language basic
2729000	2731000	And so Apple's like ah no
2731000	2733000	And stopped it
2733000	2735000	Because you can't release
2735000	2737000	An application that programs
2737000	2739000	Or something like that like you can't
2739000	2741000	Have an application on the iPhone that can program
2741000	2743000	The iPhone to do anything
2743000	2745000	You want all they have to do is
2745000	2747000	Edit the
2747000	2749000	The emulator just to
2749000	2751000	Disinclude the basic
2751000	2753000	What's funny is I think people
2753000	2755000	Are going to constantly find ways to
2755000	2757000	Get to basic you know because obviously
2757000	2759000	They figured out a way to abort the game somehow
2759000	2761000	And get into basic so I would think
2761000	2763000	They're going to keep doing this somehow but
2763000	2765000	I guess if they patched this to keep Apple happy
2765000	2767000	Then that's kind of cool because
2767000	2769000	I grew up on the Commodore 64
2769000	2771000	Okay that was my gaming system
2771000	2773000	Until our family had an NES
2773000	2775000	That was my gaming system from ages like 5 to 10
2775000	2777000	So you know
2777000	2779000	I would love to relive some of those games
2779000	2781000	For my youth but
2781000	2783000	Well it's been resubmitted
2783000	2785000	So we'll see if it hangs around
2785000	2787000	That would be
2787000	2789000	Kind of cool
2789000	2791000	I wonder though if the games that are being released
2791000	2793000	On this emulator are legal
2793000	2795000	Like I know they say that
2795000	2797000	They have kind of like this mix of games
2797000	2799000	Is the guy getting permission from these companies
2799000	2801000	Or does he have to? Maybe copyright
2801000	2803000	Laws are up because it's been about
2803000	2805000	25 years since most of these games
2805000	2807000	Were released what like 84 yeah about 25 years
2807000	2809000	Since most of these games came out maybe
2809000	2811000	Copyright law comes into play if none of these companies
2811000	2813000	It's only a handful of ROMs that are actually licensed
2813000	2815000	The ones that came out were Dragons
2815000	2817000	Den, Limons, Jupiter
2817000	2819000	Lander, Arctic Shipwreck and Jack Attack
2819000	2821000	Okay Limons I recognize
2821000	2823000	As an official Commodore title that was one of the
2823000	2825000	Games that was put out by Commodore
2825000	2827000	So I'm wondering if and I don't know if
2827000	2829000	All of these fit in that same car I actually
2829000	2831000	You know why? I actually owned Limons
2831000	2833000	It was one of the few paddle games that you had
2833000	2835000	You played this little car and you held the little
2835000	2837000	It was actually one of my favorite games to play
2837000	2839000	You held down the little fire button to drive
2839000	2841000	And you turned the paddle back and forth
2841000	2843000	To kind of move back and forth on the track
2843000	2845000	It was a lot of fun you had to avoid other cars
2845000	2847000	And you could race forever
2847000	2849000	That would be even though that's the type of game
2849000	2851000	I think would throw me for five minutes
2851000	2853000	Now like hours I played
2853000	2855000	This game as a kid but it was
2855000	2857000	Like I guess you could call it a first party
2857000	2859000	Or whatever it was actually put out by Commodore
2859000	2861000	So I'm wondering if all these games don't have
2861000	2863000	Commodore's sort of blessing or what's
2863000	2865000	Going on so
2865000	2867000	Frisbee in chat says
2867000	2869000	Dear Apple what about some
2869000	2871000	Open source on the iPhone
2871000	2873000	I just don't think
2873000	2875000	You're going to see that happen because what they're
2875000	2877000	Probably worried about is
2877000	2879000	People getting into the phone aspect of it
2879000	2881000	Using all these programming
2881000	2883000	You know hacking it so that the phones
2883000	2885000	Get open and suddenly you can make
2885000	2887000	Phone calls without having to pay for it and so on
2887000	2889000	Like I just think they're really worried about how
2889000	2891000	Far you can hack these devices
2891000	2893000	GS68 says I want to see
2893000	2895000	MSX games on the iPhone dammit
2895000	2897000	Oh wait Americans don't care about
2897000	2899000	MSX I'd like to see the
2899000	2901000	Original Metal Gear Solid
2901000	2903000	The original Metal Gear for one
2903000	2905000	Before it was Nintendo-fied
2905000	2907000	And the original Metal Gear 2
2907000	2909000	And I wouldn't mind seeing
2909000	2911000	Gardic but the problem is who's
2911000	2913000	Going to translate those
2913000	2915000	Fans!
2915000	2917000	Better learn how to speak Japanese
2917000	2919000	Something like that
2919000	2921000	Coming to the PSP is yet another firmware
2921000	2923000	Of course why not
2923000	2925000	They have plenty of other firmwares
2925000	2927000	Like all the other firmwares
2927000	2929000	It's been cracked already
2929000	2931000	Which is really important
2931000	2933000	But what this firmware does
2933000	2935000	Hint at though is
2935000	2937000	Some things that possibly will be coming out
2937000	2939000	Later on including game rentals
2939000	2941000	Apparently
2941000	2943000	As part of the change log
2943000	2945000	They have ways that you can
2945000	2947000	Now group different folders
2947000	2949000	It says games now can be grouped
2949000	2951000	And displayed in folders based on their
2951000	2953000	Expire dates under game
2953000	2955000	So that means that there's
2955000	2957000	Going to be some sort of trials or something
2957000	2959000	That will expire after a certain amount of time
2959000	2961000	And then of course
2961000	2963000	Some other stuff
2963000	2965000	They changed settings
2965000	2967000	Network updates have been changed
2967000	2969000	To system updates
2969000	2971000	The number of colors that can be selected
2971000	2973000	Under settings has been increased
2973000	2975000	And revisions to strengthen
2975000	2977000	Security of course
2977000	2979000	With the internet browser
2979000	2981000	And
2981000	2983000	The other
2983000	2985000	Of course
2985000	2987000	Before they already have support now for
2987000	2989000	Video rentals so maybe
2989000	2991000	Now they're going to do it with games
2991000	2993000	I think it has to be something big like that
2993000	2995000	Because what else justifies the
2995000	2997000	6.0 I mean it's not like
2997000	2999000	5.3 or 5.0
2999000	3001000	Like this is a major release
3001000	3003000	Or they wouldn't call it 6.0
3003000	3005000	It's the PSP Go because it's coming out in like 2 weeks
3005000	3007000	Oh that makes sense too
3007000	3009000	Fair enough
3009000	3011000	Do you think though that game rentals is something
3011000	3013000	It's nothing I ever thought of before
3013000	3015000	But then when I thought oh my gosh
3015000	3017000	Like companies get mad
3017000	3019000	At the game rental industry
3019000	3021000	Because they don't see any of those profits
3021000	3023000	But this would
3023000	3025000	Let them get a chunk of those profits
3025000	3027000	Where the rentals are happening
3027000	3029000	And Sony gets a good chunk of that too
3029000	3031000	Because they're endorsing the service
3031000	3033000	And they kind of can put the rental thing
3033000	3035000	Out of business
3035000	3037000	It's not going to happen right away or for a long time
3037000	3039000	I mean this could be something huge
3039000	3041000	That we're looking down the barrel of
3041000	3043000	I mean really it's not going to cut into rental business
3043000	3045000	Because most rental stores
3045000	3047000	I mean you know how bad
3047000	3049000	The PSP is doing I mean it's hardly
3049000	3051000	Selling anything there's not a lot of good games
3051000	3053000	Out for it most stores do not
3053000	3055000	Bring in PSP as a rental
3055000	3057000	Category
3057000	3059000	Okay but only a matter of time then
3059000	3061000	Before it's on Playstation 3
3061000	3063000	Although those games are ginormous
3063000	3065000	I don't know the feasibility
3065000	3067000	Of that but
3067000	3069000	We're years away
3069000	3071000	From that being possible
3071000	3073000	I mean technology gets better data moves faster
3073000	3075000	We're five years away from
3075000	3077000	A PS3 game being
3077000	3079000	Downloadable as fast as
3079000	3081000	Super Nintendo ROM is these days
3081000	3083000	Yeah but in five years it's going to be a Playstation 4
3083000	3085000	And no one's going to give a crap
3085000	3087000	About Playstation 3 titles that are downloadable
3087000	3089000	Just like Playstation 1 titles
3089000	3091000	That come out now
3091000	3093000	Yeah that's kind of cool that they're re-releasing them again
3093000	3095000	But really is it such a big deal
3095000	3097000	I mean is it even something that you would go rent
3097000	3099000	I mean especially when the titles are like
3099000	3101000	Ten bucks
3101000	3103000	What are they going to charge for rentals? Two dollars?
3103000	3105000	I mean it's just it's not really
3105000	3107000	Cost beneficial
3107000	3109000	To actually rent a title
3109000	3111000	Frisbee in chat says there's already game rentals
3111000	3113000	It's called DRM
3113000	3115000	I'm not sure I quite understand that comment
3115000	3117000	Is that like a dig on the fact that
3117000	3119000	When you download things you can't share it with other people
3119000	3121000	And all that I don't know
3121000	3123000	Or I was thinking that the comment was going to say
3123000	3125000	It's called demos is kind of a way of
3125000	3127000	Doing it and seeing if you like it
3127000	3129000	Well that's kind of an asinine way of doing things
3129000	3131000	I mean oh
3131000	3133000	We could put out demos for free
3133000	3135000	So that you can test our products
3135000	3137000	And see if it's something that you want
3137000	3139000	But no we're going to be assholes about it
3139000	3141000	We're going to allow you to buy a demo basically
3141000	3143000	Of this game
3143000	3145000	Rent it for a little bit and decide if you want it
3145000	3147000	And that way if you don't like it
3147000	3149000	Hey we still got some of your money
3149000	3151000	But at the same time what about
3151000	3153000	We drop $60 on a game that we play for a week
3153000	3155000	I mean imagine if we could
3155000	3157000	Spend only $10
3157000	3159000	You know $9.99 to rent the game for a week
3159000	3161000	That would be
3161000	3163000	Maybe something I'd rather do for a lot of games
3163000	3165000	I would go rent them at
3165000	3167000	Like your mom and pop rental store
3167000	3169000	But they're always out
3169000	3171000	Imagine if I can go onto this digital thing
3171000	3173000	Click a button it's downloading I got it
3173000	3175000	Well good if that's an option for you
3175000	3177000	I mean that's awesome but
3177000	3179000	The thing is
3179000	3181000	I mean it's always good to have more options
3181000	3183000	To forego demos for this
3183000	3185000	You know rental stuff because
3185000	3187000	You know they feel that they can make more money
3187000	3189000	If you don't have a way to try
3189000	3191000	Out this game
3191000	3193000	Without you know paying money
3193000	3195000	I just think
3195000	3197000	Especially PSP games I think you're going to see
3197000	3199000	And you're right
3199000	3201000	I don't think PSP games are really
3201000	3203000	Rented at stores so I don't think you're going to see
3203000	3205000	This dig into the real rental market
3205000	3207000	Right now but it's about setting a precedent
3207000	3209000	You know especially with
3209000	3211000	PSP Go being digital
3211000	3213000	Download only and that they think
3213000	3215000	This thing's going to be huge although I don't think
3215000	3217000	It is Oh it's going to fail I think they're
3217000	3219000	Setting the stage for you know this whole
3219000	3221000	Rental thing that is first party and we
3221000	3223000	Haven't seen anything like it before
3223000	3225000	I think this is
3225000	3227000	A pretty big deal on what's coming
3227000	3229000	And I think probably it sounds like by the holidays
3229000	3231000	This is going to be something that's launched
3233000	3235000	Oh man PSP Go is going to be
3235000	3237000	It's going to fail so bad
3237000	3239000	Don't get me wrong I like
3239000	3241000	The PSP 3000
3241000	3243000	I just
3243000	3245000	Yeah well
3245000	3247000	I hate going over the same
3247000	3249000	But still
3249000	3251000	I mean there's other stories
3251000	3253000	I'm sure we have coming up
3253000	3255000	It's like
3255000	3257000	What exactly are you doing different with the PSP
3257000	3259000	Go other than charging me a lot more money
3259000	3261000	And not having the ability to play
3261000	3263000	UMD games I mean there's really
3263000	3265000	Nothing that's going to be exclusive to that
3265000	3267000	Maybe rentals are exclusive
3267000	3269000	To the PSP Go?
3269000	3271000	It won't be because you know why?
3271000	3273000	Because if they do it exclusive to the PSP Go
3273000	3275000	Then they lose out on all the
3275000	3277000	PSP 3000 stuff
3277000	3279000	I don't know Deathwishing in Chat says
3279000	3281000	I love renting PSP games
3281000	3283000	Renting PSP games are awesome when you go on trips
3283000	3285000	Makes sense
3285000	3287000	I mean if you're going to go on a long road trip
3287000	3289000	Why not rent a game?
3289000	3291000	They do have PSP rentals and NDS rentals
3291000	3293000	With like the
3293000	3295000	Kiosk and airports
3295000	3297000	And stuff like that you can do that
3297000	3299000	There's a place in the airport here that has
3299000	3301000	Rental thing and you drop it off in the box
3301000	3303000	Oh good I'm going to LA next week and I'm flying
3303000	3305000	Maybe I'll have to utilize that
3305000	3307000	Yeah it's actually pretty cool you rent it
3307000	3309000	Where you're
3309000	3311000	Flying out of and you can drop it off
3311000	3313000	They have one in every single airport
3313000	3315000	Major airport yeah
3315000	3317000	Alright well
3317000	3319000	Moving on to another story
3319000	3321000	We'll see what unfolds with the PSP
3321000	3323000	possible rental system a little later on
3323000	3325000	But I want to move into this because this has to do with
3325000	3327000	Copying games too but of a whole different
3327000	3329000	Sort now of course Batman
3329000	3331000	Arkham Asylum was huge it came out on
3331000	3333000	All these consoles this past week but don't
3333000	3335000	Forget it also came out on the PC
3335000	3337000	Hello there's still quite a few people
3337000	3339000	That are very into their PC gaming love it
3339000	3341000	And Batman Arkham Asylum of course was released
3341000	3343000	On the games for windows platform
3343000	3345000	So that those folks could play it there as well
3345000	3347000	But of course where there is
3347000	3349000	PC gaming there is piracy
3349000	3351000	So I guess an early version of this
3351000	3353000	Game leaked out and there was
3353000	3355000	A user that actually posted on
3355000	3357000	The official Eidos forums
3357000	3359000	With a post that went something like this that he had a
3359000	3361000	Glitch with his PC version of the game quote
3361000	3363000	I've got a problem when it's time
3363000	3365000	To use Batman's glide in the game
3365000	3367000	When I hold like it's when I
3367000	3369000	Hold the comma like it's said to to jump from one
3369000	3371000	Platform to another Batman tries
3371000	3373000	To open his wings again and again instead
3373000	3375000	Of gliding so he falls down
3375000	3377000	Into poison gas if somebody could tell
3377000	3379000	Me what should I do here and
3379000	3381000	It was actually replied to by an
3381000	3383000	Admin on the forums Keir
3383000	3385000	Responded to the thread and said the
3385000	3387000	Problem you have encountered is a hook in the copy
3387000	3389000	Protection to catch out people who
3389000	3391000	Try and download cracked versions of the game
3391000	3393000	For free it's not a bug in the games code
3393000	3395000	It's a bug in your moral code in other
3395000	3397000	Words this
3397000	3399000	Crack or this version of the game
3399000	3401000	Was put out there with this bug in it
3401000	3403000	So that when people call
3403000	3405000	Support to complain or go post on
3405000	3407000	The forums to complain or spend the time to
3407000	3409000	Download it or what have you to do it
3409000	3411000	They essentially out themselves as
3411000	3413000	Pirates isn't that entrapment
3413000	3415000	No because they're not
3415000	3417000	Really implicating them of a crime
3417000	3419000	It's just so that they have
3419000	3421000	An unplayable copy of it if they but
3421000	3423000	Here's the thing here's the funny thing about it
3423000	3425000	One they've done this before with Grand Theft Auto
3425000	3427000	If you pirated Grand Theft Auto
3427000	3429000	4 on PC they had this
3429000	3431000	Thing basically it was drunk cam all the
3431000	3433000	Time it was shaking around making it really hard
3433000	3435000	To play
3435000	3437000	And then the other thing is
3437000	3439000	This problem with Batman Arkham Asylum
3439000	3441000	Got patched within like a day
3441000	3443000	It was only effective for about a day
3443000	3445000	And then that was it
3445000	3447000	And that's what TigerClaus does in chat
3447000	3449000	As well as the glitch was later fixed
3449000	3451000	And yeah I think we're all not surprised
3451000	3453000	To hear that but
3453000	3455000	How many people do you think
3455000	3457000	Think to find the fix
3457000	3459000	Do you think that maybe
3459000	3461000	This does still defeat
3461000	3463000	A lot of pirates because they'll get the game
3463000	3465000	Play it go this sucks and delete it
3465000	3467000	Without ever thinking to look
3467000	3469000	For a patch
3469000	3471000	No maybe stupid people
3471000	3473000	That you know are
3473000	3475000	Not really normally pirating
3475000	3477000	Games but a lot of people will
3477000	3479000	Get frustrated with it and then
3479000	3481000	Like a week later they'll read on the forums
3481000	3483000	That this was intentional and then they'll re-download it again
3483000	3485000	I mean it's just like the guy that
3485000	3487000	You know had ran into this
3487000	3489000	He's not going to go oh my goodness
3489000	3491000	I can't believe they got me
3491000	3493000	Well I'm just going to buy games from now on
3493000	3495000	No he's just going to go and re-download the game
3495000	3497000	When it's been patched or fixed
3497000	3499000	Wait for someone smart to do it
3499000	3501000	And that's what's going to happen
3501000	3503000	If they have no intention of purchasing the game
3503000	3505000	They're not going to purchase the game
3505000	3507000	El Non Hombre Hombre
3507000	3509000	In our chat room says
3509000	3511000	No it's not entrapment because they're
3511000	3513000	A. Not law enforcement and
3513000	3515000	B. They aren't asking them to pirate
3515000	3517000	Well I meant that
3517000	3519000	I thought that they had called the police on them
3519000	3521000	No it looks like they just banned
3521000	3523000	This guy from their forums or what have you
3523000	3525000	Well to be fair
3525000	3527000	Couldn't they report it?
3527000	3529000	They could report it but
3529000	3531000	They sort of set him up
3531000	3533000	I don't know I'm kind of reminded of
3533000	3535000	And this is going to make me sound super gay
3535000	3537000	But Madonna
3537000	3539000	When one of her albums was leaked to the internet
3539000	3541000	It was actually something Madonna's record label
3541000	3543000	Released themselves and it would
3543000	3545000	Start the song and you would hear like the first
3545000	3547000	15 seconds and then you would hear Madonna's
3547000	3549000	Voice come on and go what the fuck are you
3549000	3551000	Doing?
3551000	3553000	So she basically put out all these
3553000	3555000	Bogus MP3's that started off like the real
3555000	3557000	Thing and then would just cut off and it would be her
3557000	3559000	Going what the fuck are you doing?
3559000	3561000	I'm kind of reminded
3561000	3563000	Of that this is essentially the
3563000	3565000	Video game equivalent
3565000	3567000	Of that except the game doesn't taunt
3567000	3569000	You well
3569000	3571000	It taunts you without directly taunting
3571000	3573000	You if that makes sense
3573000	3575000	I don't know if entrapment
3575000	3577000	Would be the word I would use though
3577000	3579000	Yeah that wasn't quite what I was thinking
3579000	3581000	I don't know what legal
3581000	3583000	Recourse they could seek with this
3583000	3585000	Because
3585000	3587000	I certainly think it's a
3587000	3589000	Good way to out the people that
3589000	3591000	Aren't supporting them
3591000	3593000	To go so far it's pretty bold to download a
3593000	3595000	Pirated copy of the game and post on the forums
3595000	3597000	About it that is kind of a stupid
3597000	3599000	Thing to do in my opinion
3599000	3601000	Is that if you're gonna
3601000	3603000	Steal but I don't think that they had
3603000	3605000	Any way of knowing that it was an intentional
3605000	3607000	Glitch
3607000	3609000	Salacious pop in chat
3609000	3611000	Says that it would defer anyone
3611000	3613000	Even the idiot makes it worth
3613000	3615000	It in my opinion I kind of tend to agree
3615000	3617000	With that statement because
3617000	3619000	You know even if it took a day
3619000	3621000	For that patch to came out
3621000	3623000	That patch to come out that fixed it
3623000	3625000	That was still one day
3625000	3627000	Where you might have some of these pirates get fed up with
3627000	3629000	Waiting and go I'm just gonna buy it
3629000	3631000	It looked cool enough from what I saw
3631000	3633000	I'm just gonna buy it
3633000	3635000	And even if that drove sales it did curb
3635000	3637000	A low percentage of the piracy
3637000	3639000	And had more of an impact than not doing anything at all
3639000	3641000	Sure
3641000	3643000	I guess
3643000	3645000	Alright
3645000	3647000	The Rob D in chat says the best part would be
3647000	3649000	If the game crashed before the final boss
3649000	3651000	That would be the best middle finger to the pirates
3651000	3653000	I think that Rob D
3653000	3655000	Yeah but the problem with things like Earthbound
3655000	3657000	Is one thing but I think the problem with what Rob D
3657000	3659000	Is suggesting as funny and clever as that is
3659000	3661000	I think that most people
3661000	3663000	Would say at that point I played enough of the game
3663000	3665000	Forget it I mean I love the Earthbound
3665000	3667000	Thing we talked about a couple weeks on the show
3667000	3669000	That you know it doubled the number of monsters
3669000	3671000	And you know would crash your game
3671000	3673000	Delete the save and everything but
3673000	3675000	I think there's a lot of people that at that point would just go
3675000	3677000	Ah fuck it I don't need to worry about this game anymore
3677000	3679000	I'm gonna move on and steal something else
3679000	3681000	Also after having seen the last
3681000	3683000	Boss and ending of the game
3683000	3685000	First of all the last boss
3685000	3687000	Is actually kind of easy
3687000	3689000	Um you know Uber Joker
3689000	3691000	And uh the
3691000	3693000	Ending was uh less than a minute long
3693000	3695000	Really for Arkham Asylum?
3695000	3697000	Well
3697000	3699000	It was it was short okay
3699000	3701000	Spoiler free please but
3701000	3703000	Less than five minutes is fair but
3703000	3705000	Although I don't remember it even being that long
3705000	3707000	Wow okay fair enough
3707000	3709000	Rob D in chat says
3709000	3711000	I think that if they played that long
3711000	3713000	They would be really frustrated with the inability to finish it
3713000	3715000	Yeah to some extent but I
3715000	3717000	You know I do think
3717000	3719000	I think Eidos or you know did
3719000	3721000	Did a funny thing here because
3721000	3723000	I think people that are gonna be bold enough to steal
3723000	3725000	And then complain about their stolen game
3725000	3727000	On the official forums I think they deserve
3727000	3729000	To kind of be made a mockery of
3729000	3731000	You know what I mean? So
3731000	3733000	You know he kind of got his just desserts and I think that's
3733000	3735000	Where a lot of us are doing the Nelson here going
3735000	3737000	Ah ha
3737000	3739000	You know it's one thing to steal but it's
3739000	3741000	It's like even it's like the different
3741000	3743000	Circles of hell
3743000	3745000	Like stealing a computer game is it's
3745000	3747000	It's one of the circles of hell but it's like you know
3747000	3749000	It's just getting poked with a hot prod
3749000	3751000	But then to like go and actually complain about it
3751000	3753000	On the forums and try to blame the
3753000	3755000	Developers for their borked game
3755000	3757000	That's like eternal damnation
3757000	3759000	Come on
3759000	3761000	So alright anyhow
3761000	3763000	More news stories and we're gonna get into release dates
3763000	3765000	Dark Sakura
3765000	3767000	Let's see
3767000	3769000	Well Lucas Arts
3769000	3771000	Um is actually
3771000	3773000	Working on a new game
3773000	3775000	And now Lucas Arts
3775000	3777000	Loom 2
3777000	3779000	I wish I so wish
3779000	3781000	But this is actually kind of cool because they said that they took
3781000	3783000	Their inspiration from games that are like
3783000	3785000	Braid
3785000	3787000	And of course Braid was you know pretty freaking cool
3787000	3789000	Which by the way has gone down in price on Steam
3789000	3791000	It's on sale
3791000	3793000	Um
3793000	3795000	But it's called
3795000	3797000	Lucidity which is supposed to be an
3797000	3799000	Xbox Live arcade game
3799000	3801000	And um there's rumors of a PC
3801000	3803000	Version but they didn't say anything about that
3803000	3805000	It's a 2D side scrolling
3805000	3807000	Um
3807000	3809000	Platformer but it has puzzle elements
3809000	3811000	Um we play as a girl
3811000	3813000	Called Sophie and
3813000	3815000	She keeps moving you just have to move
3815000	3817000	Things out of her way
3817000	3819000	Kind of lemming-ish right you know
3819000	3821000	That's kind of what it sounds like to me a little bit
3821000	3823000	But I guess your
3823000	3825000	Goal is to get her from point A to point B
3825000	3827000	But is she stupid?
3827000	3829000	Like you know lemmings were stupid that was the whole point of the game
3829000	3831000	They would just keep walking right off a cliff
3831000	3833000	If they you know needed to
3833000	3835000	They said that she's like in her
3835000	3837000	Abstract dream world
3837000	3839000	So maybe she's just
3839000	3841000	Dreaming you know
3841000	3843000	Kind of out of it but the art
3843000	3845000	Style is supposed to be the cut paper
3845000	3847000	Look of a pop-up book
3847000	3849000	Oh that's kind of sounds neat
3849000	3851000	So it's going to look like an old school children's book
3851000	3853000	Hmm
3853000	3855000	She's dreaming stupid
3855000	3857000	What was the last time
3857000	3859000	We got a um
3859000	3861000	Game
3861000	3863000	From LucasArts like
3863000	3865000	It wasn't Star Wars related
3865000	3867000	Like at Indiana Jones?
3867000	3869000	Oh I didn't realize they were behind the Lego games
3869000	3871000	It is LucasArts
3871000	3873000	Oh gotcha
3873000	3875000	Well this sounds like it could be cool but um
3875000	3877000	I'll wait to see if there's a demo
3877000	3879000	Before that there was fracture
3879000	3881000	Alright so there's just games I missed
3881000	3883000	Somehow there's too many video games you can't play them all
3883000	3885000	I think that was them yeah fracture
3885000	3887000	Fracture sucks
3887000	3889000	Underachiever
3889000	3891000	I want to go back for a minute because I think this chat room
3891000	3893000	Comment bears repeating
3893000	3895000	To Arkham Asylum, Tigerclaw wanted to clarify something
3895000	3897000	On the ending of Arkham Asylum
3897000	3899000	He says Arkham Asylum continues on though
3899000	3901000	After you beat the game you can still click on
3901000	3903000	Continue story and you have free roaming
3903000	3905000	Of the entire game so you can go and find
3905000	3907000	Those Riddler trophies, the alignment
3907000	3909000	Puzzles and interview tapes
3909000	3911000	Yeah but that's just for completion
3911000	3913000	So that's not really the ending
3913000	3915000	Or to do with the story itself
3915000	3917000	That's like New Game Plus
3917000	3919000	You can go taunt Harley for a little while
3919000	3921000	Alright fair enough
3921000	3923000	Ok
3923000	3925000	Let's get into some release dates we're going to travel the globe
3925000	3927000	And talk about what's coming out in your neck of the woods
3927000	3929000	Starting off with the US, Loki
3929000	3931000	Yes this week actually quite a few things coming out
3931000	3933000	Starting off with of course
3933000	3935000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

3953000	3957000	Scribblenauts will be making its way out on DS this week
3957000	3959000	Actually I believe like a week from today

3969000	3971000	Some other crappy games on the DS

3979000	3981000	Let's see
3981000	3983000	Animal Planet Vet Life
3983000	3987000	I just want to say though I saw Commercial for Need for Speed Shift the other day
3987000	3989000	On TV and it looked pretty hot
3989000	3991000	Because it was in high def
3991000	3993000	It's like Project Gotham
3993000	3995000	Looks kind of neat
3995000	3997000	And speaking of piracy
3997000	3999000	Batman Arkham Asylum on PC
3999000	4001000	So if you're complaining about it now you don't have it yet
4001000	4003000	Liars
4003000	4005000	Bleach the Third Phantom on DS
4005000	4007000	Chicken Blaster on DS and Wii
4007000	4009000	Another movie tie-in game
4009000	4015000	Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on pretty much every system except for the Playstation 2
4015000	4017000	Heroes of the Galaxy
4017000	4021000	On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4021000	4023000	Which looks like an OK World War 2
4023000	4025000	Played some game
4025000	4029000	NHL you've got two games coming out this week
4029000	4033000	NHL 10 from EA on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4033000	4039000	And NHL 2K10 on Playstation 2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360
4039000	4043000	Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360
4043000	4049000	Red Faction Guerrilla finally making its way out on PC as well as Resident Evil 5
4049000	4051000	Time of Shadows
4051000	4055000	I didn't even know they were giving that a PC release
4055000	4057000	Time of Shadows also on PC
4057000	4063000	This week that really crappy game they played on Konami's booth at E3 this year
4063000	4067000	Tornado Outbreak formerly known as Zephyr Rise of the Elementals
4067000	4069000	On Playstation 3 Wii and Xbox 360
4069000	4073000	You remember that as kind of the tornado Katamari type of game
4073000	4077000	Toy Story Mania based off the ride and in 3D coming to the Wii
4077000	4081000	A game I ranted and raved about last week
4081000	4085000	Wet coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4085000	4091000	And then finally just thought I should mention this since we talked about them around E3
4091000	4095000	Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily
4095000	4099000	Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily
4099000	4101000	That will be coming out as well
4101000	4107000	And then finally on Xbox 360 the Q Entertainment Trilogy on Xbox 360
4107000	4115000	Qubed which features Rez, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and of course Luminous Live
4115000	4117000	And they left out 99 Nights
4117000	4119000	Well that's not Xbox Live
4119000	4121000	I know but still
4121000	4123000	And I don't think it is
4123000	4125000	Is there anything extra in this though?
4125000	4127000	You know what's funny?
4127000	4129000	Besides some of their misfires like 99 Nights
4129000	4131000	I really love Q Entertainment
4131000	4133000	Tetsuya Mizuguchi is the man
4133000	4135000	He's one of my favorites
4135000	4137000	Most of the games he puts out I love
4137000	4143000	So I'm kind of curious if there's anything extra in the collection that would make it worth getting
4143000	4145000	Probably the download content is probably in there
4145000	4149000	I'm not positive but it would make sense
4149000	4153000	Oh and how did I miss this?
4153000	4157000	Naruto Shippuden, Ninja Destiny 2
4157000	4159000	Who cares about Naruto
4159000	4161000	Going over to Japan, September 17th
4161000	4165000	Fuel, the localized version for Japan finally hits on September 17th
4165000	4167000	Also Left 4 Dead gets a price drop
4167000	4169000	It moves into the Platinum Collection
4169000	4171000	These are both on the Xbox 360
4171000	4175000	Terminator Salvation from Squeenix is putting it out over in Japan
4175000	4179000	A game called Velvet Assassin from Ubisoft makes its way to the Xbox 360
4179000	4183000	Moving on to the Playstation 3 coming out on the 17th
4183000	4185000	Also Fuel there as well
4185000	4187000	Makai Senki Disgaea 3
4187000	4191000	Appendisk, Razz Barrel, Hen Hajime Mashita
4191000	4195000	I'm assuming that is some type of extra scenario for Disgaea 3
4195000	4199000	Tales of Vesperia makes its way out on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week
4199000	4203000	And then lastly Terminator Salvation and Wet
4203000	4207000	Both on the Playstation 3 this week as well in Japan on the 17th
4207000	4210000	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, checking out the games there
4210000	4215000	Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean comes out from Nintendo in Japan this week
4215000	4219000	House of the Dead Overkill that comes by itself and a version with the Wii Zapper
4219000	4221000	The Wii Zapper is not dead in Japan apparently
4221000	4224000	It's coming out with that little bundle out there
4224000	4227000	Or they're just trying to unload the remaining supply they had
4227000	4228000	Probably
4228000	4231000	Playstation 2 sees some price reductions this week
4231000	4235000	Bully the Scholarship Edition and Biohazard Code Veronica
4235000	4239000	Which of course is Resident Evil Code Veronica in a bundle with Resident Evil 4
4239000	4241000	Or Biohazard 4 as it is in Japan
4241000	4245000	And lastly on the handhelds
4245000	4247000	Trying to see if there's anything
4247000	4253000	Saga 2 Hyou Densetsu Goddess of Destiny comes out from Square Enix
4253000	4257000	So this must be another Saga game that's coming out in Japan this week
4257000	4259000	So I know that series has its fans
4259000	4263000	So maybe there'll be some folks wanting to import that
4263000	4265000	Although they'll have to try and read it
4265000	4269000	And Idolmaster, Dearly Stars, DS, get it?
4269000	4271000	Idolmaster definitely has its fans in Japan
4271000	4273000	That is coming out on the Nintendo DS this week
4273000	4276000	Do you think that's a franchise we will ever see happen over here?
4276000	4277000	Probably not
4277000	4278000	Why not?
4278000	4279000	Because
4279000	4280000	It's too Japanese
4280000	4281000	Exactly
4281000	4285000	I hate to say it because it sounds weird but yeah
4285000	4288000	Quite a few games to pick from on the PSP this week in Japan
4288000	4290000	Ys 7 comes out this week
4290000	4292000	Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Tag Force
4292000	4298000	Katakyuu Hitman Reborn Battle Arena 2 Spirit's Burst comes out this week
4298000	4304000	As well as a price reduction for Irregular Hunter X and Rockman Rockman value pack
4304000	4307000	I'm assuming that is just the Mega Man games all packaged together
4307000	4314000	And lastly, Iki Utsun Eloquent Fist gets a price reduction this week
4314000	4316000	I'm trying to see what game that is
4316000	4318000	I think that's one we have over here
4318000	4319000	No
4319000	4321000	No, one of the characters looks just like Sakura though
4321000	4322000	But like an older version
4322000	4324000	Look at that, she's like wearing the same outfit and everything
4324000	4327000	Well it is a, you know, high school uniform
4327000	4328000	I guess
4328000	4330000	That's just what it makes me think of though
4330000	4332000	And it's Ys chatroom
4332000	4334000	Ys
4334000	4336000	Ys
4336000	4338000	Okay there you go, there's your release dates for Japan
4338000	4340000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4340000	4347000	For the UK we have, on the 15th as we discussed last week, Azuma's Revenge
4347000	4350000	And then on the 18th a whole crap ton of stuff
4350000	4356000	We have Batman Arkham Asylum for PC, don't pirate it or you'll get laughed at
4356000	4360000	Blood Bowl, Katamari Forever for PS3
4360000	4363000	One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2 for Wii
4363000	4370000	Order of War, Raven Squad, Red Gorilla Faction, I'm sorry Red Faction Gorilla, sorry
4370000	4373000	I was reading Gorilla and thinking beer
4373000	4379000	Resident Evil 5, Spectrobes Origins, The Humans for DS and PC
4379000	4383000	Wacky World of Sports for Wii, and Wet
4383000	4391000	Also Yamaha Supercross for DS and Need for Speed Shift on a crap ton of systems
4391000	4393000	Hmm, very cool
4393000	4399000	So there's some new stuff finally making its way to home
4399000	4401000	And this is kind of cool, I fully endorse this
4401000	4405000	Robot Chicken is coming to the PlayStation Home Theater
4405000	4409000	I did that off camera, sorry
4409000	4412000	Dark Sakura's making sound effects in the studio
4412000	4414000	I'm singing the Robot Chicken theme
4414000	4417000	It was actually really funny, it's a bummer you couldn't hear her
4417000	4419000	I'm stealing a cookie
4419000	4425000	So now they will actually have a bunch of different clips available on their theater screen
4425000	4430000	That once played Twilight's, I remember when they were playing the Twilight trailer on there
4430000	4432000	Well thank god they got rid of that
4432000	4441000	Yes, so you'll be able to watch Robot Chicken for free even though you can pretty much on your TV as well
4441000	4447000	But neat I guess, something else to watch while you're doing the Running Man
4447000	4453000	Well I think it's nice they're putting more useful things in home, does that make sense?
4453000	4460000	You know trailers are one thing but it's kind of nice that they're actually giving those theaters something a little more
4460000	4463000	I don't know, in demand to watch
4463000	4467000	Although I heard there was a soup, you know that show The Soup?
4467000	4471000	I think there was a clip show that was supposedly on Sony Home, I couldn't find it
4471000	4474000	But I didn't look very hard to be honest
4474000	4479000	I noticed that Sony's kind of branching out into putting some of these TV shows for free in home
4479000	4483000	And I think that's a good use of home, makes it a little more appealing in my opinion
4483000	4490000	I think it's just a matter of time before you start seeing the first episode of TV shows that they're trying to get you hooked into
4490000	4494000	Like the Glee pilot or what other pilots they've been trying to sell this year
4494000	4499000	There are other science fiction, Caprica's pilot, some of these shows that are coming out in 2010
4499000	4506000	Trying to kind of push those in Sony Home, I bet, especially for the next fall season you start seeing more of that
4506000	4507000	Yeah
4507000	4508000	We'll see
4508000	4511000	But that's kind of cool, I think that's a good use of Playstation Home
4511000	4515000	By the way there's some free stuff on Home this weekend too if you haven't logged in
4515000	4520000	And search for the OLR Club, I don't actually have to invite you, if you want to join the Orange Lawns Radio
4520000	4527000	Just search for it in Clubhouses, either search for Orange Lawns Radio or O-L-R-M-Y is like the keyword for it
4527000	4531000	So search for either of those and you'll find the Clubhouse and I'll invite you in
4531000	4536000	One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do with Penny Arcade Expo
4536000	4542000	And some unfortunate kind of side effect of so many folks being all contained in one place
4542000	4548000	PAX organizers did report this week that a confirmed swine flu case did break out at the show
4548000	4552000	And unfortunately this has grown into about a hundred cases of swine flu
4552000	4556000	Of course H1N1 is the real name for it but everybody calls it swine flu
4556000	4562000	Coming out of Penny Arcade Expo so kind of scary that you get all those people together and these types of things break out
4562000	4566000	Now it's not just the swine flu but of course the regular flu is showing up as well
4566000	4568000	You know as is various types of con things
4568000	4572000	Now this came up and we talked about this for a little bit on our phone call with Bobby Blackwolf
4572000	4575000	That we do on his show right before we go on the air tonight
4575000	4580000	So we talked a little bit about this and you know a couple bottom lines that come out of this
4580000	4583000	Is that A, this is just an unfortunate circumstance of cons
4583000	4587000	And Jamie you said something very smart about the fatigue that goes on at cons
4587000	4589000	And why this happens a lot
4589000	4593000	Well and keep in mind I was a long time con goer ever since I moved out here
4593000	4595000	And before I moved out here
4595000	4598000	You know my first convention I slept like three hours
4598000	4600000	And it was a three day convention
4600000	4601000	So yeah
4601000	4604000	A lot of people will do that
4604000	4605000	It's a big thing
4605000	4608000	Like for people who don't you know buy their hotel room and sleep in the lobby
4608000	4610000	People do that sorry
4610000	4615000	You are typically saving the typical con goer
4615000	4620000	May not be thinking in terms of proper nutrition for one thing
4620000	4622000	They'll be eating cheap con food
4622000	4626000	They'll be bringing snacks like when Julie used to go with us to cons
4626000	4632000	She would pack nothing but like croissants and cookies and all this crap
4632000	4635000	And I'd be like bring me some freaking carrots
4635000	4638000	You know because I can't eat that much sweet food all the time you know
4638000	4644000	And like I even ran away and got Moroccan food once
4644000	4647000	At AX one year
4647000	4649000	So um
4649000	4652000	But people don't really think in terms of their health
4652000	4654000	And the precautions they should be taking you know
4654000	4660000	At least have a couple of good decent meals you know with vegetables
4660000	4663000	Bring your vitamins with you take a good supplement in the morning
4663000	4668000	You know all of that contributes to your level of fatigue
4668000	4671000	And sleep please sleep
4671000	4675000	You know the con is a few days
4675000	4679000	But you've got to live with your health for the rest of your life
4679000	4684000	Now I know that some people have kind of been wondering what my piece is going to be on this
4684000	4687000	Because you know if you were listening to show a couple months ago
4687000	4690000	You know I have been very personally affected by swine flu
4690000	4692000	I lost a good friend of mine who is only 24 years old
4692000	4696000	She passed away of H1N1 a couple months ago
4696000	4699000	On June 23rd right before my birthday
4699000	4705000	I realized that what happened to her is not going to happen to everybody
4705000	4709000	Okay so I don't think there needs to be paranoia out there about the swine flu
4709000	4713000	But it pisses me off when people don't take this shit seriously
4713000	4716000	And I don't think that people have to like you know
4716000	4719000	Oh my god mass hysteria like no nobody wants that
4719000	4724000	But at the same time don't belittle what disease can do
4724000	4727000	And whether you know you know if you want to argue with me
4727000	4729000	The whole well swine flu is just like the regular flu
4729000	4731000	Blah blah blah fine whatever
4731000	4733000	You know yes I admit you can die from both
4733000	4736000	And I don't want to because I actually know people like on Twitter
4736000	4738000	That apparently caught this at PAX
4738000	4741000	And I don't want people to freak out like oh my gosh am I going to die
4741000	4742000	Probably not
4742000	4747000	It's you know what happened with Beth was certainly an isolated circumstance
4747000	4749000	There's still many questions
4749000	4751000	We're never going to get answers to as to what happened there
4751000	4753000	My point is though
4753000	4757000	Don't belittle this like it's the common cold
4757000	4759000	If you have a high fever
4759000	4761000	Call your doctor
4761000	4763000	Go in make an appointment
4763000	4765000	Get checked out get told it's nothing
4765000	4768000	Don't wait because the longer you let it go
4768000	4770000	The worse it's going to get and I don't want you to end up
4770000	4773000	I don't want anyone I know to have what happened to Beth happen to them
4773000	4777000	So you know please
4777000	4781000	You know and again this is not something I really get into ever on the program
4781000	4784000	But my day job is I work for a health insurance company
4784000	4787000	I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company in the state
4787000	4790000	And we work directly with the members in the center that I work with
4790000	4792000	So I know and I'll tell you
4792000	4796000	Most health insurance companies at least any decent one I know mine does
4796000	4798000	Will pay for urgent care
4798000	4801000	If you suspect you know whether you have PPO HMO whatever
4801000	4803000	It will pay for urgent care if you have symptoms
4803000	4805000	So you don't have to go to the ER because you have a high fever
4805000	4806000	You can go to an urgent care center
4806000	4808000	You can make an appointment with your doctor
4808000	4809000	Just go get checked out
4809000	4811000	Get told it's nothing get told it's the common cold
4811000	4813000	It's better you do that than the alternative
4813000	4815000	And if you don't have coverage
4815000	4818000	Still a lot of those urgent care places
4818000	4820000	Will treat you for
4820000	4824000	The last one I ever went to was 75 bucks I think
4824000	4826000	If you're uninsured you know and
4826000	4828000	They're there for that reason
4828000	4830000	Yeah go to an urgent care center not the ER for this
4830000	4833000	But get checked out for heaven's sake
4833000	4835000	You know don't sit on it and don't wait on it
4835000	4838000	And the other side I want to do with this is that
4838000	4841000	When you go to cons
4841000	4844000	And when you go to these places
4844000	4846000	Please be hygienic
4846000	4848000	I know a lot of people make jokes about this stuff
4848000	4850000	The whole con funk and all that stuff
4850000	4854000	But that is a very real thing that can continue to spread disease
4854000	4857000	And I want to reiterate one thing that Beth's mom Lynn
4857000	4860000	Said to the media when she was interviewed
4860000	4863000	Because Beth was the first person to die in this county from H1N1
4863000	4865000	And the one thing that her mom said to me
4865000	4867000	I will never forget this for the rest of my life
4867000	4869000	Is her on the news saying this
4869000	4871000	And I want you all to remember this
4871000	4874000	Wash your hands wash your hands wash your hands
4874000	4878000	I am not fucking around when you go to these conventions
4878000	4881000	And you're touching these controllers that hundreds of people have touched before
4881000	4883000	And so forth
4883000	4885000	Wash your hands
4885000	4887000	Please help stop the spread of disease
4887000	4889000	And wash your body while you're at it
4889000	4892000	Well I remember
4892000	4894000	I don't actually know if you remember this Rob
4894000	4898000	The last time that we went to E3 together
4898000	4900000	What did I have on me all the time?
4900000	4901000	Probably hand sanitizer
4901000	4902000	Hand sanitizer
4902000	4905000	I also had antibacterial lotion on hand
4905000	4907000	I had band-aids
4907000	4911000	And now this is something else I learned being a massage therapist
4911000	4915000	You don't want to have an exposed open wound
4915000	4917000	When you are around that many people
4917000	4920000	You do not want to touch other people's blood
4920000	4923000	Because first of all for example hepatitis
4923000	4926000	Lives outside of the body I think for two weeks
4926000	4928000	Active, live
4928000	4930000	Even if you think you've wiped up all the blood
4930000	4933000	It'll still live on the surface of anything that's touched
4933000	4936000	Unless you wipe it off really good
4936000	4938000	That's why they always say if you're going to be around someone who's bleeding
4938000	4940000	You put on latex gloves and then you take care of them
4940000	4944000	Put on your own mask before
4944000	4948000	And speaking of latex if you're going to have con sex use a condom
4948000	4953000	Use a full body condom if you're having con sex
4953000	4957000	But I'm saying you may not think about this
4957000	4959000	And the average person doesn't
4959000	4962000	But there are so many different ways to get sick
4962000	4965000	And I'm not saying be paranoid
4965000	4968000	But really take precaution if you're going to be around that many people
4968000	4971000	And at least always keep hand sanitizer around you
4971000	4974000	And at least be considerate to other people
4974000	4977000	If you've got like a paper cut or a cut on your arm or something
4977000	4979000	Put a good watertight bandage on it
4979000	4981000	So that you don't you know
4981000	4983000	I've got like for example
4983000	4986000	And no I've never had it but I have antibodies for hepatitis
4986000	4989000	Because I inherited it from somebody
4989000	4995000	But that still puts me at danger for exposing other people
4995000	4998000	So that's why I'm always extra careful
4998000	5000000	I always bandage up my cuts and things
5000000	5002000	Because I mean you always have
5002000	5004000	It's a matter of also being considerate to other people
5004000	5006000	And if you are sick and you do go
5006000	5008000	Wear one of those little paper masks
5008000	5010000	Don't cough on anyone wash your hands all the time
5010000	5013000	You know be considerate of other people
5013000	5015000	If you are going to be so inconsiderate
5015000	5017000	That you're going to go around other people while you're sick
5017000	5019000	And possibly contagious
5019000	5021000	If you have a sinus infection I don't care
5021000	5022000	That's not contagious
5022000	5024000	If you have the flu
5024000	5025000	If you have the cold
5025000	5027000	If you have something that is communicable
5027000	5029000	Take a precaution that you don't share it
5029000	5031000	And honestly it's not worth it
5031000	5032000	Stay home
5032000	5034000	There'll be another convention
5034000	5036000	Now I'm hoping you're sitting there on your chair
5036000	5038000	Going okay get on with it O.L.R.
5038000	5039000	I know this crap
5039000	5042000	But please understand if like one person's kind of sitting there
5042000	5044000	Going oh yeah maybe I should take like
5044000	5046000	Extra soap to the ex-con I go to
5046000	5048000	Then this whole little rant was worth it
5048000	5050000	Because I see a comment in chat
5050000	5052000	Frisbee says O.L.R. dash common sense
5052000	5054000	I really hope to everybody it is common sense
5054000	5057000	But if you've ever made the con-funk joke
5057000	5059000	Then you know it's not common sense to everybody
5059000	5061000	Okay so just please
5061000	5063000	From your friends at O.L.R.
5063000	5064000	Wash your damn hands
5064000	5066000	And again I do see
5066000	5068000	I see the con-funk around two particular groups
5068000	5070000	The really young
5070000	5074000	And the I have no life
5074000	5077000	I've never you know been on a date
5077000	5080000	You know 50 year old con-van boy
5080000	5082000	That's probably why they never had a date
5082000	5084000	S.H.A. 100 Matt also wants to put out
5084000	5086000	And don't pee on the seat when you use the toilet
5086000	5088000	Yeah don't do that Nope
5088000	5089000	I will say something this
5089000	5091000	Do not be afraid of urine on a seat
5091000	5093000	It is sterile
5093000	5095000	Just wipe it off Ew
5095000	5097000	But I'm telling you if you see poop on the seat
5097000	5099000	That's different No
5099000	5101000	Okay this is too much I'm done I'm done
5101000	5103000	Rob it actually is true urine is sterile
5103000	5105000	You have more germs on your hands and mouth
5105000	5107000	Than you do on your butt
5107000	5109000	I'm done nope too much done
5109000	5111000	Just wash your hands okay
5111000	5113000	That was the point I wanted to make
5113000	5115000	Before you pick up a controller at a gaming convention
5115000	5117000	Just wash your hands
5117000	5121000	Alright let's get into the classic game of the week
5123000	5125000	True though I know
5126000	5128000	Somehow we always end up with the show in the toilet
5128000	5129000	Even literally
5129000	5131000	Hey every week here on Orange Lawns Radio
5131000	5133000	We urge you kids to go visit the archives
5133000	5136000	And check out a classic video game of years past
5136000	5137000	And tonight is no different
5137000	5139000	Dark Sakura's gonna go into the vault
5139000	5141000	And pick out a game she thinks you all should be playing
5141000	5142000	Dark Sakura
5142000	5144000	What is the classic game of the week?
5144000	5146000	It's Pissarama
5146000	5147000	No I'm kidding
5147000	5149000	I hate you
5149000	5151000	Heart heart heart heart heart
5151000	5153000	Okay no it's Space Harrier
5153000	5155000	About damn time I did Space Harrier
5156000	5159000	I actually just got an IM from Becky
5159000	5163000	Saying that she thinks it's funny whenever I go off about pee being sterile
5163000	5165000	Will you get to the game
5165000	5167000	Get ready
5167000	5169000	Go back go back cause people have to go that far
5169000	5171000	Alright
5171000	5173000	We're looking at an arcade version of the game here
5173000	5174000	Yeah
5174000	5175000	It has my catch phrase on it
5175000	5176000	Here we go
5176000	5178000	Welcome to the fantasy zone
5178000	5179000	Get ready
5179000	5181000	Now everyone knows where that comes from
5181000	5184000	That has been like what my catch phrase as long as you've known me
5184000	5186000	It's been your little quote on forums like ever since I've known you
5186000	5187000	Yeah
5187000	5190000	Why why that quote of the thousands of quotes out there
5190000	5191000	Why this quote do you love so much
5191000	5192000	Because it's just cool
5192000	5193000	Welcome to the fantasy zone
5193000	5194000	Get ready
5194000	5195000	Alright
5195000	5196000	It's like it really makes no sense
5196000	5201000	Um Space Harrier is my third favorite video game ever
5201000	5207000	Which is me which means I have now covered all three of my top three favorite video games
5207000	5209000	The first being the Guardian Legend
5209000	5212000	The second being Fantasy Zone
5212000	5213000	And the third being Space Harrier
5213000	5217000	Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone
5217000	5219000	So moving forward
5219000	5226000	It is a game that was produced by Yu Suzuki who did a lot of Sega's really good games
5226000	5231000	And sitting right next to me is a picture of my husband shaking hands with Yu Suzuki
5231000	5232000	That was pretty cool
5232000	5241000	So Space Harrier is a sort of a fake 3D type of game
5241000	5244000	It is a sprite based game and it scrolls towards you
5244000	5250000	Well not kind of like a real over the shoulder cam but it's from behind you
5250000	5253000	And it has 18 levels each with a boss
5253000	5258000	And you have to shoot you know everything that gets in your way before it shoots you
5258000	5264000	And you can run on the ground or you can fly in the air with a jet pack
5264000	5266000	And everything really does come at you very quickly
5266000	5268000	It's brightly covered levels
5268000	5273000	Even for you know as old as it is because it came out in 1985
5273000	5281000	It is a fantastic game and it's one of the early games to use digitized voices in it
5281000	5285000	And after you beat a boss it tells you that you're doing great
5285000	5288000	It constantly encourages you I mean how many games do that
5288000	5289000	Anyway
5289000	5292000	By the way I just want to point out and I'm sorry Darsak if you were going to get to this
5292000	5295000	But since I was a Nintendo kid and not a Sega kid growing up
5295000	5298000	There was a game on Nintendo called 3D World Runner
5298000	5301000	That was a direct rip off of this game
5301000	5303000	I was going to get to it
5303000	5304000	Sorry
5304000	5307000	Actually that game was put out by Square by the way
5307000	5311000	And there was also Pony Canyon did a parody called Animal Attack Academy
5311000	5315000	That had a Japanese school girl fighting Australian animals
5315000	5322000	But yeah the game is also that along with After Burner
5322000	5329000	Was one of the first cabinets that had you in a seat
5329000	5333000	And that the whole cabinet would move along with your joystick movement
5333000	5337000	There also is one that doesn't move that sits down and an upright version
5337000	5340000	So it was really really cool to play
5340000	5346000	I haven't played a space harrier in the you know with the full motion sit down cabinet in ages
5346000	5352000	It also it used the same music for the most part over and over again
5352000	5355000	But I really loved the music
5355000	5360000	I put up a link also to just the music
5360000	5365000	I will bring that up so you can hear just the music without all the explosion noise
5365000	5367000	Let's listen to a little bit of that
5374000	5377000	Not bad for a game from 85
5377000	5380000	It really is one of my favorites
5380000	5386000	Now as far as other releases we got a there was a computer a home computer version
5386000	5392000	There was also the 32x version and one thing I will say is that the 32x version is a direct rip from the arcade
5392000	5400000	In fact you actually have a little trick that you can do with it where it changes from press start to insert coin
5400000	5405000	So that space harrier of course
5405000	5409000	But After Burner were both direct arcade ports
5409000	5412000	There was a Sega Saturn version
5412000	5420000	There was a Sharp x86000
5420000	5422000	It only came out of Japan
5422000	5426000	All of those were supposed to be the most arcade available
5426000	5429000	There is a Dreamcast version that is playable within Shenmue and Shenmue 2
5429000	5431000	And the Suzuki Gameworks Volume 1
5431000	5434000	An Xbox version of course it was in Shenmue 2
5434000	5440000	And in the Sega Arcade Gallery for Gameboy Advance and the Sega Classics Collection
5440000	5442000	For the PS2
5442000	5445000	Space Harrier 2 was the Genesis version
5445000	5449000	Which actually also just came out on Virtual Console December 2 years ago
5449000	5452000	My head students they just came out
5452000	5455000	In Europe it came out in October 2008
5455000	5459000	And over here on November 3, 2008
5459000	5463000	For the Master System
5463000	5471000	Also the arcade version is unlockable in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection
5471000	5474000	For Xbox 360 and PS3
5474000	5479000	And apparently it has sound issues by everything being just off pitch
5479000	5480000	That means I couldn't play
5480000	5483000	Actually I know that first hand because I tried to play Space Harrier
5483000	5485000	And the music sounded wrong to me
5485000	5490000	But I also have this thing where I hear anything off pitch
5490000	5493000	Really strongly perfect pitch for listening
5493000	5495000	I can't do it
5495000	5500000	There is also the Space Harrier Complete Edition
5500000	5502000	But you know what
5502000	5505000	They've done the series an injustice
5505000	5508000	Because they didn't release the sequel at home
5508000	5510000	The sequel being Planet Harriers
5510000	5512000	Have you played Planet Harriers?
5512000	5513000	I've heard of it
5513000	5514000	I've heard you talk about it before
5514000	5515000	Actually you know what
5515000	5516000	I think that you've seen me play it
5516000	5520000	Because they had it at Great America
5520000	5523000	I probably have just seen it and don't really remember it
5523000	5525000	Well I don't know if they still have it at Great America
5525000	5531000	But that one was pretty much a fantastic follow up to a great series
5531000	5532000	I think this game
5532000	5534000	And again sorry if I'm covering something you're about to get to
5534000	5537000	But I'm pretty sure this game is in that Sonic Genesis Collection
5537000	5538000	That just came out
5538000	5539000	That's what I just said
5539000	5540000	Oh sorry
5540000	5541000	I said it was Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection
5541000	5542000	But it suffered from
5542000	5544000	Oh I was zoning reading the Twitter
5544000	5546000	So okay yeah it's there
5546000	5550000	Yeah the reason why I couldn't play it is because it had pitch problems
5550000	5554000	All the voice and sound was just off
5554000	5555000	Gotcha
5555000	5556000	Enough to drive me nuts
5558000	5560000	I have the same problem with music on the radio too
5560000	5561000	If they play it too fast
5561000	5562000	I hear the pitch
5562000	5564000	But anyway I digress
5564000	5567000	But yeah go out and play Space Harrier
5567000	5569000	It's a lot of fun
5569000	5571000	It's one of the few games of that perspective
5571000	5573000	That doesn't make me utterly motion sick either
5573000	5575000	Unless I'm playing it in the cabinet
5575000	5576000	The motion cabinet
5576000	5578000	Then I will get very sick and throw up all over you
5578000	5579000	Which is not sterile
5579000	5580000	Lovely
5580000	5582000	So that's your game
5582000	5583000	Alright there it is
5583000	5586000	Your classic game of the week is Space Harrier
5586000	5589000	And I think Dark Sakura prefers the arcade version
5589000	5590000	But there are some other places
5590000	5591000	Actually
5591000	5593000	If I'm gonna play it at home
5593000	5595000	I'm gonna play it on the 32X
5595000	5599000	Just so I have a reason to play a good game on the giant mushroom of death
5599000	5600000	Alright then there you go
5600000	5603000	Space Harrier on the 32X is your classic game of the week
5603000	5606000	Something non-Sega next week Dark Sakura
5606000	5608000	I tried to pick something non-Sega
5608000	5614000	And then it occurred to me that I have done dozens of other games that are among my favorites
5614000	5615000	And have not done Space Harrier
5615000	5616000	Alright fair enough
5616000	5617000	But next week
5617000	5619000	I got them on a month streak of Sega
5619000	5621000	So next week we'll have to do something non-Sega
5621000	5622000	Next week something non-Sega
5622000	5623000	Alright
5623000	5625000	Maybe I'll do something on the Atari 2600
5625000	5627000	That would be cool actually
5627000	5628000	I would love to see some Atari 2600 games
5628000	5631000	I'm actually just looking at a game on the Atari 2600 we have sitting around
5631000	5632000	Alright
5632000	5633000	Anyhow
5633000	5634000	We'll get into that next week
5634000	5635000	For now we're gonna take a break
5635000	5639000	We will be back though in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio and Part B tonight
5639000	5640000	Twitter topics
5640000	5642000	We're also gonna talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 13
5642000	5643000	Some more Sony news
5643000	5645000	Including news about the minis
5645000	5647000	And some Playstation 3 bundles
5647000	5650000	And we're gonna talk about a possible Wii price cut
5650000	5653000	We'll get to all that and rapid fire news after this
5653000	5662000	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5662000	5664000	And welcome back everybody to this Orange Lounge Radio
5664000	5668000	We are live on September the 13th of 2009
5668000	5670000	Taping live at All Games Radio
5670000	5674000	The folks that always are kind enough to host our show
5674000	5676000	And let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night
5676000	5678000	They have a new show starting by the way this week
5678000	5680000	I just heard about it on Bobby's show tonight
5680000	5683000	The Escapist Live
5683000	5686000	I'm probably getting the name of that show wrong and I apologize
5686000	5689000	But I do know the cool thing about it is that you're gonna hear
5689000	5692000	The Yahtzee interviews early
5692000	5694000	Like that's the first place you can hear
5694000	5695000	The Yahtzee reviews
5695000	5696000	The zero punctuation reviews
5696000	5698000	Yahtzee's the guy that does it right?
5698000	5699000	Like the nice game?
5699000	5700000	Okay
5700000	5703000	You're gonna hear those reviews early before they actually go out
5703000	5706000	And that's gonna be live on Tuesday nights at All Games Radio
5706000	5710000	And it's sandwiched right in between Dead Pixel Live and Video Game Outsiders
5710000	5712000	And Video Game Outsiders are another cool bunch
5712000	5714000	It's actually funny because they're very similar to us
5714000	5716000	Because it's like two guys and a chick
5716000	5718000	But they all do it over Skype
5718000	5720000	And I think one guy's in Canada
5720000	5724000	But it's funny because one of the guys on the show reminds me of you, Dark Sakura
5724000	5728000	Because he has a classic arcade game collection that he always talks about on the show
5728000	5731000	And how he's getting these new video games and so forth
5731000	5733000	Just like you have your pinball tables, right?
5733000	5736000	It's kind of funny how our shows kind of complement each other, but they're very different
5736000	5737000	Like we don't...
5737000	5739000	They play more like Warcraft and stuff
5739000	5743000	And we're more, you know, music-based games and RPGs
5743000	5745000	They're very Xbox-centric, you know, it's just kind of funny
5745000	5748000	That we have so many similarities yet differences
5748000	5749000	But anyway
5749000	5751000	I wasn't meaning to plug them as much
5751000	5752000	Although they are a good show
5752000	5757000	I want to plug the Escapist show that's brand new that's coming to All Games as well
5757000	5759000	You know what, I say just go to All Games on Tuesday
5759000	5761000	Just leave it running throughout the day
5761000	5762000	And you're gonna hear a lot of great radio
5762000	5764000	That's just what you need to do
5764000	5766000	And then don't forget on Sunday nights
5766000	5771000	Come back and listen to Bobby Blackwolf and ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio
5771000	5772000	Alright
5772000	5775000	Let us move on and get into some Twitter topics
5775000	5778000	Before we get back to some news this week
5778000	5780000	And very thin on the Twitter topics tonight
5780000	5782000	I guess everybody's too busy with the Video Music Awards
5782000	5784000	And all this other garbage that's going on tonight
5784000	5786000	We didn't get a lot of tweets
5786000	5787000	In fact we really only have one tweet
5787000	5790000	And it's from Spazinator tonight
5790000	5792000	And the question is
5792000	5794000	Oops, it's down here a little bit
5794000	5796000	He wrote like five tweets, good lord
5796000	5800000	How about either Home, upcoming 1.3 update and OLR Club
5800000	5803000	As well as sale on the PSN Video Store
5803000	5807000	I don't know what they put for sale on the PSN Video Store
5807000	5808000	It's funny enough
5808000	5811000	Because I was actually looking at what kind of offerings were in the Video Store this week
5811000	5814000	Because since my Xbox 360 is broken
5814000	5816000	I can't do Netflix right now
5816000	5818000	It's kind of too bad though
5818000	5821000	Because a lot of stuff that is available on the PSN Store
5821000	5823000	And not to say the 360 is any different
5823000	5825000	But it's a lot of movies I'm just not interested in
5825000	5827000	It's all like slasher flicks
5827000	5829000	And action packed
5829000	5831000	Which I understand who their target audience is
5831000	5834000	But forgive me if I like a good chick flick
5834000	5836000	Or art house film every once in a while
5836000	5838000	I don't really find those on either network to be honest
5838000	5842000	But then also the OLR Club
5842000	5844000	I did plug that at the top of the show
5844000	5846000	But if you haven't joined the Orange Lounge Radio Club
5846000	5848000	In Sony Playstation Home
5848000	5850000	We do have one
5850000	5851000	So check that out
5851000	5853000	Search for Orange Lounge Radio
5853000	5855000	ORMY is our little buzzword
5855000	5857000	And we have some arcade cabinets
5857000	5859000	That I got from the Namco Collection demo
5859000	5860000	That we put there
5860000	5862000	So you can play like Dig Dug and stuff in our home
5862000	5864000	And I'm trying to get other furniture as I find it
5864000	5867000	But I don't really want to pay for a lot of furniture
5867000	5870000	But I guess there's some free stuff this weekend
5870000	5872000	So if you go into the stores
5872000	5874000	You can find some new shirts and things like that
5874000	5876000	And I guess some new furniture is free too
5876000	5878000	So I want to try and dig that up
5878000	5881000	Because I guess there's a coffin you can get for free this weekend
5881000	5883000	So I thought maybe I'd plop a coffin on the stage
5883000	5885000	Of our Orange Lounge Radio Clubhouse
5885000	5886000	Wouldn't that be lovely?
5886000	5888000	Wouldn't you like that, Dark Sakura?
5888000	5889000	Just a coffin?
5889000	5890000	That would be fantastic
5890000	5891000	Alright
5891000	5893000	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news
5893000	5895000	And kick off with some rapid fire news tonight
5895000	5897000	Starting off with Loki
5897000	5899000	Yes
5899000	5902000	Of course, Rock Band's got new stuff coming out each week
5902000	5905000	And this week we've got some new songs
5905000	5908000	Including Tenacious D
5908000	5911000	Yes, that's right, Tenacious D will be getting a couple individual tracks
5911000	5914000	With Rock Your Socks and Tribute
5914000	5917000	Both available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft points
5917000	5919000	I'm totally getting Tribute
5919000	5922000	Also part of the individual songs
5922000	5926000	The Guess Who with Hand Me Down World and No Time
5926000	5931000	And then finally Dinosaur Jr. with Pick Me Up and The Wagon
5931000	5934000	All those available as individual song downloads
5934000	5937000	Of $2 each or 160 Microsoft points
5937000	5939000	Or I guess 200 Wii points
5939000	5941000	But that's a little easier to figure out
5941000	5944000	Then to kind of coincide, I guess
5944000	5948000	I know there's a new Anvil documentary coming out
5948000	5951000	Well, they have the Anvil pack
5951000	5956000	Which is available for 440 Microsoft points or $5.50
5956000	5960000	Included with that is 666, Metal on Metal
5960000	5962000	And this is 13
5962000	5967000	And those also can be purchased individually for 160 Microsoft points or $2 each
5967000	5970000	And then finally coming to the PSP
5970000	5973000	We've got Evanescence with Bring Me to Life
5973000	5976000	And Spinal Tap with Back from the Dead
5976000	5982000	And then also we've got Forza 3 going gold
5982000	5985000	And of course with that they announced the demo for the game
5985000	5989000	Will be hitting the Xbox Live Marketplace on September 24th
5989000	5992000	You'll be able to check out some of the new cars
5992000	5995000	As well as some of the tracks
5995000	5997000	And the demo will include 5 playable vehicles
5997000	5999000	Including the 2007 Porsche
5999000	6002000	Number 80 Flying Lizard 911
6002000	6008000	Looks like an Audi R8 5.2
6008000	6010000	The Ferrari California
6010000	6013000	Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X
6013000	6015000	That would be 10
6015000	6017000	Whatever
6017000	6020000	And the mini John Cooper works
6020000	6023000	That's interesting
6023000	6026000	Finally, a game I'm quite excited about
6026000	6030000	DJ Hero will be getting its healthy dose of Daft Punk
6030000	6034000	And they will be contributing 11 unique mixes for the game
6034000	6038000	As well as being playable characters in the game as well
6038000	6044000	Included with that would be Daft Punk Ride the World vs. Young MC Bust a Move
6044000	6050000	Defunk vs. NASA Strange Enough featuring Karen, ODB, and Fatlip
6050000	6055000	Daft Punk Defunks with Queen, another one bites the dust
6055000	6060000	Robot Rock with Hashim Al-Nayefish
6060000	6063000	I guess that's translated to the soul
6063000	6068000	I'm glad I'm not the only one that horribly butchers pronunciations on this show
6068000	6071000	Robot Rock vs. Queen, We Will Rock You
6071000	6073000	I guess that's kind of appropriate
6073000	6078000	Short Circuit vs. Boogie Down Productions Jack of Spades
6078000	6081000	Technologic vs. Gary Numan's Cars
6081000	6084000	I think there's too many tracks mixed with Cars
6084000	6086000	That's just my guess
6086000	6090000	Television Rules the Nation vs. No Doubt Hella Good
6090000	6096000	And I'm very disappointed to see that there's not anything for like
6096000	6100000	Some of the songs One More Time or something like that
6100000	6105000	Last, well, I guess that was their last album, maybe the album before last
6105000	6109000	But man, maybe some download content later on
6109000	6113000	And I think that all that is probably download content, all those songs, right?
6113000	6117000	Did they say that? Because I wouldn't think Daft Punk has that many songs in the game, do they?
6117000	6119000	No, I think that's that many songs in the game
6119000	6121000	Wow, that's kind of cool
6121000	6127000	Yeah, so that was only 8 of the 11 songs too, so there's going to be more
6127000	6132000	Well, getting into the Nintendo Virtual Console releases from this week
6132000	6137000	On Virtual Console we had the Super Return of the Jedi from the Super Nintendo
6137000	6140000	Came out this week and that was 800 Wii Points
6140000	6143000	And I think every week they've been doing a Star Wars game, I think for the month
6143000	6145000	So there you go
6145000	6149000	DSiWare, they had Clubhouse Games Express Family Favorites
6149000	6152000	Which has games like Hearts and Bridge and so forth
6152000	6157000	On WiiWare though, they had a game called Color Z, or Colors
6157000	6162000	Which was where you go forth in spaceships on a mission to clean up virus infested planets
6162000	6167000	I guess you absorb viruses of your color, but you want to stay away of other viruses
6167000	6171000	But who cares about that when you have Contra Rebirth hit for 1000 Wii Points
6171000	6176000	Which is kind of like a Super Nintendo-ish looking newer version of Contra
6176000	6179000	Which, funny enough, our caller last week, nailed it
6179000	6182000	That they thought Contra was going to be out on Labor Day and they were correct
6182000	6184000	So good job on that
6184000	6193000	Hey, Capcom vs. Tatsunoko has some new, apparently leaked, characters from poor website planning
6193000	6200000	Apparently somebody was able to mine the website and find some images that were missing on the website
6200000	6205000	That apparently are going to be added later, which include Frank West from Dead Rising as a playable character
6205000	6206000	Ah, we knew it
6206000	6208000	As in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom
6208000	6212000	Apparently Zero from the Mega Man series is there as well
6212000	6218000	And Yatterman number 2 and Joe Asukara
6218000	6222000	We should have been in it to begin with, yes
6222000	6224000	He's always the one that wants to push the button
6224000	6229000	Now see, I don't know dick about anime, so I guess Jamie's excitement has me excited too
6229000	6231000	Woo!
6231000	6233000	I guess that's good news, right?
6233000	6244000	The Pac-Man world record was broken, apparently the kill screen was reached in 3 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds
6244000	6247000	I'm sorry, that was the old record from Chris Ira
6247000	6252000	Now it has been beat by David Race, I think is his name
6252000	6257000	3 hours 41 minutes and 22 seconds is the new time
6257000	6261000	Wow, Billy Mitchell once held that spot
6261000	6264000	But Billy Mitchell's a dick
6264000	6268000	I don't know, it's a movie, I'm not going to
6268000	6270000	He really is
6270000	6272000	I don't know the guy, I'm not going to bother
6272000	6276000	Alright, let's finish off the rapid fire news, Dark Sakura
6276000	6279000	Well let's see what else we've got going on
6279000	6286000	There's actually an ESRB rating for Castlevania The Adventure on Wii
6286000	6289000	Which really wasn't that good of a game
6289000	6293000	It was, you know, the Game Boy one that came out
6293000	6299000	Also, and I mentioned this earlier, Braid is cheaper now on Steam
6299000	6305000	It's $5 now, or £3.39
6305000	6308000	And it's a pretty cool game
6308000	6315000	And also, Final Fantasy VII on Wii has more download content
6315000	6321000	Chapter 9, The Crystals, which is the final part of the story, that's 800 Wii Points
6321000	6323000	I need to finish up that game
6323000	6325000	Yep, I thought you'd be interested in that one
6325000	6329000	Yeah, I kind of stopped playing, but it was a really good Wii download game
6329000	6336000	A little other news in WiiWare, is that for 800 Wii Points, Spaceball Revolution
6336000	6338000	Not to be confused with Spaceballs
6338000	6343000	Then 2 and 1 Solitaire, which is Spider and Klondike
6343000	6350000	And then, Sullivan's Key and Rygar for 500 and 600 Wii Points respectively
6350000	6354000	Alright, let's get back into some long discussion topics tonight, Loki
6354000	6358000	Yes, the music game sales are down
6358000	6367000	But, even though they are down 46%, it is still the third best selling genre among video games
6367000	6373000	And of course, this is coming from the NPD group, they do all these sales tracking and whatnot
6373000	6377000	And I guess, year to date sales have declined quite a bit
6377000	6384000	But, when you look at it, they're pretty much calculating stuff from up until
6384000	6387000	Up to Guitar Hero 5 and the Beelz Rock Band
6387000	6389000	I think a lot of people were anticipating those two games
6389000	6393000	I was going to say, because I've seen this story spread like wildfire through blogs this week
6393000	6395000	And I'm like, this is completely misleading, in a way
6395000	6398000	Because the big music games for the year haven't even come out yet
6398000	6400000	Or just came out
6400000	6406000	Well, you obviously can't have that data right away
6406000	6412000	I mean, they usually release the previous month's data like halfway through the next month
6412000	6415000	I think that it's even selling half of what it used to is pretty damn impressive
6415000	6419000	When you consider a year ago, we had Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2
6419000	6421000	I mean, those are both huge titles
6421000	6423000	The DS games were just coming out too
6423000	6425000	Those are all huge stuff
6425000	6427000	So, I mean, I'm not surprised
6427000	6431000	I mean, since I don't really think that Smash Hits and Metallica sold
6431000	6435000	I mean, they sold alright, but not like, you know, a Guitar Hero 5
6435000	6439000	They're just not going to sell the way a Guitar Hero 4 or a Rock Band 2 does
6439000	6442000	Exactly, and the track packs, I mean, that doesn't really count
6442000	6445000	So, it's a little misleading
6445000	6449000	It'd be more interesting to see what happens after the holiday
6449000	6450000	At the end of the year
6450000	6452000	I would like to see an end of the year wrap up as compared to last year
6452000	6454000	You think it'll be kind of in the same?
6454000	6456000	I think you'll still see a little decline
6456000	6460000	I don't think the Beatles Rock Band is going to sell quite the way Rock Band 2 did
6460000	6462000	Don't get me wrong, I think it'll still sell pretty big
6462000	6466000	And I think Guitar Hero 5 will probably be on par with Guitar Hero World Tour
6466000	6471000	Which, if I'm not mistaken, didn't Guitar Hero beat Rock Band last year in terms of sales?
6471000	6472000	Um, yes
6472000	6476000	Yeah, because Guitar Hero is still, you know, despite the fact that, you know
6476000	6480000	Rock Band gets more press usually because they have done more download packs
6480000	6483000	And, you know, so forth, Guitar Hero still sells better
6483000	6485000	Because they have more releases
6485000	6489000	Well, and also, I would say they have better peripherals too
6489000	6493000	I wouldn't call their drum set better than the other ones
6493000	6495000	Alright, I'm basing it off the guitars, I am
6495000	6498000	But I like the Guitar Hero guitar much better than the Rock Band
6498000	6500000	Yeah, definitely they're going to skew everything
6500000	6502000	Because now they're going to consider, you know
6502000	6506000	Each copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen that people redeem for free as a sale
6506000	6508000	You know, just stuff like that
6508000	6511000	It's, they do a lot to really skew their numbers
6511000	6515000	And they're like, yeah, look how much Guitar Hero is selling compared to Rock Band
6515000	6519000	And you can't compare the two because one has way more releases than the other
6519000	6523000	Because they refuse to embrace download content on a regular basis
6523000	6526000	I mean, they do have download content on a regular basis
6526000	6528000	But nowhere near what Rock Band has
6530000	6531000	Alright
6531000	6533000	Well, moving on with other stories
6533000	6535000	Completely out of the Music Game League
6535000	6539000	Final Fantasy XIII finally had its release date revealed
6539000	6542000	There was actually like a little conference earlier this week
6542000	6544000	Where they finally revealed some details about the game
6544000	6547000	But, you know, the biggest thing, because we weren't there
6547000	6548000	We didn't get to play the playable demo
6548000	6554000	December 17, 2009 is the release date for Final Fantasy XIII in Japan
6554000	6557000	But, I will say this, don't forget the Playstation 3 is region free
6557000	6560000	This game is not coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan
6560000	6562000	That was not something they said as part of the announcement
6562000	6564000	So it is only PS3 in Japan
6564000	6567000	And I bet you, you're going to have a lot of folks that import this
6567000	6571000	Although, it's going to be very Japanese heavy still
6571000	6572000	That's the problem
6572000	6573000	I don't think I will though
6573000	6574000	I mean, I've done that in the past
6574000	6578000	I've played Final Fantasy games in Japanese and never had a problem
6578000	6582000	Well, look, I don't know Japanese like you guys do
6582000	6583000	I don't know Japanese
6583000	6584000	I would get nothing from this
6584000	6587000	I print out a nice little fan translation of everything and that works
6587000	6591000	That's why I played through Final Fantasy VIII when I originally imported that
6591000	6594000	It would be cool if they had English subtitles
6594000	6596000	But they don't want to dip into the US sales
6596000	6597000	Naturally, it's not going to be there
6597000	6602000	However, though, that doesn't happen until the international versions
6602000	6604000	That they have English subtitles
6604000	6608000	My copy of Final Fantasy X-2, my Japanese one
6608000	6611000	Well, I have the international version
6611000	6614000	It has subtitles
6614000	6618000	No, but I haven't heard of any type of extras
6618000	6621000	That we're going to get in Final Fantasy XIII here in the US
6621000	6623000	With the exception of the fact that we have a 360 version
6623000	6626000	So do you think there will even be an international version this time?
6626000	6628000	Maybe
6628000	6630000	Or maybe, I guess they could always do a remixed version
6630000	6634000	You know how Final Fantasy X, I don't think there were a whole lot of differences there either
6634000	6637000	But the international version had the different
6637000	6639000	What was the name of the board where you leveled?
6639000	6642000	You filled in the spots on the board
6642000	6644000	That was how you leveled your characters, remember that?
6644000	6647000	They have a different version of that board in the international version
6647000	6649000	I wonder if they'll do things like that, I don't know
6649000	6652000	But I am certainly excited for Final Fantasy XIII
6652000	6655000	But not excited enough to import it because I don't know Japanese
6655000	6658000	And for me, the story is everything in Final Fantasy XIII
6658000	6660000	Well, it's not everything, but it's like 90% of it
6660000	6663000	So I'm going to wait for the English one
6663000	6664000	Which I'll be able to comprehend
6664000	6668000	Atdeft points out in our chatroom at chat.orangewashowagerdoo.com
6668000	6671000	The international version would probably be on the 360
6671000	6673000	I don't think it will in Japan
6673000	6677000	I mean, I see where your logic is going and that's a logical thought
6677000	6684000	But again, you have to remember the 360 has not penetrated the Japanese marketplace the way it has here
6684000	6688000	Sony is still on top, well Nintendo is still on top in Japan if I'm not mistaking
6688000	6690000	But Sony has a clear second place
6690000	6692000	And I think Microsoft has gained some ground
6692000	6695000	They're not a laughing stock in Japan at this point
6695000	6700000	But they're even further back than where Sony is here
6700000	6704000	I mean, at least Sony has been gaining a lot of ground here
6704000	6706000	In this generation
6706000	6708000	But I think in Japan it's a whole different story
6708000	6712000	And Game Guru says the 360 version is your extra
6712000	6714000	Keep in mind 360s aren't region free
6714000	6717000	So if you live in Japan and for whatever reason have a 360
6717000	6720000	You're out of luck unless you can figure out a way to mod or whatever
6720000	6723000	Also, I wanted to kind of point out one thing
6723000	6726000	This had me thinking about was Final Fantasy XIV
6726000	6729000	When do you think we're going to start seeing more Final Fantasy XIV?
6729000	6731000	Do you think it's going to come out?
6731000	6733000	I don't know if the game itself will come out next year
6733000	6736000	But do you think we're going to see a lot more information start to spill out really quick?
6736000	6739000	It seems to me like we're going to have our shortest window
6739000	6742000	Between Final Fantasy games with this and XIV
6742000	6745000	Being that we already know there's a playable alpha out there
6745000	6749000	That they demoed at a show
6749000	6752000	I'm wondering if XIV is not going to show up at Tokyo Game Show as well
6752000	6754000	It might, they may have a little bit there
6754000	6757000	But I don't know how finished they'll be
6757000	6762000	That's true, well maybe that same alpha that they had at the Gamescom in Germany
6762000	6763000	I don't know
6763000	6767000	But I think it's very possible that we're going to at least see the beta
6767000	6770000	Final Fantasy XIV by next year
6770000	6773000	One of my friends was trying to tell me it was going to be this year, the beta
6773000	6774000	I'm like dream on
6774000	6777000	There's no way that XIV is going to be out there before XIII is
6777000	6779000	That would just be weird
6779000	6781000	That's like dividing by zero
6781000	6784000	You can't do that in the Final Fantasy universe
6784000	6787000	Of course there's a lot of people that think those online games
6787000	6790000	Shouldn't be part of the regular numerology anyway
6790000	6792000	As much as I love Final Fantasy XI
6792000	6794000	I sometimes tend to agree with them
6794000	6798000	Anyhow, let's keep moving on with some news, Darcyra
6798000	6802000	Well there is a rumor going around that there's supposed to be
6802000	6806000	Three different 250GB bundles of the PS3
6806000	6809000	Coming out in the UK in October
6809000	6816000	There were FCC documents showing that there was supposed to be a PS3 Slim
6816000	6825000	And a retail source to a Eurogamer
6825000	6829000	That said that there was supposed to be three different bundles with different games
6829000	6833000	As in Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, Gran Turismo 5, and Assassin's Creed 2
6833000	6839000	And they were supposed to sell for £299 which over here would be £494
6839000	6844000	And there's of course no statement made to the rumor
6844000	6850000	I don't know, are all these different bundles necessary?
6850000	6853000	I guess so, I guess bundles help drive sales
6853000	6856000	There's a ton of different PSP bundles here in the States
6856000	6861000	There's the Hannah Montana OMG Girls one and the Rock Band one
6861000	6865000	No, I think that's seriously what it's called
6865000	6867000	OMG Girls Play 2 or something like that
6867000	6871000	Kind of their way of getting girls to get Sony PSPs
6871000	6874000	Because right now they all have DS's
6874000	6879000	That's funny
6879000	6882000	We'll probably see something over here too
6882000	6885000	As far as US bundles, I'm guessing
6885000	6887000	In time for the holidays, certainly
6887000	6888000	Definitely
6888000	6892000	So to kind of go back to something we were talking a little bit about
6892000	6895000	Or complaining about I guess in part A
6895000	6897000	Was the PSP Go
6897000	6903000	And one of the things that they were kind of showing off during E3
6903000	6909000	Well actually not so much E3, but during Gamescom was the PSP Minis
6909000	6913000	And they said that there is a possibility though
6913000	6917000	We will see collections of these Minis available on a single UMD
6917000	6920000	At a later stage later on
6920000	6924000	Where maybe a publisher or whatever can put out a bunch of these little games
6924000	6931000	I guess like you see right now on the Xbox 360 every now and then
6931000	6935000	You'll see an Xbox Live game collection or something like that
6935000	6939000	They also said that there's a possibility that the Minis will jump to the PS3 as well
6939000	6941000	To be downloaded
6941000	6944000	I could see that happening especially if they feel that
6944000	6948000	They're not making up enough sales with the PSP Go
6948000	6950000	And I have a feeling that's going to be the problem
6950000	6952000	But at the same time
6952000	6954000	And to kind of go back to what we were saying before
6954000	6956000	What exactly does the PSP Go have going for
6956000	6959000	Other than it's more expensive and slightly smaller
6959000	6961000	I mean nothing
6961000	6962000	It's new
6962000	6964000	Oh goody
6964000	6968000	So if Nintendo came out with the Wii Gold
6968000	6969000	Or something like that
6969000	6971000	It's a gold colored Wii, but it's $500
6971000	6972000	Does that mean I have to go buy it?
6972000	6974000	I mean that's stupid
6974000	6976000	But
6976000	6977000	Oh well
6977000	6979000	I mean to me
6979000	6982000	Saying that they're going to re-release these on UMD later on
6982000	6987000	Makes me feel that they're not really confident in the PSP Go
6987000	6992000	And that they will need the supplement or sales by other means
6992000	6996000	I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about putting these on the PS3 as well
6996000	6997000	I mean it makes sense
6997000	6999000	But then again we kind of talk about this
6999000	7001000	Oh you know they're going to do all this with the Minis
7001000	7003000	We don't really know what they're going to be yet
7003000	7005000	We haven't seen what the Minis are
7005000	7007000	Right? Like I know that little picture you have there
7007000	7008000	Looks like a little bejeweled thing
7008000	7010000	Well they have like Tetris and stuff
7010000	7012000	Do they already have some Minis out there?
7012000	7014000	Tetris is supposed to be one of the Minis
7014000	7016000	I heard by the way that there was somebody
7016000	7018000	I was trying to get them to tweet us about it
7018000	7020000	Because I didn't have a story on it
7020000	7021000	But I heard about it
7021000	7023000	That there's like a new Tetris in development right now
7023000	7025000	Not the Nintendo one, but like a new Tetris
7025000	7027000	There's one for the DS I think, maybe the Wii
7027000	7029000	No there's a different one even outside of that
7029000	7031000	Yeah
7031000	7036000	Is it now going to have like more blocks?
7036000	7038000	Tetris now with more blocks
7038000	7040000	Tetromino is made out of five cubes instead
7040000	7043000	No I imagine it's more like probably more competitive in internet things
7043000	7045000	You know like I'm sure there's some people out there
7045000	7047000	They're like how many times can you do Tetris?
7047000	7049000	But like look at Tetris DS
7049000	7050000	A million
7050000	7052000	Yeah I mean but realistically yes you can
7052000	7054000	Because look at Tetris DS
7054000	7056000	That was an awesome version of Tetris
7056000	7060000	You know one series they've managed to re-release several times
7060000	7063000	And actually do a pretty good job with every time
7063000	7064000	Is Tetris
7064000	7067000	Like if you look at the original PC game
7067000	7069000	Then you look at the NES Tetris
7069000	7072000	Even Tengen Tetris versus Nintendo Tetris
7072000	7076000	And then Game Boy Tetris with its whole link play was revolutionary
7076000	7078000	And then Nintendo DS is awesome I mean
7078000	7083000	Tetris is kind of actually one game that they've done right
7083000	7084000	Many many times
7084000	7086000	Not to say it's been perfect
7086000	7088000	Because there was a Tetris on the Playstation
7088000	7090000	By Jellico I think it was
7090000	7091000	Tetris Plus
7091000	7093000	That was awful
7093000	7096000	It was an awful awful game
7096000	7097000	So it's just kind of interesting
7097000	7098000	Agreed
7098000	7100000	You know it's kind of interesting that you can take like
7100000	7103000	A game that's essentially the same and do it so many different ways
7103000	7105000	And sometimes it's very very good like Tetris DS
7105000	7108000	And sometimes it's very very sad like Tetris Playstation
7108000	7109000	So
7109000	7110000	Anyhow
7110000	7114000	Let me move on I didn't mean to get into a different topic
7114000	7115000	But I did
7115000	7117000	I want to talk about Silent Hill Homecoming
7117000	7119000	Which you know was the fifth game in the series
7119000	7121000	Even though it didn't carry the number 5 on it
7121000	7124000	And was somewhat razzed here in the states
7124000	7127000	As you know kind of because it was by an American developer and so forth
7127000	7130000	Well the game was set to make its way to Japan
7130000	7131000	But guess what
7131000	7133000	The website was updated this week
7133000	7136000	The Japanese Silent Hill Homecoming website was updated to say
7136000	7138000	The game has been cancelled
7138000	7141000	Silent Hill Homecoming will not be out in Japan
7141000	7143000	No reason was given for the decision
7143000	7146000	It just said on the website simply quote
7146000	7149000	Please look forward to future titles in the series
7149000	7151000	Kind of interesting that
7151000	7152000	They
7152000	7154000	That this game was developed in the west
7154000	7155000	Took some shit for that
7155000	7158000	And now the Japanese aren't even going to release it at all
7158000	7161000	But it's not too surprising considering the site hadn't had an update
7161000	7162000	Until this
7162000	7164000	Since November of 2008
7164000	7166000	I don't know what do you guys think
7166000	7168000	I don't think Silent Hill Homecoming was terrible by any means
7168000	7170000	But I can see where
7170000	7172000	It's different
7172000	7174000	And maybe
7174000	7176000	I don't know I don't know it just seems weird to me
7176000	7178000	That they're not releasing it at all
7178000	7180000	Like even under a different name or anything
7180000	7184000	Given the reviews that it got here though
7184000	7186000	That's really not very surprising
7186000	7188000	Because it doesn't I think
7188000	7192000	The biggest complaint about it was that it didn't have the same kind of
7192000	7196000	Scare factor that appealed to Japanese players
7196000	7199000	It wasn't the same type of a scary game
7199000	7201000	I don't think the game was terrible it was different
7201000	7203000	But you know I also like Silent Hill 4
7203000	7205000	I didn't say it was bad but I'm saying that it wasn't
7205000	7207000	What was up to snuff
7207000	7209000	For that series
7209000	7211000	It's just interesting that
7211000	7214000	I wonder if that's because of sales figures here
7214000	7216000	I wonder if that game just didn't sell well here
7216000	7218000	I don't know Loki from your inside perspective
7218000	7219000	I don't know if you would know this but
7219000	7221000	It didn't sell that well here
7221000	7223000	It didn't sell well in the beginning but that's it
7223000	7225000	It's not something that's constantly being reordered or anything
7225000	7227000	It's too bad
7227000	7229000	Yeah
7229000	7231000	Alright let's get into tonight's mailbag
7231000	7233000	A part of the show where you can interact with us
7233000	7236000	By sending us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7236000	7239000	Dark Sakura's gonna dive in head first into the mailbag
7239000	7241000	And find some emails to read for us
7241000	7243000	I am
7243000	7245000	You are, you is
7245000	7247000	I is, okay
7247000	7249000	Greetings Rob, Loki, Dark Sakura
7249000	7251000	Here's the dilemma
7251000	7253000	I'm a hardcore PC gamer and want a PS3
7253000	7255000	But can't justify bringing one
7255000	7257000	Buying one because
7257000	7259000	Any of the games I like for it I can buy for the PC
7259000	7261000	And play with better graphics, cheaper and less hassle
7261000	7263000	But I like the idea of having one
7263000	7265000	If only for Gran Turismo and Blu-ray
7265000	7267000	To get a system I would have to buy an HDTV
7267000	7269000	Which is expensive
7269000	7271000	And I don't know whether I should wait
7271000	7273000	For the 3D TVs
7273000	7275000	So many questions so little time
7275000	7277000	Are there any good PS3 exclusives
7277000	7279000	That would justify me buying this system
7279000	7281000	And should I wait for 3D TVs
7281000	7283000	Also, how do I vote for your show
7283000	7285000	Without going through iTunes, I hate Apple
7285000	7287000	The turtle
7287000	7289000	Wait, just wait
7289000	7291000	And you can get a Blu-ray player, you know, for your PC
7291000	7293000	So wait, they're getting cheaper
7295000	7297000	The one thing that
7297000	7299000	I kind of have to say on this though
7299000	7301000	Is that, you know, one thing to consider
7301000	7303000	And has always kind of been a drawback
7303000	7305000	Of PC gaming is that you have to constantly
7305000	7307000	Build your PC
7307000	7309000	And I realize there's PC gaming fans that are gonna
7309000	7311000	Hate me for kind of calling that out a little bit
7311000	7313000	Cause there's a lot of people that do spend the kind of money
7313000	7315000	To keep on tip top shape
7315000	7317000	But the nice thing about console games is that
7317000	7319000	The metrics are already established
7319000	7321000	On console games
7321000	7323000	And that, you know, the game is always
7323000	7325000	Going to play the way it was
7325000	7327000	Meant to be played on a certain console
7327000	7329000	Whereas on the PC sometimes you have to deal with
7329000	7331000	Frame rate issues and so forth if your PC is not up to par
7331000	7333000	But it sounds like you are
7333000	7335000	An established PC gamer and you have a lot of games
7335000	7337000	On PC, you probably have a top of the line computer
7337000	7339000	You may have hit the nail on the head
7339000	7341000	If every game you want to play
7341000	7343000	Is coming out on PC
7343000	7345000	Then maybe you don't have a reason to get a
7345000	7347000	PS3, Dark Soccer makes a good point
7347000	7349000	Get a Blu-ray player for your PC
7349000	7351000	They're coming down in price
7351000	7353000	But keep in mind too
7353000	7355000	The Playstation is a bit of an
7355000	7357000	Entertainment hub, quote unquote
7357000	7359000	Not just the Blu-rays, but you know
7359000	7361000	Home and the download movies and so forth
7361000	7363000	I don't know if it's really enough to justify a $300
7363000	7365000	Expense, especially if you're saying you get all
7365000	7367000	Of the rest of it on your computer
7367000	7369000	The only other thing I do want to
7369000	7371000	Say though, Sony exclusives, keep that in mind
7371000	7373000	There are certain games that
7373000	7375000	Will not come out on the PC, period
7375000	7377000	Games like LittleBigPlanet, which are
7377000	7379000	Pretty awesome, I gotta say
7379000	7381000	Mag, the ModNation Racers
7381000	7383000	These games are not going to ever come out
7383000	7385000	On PC because they're made by Sony and they want you
7385000	7387000	To have a Playstation to play it on
7387000	7389000	So, if those games are
7389000	7391000	Worth it to you, then you're going to have to take
7391000	7393000	The plunge, but if you know the types of
7393000	7395000	Games you're getting are, you know, Batman Arkham
7395000	7397000	Asylum, Call of Duty and the games
7397000	7399000	That do come out on PC, then
7399000	7401000	You might be right, you don't need a
7401000	7403000	Playstation 3, so don't spend money on one
7403000	7405000	Um
7405000	7407000	I personally just love the
7407000	7409000	Controls and sitting on my couch
7409000	7411000	And all that, you know, but that's
7411000	7413000	I realize it's not for everybody, that's
7413000	7415000	Why we have choices, as far as the other part of your question
7415000	7417000	About iTunes and you want to leave a review
7417000	7419000	That is not on an Apple place, that's fine
7419000	7421000	We always ask, look, just tell
7421000	7423000	A friend about the show, you don't even have to leave a review
7423000	7425000	I think there are other places
7425000	7427000	That take them, I don't know of any other big big site
7427000	7429000	Like, I know of one called Podcast Alley
7429000	7431000	That has some reviews, like PodcastAlley.com
7431000	7433000	You can always use that, or Dig.com
7433000	7435000	If I could also say something really quick
7435000	7437000	About iTunes reviews, I've become really pissed
7437000	7439000	Off at some of the things I've read on there, and I know I
7439000	7441000	Shouldn't care, but I kind of do
7441000	7443000	That there's some one star reviews
7443000	7445000	First off, there's a troll on there, and I'm not gonna
7445000	7447000	Say who they are, because I'm not gonna give them attention
7447000	7449000	But all I'm gonna say is, when I find out your
7449000	7451000	IP, I'm gonna ban you, so that you
7451000	7453000	Can never download the show and listen to it again
7453000	7455000	It's not that I can't take criticism of the show
7455000	7457000	But this person is probably
7457000	7459000	Jacking off right now to listen to me talk about
7459000	7461000	Them on the air, like, this is why you would write
7461000	7463000	A negative review of a show over
7463000	7465000	And over again, that says nothing constructive
7465000	7467000	About the show, so if this is you
7467000	7469000	I want you to know you're banned from this program
7469000	7471000	We do this for free, out of
7471000	7473000	Our spare time, because, you know
7473000	7475000	We like to do it
7475000	7477000	You pay nothing for this, and for you to continue
7477000	7479000	To troll us like that is just ridiculous
7479000	7481000	You're banned, and if I ever find out
7481000	7483000	Your IP, I will block you from the domain so you can no longer
7483000	7485000	Continue to download the show
7485000	7487000	You better pray I never figure that out
7487000	7489000	So, just go get fucked with a chainsaw
7489000	7491000	If you write a negative
7491000	7493000	Review, though, and say constructive
7493000	7495000	Things, I'm fine with that
7495000	7497000	As long as you've shown that you've listened
7497000	7499000	To the program, because then I saw another
7499000	7501000	Review that talked about how we were
7501000	7503000	Box fanboys and fangirls
7503000	7505000	And I'm like, and that we were always too critical
7505000	7507000	Of Sony, and I'm like, okay, we're critical of
7507000	7509000	Everybody when we need to be
7509000	7511000	Critical, and especially tonight
7511000	7513000	We've barely had any Microsoft
7513000	7515000	News, and maybe a little bit of Sony
7515000	7517000	News, so it's kind of unfortunate because
7517000	7519000	That person clearly based their review off one
7519000	7521000	Episode of the show, I'm not mad
7521000	7523000	At that person, I just wish they would've tried
7523000	7525000	A little more before writing that, but I'm not gonna say
7525000	7527000	Oh, I'm gonna ban you because you don't like the show, that's ridiculous
7527000	7529000	But if you're trolling, that's the difference
7529000	7531000	That other guy needs to go get fucked
7531000	7533000	And I wish, more people need
7533000	7535000	To report that to Apple, too, that's what I did
7535000	7537000	So hopefully, because I just, I hate that you can't
7537000	7539000	Review reviewers, you kind of
7539000	7541000	Can, you can put, was this review helpful
7541000	7543000	And I just click no all the time, but the problem
7543000	7545000	Is when he rewrites a new review
7545000	7547000	Complaining about something in the show this week
7547000	7549000	That, you know, didn't even happen
7549000	7551000	Then it just
7551000	7553000	Gets rewritten, so
7553000	7555000	There you go
7555000	7557000	And I'm looking at chat.orensonsrated.com
7557000	7559000	ActDef says
7559000	7561000	Sky rant and FUs incoming, no not yet
7561000	7563000	Not yet
7563000	7565000	SHA100Matt says the troll is a
7565000	7567000	Former all games listener that one stars every
7567000	7569000	Show, including Bobby's, that guy
7569000	7571000	Needs to go get fucked, and like I said
7571000	7573000	He's probably jacking off right now because I'm talking
7573000	7575000	About him on the air and he got the attention he
7575000	7577000	Looked for, so I'm going to stop talking about him
7577000	7579000	And just hope that a meteor
7579000	7581000	Falls on his head
7581000	7583000	Next email, please
7583000	7585000	Okay
7585000	7587000	Um
7587000	7589000	Next email, um
7589000	7591000	Okay
7591000	7593000	I guess this was sent out to multiple people
7593000	7595000	But I'm going to use the part that's addressed
7595000	7597000	To us, um
7597000	7599000	I know what you're thinking, dslover the person who
7599000	7601000	Despises 360 wants
7601000	7603000	One, I can't read this
7605000	7607000	Why is the grammar
7607000	7609000	Okay
7609000	7611000	Almost no
7611000	7613000	I'll go read it if you need somebody
7613000	7615000	No Rob, it's not just that
7615000	7617000	They hardly use any punctuation
7617000	7619000	So it's hard for me to get phrasing on this
7619000	7621000	Just go slow
7621000	7623000	Um
7623000	7625000	Gosh
7625000	7627000	Okay, well if you were wondering
7627000	7629000	Why here's the things
7629000	7631000	That pushed me over the edge
7631000	7633000	During my boy scout, oh that's it, you're a boy scout
7633000	7635000	You know, funded by the Mormons
7635000	7637000	During a boy scout troops holiday
7637000	7639000	Party where we stay up all night
7639000	7641000	Playing games, I saw one of my
7641000	7643000	Friends playing Guitar Hero 2
7643000	7645000	And we played over 13 songs, then we played
7645000	7647000	Thunder Horse, okay you use a hyphen
7647000	7649000	In a song that doesn't even have a hyphen
7649000	7651000	In the name, okay
7651000	7653000	Then at the end of the song, I saw an achievement unlocked
7653000	7655000	And then I saw another one of my friends
7655000	7657000	Playing Burnout Revenge after he left
7657000	7659000	His 360 in my hands, I plugged in my
7659000	7661000	MP3 player to the 360 and started using
7661000	7663000	My own music like Dragon Force and Anthrax
7663000	7665000	While doing takedowns
7665000	7667000	And crash events made my eyes open
7667000	7669000	And especially when I started playing with my friend
7669000	7671000	Communication, flawless, comma
7671000	7673000	Finally, compared to the PS
7673000	7675000	Doesn't even
7675000	7677000	Need a comma, okay
7677000	7679000	Compared to the PS3, it can suck my balls
7679000	7681000	Sony, I ain't buying your stupid PS3, period
7681000	7683000	I need some recommendations
7683000	7685000	On games and accessories to buy with my system
7685000	7687000	And I'm needing one on
7687000	7689000	Should I buy it used or new
7689000	7691000	I've been waiting for a price drop on 360
7691000	7693000	Comma, doesn't need to be there
7693000	7695000	I'm wondering which, WITCH
7695000	7697000	By the way, configuration I should start off with
7697000	7699000	Sincerely, dslover, PS
7699000	7701000	Keep the shows rocking
7701000	7703000	It wasn't even addressed to the right
7703000	7705000	People, was it?
7705000	7707000	We were in there
7707000	7709000	I don't know what type of games
7709000	7711000	This guy likes, it's so hard
7711000	7713000	To recommend games when I don't
7713000	7715000	Her inner grammar Nazi
7715000	7717000	Is crying
7717000	7719000	I don't know what type of games to recommend
7719000	7721000	When, put the Dalek away
7721000	7723000	I don't know what type of games to recommend
7723000	7725000	When I don't know what type of games you like
7725000	7727000	Did he say what type of games he likes to play
7727000	7729000	Guitar Hero 2, I don't know
7729000	7731000	Get Rock Band Beatles, Guitar Hero 3
7731000	7733000	I mean Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 5
7733000	7735000	What game has takedowns in it
7735000	7737000	Oh, Burnout
7737000	7739000	Burnout Paradise
7739000	7741000	Ok, Burnout Paradise and Split Seconds
7741000	7743000	Gonna be very cool, and that comes out
7743000	7745000	Need for Speed, Fuel
7745000	7747000	I liked Fuel even though a lot of people gave it
7747000	7749000	Kinda mediocre reviews
7749000	7751000	Yeah, I don't know
7751000	7753000	See, when you say what PlayStation 3 game should I get
7753000	7755000	Oh, LittleBigPlanet, I think that game's amazing
7755000	7757000	And I think everybody should
7757000	7759000	This person asked about Xbox 360
7759000	7761000	I thought they said PS3
7761000	7763000	That was the previous one
7763000	7765000	Oh, they want Xbox 360 games they should have?
7765000	7767000	No, they want, they're thinking about getting an Xbox 360
7767000	7769000	I thought they said PS3 at the end
7769000	7771000	I wanna know, I wanna know which
7771000	7773000	Version of the Xbox 360 to get
7773000	7775000	It was the last one
7775000	7777000	That asked about what PS3 games
7777000	7779000	Were exclusive and what to buy
7779000	7781000	You need to find
7781000	7783000	One that matches what needs
7783000	7785000	Do you have an HDTV
7785000	7787000	That can benefit from HDMI
7787000	7789000	Do you have, you know
7789000	7791000	I don't think you need all the frills
7791000	7793000	But I think you do need a hard drive
7793000	7795000	So I wouldn't get the one that doesn't come with a hard drive
7795000	7797000	I think that you need to stop thinking about an Xbox 360
7797000	7799000	You need to sell your DS
7799000	7801000	And you need to freakin' hire a tutor
7801000	7803000	Wow
7803000	7805000	If you would like Dark Soccer to criticize your emails
7805000	7807000	Please send us an email
7807000	7809000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7809000	7811000	Okay, last one's from Deathwishing
7811000	7813000	Um, well
7813000	7815000	Thanks to this game, oh let's talk about Beatles
7815000	7817000	Rock Band by the way
7817000	7819000	Well thanks to this game, I like the Beatles
7819000	7821000	Sure, I liked a few songs before, but now I like them all
7821000	7823000	It doesn't even have all of them in there though
7823000	7825000	You need to go download some
7825000	7827000	Or pay for the new albums
7827000	7829000	Yes, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
7829000	7831000	It's also very cool to learn about
7831000	7833000	The, about the fan with
7833000	7835000	Photos and pictures
7835000	7837000	Dark Soccer, I'm sure you saw the Jelly Babies photo
7837000	7839000	Slayers
7839000	7841000	My favorite song by them is Here Comes the Sun
7843000	7845000	And you know what, I think that's the part
7845000	7847000	That makes harmonics and the
7847000	7849000	Surviving Beatles and relatives of
7849000	7851000	The deceased ones very happy
7851000	7853000	Is that it's like a whole new generation
7853000	7855000	Discovering the Beatles, and I think what they
7855000	7857000	Would say to your email is, mission accomplished
7857000	7859000	I think that's a very good thing
7859000	7861000	So, um
7861000	7863000	Congrats to you discovering your love for
7863000	7865000	Beatles music
7865000	7867000	I don't, I always kind of
7867000	7869000	I respect the Beatles
7869000	7871000	I don't like, love them or
7871000	7873000	Foam of the Mouth about them
7873000	7875000	Or even really buy a lot of their albums, but I respect
7875000	7877000	Them, I really understand what they did for music
7877000	7879000	And why they were so popular
7879000	7881000	But I'm thinking that maybe playing this game
7881000	7883000	Will kind of open up the catalog, but
7883000	7885000	I also like the movie Across the Universe
7885000	7887000	Somewhat, I actually
7887000	7889000	I love that movie
7889000	7891000	I didn't like the movie, but I like the parts of the movie
7891000	7893000	It had nice parts
7893000	7895000	I do, that's a perfect
7895000	7897000	Comparison, it has nice parts, but the whole
7897000	7899000	It adds up to is WTF
7899000	7901000	Well, that, therefore the Xanady rating
7901000	7903000	I actually love the whole movie
7903000	7905000	Um, I was gonna
7905000	7907000	Say something else too, yeah, if you had to say
7907000	7909000	You had a favorite song by them, Rob, what would it be?
7909000	7911000	Probably Across the Universe
7911000	7913000	But I also know
7913000	7915000	Covers of that song that kind of, you know
7915000	7917000	Skew me a little bit like that
7917000	7919000	Don't say Fiona Apple
7919000	7921000	I do like the Fiona Apple cover, but I also like
7921000	7923000	Oh, he has one too
7923000	7925000	I also really like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
7925000	7927000	William Shatner version? No
7927000	7929000	And I like Strawberry Fields Forever
7929000	7931000	And I've been to Strawberry Fields
7931000	7933000	And it's beautiful, in New York City where the
7933000	7935000	Imagine Memorial is, so I think
7935000	7937000	I think Strawberry Fields Forever
7937000	7939000	And it does make me think of that scene in Across the Universe
7939000	7941000	Which I think is one of the better scenes in the movie
7941000	7943000	That seriously is my favorite scene in the movie
7943000	7945000	I would say that's definitely one of my top songs
7945000	7947000	I met the guy that was
7947000	7949000	In the movie, oh really?
7949000	7951000	How random, I know, there you go
7951000	7953000	Well, do you have a favorite song?
7953000	7955000	In what, in Across the Universe? No, Beatles, Beatles song in general
7955000	7957000	No
7957000	7959000	Strawberry Fields isn't in the rock band, is it?
7959000	7961000	Uh, no
7961000	7963000	It should be
7963000	7965000	Um, I did want to say though
7965000	7967000	Um, one of my
7967000	7969000	Probably my favorite favorite song of
7969000	7971000	The Beatles as a
7971000	7973000	Not just the band itself, but all the members
7973000	7975000	Was Imagine by John Lennon
7975000	7977000	I mean, that is a
7977000	7979000	Song that will live on forever
7979000	7981000	And it rightfully should
7981000	7983000	I mean, I think
7983000	7985000	That song, to me, even transcends
7985000	7987000	Anything the Beatles ever did
7987000	7989000	But that's just, that's my opinion
7989000	7991000	So, alright, anyhow
7991000	7993000	Um, moving on
7993000	7995000	Why isn't my Sim dying, by the way?
7995000	7997000	Was that it for the mailbag? Yeah, I'm trying to kill the Sim too
7997000	7999000	Alright, cause he's a dick
7999000	8001000	Let's get into the FUs of the week
8001000	8003000	I don't have a story to inspire the FUs of the week
8003000	8005000	But certainly Darksiders, but her Sim is a dick
8005000	8007000	Yeah, that's right, her Sim is a dick
8007000	8009000	So the FUs of the week go to that Sim
8023000	8025000	Ooh, DarkTetsuya in chat says
8025000	8027000	Less Sims, more show, please
8027000	8029000	Um, I can do both at the same time
8029000	8031000	And you are totally not one to talk, okay?
8031000	8033000	Addict! That's right, I can text message
8033000	8035000	At five at the same time, so she can play Sims
8035000	8037000	Rob
8037000	8039000	You saw the video, didn't you? Yes, I saw the video
8039000	8041000	That was fantastic!
8041000	8043000	It was stupid! It was great!
8043000	8045000	It was the most over-the-top thing I've ever seen
8045000	8047000	I know, but it was gorgeous
8047000	8049000	And I've been to the Rocky Horror Picture
8049000	8051000	Show 300 times, and that text messaging
8051000	8053000	Crash video was the most over-the-top thing
8053000	8055000	Yay, my Sim is drowning! Alright, shut up
8055000	8057000	Why'd you build a wall around the pool?
8057000	8059000	So that he couldn't get out?
8059000	8061000	You're killing your dick, Sim
8061000	8063000	And the Sims 3 have learned
8063000	8065000	That they can pull themselves out of the pool
8065000	8067000	Without the ladder? Yeah
8067000	8069000	Damn it! They're always getting smarter
8069000	8071000	She built walls around the pool
8071000	8073000	As you should
8073000	8075000	Well, you can't put a fence around him
8075000	8077000	But what I could do is the moving
8077000	8079000	The move objects on, and then I put
8079000	8081000	The little sign, neighborhood sign
8081000	8083000	Can you douse him with gasoline? No
8083000	8085000	Alright, can we get to the FUs of the week?
8085000	8087000	I guess
8087000	8089000	Um
8089000	8091000	Um
8091000	8093000	FU to, um
8093000	8095000	Going back to work
8095000	8097000	Bogey!
8097000	8099000	Um
8099000	8101000	Huh, I had something
8101000	8103000	And I don't remember what it was
8103000	8105000	I guess FU to
8105000	8107000	Having a bunch of new locks for my arcade cabinet
8107000	8109000	But not any of the keys
8111000	8113000	That's it
8113000	8115000	Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week
8115000	8117000	I think, um, I've actually been in somewhat
8117000	8119000	Good mood, so, um, I don't know
8119000	8121000	FU to the fact that I'm not
8121000	8123000	Already at Disneyland, because that's where I'm going to be in a few days
8123000	8125000	I'm so
8125000	8127000	Freaking excited I need to be there
8127000	8129000	So, oh, did Death show up to get your little
8129000	8131000	Yep
8131000	8133000	And Death can't get to the person?
8133000	8135000	Oh yeah, Death can't do anything
8135000	8137000	Alright, anyhow
8137000	8139000	See how Sims is derailing the show?
8139000	8141000	Now you need to drown Death in a pool too
8141000	8143000	Because that'd be ironic
8143000	8145000	Back to games, Loki
8145000	8147000	Yes, I am not going to be talking
8147000	8149000	About The Sims
8149000	8151000	However, I am going to be talking about Fallout
8151000	8153000	And apparently Bethesda is suing
8153000	8155000	Interplay over the
8155000	8157000	Fallout MMO
8157000	8159000	Um
8159000	8161000	I guess, uh, you know
8161000	8163000	They wanted to make a Fallout MMO
8163000	8165000	I guess called Project
8165000	8167000	V13
8167000	8169000	And, um
8169000	8171000	You know, the problem is, though, that
8171000	8173000	I believe Bethesda has the rights
8173000	8175000	To Fallout right now
8175000	8177000	And, um, Interplay infringed on
8177000	8179000	Its trademark
8179000	8181000	So, um
8181000	8183000	Interesting
8183000	8185000	I'm surprised, though, if we did see a
8185000	8187000	Fallout MMO, that it wouldn't be coming from Bethesda
8187000	8189000	I would think that that would be kind of right up
8189000	8191000	Their alley
8191000	8193000	I think Bethesda's
8193000	8195000	Gotta be working on some MMO
8195000	8197000	Right now, but it's probably in the Elder Scrolls
8197000	8199000	Universe, not Fallout
8199000	8201000	But, who knows? Anything's possible
8201000	8203000	Both those games are huge. How about combining
8203000	8205000	Them?
8205000	8207000	Nuclear Holocaust in, like, the medieval
8207000	8209000	Times? A nuclear holocaust hits
8209000	8211000	The world of, what's the name of the world that
8211000	8213000	The Elder Scrolls is set in?
8213000	8215000	I can't remember. But that's what we need
8215000	8217000	We need a crossover game of the two
8217000	8219000	And it's an MMO. There you go
8219000	8221000	Or that they
8221000	8223000	Turn nomadic and they're back
8223000	8225000	Now to, like, you know, medieval
8225000	8227000	Technology
8227000	8229000	You know I still haven't played Fallout 3
8229000	8231000	Like, I'm like
8231000	8233000	It's Oblivion with guns. I don't know how I wouldn't like
8233000	8235000	This game, but I just somehow haven't played it
8235000	8237000	I'm too addicted to Warcraft
8237000	8239000	I have Fallout 3 and I have still not played it
8239000	8241000	I also have Left 4 Dead and still have not played it
8241000	8243000	Can I borrow your Fallout 3 if you're not gonna play it?
8243000	8245000	See, Fallout 3 is pretty cool
8245000	8247000	Is it?
8247000	8249000	Becky's Husband was playing
8249000	8251000	Quite a bit of it and it just looks
8251000	8253000	Really cool. I liked it
8253000	8255000	No, I've never heard anything but good things about it
8255000	8257000	And even when I've watched it, it looks like a lot of fun
8257000	8259000	Remember guys, I don't have time to play
8259000	8261000	Every game, especially when you're addicted to an MMO
8261000	8263000	Actually, no, I take that back
8263000	8265000	I think I did sell it already
8265000	8267000	Cause I don't have a lot of
8267000	8269000	Games anymore
8269000	8271000	Wow, you unloaded all your games? Why?
8271000	8273000	Different reasons
8273000	8275000	Alright, well
8275000	8277000	Do you think Bethesda has any ground to stand on with this?
8277000	8279000	I mean, do you think they'll win, Loki?
8279000	8281000	Yeah, if they have the rights for it right now
8281000	8283000	I mean, I know Interplay I think was the one that actually
8283000	8285000	Came out with the original Fallout, but
8285000	8287000	Um
8287000	8289000	I don't know, they're saying that
8289000	8291000	This has caused
8291000	8293000	Immediate, substantial
8293000	8295000	Inrepairable harm, I guess
8295000	8297000	I don't know
8297000	8299000	It probably wasn't going to end up working out for them anyways
8299000	8301000	Okay, well
8301000	8303000	I want to move on to one more story
8303000	8305000	Before we get to your phone calls tonight
8305000	8307000	And it has to do with the Nintendo Wii
8307000	8309000	Apparently, Nintendo
8309000	8311000	Is going to price
8311000	8313000	The Wii
8313000	8315000	Rumor is that the Wii is going to get its price drop
8315000	8317000	The first week of October
8317000	8319000	Which makes sense, cause the machine still costs $250
8319000	8321000	And you know, isn't the Xbox 360
8321000	8323000	Now $199?
8323000	8325000	Yep
8325000	8327000	And it has been for a while, so
8327000	8329000	I think the Wii is probably going to have to move
8329000	8331000	To a price drop
8331000	8333000	Their sales have been kind of slowing down
8333000	8335000	Well, plus it's time to update with the pack too
8335000	8337000	You know, I think it's inevitable
8337000	8339000	They're going to put Wii Motion Plus in it
8339000	8341000	And Wii Sports Relevance
8341000	8343000	I think is what you're going to find
8343000	8345000	In the new pack
8345000	8347000	No?
8347000	8349000	No, it's going to stay the same
8349000	8351000	Really?
8351000	8353000	I think it is
8353000	8355000	You don't think they'll bundle in an extra game?
8355000	8357000	No, because you can't get Wii Sports by itself
8357000	8359000	What about a Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort bundle?
8359000	8361000	What about it comes with Wii Sports
8361000	8363000	No, because that would impact their sales of Wii Sports Resort
8363000	8365000	Really?
8365000	8367000	Yeah
8367000	8369000	Well, we'll see
8369000	8371000	This is from an early version of a Walmart ad
8371000	8373000	But apparently it is coming soon
8373000	8375000	I don't see the exact price though
8375000	8377000	It's just apparently the ad says
8377000	8379000	That it's coming
8379000	8381000	So we don't know exactly what the new price is
8381000	8383000	But
8383000	8385000	Now, Nintendo doesn't
8385000	8387000	Do Tokyo Game Show
8387000	8389000	But they will be participating in a thing called
8389000	8391000	Kyoto Cross Media Experience 2009
8391000	8393000	But that's at the end of September
8393000	8395000	September 26th to October 4th
8395000	8397000	So if they're going to announce a price drop
8397000	8399000	That's when it's kind of expected
8399000	8401000	To happen, because Nintendo never does
8401000	8403000	Tokyo Game Show
8403000	8405000	I don't remember the reason behind it
8405000	8407000	They kind of do their own media thing in Japan
8407000	8409000	Got it
8409000	8411000	So, very interesting
8411000	8413000	It is
8413000	8415000	I wonder if there will be a fitness thing
8415000	8417000	Like maybe the original Wii Fit
8417000	8419000	Or something, I don't know
8419000	8421000	Because then you'd have to throw in the Wii Fit
8421000	8423000	Balance board
8423000	8425000	I can see maybe some holiday bundles
8425000	8427000	If they're going to do anything
8427000	8429000	What they're going to do is some crappy
8429000	8431000	Holiday bundle later on
8431000	8433000	That it's going to have new Super Mario Brothers
8433000	8435000	Wii bundled in it, and maybe that's it
8435000	8437000	But, you know
8437000	8439000	At the same time, they may think that their
8439000	8441000	Game system stands alone
8441000	8443000	That it's just super awesome
8443000	8445000	That they're going to drop the price a little bit
8445000	8447000	Just to kind of spark some more sales
8447000	8449000	But, I don't know
8449000	8451000	I mean, we'll see
8451000	8453000	Yeah, I mean there's really nothing on the Wii
8453000	8455000	I'm really looking forward to
8455000	8457000	Even the new Super Mario Brothers, I'm very meh about
8457000	8459000	I kind of wish
8459000	8461000	I was just thinking the other day
8461000	8463000	Even though I understand they have the new
8463000	8465000	Super Mario Brothers and so forth
8465000	8467000	I wish they would just release a game called
8467000	8469000	Super Mario Brothers 4
8469000	8471000	And make it very similar to like Mario 3
8471000	8473000	But with the whole like
8473000	8475000	New graphics and the types of things
8475000	8477000	That you can do on the Wii
8477000	8479000	That's not 3D
8479000	8481000	Would that be Super Mario World?
8481000	8483000	Well, I would like to just see them make a game
8483000	8485000	Called Super Mario Brothers 4
8485000	8487000	That kind of does away with
8487000	8489000	You know, a lot of the changes to the Mario Universe
8489000	8491000	That might be too difficult for Grandma
8491000	8493000	Maybe
8493000	8495000	Maybe I just live in this weird fanboy bubble
8495000	8497000	Or I just miss the old school days
8497000	8499000	Of Nintendo, but
8499000	8501000	It'd be kind of cool
8501000	8503000	Alright, I guess it's time
8503000	8505000	For us to open up the Skype line
8505000	8507000	We're ready to take some calls
8507000	8509000	1-877-GAME-OLR
8509000	8511000	Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like to
8511000	8513000	Give a comment on any topic that you've heard about tonight
8513000	8515000	And we'll take some calls
8515000	8517000	To see what's on your mind
8517000	8519000	I'll ask if there's any last minute stories
8519000	8521000	Here in the studio because we have a delay
8521000	8523000	Oh, no, we just, we're getting our first call
8523000	8525000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8525000	8527000	Well, I'm the first caller, hey, this is X-Link
8527000	8529000	Well, hello X-Link, congratulations, you've
8529000	8531000	Beaten some of our serial phone callers
8531000	8533000	That seem to get through every week
8533000	8535000	It's been a little while since we've heard from you, what's on your mind?
8535000	8537000	Yes, actually I played
8537000	8539000	A really cool demo on the Playstation Store this weekend
8539000	8541000	It was called the Half Minute Hero
8541000	8543000	Which was really interesting
8543000	8545000	It had a Final Fantasy 1
8545000	8547000	Dragon War 1
8547000	8549000	Type, you know, NES
8549000	8551000	Roleplaying type feel to it
8551000	8553000	But they give you 30 seconds
8553000	8555000	From the time you start
8555000	8557000	To get to the boss
8557000	8559000	To beat the boss
8559000	8561000	But in order to do this
8561000	8563000	You like, really, it plays like
8563000	8565000	Basically you're playing the game in fast forward
8565000	8567000	I've heard about this, isn't this the one, doesn't it switch
8567000	8569000	Genres too, like every 30 seconds?
8569000	8571000	I remember, there's a demo for that
8571000	8573000	Out now? Yes
8573000	8575000	Is that on PSP? It's coming soon
8575000	8577000	Yeah, it's coming
8577000	8579000	It's coming on, it's supposedly October 20th
8579000	8581000	Is the release date for it
8581000	8583000	Is that on PSP or PS3?
8583000	8585000	PSP
8585000	8587000	Oh, I want to check that out, that game, I remember
8587000	8589000	When we reported on that game and I was like, oh, it's kind of like
8589000	8591000	WarioWare, but like
8591000	8593000	It sounds even cooler than, what was the
8593000	8595000	WarioWare clone we got on PSP, WTF, right?
8595000	8597000	WTF was kind of funny
8597000	8599000	This sounds even cooler, like
8599000	8601000	I definitely want to check this out, so
8601000	8603000	Did it feel like WarioWare to you, XLink?
8603000	8605000	Was it? Kind of, yeah, but it had
8605000	8607000	More of a, when I played it, it had
8607000	8609000	More of the Roleplaying type feel, so it's
8609000	8611000	More like playing Final Fantasy 1
8611000	8613000	On fast forward, like I said before, so it was
8613000	8615000	Really good though
8615000	8617000	Cool
8617000	8619000	How far did the demo let you go? I mean, it sounds like
8619000	8621000	With games like that, I wouldn't think you could do much of a demo
8621000	8623000	Because, well, you start on
8623000	8625000	This small island, and they're like, okay, you're
8625000	8627000	Here, the boss is here, go
8627000	8629000	And then they give you the 30 seconds, we'll count
8629000	8631000	Down, and then
8631000	8633000	There's like one or two islands you can choose, the first one
8633000	8635000	Does that one, and the second one's more complicated
8635000	8637000	Where it's like, here's the
8637000	8639000	Town, here's where the
8639000	8641000	Boss is, here's where it doesn't, where you can get more gold
8641000	8643000	For, you know, items and stuff
8643000	8645000	But in the town, it has a statue
8645000	8647000	Where we'll reset the timer
8647000	8649000	The 30 seconds, depending on how much
8649000	8651000	Gold per time you do it
8651000	8653000	So the demo
8653000	8655000	Was cool enough for you to go pre-order the game?
8655000	8657000	Oh, definitely, I would definitely
8657000	8659000	Pre-order it
8659000	8661000	It had like
8661000	8663000	Other elements I saw from the
8663000	8665000	Trailer, which really piqued my interest
8665000	8667000	Like shootings and stuff like that
8667000	8669000	And summons
8669000	8671000	A successful demo, thank you for calling me
8671000	8673000	To tell me about it, because I'm gonna go
8673000	8675000	Put that in my queue to download my PSP
8675000	8677000	No, no problem
8677000	8679000	I got to get my PS3 and PSP to work together
8679000	8681000	And I got a better memory card for my PSP
8681000	8683000	I'm all about checking out all the latest
8683000	8685000	Demos and so forth, because I know I've been critical
8685000	8687000	Of the PSP as a gaming device
8687000	8689000	But there are some gems out there, there's some real
8689000	8691000	Gems out there, definitely, and I'm looking forward to
8691000	8693000	Two percent, which comes out in about two weeks
8693000	8695000	I already had that pre-ordered and paid for
8695000	8697000	Awesome, well anything
8697000	8699000	Else on your mind tonight, buddy?
8699000	8701000	Nah, not really, I've been too busy
8701000	8703000	Doing my live journal game, so I've been
8703000	8705000	Really trying to catch up back on the
8705000	8707000	News here during the weekend, so
8707000	8709000	Of course I'll send it to you guys and give you guys five stars
8709000	8711000	I know what you're talking about, and I hope it's
8711000	8713000	Fun for you, in fact I'm going to be talking about
8713000	8715000	Live journal games on this show in a couple weeks
8715000	8717000	Because I'm going to be hosting another one, and I want people to
8717000	8719000	Sign up and play
8719000	8721000	Real quickly, it was very unique
8721000	8723000	The way some of you guys approached me and told me
8723000	8725000	Oh hey, if you like doing this kind of stuff
8725000	8727000	You might like doing this, so I signed up for it
8727000	8729000	It was very unique and very fun
8729000	8731000	And I got to meet a lot of
8731000	8733000	New people through it, and if
8733000	8735000	Everybody has to do it or wants to do it
8735000	8764000	I'll give you more details in a couple weeks here on Orange Lawns Radio
8764000	8766000	He kind of already had it lined out
8766000	8768000	He spoke very well, obviously tested
8768000	8770000	This connection before, and you know
8770000	8772000	Just kind of laid it all out there
8772000	8774000	When I asked him if there was anything else, he kind of
8774000	8776000	Added a little more, and I just
8776000	8778000	Very good, everybody take notes
8778000	8780000	From that last call, so sorry about that
8780000	8782000	Rama, now you have to follow that
8784000	8786000	I'm not trying to say we get bad calls
8786000	8788000	I'm just saying that if you want to know what I think
8788000	8790000	A perfect phone call is, that last call was great
8790000	8792000	So now you have to follow it Rama
8792000	8794000	What's on your mind tonight?
8794000	8796000	Well, I will do my best, but first off
8796000	8798000	Me and Jodea, we went to a
8798000	8800000	Classic gaming convention yesterday
8800000	8802000	Called Gamecore
8802000	8804000	First of them post
8804000	8806000	A link in the chat
8806000	8808000	Makes for great radio, doesn't it?
8808000	8810000	Yes, exactly, that's okay, I'll forgive you
8810000	8812000	Thank you, the pictures are on
8812000	8814000	Small and large size, because it was
8814000	8816000	A lot of stuff
8816000	8818000	I can call this convention like
8818000	8820000	Jamie's vault
8820000	8822000	Game six, that's how much
8822000	8824000	Stuff was there, you had a lot of
8824000	8826000	Classic arcade machines there
8826000	8828000	That were for sale, such as the
8828000	8830000	Simpsons arcade machine for like 400 bucks
8830000	8832000	Oh my god, I would have went home with that
8832000	8834000	Seriously? Even though I'm supposed to be
8834000	8836000	Saving for a new car right now, I would have went home with that
8836000	8838000	Dude, it was cash and carry
8838000	8840000	Do they really?
8840000	8842000	Oh my god, I should get an arcade machine
8842000	8844000	For my house, you should
8844000	8846000	Wouldn't my roommate fucking love that?
8846000	8848000	Sorry, by the way
8848000	8850000	Rob, I met your picture gallery, there's a lot of broken pictures
8850000	8852000	You might want to check that out
8852000	8854000	I don't know if it's me or...
8854000	8856000	It's an issue with the gallery sulfur, but if you click on the broken
8856000	8858000	Link, the picture will actually show up
8858000	8860000	Okay, I probably shouldn't look at them all
8860000	8862000	During the show, but I am looking at some of these things
8862000	8864000	Yeah, I see some things that are reminiscent
8864000	8866000	Of classic gaming expos, certainly, did they have a lot
8866000	8868000	Of playable stuff out there?
8868000	8870000	Pretty much they did, a lot of
8870000	8872000	Arcade machines, they had a
8872000	8874000	Roll of Dreamcast set up to celebrate
8874000	8876000	The tenth anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast
8876000	8878000	There was an actual Neo Geo
8878000	8880000	MVS machine set up, not the whole
8880000	8882000	Arcade unit, but the actual console
8882000	8884000	And board, you know?
8884000	8886000	I have an MVS board now
8886000	8888000	Sweet
8888000	8890000	Dude, what is up with everybody getting fucking Neo Geo
8890000	8892000	MVS boards? You, Bobby
8892000	8894000	No, okay, here's the thing
8894000	8896000	They threw it in with my cabinet
8896000	8898000	Because I was testing
8898000	8900000	To test my cabinet, they plugged an MVS board
8900000	8902000	In there, and they're like, okay
8902000	8904000	And he's all, hey, you want this board for
8904000	8906000	You know, 60 bucks, and I'll throw in this bootleg
8906000	8908000	48-in-1 cart with him, like
8908000	8910000	What?
8910000	8912000	What? I am so uncool
8912000	8914000	I have to get one
8914000	8916000	I have to fit in with
8916000	8918000	Everybody else, I'm gonna have to get a fucking Neo Geo
8918000	8920000	Now, just so I can feel cool
8920000	8922000	Sorry, Rama, I didn't mean to derail your call
8922000	8924000	See, this is an example of where the hosts
8924000	8926000	Derail your call
8926000	8928000	Which happens, what town was this
8928000	8930000	Convention in again?
8930000	8932000	Oaks, Pennsylvania, it was about
8932000	8934000	20 minutes outside of Philly
8934000	8936000	I wonder
8936000	8938000	Was it at, like, an actual classic gaming store
8938000	8940000	Or is there one, like, right nearby?
8940000	8942000	No, it was an actual
8942000	8944000	Convention center
8944000	8946000	Oddly enough, a lot of the people that are selling
8946000	8948000	Old school games and accessories
8948000	8950000	Were right out of Jersey
8950000	8952000	Because there was a classic gaming store in Pennsylvania
8952000	8954000	I was gonna visit when I was out there
8954000	8956000	Because, you know, I spent several weeks in Allentown for work
8956000	8958000	And I just never got out to the store I was gonna go to
8958000	8960000	I don't even know if it's still in business, it was a few years ago
8960000	8962000	I'm sorry
8962000	8964000	Did they do panels or anything else at this con
8964000	8966000	Or was it just mostly, like, a sales floor
8966000	8968000	That you could test the merchandise
8968000	8970000	There were panels there
8970000	8972000	But I didn't get a chance to check them out
8972000	8974000	But what they were mostly also focusing on was
8974000	8976000	Nerdcore rappers
8976000	8978000	And Chiptunes music
8978000	8980000	Nice
8980000	8982000	The list of people that were there
8982000	8984000	Performing was MC Lars, YT Cracker
8984000	8986000	Super 8-Bit Brothers
8986000	8988000	Armadillo Tank
8988000	8990000	This is cool
8990000	8992000	Yes, yes
8992000	8994000	Did you go to the concerts at all?
8994000	8996000	I went to a couple of the concerts
8996000	8998000	I walked in on Super 8-Bit Brothers
8998000	9000000	And since I was dressed as Luigi
9000000	9002000	I got a lot of props and shout-outs
9002000	9004000	Very nice
9004000	9006000	There was actually a couple of classic cars there
9006000	9008000	Such as the DeLorean and Kit
9008000	9010000	Huh
9010000	9012000	Well, sounds like you had a lot of fun at the convention
9012000	9014000	Is this something that travels
9014000	9016000	Or was it just the one place
9016000	9018000	I was talking to some of the people
9018000	9020000	That helped create it
9020000	9022000	And they were seeing some ups and downs
9022000	9024000	They had with it
9024000	9026000	So they're looking to do things a little bit differently
9026000	9028000	For next year
9028000	9030000	And also I have a bit of a game review too
9030000	9032000	Oh, please
9032000	9034000	Yes
9034000	9036000	There was a company there called Storm City Games
9036000	9038000	Independent publishing group
9038000	9040000	They had a game there
9040000	9042000	They were demoing out called Hands-On Tangrams
9042000	9044000	Like the Tangrams
9044000	9046000	Like we used to play with in junior high school
9046000	9048000	That game came out a long time ago
9048000	9050000	Interesting
9050000	9052000	Alright, well how was it
9052000	9054000	Did you get your Tangram on
9054000	9056000	Yes I did
9056000	9058000	And for 20 bucks I think it was well worth it
9058000	9060000	This is like a perfect time waster
9060000	9062000	If you need to kill 10-20 minutes while you're waiting for something
9062000	9064000	I came out back in spring
9064000	9066000	Okay, Debbie Downer
9066000	9068000	Hands-On Tangrams
9068000	9070000	They said they had the demo
9070000	9072000	And this is actually coming out October
9072000	9074000	Maybe it's a new platform or a new version
9074000	9076000	Maybe that's what's going on
9076000	9078000	Probably so
9078000	9080000	Alright, well Rama we're going to let you go get some more calls
9080000	9082000	But I'm glad you had fun at the convention
9082000	9084000	Sure, sure, sure
9084000	9086000	Can we talk to Jamie for one quick second please
9086000	9088000	I suppose
9088000	9090000	Hello
9090000	9092000	Hello
9092000	9094000	Hi
9094000	9096000	While we were there they were actually
9096000	9098000	Doing viewings for
9098000	9100000	Nerdcore Rising
9100000	9102000	Which is the film by
9102000	9104000	MC Frontalot
9104000	9106000	And they were actually giving a couple of them out
9106000	9108000	I
9108000	9110000	Had asked Rama to go up there
9110000	9112000	And see if he could win one
9112000	9114000	And he did
9114000	9116000	So we're going to be giving it to you Jamie
9116000	9118000	What
9118000	9120000	Yes
9120000	9122000	It's a copy of Nerdcore Rising
9122000	9124000	And if you open it up on the DVD itself
9124000	9126000	It is signed by
9126000	9128000	MC Frontalot
9128000	9130000	And it says
9130000	9132000	Win win win on there, we don't know exactly
9132000	9134000	Who wrote that on the DVD
9134000	9136000	But we think it was Lars
9136000	9138000	Sweet, we're not exactly sure
9138000	9140000	But yeah, just wanted to let you know that
9140000	9142000	And who is this on the phone right now
9142000	9144000	This would be Giove Day, Patty
9144000	9146000	Hello, well welcome to the show, I don't think you've ever
9146000	9148000	Called in before, but what a great first
9148000	9150000	Call, we like when new
9150000	9152000	People on the show give stuff away
9152000	9154000	I don't remember her talk, I know she's been in
9154000	9156000	Chat and Twitter and all that
9156000	9158000	We've heard her
9158000	9160000	With Rama before
9160000	9162000	Well that's awesome
9162000	9164000	And then you have to deliver it to me in person
9164000	9166000	I will attempt that
9166000	9168000	I swear to God
9168000	9170000	I will try and attempt that one
9170000	9172000	If not, I am actually
9172000	9174000	Looking to get to New York, possibly as soon as
9174000	9176000	The end of the year, so I may just have to come pick it up
9176000	9178000	That would work too
9178000	9180000	On behalf of Dark Soccer
9180000	9182000	And then I can forget to give it to her
9182000	9184000	I'm just
9184000	9186000	Just kidding, no that sounds really awesome
9186000	9188000	That's so awesome
9188000	9190000	Of some of our listeners to do
9190000	9192000	Thank you guys
9192000	9194000	And how did you like the con, Giove Day
9194000	9196000	How did you like it
9196000	9198000	I liked it a lot, it was
9198000	9200000	I'm not really big into loud
9200000	9202000	Crazy conventions, it was nice, it was mellow
9202000	9204000	But there was enough stuff there to do
9204000	9206000	That you didn't feel that you were bored
9206000	9208000	Alright
9208000	9210000	Very cool, and any favorite classic game
9210000	9212000	That you discovered or something that you played
9212000	9214000	No, I was actually
9214000	9216000	In the booth most of the time
9216000	9218000	Chatting with the guy next to us
9218000	9220000	Who was selling all the D&D
9220000	9222000	Stuff and he sold me
9222000	9224000	D&D dice for two bucks
9224000	9226000	That made me happy
9226000	9228000	Hey, nerds need their dice
9228000	9230000	Yes, we do
9230000	9232000	Well, we're gonna let you go so we can roll the dice
9232000	9234000	On another phone call, but thank you so much you guys
9234000	9236000	That sounds like an awesome present and you guys didn't have to
9236000	9238000	Do that, so I know Dark Soccer
9238000	9240000	Is bouncing as she's playing The Sims
9240000	9242000	Hey, I'm bouncing in like
9242000	9244000	Most of my parts, they're quivering with joy
9244000	9246000	Alright
9246000	9248000	Before this gets dirty, I'm gonna have to let you go
9248000	9250000	Night guys
9250000	9252000	Alright, take care
9252000	9254000	We've had some good phone calls tonight
9254000	9256000	Any call that gives Dark Soccer like something
9256000	9258000	Free is always gonna be a good call
9258000	9260000	That makes my liver quiver
9260000	9262000	There's just no way that that's gonna be a bad call
9262000	9264000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch, wait, did I answer this one?
9264000	9266000	There we go, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9266000	9268000	This is Cheeseburger
9268000	9270000	Hi, Cheeseburger, have you been on the show before?
9270000	9272000	I don't think you've ever called
9272000	9274000	No, I haven't, I've been in chat
9274000	9276000	You've got a deeper voice than I imagined
9276000	9278000	I've heard your name before
9278000	9280000	Like reading the Twitters and the chat and all that
9280000	9282000	And I just want to point out
9282000	9284000	The icon on Skype is
9284000	9286000	A picture of a cheeseburger
9286000	9288000	Why do you go by cheeseburger?
9288000	9290000	I know why I guess by cheeseburger, because I read his emails
9290000	9292000	Are you just a big fan of cheeseburgers?
9292000	9294000	No, it's extremely similar to my last name
9294000	9296000	Oh
9296000	9298000	See, I know
9298000	9300000	Okay, I get it
9300000	9302000	If you go on the wiki, I put it on there
9302000	9304000	Alright, cheeseburger, I'll stop interrogating you
9304000	9306000	Because you called us, what's on your mind tonight?
9306000	9308000	I know you played WoW for a while
9308000	9310000	And I just want to know why you got back into it
9310000	9312000	I didn't know you got back into it
9312000	9318000	I'm trying to think how far I want to get into this on a public radio show
9318000	9322000	The reason why I had to stop playing WoW
9322000	9326000	Was I found myself kind of getting too involved
9326000	9328000	With some of the stuff that was going on in the guild
9328000	9330000	And unfortunately
9330000	9334000	As seems to always happen in various guilds in WoW
9334000	9336000	There was some very unfortunate guild drama
9336000	9338000	Where people went their separate ways
9338000	9340000	And it really kind of turned me off to the game
9340000	9342000	Because part of me
9342000	9344000	Actually, all of me felt it was very unnecessary
9344000	9348000	And that I think if people across the board
9348000	9350000	Had been a little more reasonable
9350000	9352000	And open minded and hadn't reacted
9352000	9356000	And I think some very selfish things were done by certain people
9356000	9358000	And god, I hope I'm going to get in deep hot water
9358000	9360000	For getting into this on my radio show
9360000	9362000	But unfortunately, that's just kind of how I view things
9362000	9364000	And I just thought
9364000	9366000	You know, I am taking this too much
9366000	9368000	For something that's an online game
9368000	9370000	I need to just step away and involve real life for a while
9370000	9372000	And you know, at the same time
9372000	9374000	I was starting to date somebody new
9374000	9376000	And kind of get into a relationship
9376000	9380000	And you know, anything that happens in real life
9380000	9382000	Is more important than WoW
9382000	9384000	WoW is what you go to when you're bored
9384000	9386000	So the reason why I got back in
9386000	9388000	Well, I found a new group of people to play with
9388000	9390000	That have different goals in the game
9390000	9392000	That aren't so focused on the end game rating
9392000	9394000	And so forth
9394000	9396000	And just kind of rediscovering what makes WoW fun
9396000	9400000	And also I dumped the guy I was seeing
9400000	9404000	So I have a little more spare time now
9404000	9408000	It's kind of like what I told one of my friends
9408000	9410000	When she criticized me, she's like
9410000	9412000	I can't believe you went back to Warcraft
9412000	9414000	I said, this is what depressed people do
9414000	9416000	I wouldn't really say I'm depressed
9416000	9418000	It's just, you know, it's a time waster
9418000	9420000	But like I said, I think real life
9420000	9422000	If there's stuff going on in real life
9422000	9424000	It will always be better than WoW
9424000	9426000	And this is kind of what I tell people
9426000	9428000	I don't watch a lot of TV
9428000	9430000	There's some things I watch
9430000	9432000	But I don't watch as much as probably most people do
9432000	9434000	I'm playing while I'm not playing as many console games
9434000	9436000	It's just my entertainment of choice
9436000	9438000	But, you know, finding a balance is important
9440000	9442000	What realm do you play on?
9442000	9444000	Right now I am playing Alliance on Blade's Edge
9444000	9446000	Is the server I'm playing on
9446000	9448000	Is it alright if I join your guild?
9448000	9450000	Possibly, send me an email after the show
9450000	9452000	It's not my guild
9452000	9454000	That's the difference this time
9454000	9456000	Actually, I wasn't in charge of the guild before
9456000	9458000	But I knew the people in charge more
9458000	9460000	Than I know the ones here
9460000	9462000	As long as you're not a dick
9462000	9464000	Which you don't sound like from your phone call
9464000	9466000	I don't see why not
9466000	9468000	Cool!
9468000	9470000	Alright, well you take care of yourself
9470000	9472000	Thanks for the call, okay?
9472000	9474000	Alright, you too. See ya. Take care
9474000	9476000	See, I was gonna say at the end of that phone call
9476000	9478000	For the Horde! But then I was like, oh shit, I'm Alliance now
9478000	9480000	I can't say that. I'm playing one of each
9480000	9482000	You're playing what? One of each
9482000	9484000	One of each? You're on a different server, right?
9484000	9486000	I am, but I'll play on another
9486000	9488000	I think I'm actually gonna pay for it
9488000	9490000	But I'm playing
9490000	9492000	A blood elf
9492000	9494000	And I'm playing a goat girl
9494000	9496000	Alright, fair enough
9496000	9498000	You know what I mean by a goat girl
9498000	9500000	Yes, Draenai
9500000	9502000	Draeno!
9502000	9504000	Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
9504000	9506000	And those were all excellent calls tonight, so thank you very much
9506000	9508000	I think we'll leave it at that
9508000	9510000	I do still see calls coming in
9510000	9512000	But no offense, all those guys that are calling in
9512000	9514000	Have been on the show before
9514000	9516000	So we're gonna leave this as a
9516000	9518000	New caller, well even though Rama's not a new caller
9518000	9520000	So
9520000	9522000	Two out of three at best
9522000	9524000	Plus about three phone calls
9524000	9526000	Tonight's good, so
9526000	9528000	If you didn't get through tonight though
9528000	9530000	Twitter topics next week, we didn't get a lot tonight
9530000	9532000	And don't forget you can always interact with the chat room
9532000	9534000	Mailbag! Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com
9534000	9536000	Always plenty of ways to interact with the program
9536000	9538000	So let's get into some
9538000	9540000	Last minute stories, I never
9540000	9542000	Allowed Loki the chance
9542000	9544000	I'm not gonna steal one more cookie, because they're delicious
9544000	9546000	That's fine, they're there for stealing
9546000	9548000	And we can throw away all the
9548000	9550000	Bacon stuff, except for my plate
9550000	9552000	I need that plate
9552000	9554000	Well, why don't we feed all the bacon stuff to Dan?
9554000	9556000	Well, if he wants it
9556000	9558000	What the hell is this crap
9558000	9560000	Anyways, Sonic is
9560000	9562000	Possibly gonna come back in the way that it
9562000	9564000	Should've been coming back in the first place
9564000	9566000	None of these 3D
9566000	9568000	Crapfests with were
9568000	9570000	Hedgehogs and that kind of stuff
9570000	9572000	No, we're actually gonna get a brand
9572000	9574000	New 2D HD
9574000	9576000	Sonic the Hedgehog game
9576000	9578000	It's gonna be as old school fun
9578000	9580000	As it can get
9580000	9582000	And it's in the early planning stages right now
9582000	9584000	But they do have a wonderful teaser for
9584000	9586000	What they're calling as Project Needlemouse
9586000	9588000	The working title for the game
9588000	9590000	So that's kinda neat
9590000	9592000	King of Fighters
9592000	9594000	You may remember that they had a
9594000	9596000	Japanese
9596000	9598000	Shoot-em-up version of King of Fighters
9598000	9600000	Called Sky Stage
9600000	9602000	To Xbox Live Arcade
9602000	9604000	Well now it's also making its way
9604000	9606000	To arcades as well
9606000	9608000	And
9608000	9610000	I don't know man
9610000	9612000	I've seen screenshots and video of this
9612000	9614000	It just looks weird
9614000	9616000	I don't think King of Fighters really translates itself
9616000	9618000	Well into
9618000	9620000	It's one of those things I wanna see just once though
9620000	9622000	Just like for the WTF value
9622000	9624000	Yeah
9624000	9626000	By the way, the Sonic 2D thing
9626000	9628000	I'm a little nervous about that
9628000	9630000	And I'm with everybody else in the camp
9630000	9632000	Of OMG Awesome
9632000	9634000	Sonic 2D
9634000	9636000	Hopefully it's kinda influenced by Mega Man 9
9636000	9638000	Just to go back to your damn roots
9638000	9640000	But I am a little worried because
9640000	9642000	This is like the third time Sonic has been
9642000	9644000	Reinvented
9644000	9646000	And the last few have not been that great
9646000	9648000	So I really hope this one's good
9648000	9650000	I'm hopeful
9650000	9652000	But I'm a little apprehensive and I think I have the right to be
9652000	9654000	As do all the rest of you
9654000	9656000	Yeah
9656000	9658000	And then
9658000	9660000	Also to kinda go along with
9660000	9662000	Some stuff we were talking about before
9662000	9664000	You may remember that porn has been
9664000	9666000	Kind of
9666000	9668000	Making its way to the Playstation 3
9668000	9670000	Playstation Network
9670000	9672000	In Japan
9672000	9674000	Well now apparently Vivid Entertainment
9674000	9676000	Is hoping to do the same thing in the US
9676000	9678000	They're making a stand
9678000	9680000	Trying to convince
9680000	9682000	Sony that their porn
9682000	9684000	Should be on
9684000	9686000	The Playstation Network
9686000	9688000	Bravo I say
9688000	9690000	So that'll be kind of interesting
9690000	9692000	And
9692000	9694000	Apparently
9694000	9696000	You know to kinda go back to some of the
9696000	9698000	Piracy stuff we were talking about
9698000	9700000	We may have talked about this in the past
9700000	9702000	But yes
9702000	9704000	They have finally released the sequel
9704000	9706000	The official sequel to
9706000	9708000	Don't Copy That Fluffy
9708000	9710000	Don't Copy That 2
9710000	9712000	And let me tell you this much
9712000	9714000	And then promptly copied a floppy
9714000	9716000	And it's horrible
9716000	9718000	If I still had a floppy I would copy it
9718000	9720000	And my favorite
9720000	9722000	Thing about this is they're talking about how
9722000	9724000	Oh copying is a crime and stuff
9724000	9726000	And yeah piracy is a crime
9726000	9728000	Whatever but the guy that they show
9728000	9730000	At the very end there's like a real pirate
9730000	9732000	I guess who
9732000	9734000	He was selling copies of stuff
9734000	9736000	Okay I think that's something
9736000	9738000	That's gonna probably land you in jail more than
9738000	9740000	Pirating games for your own use
9740000	9742000	Can I get into this a little bit
9742000	9744000	Because I haven't seen the video
9744000	9746000	I've purposely not watched the video because I
9746000	9748000	Thought maybe I would watch it here on the show
9748000	9750000	So how long is it? Is it long?
9750000	9752000	No it shouldn't be that long
9752000	9754000	About five minutes
9754000	9756000	Well it's got a funny song
9756000	9758000	He raps in it
9758000	9760000	And we can laugh at it
9760000	9762000	I don't know legally how much of it we can play here on the show
9762000	9764000	It's a YouTube clip
9764000	9766000	I think they want it
9766000	9768000	Freely distributed everywhere
9768000	9770000	Even if we're critical of it?
9770000	9772000	Even if we're critical of it
9772000	9774000	So are we gonna copy the
9774000	9776000	The thing
9776000	9778000	Read that in a minute DarkSocker I know what you're looking at
9778000	9780000	It's related
9780000	9782000	Where is it here who linked it in chat here
9782000	9784000	It's this right
9784000	9786000	Okay hold on I'm bringing it up in studio sorry
9786000	9788000	Okay here it is
9788000	9790000	Don't copy that floppy 2
9790000	9792000	Welcome back to 90's Time Trip
9792000	9794000	It's that anti-piracy classic
9794000	9796000	Don't copy that floppy
9796000	9798000	Can I just skip ahead here
9798000	9800000	I don't wanna watch this whole damn thing
9800000	9802000	I just wanna see what the song sounds like
9802000	9804000	And I wanna see that bit at the end
9814000	9816000	He looks kinda like Max Headroom but black
9816000	9818000	Like is it just me?
9818000	9820000	But that's kinda what it looks like
9820000	9822000	Sorta
9822000	9824000	Don't copy it
9824000	9826000	Oh he does
9826000	9828000	See?
9840000	9842000	I don't know it's not
9842000	9844000	As funny as the other one was
9844000	9846000	I think the old 90's
9846000	9848000	Value of the first one is what made it so
9848000	9850000	Funny and catchy but this one
9850000	9852000	Is like
9852000	9854000	Technically enough is a copy of a copy
9854000	9856000	And you know how copies of copies
9856000	9858000	Like lose quality over time
9858000	9860000	That's what I feel this is
9860000	9862000	Like a unnecessary
9862000	9864000	Sequel okay I wanna see the bit
9864000	9866000	Woah what happened the thing stopped
9866000	9868000	Don't do that
9868000	9870000	Don't stoppie my floppy alright
9870000	9872000	Let me see the bit at the end
9872000	9874000	It's about the last minute is where the pirate shows up
9874000	9876000	Um yeah even
9876000	9878000	I wanna see
9878000	9880000	I wanna see the little like
9880000	9882000	Message to kids
9900000	9902000	Would I be immature for making fun of his voice?
9902000	9904000	Because
9904000	9906000	I wondered if that was a woman
9906000	9908000	I don't mean to sound rude
9908000	9910000	And or petty and I should really
9910000	9912000	Not be the first to talk but
9912000	9914000	Like
9914000	9916000	He doesn't sound like he's ever gone through puberty
9916000	9918000	Maybe that's
9918000	9920000	Is that a disease?
9920000	9922000	See what happens when you copy
9922000	9924000	Does piracy
9924000	9926000	Does selling pirated
9926000	9928000	Does selling pirated games cause
9928000	9930000	Your balls to go back into your body
9930000	9932000	Or something like
9932000	9934000	I think being in prison causes your balls to go back
9934000	9936000	Into your body
9936000	9938000	I had to look at his neck
9938000	9940000	I guess it's okay for me to make fun of him because he is a felon
9940000	9942000	I had to look at his neck
9942000	9944000	To see if there was an Adam's apple?
9944000	9946000	Oh he's got too much facial hair
9946000	9948000	Even if that was drugs
9948000	9950000	A woman can grow that much facial hair
9950000	9952000	With hormonal therapy yes really
9952000	9954000	I wanna see the rest
9954000	9956000	Can I see the rest of this uplifting message here
9956000	9958000	Oh he's
9958000	9960000	Sad face
9960000	9962000	It was just a sad face that was the end of it
9962000	9964000	Nevermind
9964000	9966000	So now he's serving four years in jail
9966000	9968000	I learned my lesson
9968000	9970000	And now he's being made fun of on the internet
9970000	9972000	Well how about you don't
9972000	9974000	Sell pirated copies of stuff
9974000	9976000	Stupid
9976000	9978000	Of course see that's the people that they go after
9978000	9980000	Is the big piracy rings that
9980000	9982000	Cause companies money because they're actually
9982000	9984000	Selling bootleg copies
9984000	9986000	Amazetatsuma in chat says his body
9986000	9988000	Copied too much estrogen
9990000	9992000	And Rama says and people wonder why
9992000	9994000	Software is so fucking expensive
9994000	9996000	By the way that's a free download
9996000	9998000	At iTunes
9998000	10000000	Yeah better be it wouldn't be worth
10000000	10002000	Someone should go copy it
10002000	10004000	Ha ha ha
10004000	10006000	Oh you gotta love irony
10006000	10008000	Alright guess who's never gonna download that
10008000	10010000	Me
10010000	10012000	DarkSocker you had a last minute story and then we'll let Loki
10012000	10014000	Finish up if he has anything else
10014000	10016000	Yeah it's actually somebody
10016000	10018000	To quote Silent Scope
10018000	10020000	Let's play Metal Gear for real
10020000	10022000	A guy
10022000	10024000	In France who was
10024000	10026000	Accused of killing
10026000	10028000	The
10028000	10030000	There's an actor Roland Gerard
10030000	10032000	He was convicted with
10032000	10034000	Well supposed to be going actually in jail waiting
10034000	10036000	Trial for killing the guys daughter
10036000	10038000	And her friend
10038000	10040000	He escaped
10040000	10042000	From jail in a box
10042000	10044000	In a box
10044000	10046000	Playing Metal Gear
10046000	10048000	Not really
10048000	10050000	He had put himself
10050000	10052000	In a box that was
10052000	10054000	Being
10054000	10056000	Loaded onto a truck to take to southeast
10056000	10058000	Of Paris
10058000	10060000	And he broke free
10060000	10062000	And the driver didn't even figure it out until later
10062000	10064000	And so the guys from what I can
10064000	10066000	See is still at large
10066000	10068000	His name is
10068000	10070000	Jean-Pierre Trebert
10070000	10072000	I think so
10072000	10074000	Trebek
10074000	10076000	Not Trebek
10076000	10078000	But uh
10078000	10080000	I just thought it was kind of funny
10080000	10082000	That he shipped himself out in a box
10082000	10084000	Like Solid Snake
10084000	10086000	It's myself in a box
10086000	10088000	Anyhow sorry
10088000	10090000	Like Solid Snake you know
10090000	10092000	Oh no
10092000	10094000	Cause you know in the game he was in a box
10094000	10096000	And he moved the box in the truck
10096000	10098000	And says oh no the truck have started to move
10098000	10100000	The truck have started to move I love that
10100000	10102000	I need to play through old school NES Metal Gear
10102000	10104000	Hey that gaming marathon
10104000	10106000	We're doing on the 17th
10106000	10108000	I want to play Metal Gear for an hour
10108000	10110000	Old school
10110000	10112000	What?
10112000	10114000	Yeah
10114000	10116000	Hey by the way
10116000	10118000	I hate you
10118000	10120000	The other thing I wanted to say
10120000	10122000	I was watching Saturday Night Live last night
10122000	10124000	Those of you that follow me on Facebook
10124000	10126000	Probably saw I made a little joke
10126000	10128000	I'm watching Saturday Night Live drinking wine and eating ice cream
10128000	10130000	And two of the three things are good
10130000	10132000	There was actually
10132000	10134000	One funny thing they had on Saturday Night Live last night
10134000	10136000	It was a repeat but I never watched Saturday Night Live
10136000	10138000	So it was new to me
10138000	10140000	But they had like a sequel to the Dick in the Box thing
10140000	10142000	With Justin Timberlake and whoever that guy
10142000	10144000	Andy Samberg is that his name?
10144000	10146000	It was like something like
10146000	10148000	We're gonna fuck each other's moms for Mother's Day
10148000	10150000	Or something like that
10150000	10152000	It was actually really funny
10152000	10154000	I hadn't heard that one
10154000	10156000	That was the one funny thing I saw on that show
10156000	10158000	It's not on the album
10158000	10160000	Cause they tried to do this parody of the Governors of New York
10160000	10162000	For a very long time
10162000	10164000	Where it's like you're just watching someone embarrass themselves
10164000	10166000	And you're like please stop
10166000	10168000	Please stop
10168000	10170000	Much like you probably do listening to this show
