You can emulate Commodore 64 on your iPhone, then you can't

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
An intentional glitch outs pirates of a popular game

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And a popular franchise's sequel gets canned in Japan

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

What kind of beer tonight?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
250th Anniversary Guinness

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And what makes it so dang special?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because it's 250th Anniversary Guinness

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How are you, Loki?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm good

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, now of course before we get into gaming weeks usually

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We somehow start off the show as Orange Lounge Radio Foodio

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And tonight is no exception to the cause here

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Loki, what the hell did you bring with you tonight because

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have to admit it actually looks kind of disgusting

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I brought parts of Bacon Fest 2009

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As Nellie would call it, it was the bacon themed birthday party

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Some of the food that we serve there

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Including bacon muffins

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Which they're cornbread muffins

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That have a little

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm seriously looking at all this food, oh my god

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just too much, it's too much

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't get me wrong, I love bacon

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But this is too much bacon

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bacon is meat candy

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ok, sorry to interrupt

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Anyways, so it's

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ok, let me just run down the list here

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The bacon muffins, they're basically cornbread muffins

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It initially had a little bit of reserved bacon fat in there

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To give it the kind of bacon flavor

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And there's bacon inside of it

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then Nellie decided that they didn't quite taste like enough bacon

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And she

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Originally when I made them, I bought the wrong size tins

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So I only made like 10 muffins

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'm like, you can't eat any of those because we only have 10 muffins

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So there's a piece of the muffin mix or whatever that had fallen into the bacon grease

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And she snatched it up and ate it

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And she's like, mmm that's good, you should rub all of them into the bacon grease

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So we rolled the top of them really quickly into the bacon grease

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To give it a little bit of extra bacon flavor

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then on top of it is like cream cheese, hot sauce, green onion, and bacon

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's kind of like a spicy, I don't know, frosting almost

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then we made these pancetta cups with mac and cheese inside of them

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Just mainly because we couldn't think of anything good to fill inside of them

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ok

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And they're ok

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm about to eat one and just for the record

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have yet to touch the bacon food

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is actually funny because I was going to be

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I had said I was giving up bacon and I had decided I'm going to do it tomorrow

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is great because I can now make myself completely sick of bacon

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why give it up now when you can procrastinate to tomorrow

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Especially with all these bacon temptations in front of you

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nom nom nom

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know, I've got to admit

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a little over bacon being the food of worship

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like, you know, bacon's kind of been the in-food for years and years now

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think we need to move on to a new food of worship

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Like, what about the jelly bean?

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't see enough appreciation for jelly beans out there

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It has to be jelly bellies

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alright, forget it

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then the last one is shrimp wrapped in bacon with barbecue sauce

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And mozzarella cheese broiled on top of it

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But it's actually, the shrimp's pretty good

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We ate mostly the shrimp

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then I had candied bacon

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It was with, you know, brown sugar

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, kind of caramelized on top of it and stuff

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That I meant to put on ice cream so we'd have bacon ice cream

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But everybody ate the bacon, you know, the candied bacon

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Before I got a chance to bring out the ice cream

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now sadly I missed Bacon Fest because it conflicted with my dad's birthday

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And I had a friend from out of town who I hadn't seen in years who was visiting

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But thank you to Loki and Nellie for bringing a little piece of it here

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was very nice

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I will try at least one of the bacon shrimp things

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That looks kind of good

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They're pretty good

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And then Irene and Nathan brought these like mashed potato ball things that have like bacon and stuff

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I don't, I haven't tried those

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But everyone liked those I think

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright let's go to our chat room

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes we do talk about video games occasionally on this show

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But let me go to the chat room and introduce them

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Howdy guys at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're always with us, the EverPresence fourth guest on the show

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tigerclaw says you guys should take a picture of this and post on the OLR Gallery

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We are one step ahead of you sir

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Dark Sakura I think already did that

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They should be on their way up to the OLR Gallery

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So if you want to check out the food

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Go to orangelaungeradio.com

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Click on I think it's galleries and you'll see

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you're smart you'll figure it out

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Click on like pictures or galleries

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't have it in front of me

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then you can find the bacon stuff that Loki brought

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sadly the one thing that wasn't there was super bacon

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Just because I thought I had plenty of bacon

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I actually ran short of bacon

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I had bought like five packages of bacon

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And it was still not enough

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Salaciouspopnchat says popcorn jelly bellies equal vom

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The chat room by the way is called Kevin

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just want to point out though that I actually like the popcorn jelly beans quite a bit

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But my favorite is toasted marshmallow

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jelly Belly makes a toasted marshmallow jelly bean that is delicious

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In honor of Bacon Fest

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The chat room is called Kevin

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm very sorry I did not refer to them by their proper name

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I still don't understand this whole renaming the chat room to names of people you know

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are Kevin!

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Fine

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright there you go

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So okay I'm going to try one of these bacon shrimp things

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Even though my pancreas hurts just looking at it

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Dear God

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well that's two of them

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There's two of them

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You need to separate that

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay here we go

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Careful and chew carefully because like you said it's a little choke-y

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is not good radio

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sorry

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's delicious radio

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It takes a while to chew through because unfortunately the bacon did not crisp up as well as I'd like to

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's pretty darn good

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's pretty darn good

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But no one seemed to care because you know

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's delicious

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's good but damn

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is probably all I'm going to have

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to have another piece of shrimp

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You guys can see in the picture gallery and even if you're listening on the podcast you can go on the website

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sure it'll still be there

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can go in that picture gallery and look and it's too much

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's too much

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes there is a such a thing as too much bacon and it is sitting in front of us tonight

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The important thing today Rob is that all I've had is a salad so I could safely eat this bacon

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But tomorrow no more pork

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
See I'm already a little full because I had wings topped today which is not good

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh my God all the weight I've worked so hard to lose I'm getting right back today

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Alright

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll move it out of here if you'd like

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At some point we're going to need to do that

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right not right now

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's get into our gaming week

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We should talk about video games that is what we do here on this show

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Dark Sakura what type of video games have you been playing this week?

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know what type of games

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Enough with the bacon

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Put the bacon down step away from the bacon

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you want me to have Loki go first?

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My gaming week was awesome

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well you know played the usual stuff New Grand Theft Auto what not

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Also got around to playing a little bit of Scribblenauts which it's alright

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I haven't really gotten past the tutorial stuff yet because I've only played it for a little bit

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I've been busy messing with the little front end thing where you can spawn wherever you want and stuff

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And let me tell you and I know this really sucks to say it but oh my god does it get old after 5 minutes

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And you know that is really sad

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I knew it I knew that's what was going to happen with this game

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I haven't played it yet so I just you know it's one of those things I think it's like the Nintendogs of this year

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's like one of those things is going to be cute as hell for 30 minutes

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then you're going to be like okay I did all the lolsy things I wanted to do

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And pretty much and you know I'm sure the puzzles and stuff are going to be fun

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I haven't quite gotten there yet because I'm still doing the fucking tutorial stuff which is annoying

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But just as far as messing with stuff it's kind of boring

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the other thing that I don't really care for in it is the control

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The control you have to use the stylus and you click to where you want Maxwell to go

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it's so non-responsive it's just ah it really bugs me

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But it's cool I guess you know that you can spawn all these different things

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But like you know they've got like 2200 words or something in this

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But a lot of the other words just you know create the same thing

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you type in any type of dog it just makes this generic looking dog or something

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now you're getting called out a little bit in chat from our good friend Bobby

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Who's on Before Us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Black Wolf says so Loki played with the playground and not the actual game and called it old

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well I'm telling you what I played

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm just saying I thought I'd be able to play this playground part

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And just you know have a lot of fun with it for quite a while

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because I mean dude I made a cat

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well first thing I did was I did what the ESRB had

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know where they said you can lure a lion with you know meat strapped to a baby

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I strapped meat to a baby and you know lured a lion with that and that was kind of funny

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then I strapped the laser to a cat and tried to make a laser cap

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But that didn't work because you know it just it didn't know what I wanted to do

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But yeah I'm sure the puzzles are fun but like I said I haven't played there yet

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm just saying what this is my impression so far

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a really quick impression but yeah it's not as much fun as I thought it would be

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Fair enough I guess

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now the other thing too this week is I finally finally finally got my arcade cabinet

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I went down to the San Jose and picked up my Astro City candy cab

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And brought it home and also with that I got a

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Was it an MVS Neo Geo board a single slot with a 48 in one

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Which I'm sure is absolutely not legit one bit

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
48 in one Neo Geo cart that's got a lot of King of Fighters and Metal Slug and whatnot on there

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But you know basically I have that to hold me over until I finish my main computer and all that stuff

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But it's kind of cool so I'm putting that all together

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And actually going to be painting the whole thing black

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So I have to do that as well because it's kind of scuffed up

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I tried to find a white paint or something that might match it

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But I mean you can't match the color of the plastic there so it's just easier to paint the whole thing black

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So yeah and I've got some pics on my live journal right now of just the cabinet

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's kind of taken apart a little bit the control panel wasn't on there

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I had to re-screw that back on there because they gave me like two different control panels

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
None of which were the one I wanted but you know it's fine for now

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And then I plan on getting the correct one later because I wanted a two player both with six buttons

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I have a two player with three buttons on each and a one player with six buttons

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So whatever it'll work for now

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And what other stuff did I have to do

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh yeah I had to get a new halogen or not halogen a fluorescent light for the marquee

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And of course it's some special fluorescent light that they don't make over here in the United States

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know because most of them are standard size like 12 inch, 18 inch, 24

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This was 22 and 3 eighths so I had to go order that specially online from Atlanta

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And they had apparently some of these Toshiba fluorescent lights so I had that

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now you are still taking late donations for your cabinet

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh yeah definitely

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay good because I never donated

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was going to do it on Friday but I got sidetracked so I'm going to give you a late donation

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I still got lots of stuff I got to get online

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm planning on actually rebuilding my DDR pads

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And I have an email to channel Beat about Dance Maniacs sensors

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because I have the actual Dance Maniacs machine

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I have two upper sensors but I need two lower sensors

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And if I can get them for a good price I'm going to buy them from them

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now where did you put all these machines are you putting them in your garage?

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well I don't have a Dance Maniacs machine I have the motherboard inside of it

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Right but you used to have your candy cab where's that going?

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The candy cab is in the garage right now but it's going to go in the middle of the room

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm taking the HDTV and there's an HDTV and a Stanford in the room right now

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So you have to put the toys in the middle of the bedroom so the wife can close the door and not see it?

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well she doesn't close the door I just wanted it in there because that's where I'm going to put my DDR pads

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And that's going to take up a lot of space

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I could put it in the garage and that would be fine going through the winter

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But in the summer fuck no it's like 100 degrees inside there I'd die

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah it's even worse than the studio where we were taping at my house

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's quite pleasant today though

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah it's nice today

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Alright so that's it for your gaming week

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's it

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Dark Sakura now that she's done with her bacon

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mmm bacon

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
My gaming week was a marathon session of Beatles Rock Band

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Which I really loved I had a great time playing especially doing harmony

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because everybody doesn't have to do all the harmony but you get more bonuses if you harmonize properly

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I had a really good time with that that was a lot of fun except that my hands started hurting after a while playing some of the guitar

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was going to say I forgot I also did play the Beatles Rock Band and Rock Band 2

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Did you know actually and this is kind of neat I just tried it because I wasn't sure if it worked

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That the old Karaoke Revolution mics from the Playstation 2 actually work on the 360 version of Rock Band

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you know the Lips mics also work on it?

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn't know if they patched that stuff in yet but I know they were supposed to be getting patched in soon

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well we cause Dan made it out of his conference with a double set of Lips mics

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And so we used those we had a really good time I thought it was great

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So you guys both feel, no you kind of already gave your review last week Loki and you said

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not a fan of the Beatles so I'm not as yippy about this but I see where people are getting excited about it

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah it was alright but I think we came away with it like wow the Beatles had some really tripped out shit in there

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Their songs were weird because we had Nathan singing this stuff and he's just like holy crap I didn't know that they had these weird songs

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But after about maybe 10 minutes of it we were just like ok let's go to Rock Band 2 because we just got tired of it

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But Dark Sakura is someone who is more of a Beatles fan you were like yay I'm in heaven

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was like dude I want my other songs in here because like the songs that I most wanted in there weren't there

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well a lot of the ones that I really liked like some of my favorite songs are like

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Dear Prudence was in there which is one of my favorites and which is actually really easy and fun to sing

282
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's the only one I beat on Expert and then Something was on there which is another one I like

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And we also the theme was we had a discussion on who had the better hair and we all agreed that George Harrison had better hair

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Now quick question have you explored download content because you know some of it's there

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We just rented it because Dan with a button didn't pre-order it for me

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But the one song that I would have most liked in there I know it would make zero sense to put it in there

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because the only thing you could do on it would be vocals unless you could mimic violin on the guitar controller

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or something would be Eleanor Rigby which is my favorite Beatles song

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There were really some fun ones in there like Taxman was in there and I think I saw She Came in Through the Bathroom Window

290
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Which is a cool song

291
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A lot of stuff you know but of course then I had to go and listen to all the stuff that Tiare gave me

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So I actually listened to Rubber Soul like three times all the way through

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I feel so uncool I'm like the only person that didn't play Beatles Rock Band this week

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Because my ex and granted it's my own damn fault my Xbox 360 is still broke and I need to go get it fixed

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I just you know I've just been complacent doing all this other stuff and I've just been busy with some other things in my personal life

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So I haven't really gotten out to get it fixed but I'm not gonna re-buy the instruments just for the PS3 version

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No I have all these money invested in instruments on the 360 that's where I want to get Beatles Rock Band

298
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I'm just a little behind and by the time I'm ready to play it there'll probably be nobody left playing it online

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well I also like I'm doing right now play Sims 3 because I love Sims 3

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it's actually really easy to run it during the show because I have to always be doing something

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I also, what else did I play? No I don't think I played, I was gonna play a Dreamcast game and I didn't

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You know, thought about it, didn't do it, played some Pinball

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I go back to work Monday

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Sucks to be you

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh I played Peggle, lot of Peggle, lot of Peggle

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
My gaming week was not quite as exciting as Dark Soccer or Loki's, I had pretty mellow

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I played a lot of World of Warcraft, don't judge, haters gonna hate

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But I'm playing Alliance this time because I was Horde for years

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah I played that too

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Good, I'm glad now instead of calling me an addict you're like oh okay yeah I'm addicted too

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm not addicted, I played twice

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Clearly I have issues because I'm already like level 24 but I have some friends that are playing so whatever

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It makes it go by faster, and I'm sure these people are gonna be like you could have gotten your Xbox fixed

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But you've been playing World of Warcraft, don't judge me

315
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's see what else, I've been playing, I have been playing some stuff on the Playstation as well

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Just kind of mostly the same stuff, Wipeout and Home, even I got some more invites to the club on there taken care of

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So if you were waiting for that then you probably got that, and yeah just kind of playing that stuff

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh and also Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP, that's probably been the game I've been playing more than any other console game

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is that, and it's difficult, it's way harder than regular Rock Band

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry some of those note patterns are really tough to do with the four buttons

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So I can see where Rock Band Unplugged definitely polarizes audiences

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But I'll tell you what, after having been missing frequency and amplitude for so long it's kind of cool to have this

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I do miss the techno music, but Rock Band Unplugged has a decent song list

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So I'm satisfied

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Alright well that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into our housekeeping tonight

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
In tonight's housekeeping, there may or may not be a show next week

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm thinking, and I kind of have to ask this live on air, no? No show? Are you out?

328
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm out

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay so then we're not gonna do it

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I have stuff that needs to get done on Sunday night

331
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay then fine, cause I was gonna suggest we could do it late cause my flight gets in at 5.30 so maybe we could start the show at 7

332
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But we'll just not do it then if you have stuff going on too

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So free night for Loki, woo, I gotta work in the cabinet, woo, woo

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But the problem is I am also going to be out the first weekend of October

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So I'll have to figure something out for that, where you guys can do it without me or something

336
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Cause we don't want to miss too many shows, or we pre-taped that week or something, maybe we can do that

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Alright so yeah, there's gonna be no show next Sunday so just brace yourself for that and have a good week without us here

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Alright, that's it I guess for housekeeping, otherwise you can always follow us on Twitter

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We're OLR on Twitter, we're OLRME on Facebook, it's a club so you have to search for OLRMY

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, although I don't think we've posted to LiveJournal in about a year, but it's there

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I should cross post some of mine

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You should actually cross post some of it to Orange Lounge, it'd be nice to see that being updated, so there you go

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news already and some long discussion tonight

345
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Loki's gonna start us off with a four part story

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes, well speaking about Twitter, apparently Courtney Love has one

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And she wasn't too happy about some stuff that went down with a deal that she had with Activision

348
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Regarding Kurt Cobain's appearance in Guitar Hero 5

349
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Apparently, and this is her two posts that she had on Twitter

350
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For the record, this Guitar Hero shit is breach of contract on Bully's part

351
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And then she followed up with, we're gonna sue the shit out of Activision

353
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We being the trusty estates, the LLC, and the various LLCs, Cobain Enterprise

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is gonna be a completely unrelated statement, but I just have to get this off my chest

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Isn't this fascinating that we live in a world now where Twitter is like a late breaking news source

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And a lot of the reason why is because celebrities on Twitter are unfiltered

357
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They're not going through their publicists and writing things like this

358
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Like I don't know why, but like seven years ago when we started this show we would never have a story like this

359
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But now it's kind of weird that we're reading about Courtney being pissed off like through her Twitter

360
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's just weird that Twitter is like this news source all of a sudden

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Here's my thing

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why the hell is anyone reading CourtneyLovesTwitter?

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I mean seriously

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
She has fans

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Who?

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
She does?

367
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Like convicts? I mean who?

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't know

369
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You know what? I will say this

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
When I was in high school, I was a senior in high school

371
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We participated in the lip sync contest

372
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You know how they do the lip sync contest at high school?

373
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sure your high school did one, like all high schools did this right?

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So we decided to make a mockery of the whole thing, me and my two friends

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I dressed up as Courtney Love

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And we did what's the song called?

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Violet by Hole?

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Go on take everything

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And you know I had a wig and I wore this really trashy outfit and everything

380
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yes it's like one of the few times in my life where I've cross dressed outside of Rocky Horror

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And let's see

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then one of my other friends put his long hair in pigtails and pretend to play the bass

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then our other friend dressed up like a Japanese schoolgirl and ran out on stage with these random signs

384
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Like it was the most random anti lip sync thing you did

385
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Because everybody else was doing like lollipop lollipop

386
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And all this stupid shit and all dressed and clear cut

387
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And here we are going out on stage in drag singing Violet

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And it was all kinds of awesome

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You know how we did? We got last place

390
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Last place

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Thank you Courtney Love

392
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I was a hot ass Courtney Love though

393
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I will just put that out there

394
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Well they did have a picture of Courtney Love on Kotaku during one of the stories

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It actually was one of the good pictures of her

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm like wow she was hot at one time

397
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What the fuck happened there?

398
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm guessing a lot of drugs but you know

399
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Anyways back to the story

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So she was pissed off that you know Kurt Cobain is totally

401
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Mainly the thing that they're pissed off about is

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos regarding this

403
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Apparently these characters or these artists can be unlocked

404
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
As playable characters in the game

405
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So therefore you can make them sing any retarded song that's in this game

406
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Including I think they had one that had Flava Flav in it

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So they had the clip of course of Kurt Cobain

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You know lip sync to Flava Flav

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And I mean that's just blasphemy right there

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Activision responded of course after these stupid Twitter updates

411
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Saying that Courtney Love signed a contract for this

412
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And you know tough luck

413
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Because they aren't in breach of contract

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And then of course then her publicist I guess

415
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Released a statement I guess it was

416
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh I'm sorry then I have publicist

417
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Other band members from Nirvana

418
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They said this is a statement regarding Nirvana

419
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Guitar Hero and the likeness of the late Kurt Cobain

420
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We want the people to know that we are dismayed and very disappointed

421
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
In the way a facsimile of Kurt is used in Guitar Hero

422
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The name and likeness of Kurt Cobain are sole property of his estates

423
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We have no control whatsoever in that area

424
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
While we are aware of Kurt's image being used with the two Nirvana songs

425
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We didn't know that the players have the ability to unlock the character

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This feature allows a character to be used with any kind of song the player wants

427
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We urge Activision to do the right thing in relocking Kurt's character

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So that this won't continue in the future

429
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's hard to watch an image of Kurt pantomiming other artists alongside cartoon characters

430
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Kurt Cobain wrote songs that hold a lot of meaning to people all over the world

431
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
We feel he deserves better

432
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You read that about as enthusiastically as I feel about it

433
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Just so you know

434
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well here's the thing, they have no say in it

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They didn't sign any contracts, they're just giving their piece about it

436
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
They're just throwing gasoline on the fire basically

437
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And then of course Cobain's attorney

438
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Basically saying the same thing that they want them to kind of

439
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Relock the character so that he can only sing certain songs or something like that

440
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Which I can tell you right now is not going to happen

441
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not going to happen because Guitar Hero 5 is out on the Wii right?

442
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Whoops! We can't patch games on the Wii

443
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're fucked

444
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So it's just not going to happen

445
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
They said that they, you know, of course they know that they signed the agreement

446
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But they didn't know that he was going to be used in that way

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That kind of thing

448
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This says it all right here

449
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Exactly where this whole thing is coming from

450
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They signed the agreement but didn't know that it was going to be used in that way

451
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And here's the thing, I'm sorry, go ahead

452
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because I have a rant on this

453
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I think that's actually it

454
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Good

455
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Here's the thing

456
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Obviously there's multiple sides to every story

457
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But having covered this crap as long as we have

458
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know, I think, I think

459
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I have a pretty good idea what's going on here

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I'm probably wrong and I'm pulling this out of my ass

461
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's complete speculation

462
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But here's my thought

463
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
When this was shown to the people that it needed to be shown to

464
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They didn't show the clip of Kurt Cobain doing Flavor Flav

465
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
They didn't say anything about Kurt Cobain being an unlockable character in the game

466
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They probably showed clips of Kurt Cobain doing the actual Nirvana songs

467
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then, you know, the proper signatures were obtained or what have you

468
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Although I hear that Courtney Love, like, she signed it then she resisted it

469
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You know, even before this

470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That she didn't want to approve the likeness of the character and all this other stuff

471
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So she was, she was kind of resistant to the whole thing to begin with

472
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't know how much ultimate control she has over his likeness or what have you

473
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But here's what it boils down to

474
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You cash the check, it's done

475
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know, whether this was not an intended purpose of his likeness when they signed off on it

476
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
They probably should have thought about that a little harder or read the fine print

477
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because obviously they saw him being used in the Nirvana things

478
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And that's probably the footage that Activision showed to them

479
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh yeah

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But didn't realize when they signed the contract that he was also going to be a character

481
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Just like Slash was in Guitar Hero 3

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Just like, you know, and so forth these other characters

483
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Just like Johnny Cash is

484
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean Johnny Cash can very well do the Flavor Flav stuff in this game as well

485
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I mean, it's, it's, it's just, you know, a model of a person being thrown on top of these

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You know, motion capture data that they basically collected for these different songs

487
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Going to chat.orangelandradio.com and reading comments

488
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I could understand him having a problem with him singing stuff from other artists

489
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't see why they couldn't just lock him to only the Nirvana stuff

490
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
See, well A, there's two things to that

491
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
A, you can't patch games on the Wii and you can't patch games on the Playstation 2

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So, it's, it's done

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean, they could recall the game, but what's the point, honestly

494
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In my opinion, B, the damage is done

495
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The YouTubes are out there and it's done

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And even if they were to recall the game, people aren't going to send it back because they think this shit is funny

497
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So

498
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Exactly, I thought it was funny

499
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Exactly, I kind of think it's funny too

500
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I guess I am

501
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You're putting him in a video game, what do you expect?

502
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, this isn't, this is Guitar Hero

503
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I mean, if you want respectful treatment of artists, you need to go to Rock Band, I'm sorry

504
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Burn

505
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Does Rock Band really, they don't have artist's likeness in the games, do they?

506
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No, they don't, except for the Beatles Rock Band, but that's the way you do it

507
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, God, it's Guitar Hero

508
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, get over it people, if you don't like his likeness in the game, don't buy the game

509
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There you go

510
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Or if you bought the game and it's too late, return it

511
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
At the same time, isn't it just a game?

512
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Isn't this just a type of artistic impression?

513
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean, what's to stop me from going on YouTube and making a sock puppet effigy of Kurt Cobain

514
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Singing whatever songs I want, and then pretending to have that sock puppet effigy

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Put a shotgun in his mouth and do away with himself

516
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Is it in bad taste? Yes

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But can Courtney Love really sue me over that? No, because it's art

518
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I can kinda do whatever the fuck I want

519
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Well, keep in mind though, her perspective too

520
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
She is his widow

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And that's gonna put a different emotional push on it for her than it would for anyone else

522
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And why in the hell did she ever allow this in the first place?

523
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because she's stupid

524
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If she's that passionate about it, why did she ever sign off to his likeness being in the game in the first place?

525
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And B, why wasn't everybody more educated on what was going on?

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean, you know, the Beatles were involved with Beatles Rock Band like the whole way through

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Why didn't at some point someone send Courtney the game or send the lawyers the game and say

528
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Here it is, here's your final review copy before we send it out

529
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you have a problem, speak now or forever hold your peace

530
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I mean, in my opinion, before I signed, that's what I would have wanted to see

531
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But I have a feeling that it didn't happen

532
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So, I don't know

533
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
As your edge in the chat says, you should do that

534
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm not gonna do that, that's kinda, that's like

535
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Look, I may not be the biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but that is extremely disrespectful

536
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What I just suggested doing and I'm not gonna do it

537
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's time out of my day that I don't want to

538
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Exactly, I could be playing WoW, come on

539
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm not gonna make a mess

540
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Hey, do you know how much red corn syrup that would take?

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
At least, at least it's not Revolution X, okay?

542
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I mean, they could have had it worse

543
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Frisbee says, even if it's not art, lol, freedom of speech

544
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You know, I suppose the difference though is

545
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That if I were to make that whole YouTube as disrespectful as it might be

546
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm not charging for it and I'm not making money off of it

547
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And that's probably the big difference is that, you know

548
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Activision makes a ton of money off Guitar Hero

549
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
No offense, I'm sorry, but I can't see people going

550
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh my god, Kurt Cobain's in this game, I must buy it

551
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't think so, I mean

552
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sure maybe there is one or two, but I mean, come on

553
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't think people are gonna buy a game just because an artist is in it

554
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Unless it's like the Beatles rock band where it's all about the artist

555
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh yeah, yeah, I can understand like if it was, you know

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Guitar Hero Navar

557
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Or even the Metallica Guitar Hero, the Van Halen

558
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
There are gonna be people, as much as we've kind of made fun of Van Halen Guitar Hero

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There's gonna be people that really want that because they're just diehard Van Halen fans

560
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know, I get that

561
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yes ma'am

562
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We need Van Hagar

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Different topic altogether

564
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Alright, GS68 in chat says, Kurt Cobain confirmed for Super Smash Brothers 4

565
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
How about Silent Hill?

566
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now that's bad taste

567
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Salacious Pop says, when he finds his way into Space Channel 5-3, I'll be impressed

568
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It wouldn't be funny if she just didn't realize

569
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I would like to see people make YouTubes of Kurt Cobain in other video games now

570
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Like this should become the new meme or whatever you wanna call it that's out there

571
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Somebody should do that, put Kurt Cobain's face on Ulala's head and have him doing the choo choo

572
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Or would it be funny though if she accidentally signed off on his appearance being in any Activision game

573
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Like Call of Duty or some Madagascar game

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The other thing to consider too is how intoxicated was she when she signed

575
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because now

576
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Well I'm sorry, that's her own fucking fault then

577
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If she can prove though that she was sufficiently drunk enough or intoxicated enough

578
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Then it actually could be considered null and void under federal business law

579
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You have got to be kidding me

580
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Even if witnesses signed it too

581
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I took business law

582
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Why should that be an excuse? Sober the fuck up before you sign something

583
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The same thing applies to weddings too

584
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Like I was too drunk to marry him?

585
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well no like

586
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Isn't that why the annulment process is there? Like if you change your mind

587
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's what annulments are for

588
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But it's the same thing

589
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's a big fucking difference though between a wedding and a likeness in a video game

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But it's still considered business contract

591
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't know

592
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I just think if you're high you shouldn't sign things

593
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Call me crazy

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well they shouldn't have got her to sign it

595
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But you know she can say

596
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Hey I was really drunk at the time then

597
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And who wouldn't believe her

598
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Then there is cause to take it to court

599
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't know if she'd be smart enough to realize that

600
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You wouldn't be able to prove that

601
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Maybe

602
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Salacious pop and chat says it is not legal to enter contract with an impaired person

603
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Then how did they ever get her to sign?

604
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Ever

605
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Hey she's drunk let's get her to sign

606
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean isn't there

607
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Surely

608
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't know

609
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm thinking does she have soul

610
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
We can't tell the difference

611
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Does she have soul power of an attorney over everything?

612
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Probably

613
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
She probably does huh

614
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
There wouldn't be like a lawyer involved or anybody else that signs off right

615
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think she was a full executor wasn't she

616
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I don't think their daughter is 18 yet

617
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
No

618
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So no

619
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Although she's an attractive young lady I don't know if you've seen pictures of her

620
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
She's you know aging very well

621
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Got stuck after her dad

622
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Alright anyhow sorry we're talking a bit too much about this

623
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And I think everybody's got their thoughts out on this

624
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But yeah I honestly I don't think there's anything that can be done

625
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think the stink is out there

626
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't think her lawsuit is going to hold much weight

627
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Unless maybe Dark Soccer is on to something honestly

628
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It could be very interesting if that is the defense that comes up in court

629
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Is that she was too high to sign the document

630
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
She's a drugged up bitch

631
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Clearly she can't enter into any contract

632
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Which makes me wonder

633
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That might violate other terms though

634
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Because doesn't she have some sort of custody term with her daughter

635
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
For having to be clean or something

636
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh maybe

637
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it

638
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So then she couldn't say

639
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Ah her answer ties

640
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm fucked up

641
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know what I'm placing my bet on out of court settlement

642
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's the way these things always end up

643
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Out of court settlement more money

644
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Frisbee says zombies ate my cart

645
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Alright shush

646
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's move on to some more news

647
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And talk about zombies of a different sort

648
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And the type of zombies that are in Left 4 Dead 2

649
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Now you know we've been talking about the boycotts of Left 4 Dead 2

650
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I know we've talked about it previously on this show

651
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
About how there was this you know thing out there

652
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Where all these people were signing it

653
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Wah wah wah you shouldn't be making Left 4 Dead 2

654
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because you haven't supported Left 4 Dead 1 enough

655
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And I think the agreement among us here in studio was

656
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Get over it

657
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Because you know tons of games are re-released every year

658
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
With different types of skins and everything

659
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And you don't see hundreds of thousands of people bitching about that

660
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And Valve's done a pretty good job supporting Left 4 Dead 1

661
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
As it is

662
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Like those

663
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
They got a heck of a lot more support

664
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Than I think people do for their maddens

665
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
For their DDR's

666
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
For their what other games do they re-release every year

667
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know those are two of the big ones I can think of

668
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But you know what I mean right

669
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Guitar Heroes

670
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And so forth

671
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay

672
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well here's an interesting tactic by Valve

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I actually have to hand it to them

674
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
They actually invited the two Steam users who started the boycott

675
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Their online names are Walking Target and Agent of Chaos

676
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Right after the game was announced at E3 2009

677
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They invited these guys to Valve's offices to play the game

678
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Interview members of the development team

679
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Now the interesting thing is that the resolution of this

680
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Is that these two guys say they're going to continue boycotting the upcoming title

681
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But at the same time

682
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Reported that the game seemed balanced and tight

683
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And did not feel like a rush jobs

684
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now of course

685
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The people that all signed this petition

686
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There's a lot of them saying

687
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's corrupt

688
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You guys are corrupt

689
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And now you guys should step down

690
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You should no longer be admins of this

691
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And the guys that went say

692
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Hey what we did

693
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We did way more than most people thought we'd get done

694
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Meaning they have only over 40,000 members in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group on Steam

695
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And they are still demanding that Valve release this as a low cost expansion pack to the original Left 4 Dead

696
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is what the community is bitching for

697
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What I think, I really don't think that it's in any way kind of selling out

698
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's that Valve offered an olive branch

699
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, I don't think these guys sold out

700
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
By any means

701
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think that they out of

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I actually think it's a very mature thing that they did

703
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Going, you know, humoring them

704
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Looking at it, you know, trying to see if maybe

705
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
They were justified or not, you know what I mean?

706
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But doesn't that strike you as weird that on one hand they're saying

707
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We're going to continue the boycott

708
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And on the other hand they're saying

709
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But the game doesn't feel rushed, it does feel pretty complete

710
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Like, don't you get the sense that they're only continuing the boycott

711
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Because they don't want to have that percent

712
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Like, imagine they come home and drop the boycott

713
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Like, what's that going to make them look like?

714
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's going to make it look like their silence was bought, right?

715
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No

716
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Don't you wonder if that's coming into play

717
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That they just don't want their integrity questioned?

718
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
See, if they came out and said

719
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We played the game

720
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And, you know, we'd like to retract our position

721
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Everything that we complained about

722
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
We were wrong

723
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I think that is bigger balls and shows more integrity

724
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But have they provided a reason that they're still going to continue their boycott?

725
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Do they say it still doesn't feel like a sequel?

726
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know

727
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
To be fair, I'm reading this off of another news release

728
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So I don't have their full statement on whatever it is they went and visited

729
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We need to wait to see if they say why they're continuing

730
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Let me see if I can find that

731
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Or chatters, feel free to help out if you have a link to something that they said

732
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's just a safe face on their part

733
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That's all it really is

734
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because, like you said, if they came back and said

735
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, the game's awesome, you know, we should drop our boycott

736
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then, you know, 39,998 people would go

737
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You're fucking retarded

738
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Here's another quote from them I found on another news source

739
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question

740
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And it will only get better

741
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But they will continue the boycott until their, quote, individual concerns are addressed

742
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Which, you know, I don't

743
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Big fat paycheck

744
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, I don't think it has anything to do with that

745
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think, again, it's that they've dug themselves in too deep in this boycott now

746
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I don't think Valve was under any obligation to do what they did

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I think that was actually kind of nice of Valve

748
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And sets kind of a sad precedence

749
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Is that if you bitch enough about something they'll fly you out to fix it

750
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It almost kind of makes me go

751
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Hmm, where do I want to travel

752
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, I would like to kind of go to Boston

753
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Hey, Beatles Rock Band blows

754
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And it was released way too soon after Rock Band 2

755
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And you know they're going to release Rock Band 3

756
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You know what, Rock Band 3 needs to be an expansion to Rock Band 2

757
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
A cheap upgrade

758
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, that's right, I said it

759
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Come sign my petition

760
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, free trip to Boston, yeah

761
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm just worried about the precedent that sets

762
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But, again, I'm not blaming Valve

763
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It was very cool of them

764
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, but this has been a very big thing

765
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They've got a big gathering

766
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Like, you may have people go

767
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If you had like a hundred people or so

768
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That would be big enough

769
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But they've got, you know, in the tens of thousands

770
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You know, they've got a big following

771
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TheRobDeeInChat, chat.orangelandradio.com says

772
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The gamers who support this boycott in the first place

773
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Have way too large of a sense of entitlement

774
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I almost kind of think that hits the nail on the head

775
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
If these guys feel that strongly about it

776
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You know, and I realize we've debated this topic to death on the show

777
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I really don't want to rehash the whole damn thing

778
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But if you really feel that strongly about it

779
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The best message you could send is don't buy it

780
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Honestly, at the end of the day

781
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No petition you sign or anything like that

782
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Is going to have the impact that your wallet has

783
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
At the store

784
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So there it is

785
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And let's see

786
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 exists

787
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Because what Valve wants to do requires a sequel

788
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SalaciousPop says

789
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Valve has already done a ton of stuff

790
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That is anthema to pretty much every other developer

791
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Anathema

792
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Using big words in my chat

793
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
How dare you, I'm just kidding

794
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
By the way, there was a somewhat related story

795
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Going on

796
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Where I guess there's a campaign

797
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Going on to fly the

798
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Valve boss

799
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Gabe Newell over to Australia

800
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
To actually look at a

801
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Left 4 Dead campaign

802
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That was made called Shotgun Sunrise

803
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's a custom campaign

804
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That he basically

805
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Wanna fly the guy out there

806
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
To release this

807
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
They raised $3,000

808
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
In donations

809
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And

810
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't know how they raised all that money

811
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Just trying to get this guy to fly out there

812
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And look at this expansion or whatever

813
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I think he actually made like a quote

814
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Kind of tongue in cheek that

815
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh well I'll go look at it if they fly me out there

816
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And they actually raised the money

817
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But now he's kind of backing down or whatever

818
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So

819
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Hopefully they donate the money somewhere

820
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Or something

821
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I just

822
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But again it kind of goes back

823
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
To that entitlement thing

824
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Okay yay for you you made a mod and spent a lot of time

825
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Making the mod but why did you

826
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Do that? Did you feel entitled

827
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
To the fact that Valve should release that as an

828
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Official expansion? I mean

829
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You know

830
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Don't mod if you're not gonna be

831
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Content with getting nothing

832
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
For what you did

833
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's what I don't understand

834
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So

835
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
People suck

836
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I don't know I think the Left 4 Dead community

837
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Some of them

838
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I think they should be happy

839
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Where they're being angry

840
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I think that's a waste of money

841
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What? Well I mean I can understand

842
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If you feel passionately enough about something

843
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Especially if you put a whole lot of work into it

844
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And you have enough other people that

845
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Enjoy your work that they're willing to

846
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Contribute to that yeah

847
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But in the end it's a game

848
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You know why not

849
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Save that three thousand dollars for

850
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You know people who need it

851
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Aren't we in a global recession?

852
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
God damn they raised that much

853
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Money over this

854
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm just kind of surprised

855
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You know that could go into an

856
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Arcade cabinet

857
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Shush

858
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The Rob D in chat

859
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Says I would love love

860
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
For Valve to cancel Left 4 Dead 2

861
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Just to see how they would react

862
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't think that's gonna happen and I don't think

863
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You should let a few bad apples spoil the barrels

864
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So to speak

865
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I don't see how this is different from

866
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The sports games that come out every year

867
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And the DDR's and music

868
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Games that get re-released every year

869
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That people buy

870
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I don't see how this is that much different except it actually

871
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Sounds like Valve is doing more

872
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Than what a lot of these other games that come out every year

873
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Do it actually sounds like there's more to it

874
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So

875
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know I think they should be happy

876
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I think some people just need to

877
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Get over themselves

878
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well guess what came out for

879
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
iPhone

880
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Commodore 64 emulator

881
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Isn't that great?

882
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Awesome where can I download it?

883
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You can't

884
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Because they have found

885
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Problems that will be problems

886
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
For Apple actually

887
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah there were

888
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Ways to access

889
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Basic programming

890
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Like the language basic

891
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And so Apple's like ah no

892
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And stopped it

893
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Because you can't release

894
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
An application that programs

895
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Or something like that like you can't

896
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Have an application on the iPhone that can program

897
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The iPhone to do anything

898
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You want all they have to do is

899
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Edit the

900
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The emulator just to

901
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Disinclude the basic

902
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What's funny is I think people

903
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Are going to constantly find ways to

904
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Get to basic you know because obviously

905
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
They figured out a way to abort the game somehow

906
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And get into basic so I would think

907
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They're going to keep doing this somehow but

908
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I guess if they patched this to keep Apple happy

909
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Then that's kind of cool because

910
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I grew up on the Commodore 64

911
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay that was my gaming system

912
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Until our family had an NES

913
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That was my gaming system from ages like 5 to 10

914
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So you know

915
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I would love to relive some of those games

916
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
For my youth but

917
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Well it's been resubmitted

918
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So we'll see if it hangs around

919
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That would be

920
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Kind of cool

921
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I wonder though if the games that are being released

922
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
On this emulator are legal

923
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Like I know they say that

924
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
They have kind of like this mix of games

925
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Is the guy getting permission from these companies

926
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Or does he have to? Maybe copyright

927
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Laws are up because it's been about

928
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
25 years since most of these games

929
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Were released what like 84 yeah about 25 years

930
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Since most of these games came out maybe

931
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Copyright law comes into play if none of these companies

932
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's only a handful of ROMs that are actually licensed

933
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The ones that came out were Dragons

934
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Den, Limons, Jupiter

935
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Lander, Arctic Shipwreck and Jack Attack

936
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay Limons I recognize

937
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
As an official Commodore title that was one of the

938
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Games that was put out by Commodore

939
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So I'm wondering if and I don't know if

940
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
All of these fit in that same car I actually

941
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You know why? I actually owned Limons

942
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It was one of the few paddle games that you had

943
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You played this little car and you held the little

944
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It was actually one of my favorite games to play

945
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You held down the little fire button to drive

946
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And you turned the paddle back and forth

947
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
To kind of move back and forth on the track

948
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It was a lot of fun you had to avoid other cars

949
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And you could race forever

950
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That would be even though that's the type of game

951
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I think would throw me for five minutes

952
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Now like hours I played

953
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
This game as a kid but it was

954
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Like I guess you could call it a first party

955
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Or whatever it was actually put out by Commodore

956
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So I'm wondering if all these games don't have

957
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Commodore's sort of blessing or what's

958
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Going on so

959
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Frisbee in chat says

960
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Dear Apple what about some

961
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Open source on the iPhone

962
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I just don't think

963
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You're going to see that happen because what they're

964
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Probably worried about is

965
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
People getting into the phone aspect of it

966
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Using all these programming

967
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You know hacking it so that the phones

968
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Get open and suddenly you can make

969
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Phone calls without having to pay for it and so on

970
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Like I just think they're really worried about how

971
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Far you can hack these devices

972
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
GS68 says I want to see

973
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
MSX games on the iPhone dammit

974
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh wait Americans don't care about

975
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
MSX I'd like to see the

976
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Original Metal Gear Solid

977
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The original Metal Gear for one

978
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Before it was Nintendo-fied

979
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And the original Metal Gear 2

980
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And I wouldn't mind seeing

981
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Gardic but the problem is who's

982
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Going to translate those

983
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Fans!

984
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Better learn how to speak Japanese

985
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Something like that

986
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Coming to the PSP is yet another firmware

987
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Of course why not

988
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They have plenty of other firmwares

989
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Like all the other firmwares

990
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's been cracked already

991
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Which is really important

992
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But what this firmware does

993
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Hint at though is

994
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Some things that possibly will be coming out

995
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Later on including game rentals

996
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Apparently

997
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
As part of the change log

998
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They have ways that you can

999
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Now group different folders

1000
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It says games now can be grouped

1001
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And displayed in folders based on their

1002
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Expire dates under game

1003
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So that means that there's

1004
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Going to be some sort of trials or something

1005
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That will expire after a certain amount of time

1006
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then of course

1007
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Some other stuff

1008
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
They changed settings

1009
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Network updates have been changed

1010
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
To system updates

1011
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The number of colors that can be selected

1012
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Under settings has been increased

1013
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And revisions to strengthen

1014
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Security of course

1015
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
With the internet browser

1016
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And

1017
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The other

1018
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Of course

1019
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Before they already have support now for

1020
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Video rentals so maybe

1021
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Now they're going to do it with games

1022
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I think it has to be something big like that

1023
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Because what else justifies the

1024
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
6.0 I mean it's not like

1025
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
5.3 or 5.0

1026
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Like this is a major release

1027
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Or they wouldn't call it 6.0

1028
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's the PSP Go because it's coming out in like 2 weeks

1029
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh that makes sense too

1030
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Fair enough

1031
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Do you think though that game rentals is something

1032
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's nothing I ever thought of before

1033
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
But then when I thought oh my gosh

1034
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Like companies get mad

1035
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
At the game rental industry

1036
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because they don't see any of those profits

1037
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But this would

1038
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Let them get a chunk of those profits

1039
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Where the rentals are happening

1040
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And Sony gets a good chunk of that too

1041
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Because they're endorsing the service

1042
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And they kind of can put the rental thing

1043
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Out of business

1044
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's not going to happen right away or for a long time

1045
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I mean this could be something huge

1046
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That we're looking down the barrel of

1047
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean really it's not going to cut into rental business

1048
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because most rental stores

1049
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I mean you know how bad

1050
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The PSP is doing I mean it's hardly

1051
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Selling anything there's not a lot of good games

1052
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Out for it most stores do not

1053
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Bring in PSP as a rental

1054
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Category

1055
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay but only a matter of time then

1056
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Before it's on Playstation 3

1057
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Although those games are ginormous

1058
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I don't know the feasibility

1059
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Of that but

1060
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We're years away

1061
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
From that being possible

1062
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I mean technology gets better data moves faster

1063
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
We're five years away from

1064
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
A PS3 game being

1065
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Downloadable as fast as

1066
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Super Nintendo ROM is these days

1067
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah but in five years it's going to be a Playstation 4

1068
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And no one's going to give a crap

1069
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
About Playstation 3 titles that are downloadable

1070
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Just like Playstation 1 titles

1071
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
That come out now

1072
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah that's kind of cool that they're re-releasing them again

1073
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But really is it such a big deal

1074
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I mean is it even something that you would go rent

1075
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I mean especially when the titles are like

1076
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Ten bucks

1077
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
What are they going to charge for rentals? Two dollars?

1078
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I mean it's just it's not really

1079
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Cost beneficial

1080
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
To actually rent a title

1081
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Frisbee in chat says there's already game rentals

1082
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's called DRM

1083
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm not sure I quite understand that comment

1084
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Is that like a dig on the fact that

1085
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
When you download things you can't share it with other people

1086
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And all that I don't know

1087
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Or I was thinking that the comment was going to say

1088
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's called demos is kind of a way of

1089
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Doing it and seeing if you like it

1090
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well that's kind of an asinine way of doing things

1091
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I mean oh

1092
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
We could put out demos for free

1093
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So that you can test our products

1094
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And see if it's something that you want

1095
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But no we're going to be assholes about it

1096
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We're going to allow you to buy a demo basically

1097
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Of this game

1098
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Rent it for a little bit and decide if you want it

1099
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And that way if you don't like it

1100
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Hey we still got some of your money

1101
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But at the same time what about

1102
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
We drop $60 on a game that we play for a week

1103
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I mean imagine if we could

1104
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Spend only $10

1105
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You know $9.99 to rent the game for a week

1106
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That would be

1107
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Maybe something I'd rather do for a lot of games

1108
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I would go rent them at

1109
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Like your mom and pop rental store

1110
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But they're always out

1111
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Imagine if I can go onto this digital thing

1112
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Click a button it's downloading I got it

1113
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Well good if that's an option for you

1114
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I mean that's awesome but

1115
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The thing is

1116
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I mean it's always good to have more options

1117
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
To forego demos for this

1118
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You know rental stuff because

1119
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You know they feel that they can make more money

1120
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
If you don't have a way to try

1121
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Out this game

1122
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Without you know paying money

1123
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I just think

1124
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Especially PSP games I think you're going to see

1125
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And you're right

1126
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I don't think PSP games are really

1127
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Rented at stores so I don't think you're going to see

1128
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
This dig into the real rental market

1129
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Right now but it's about setting a precedent

1130
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You know especially with

1131
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
PSP Go being digital

1132
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Download only and that they think

1133
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This thing's going to be huge although I don't think

1134
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It is Oh it's going to fail I think they're

1135
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Setting the stage for you know this whole

1136
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Rental thing that is first party and we

1137
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Haven't seen anything like it before

1138
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I think this is

1139
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
A pretty big deal on what's coming

1140
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And I think probably it sounds like by the holidays

1141
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
This is going to be something that's launched

1142
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh man PSP Go is going to be

1143
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's going to fail so bad

1144
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Don't get me wrong I like

1145
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
The PSP 3000

1146
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I just

1147
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah well

1148
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I hate going over the same

1149
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But still

1150
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I mean there's other stories

1151
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm sure we have coming up

1152
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's like

1153
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
What exactly are you doing different with the PSP

1154
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Go other than charging me a lot more money

1155
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And not having the ability to play

1156
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
UMD games I mean there's really

1157
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Nothing that's going to be exclusive to that

1158
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Maybe rentals are exclusive

1159
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
To the PSP Go?

1160
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It won't be because you know why?

1161
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because if they do it exclusive to the PSP Go

1162
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Then they lose out on all the

1163
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
PSP 3000 stuff

1164
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know Deathwishing in Chat says

1165
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I love renting PSP games

1166
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Renting PSP games are awesome when you go on trips

1167
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Makes sense

1168
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I mean if you're going to go on a long road trip

1169
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Why not rent a game?

1170
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They do have PSP rentals and NDS rentals

1171
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
With like the

1172
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Kiosk and airports

1173
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And stuff like that you can do that

1174
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
There's a place in the airport here that has

1175
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Rental thing and you drop it off in the box

1176
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh good I'm going to LA next week and I'm flying

1177
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Maybe I'll have to utilize that

1178
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yeah it's actually pretty cool you rent it

1179
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Where you're

1180
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Flying out of and you can drop it off

1181
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They have one in every single airport

1182
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Major airport yeah

1183
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Alright well

1184
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Moving on to another story

1185
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We'll see what unfolds with the PSP

1186
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
possible rental system a little later on

1187
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But I want to move into this because this has to do with

1188
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Copying games too but of a whole different

1189
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Sort now of course Batman

1190
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Arkham Asylum was huge it came out on

1191
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
All these consoles this past week but don't

1192
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Forget it also came out on the PC

1193
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Hello there's still quite a few people

1194
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That are very into their PC gaming love it

1195
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And Batman Arkham Asylum of course was released

1196
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
On the games for windows platform

1197
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So that those folks could play it there as well

1198
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
But of course where there is

1199
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
PC gaming there is piracy

1200
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So I guess an early version of this

1201
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Game leaked out and there was

1202
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
A user that actually posted on

1203
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The official Eidos forums

1204
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
With a post that went something like this that he had a

1205
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Glitch with his PC version of the game quote

1206
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I've got a problem when it's time

1207
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
To use Batman's glide in the game

1208
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
When I hold like it's when I

1209
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Hold the comma like it's said to to jump from one

1210
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Platform to another Batman tries

1211
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
To open his wings again and again instead

1212
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Of gliding so he falls down

1213
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Into poison gas if somebody could tell

1214
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Me what should I do here and

1215
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It was actually replied to by an

1216
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Admin on the forums Keir

1217
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Responded to the thread and said the

1218
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Problem you have encountered is a hook in the copy

1219
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Protection to catch out people who

1220
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Try and download cracked versions of the game

1221
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
For free it's not a bug in the games code

1222
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's a bug in your moral code in other

1223
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Words this

1224
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Crack or this version of the game

1225
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Was put out there with this bug in it

1226
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So that when people call

1227
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Support to complain or go post on

1228
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The forums to complain or spend the time to

1229
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Download it or what have you to do it

1230
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They essentially out themselves as

1231
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Pirates isn't that entrapment

1232
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
No because they're not

1233
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Really implicating them of a crime

1234
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's just so that they have

1235
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
An unplayable copy of it if they but

1236
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Here's the thing here's the funny thing about it

1237
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
One they've done this before with Grand Theft Auto

1238
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If you pirated Grand Theft Auto

1239
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
4 on PC they had this

1240
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Thing basically it was drunk cam all the

1241
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Time it was shaking around making it really hard

1242
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
To play

1243
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And then the other thing is

1244
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This problem with Batman Arkham Asylum

1245
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Got patched within like a day

1246
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It was only effective for about a day

1247
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then that was it

1248
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And that's what TigerClaus does in chat

1249
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
As well as the glitch was later fixed

1250
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And yeah I think we're all not surprised

1251
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
To hear that but

1252
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
How many people do you think

1253
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Think to find the fix

1254
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Do you think that maybe

1255
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
This does still defeat

1256
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
A lot of pirates because they'll get the game

1257
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Play it go this sucks and delete it

1258
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Without ever thinking to look

1259
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
For a patch

1260
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
No maybe stupid people

1261
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That you know are

1262
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Not really normally pirating

1263
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Games but a lot of people will

1264
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Get frustrated with it and then

1265
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like a week later they'll read on the forums

1266
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
That this was intentional and then they'll re-download it again

1267
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I mean it's just like the guy that

1268
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You know had ran into this

1269
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
He's not going to go oh my goodness

1270
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I can't believe they got me

1271
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Well I'm just going to buy games from now on

1272
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
No he's just going to go and re-download the game

1273
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
When it's been patched or fixed

1274
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Wait for someone smart to do it

1275
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And that's what's going to happen

1276
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
If they have no intention of purchasing the game

1277
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
They're not going to purchase the game

1278
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
El Non Hombre Hombre

1279
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
In our chat room says

1280
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
No it's not entrapment because they're

1281
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
A. Not law enforcement and

1282
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
B. They aren't asking them to pirate

1283
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Well I meant that

1284
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I thought that they had called the police on them

1285
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
No it looks like they just banned

1286
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
This guy from their forums or what have you

1287
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Well to be fair

1288
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Couldn't they report it?

1289
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
They could report it but

1290
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
They sort of set him up

1291
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I don't know I'm kind of reminded of

1292
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And this is going to make me sound super gay

1293
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But Madonna

1294
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
When one of her albums was leaked to the internet

1295
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It was actually something Madonna's record label

1296
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Released themselves and it would

1297
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Start the song and you would hear like the first

1298
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
15 seconds and then you would hear Madonna's

1299
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Voice come on and go what the fuck are you

1300
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Doing?

1301
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So she basically put out all these

1302
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Bogus MP3's that started off like the real

1303
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Thing and then would just cut off and it would be her

1304
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Going what the fuck are you doing?

1305
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm kind of reminded

1306
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Of that this is essentially the

1307
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Video game equivalent

1308
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Of that except the game doesn't taunt

1309
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You well

1310
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
It taunts you without directly taunting

1311
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You if that makes sense

1312
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I don't know if entrapment

1313
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Would be the word I would use though

1314
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah that wasn't quite what I was thinking

1315
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I don't know what legal

1316
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Recourse they could seek with this

1317
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Because

1318
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I certainly think it's a

1319
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Good way to out the people that

1320
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Aren't supporting them

1321
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
To go so far it's pretty bold to download a

1322
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Pirated copy of the game and post on the forums

1323
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
About it that is kind of a stupid

1324
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Thing to do in my opinion

1325
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Is that if you're gonna

1326
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Steal but I don't think that they had

1327
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Any way of knowing that it was an intentional

1328
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Glitch

1329
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Salacious pop in chat

1330
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Says that it would defer anyone

1331
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Even the idiot makes it worth

1332
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It in my opinion I kind of tend to agree

1333
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
With that statement because

1334
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You know even if it took a day

1335
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
For that patch to came out

1336
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That patch to come out that fixed it

1337
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That was still one day

1338
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Where you might have some of these pirates get fed up with

1339
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Waiting and go I'm just gonna buy it

1340
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It looked cool enough from what I saw

1341
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'm just gonna buy it

1342
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And even if that drove sales it did curb

1343
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
A low percentage of the piracy

1344
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And had more of an impact than not doing anything at all

1345
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Sure

1346
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I guess

1347
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Alright

1348
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
The Rob D in chat says the best part would be

1349
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
If the game crashed before the final boss

1350
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
That would be the best middle finger to the pirates

1351
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I think that Rob D

1352
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah but the problem with things like Earthbound

1353
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Is one thing but I think the problem with what Rob D

1354
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Is suggesting as funny and clever as that is

1355
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I think that most people

1356
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Would say at that point I played enough of the game

1357
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Forget it I mean I love the Earthbound

1358
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Thing we talked about a couple weeks on the show

1359
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That you know it doubled the number of monsters

1360
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And you know would crash your game

1361
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Delete the save and everything but

1362
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I think there's a lot of people that at that point would just go

1363
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Ah fuck it I don't need to worry about this game anymore

1364
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm gonna move on and steal something else

1365
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Also after having seen the last

1366
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Boss and ending of the game

1367
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
First of all the last boss

1368
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Is actually kind of easy

1369
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Um you know Uber Joker

1370
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And uh the

1371
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Ending was uh less than a minute long

1372
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Really for Arkham Asylum?

1373
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Well

1374
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It was it was short okay

1375
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Spoiler free please but

1376
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Less than five minutes is fair but

1377
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Although I don't remember it even being that long

1378
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Wow okay fair enough

1379
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Rob D in chat says

1380
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I think that if they played that long

1381
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
They would be really frustrated with the inability to finish it

1382
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Yeah to some extent but I

1383
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You know I do think

1384
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I think Eidos or you know did

1385
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Did a funny thing here because

1386
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I think people that are gonna be bold enough to steal

1387
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And then complain about their stolen game

1388
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
On the official forums I think they deserve

1389
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
To kind of be made a mockery of

1390
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
You know what I mean? So

1391
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You know he kind of got his just desserts and I think that's

1392
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Where a lot of us are doing the Nelson here going

1393
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Ah ha

1394
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You know it's one thing to steal but it's

1395
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's like even it's like the different

1396
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Circles of hell

1397
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Like stealing a computer game is it's

1398
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It's one of the circles of hell but it's like you know

1399
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's just getting poked with a hot prod

1400
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But then to like go and actually complain about it

1401
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
On the forums and try to blame the

1402
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Developers for their borked game

1403
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
That's like eternal damnation

1404
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Come on

1405
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So alright anyhow

1406
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
More news stories and we're gonna get into release dates

1407
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Dark Sakura

1408
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Let's see

1409
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Well Lucas Arts

1410
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Um is actually

1411
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Working on a new game

1412
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And now Lucas Arts

1413
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Loom 2

1414
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I wish I so wish

1415
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But this is actually kind of cool because they said that they took

1416
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Their inspiration from games that are like

1417
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Braid

1418
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And of course Braid was you know pretty freaking cool

1419
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Which by the way has gone down in price on Steam

1420
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It's on sale

1421
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Um

1422
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
But it's called

1423
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Lucidity which is supposed to be an

1424
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Xbox Live arcade game

1425
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And um there's rumors of a PC

1426
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Version but they didn't say anything about that

1427
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's a 2D side scrolling

1428
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Um

1429
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Platformer but it has puzzle elements

1430
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Um we play as a girl

1431
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Called Sophie and

1432
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
She keeps moving you just have to move

1433
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Things out of her way

1434
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Kind of lemming-ish right you know

1435
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That's kind of what it sounds like to me a little bit

1436
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
But I guess your

1437
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Goal is to get her from point A to point B

1438
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But is she stupid?

1439
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Like you know lemmings were stupid that was the whole point of the game

1440
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
They would just keep walking right off a cliff

1441
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
If they you know needed to

1442
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They said that she's like in her

1443
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Abstract dream world

1444
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So maybe she's just

1445
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Dreaming you know

1446
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Kind of out of it but the art

1447
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Style is supposed to be the cut paper

1448
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Look of a pop-up book

1449
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Oh that's kind of sounds neat

1450
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So it's going to look like an old school children's book

1451
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Hmm

1452
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
She's dreaming stupid

1453
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
What was the last time

1454
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We got a um

1455
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Game

1456
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
From LucasArts like

1457
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It wasn't Star Wars related

1458
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like at Indiana Jones?

1459
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Oh I didn't realize they were behind the Lego games

1460
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It is LucasArts

1461
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh gotcha

1462
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well this sounds like it could be cool but um

1463
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I'll wait to see if there's a demo

1464
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Before that there was fracture

1465
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Alright so there's just games I missed

1466
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Somehow there's too many video games you can't play them all

1467
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I think that was them yeah fracture

1468
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Fracture sucks

1469
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Underachiever

1470
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I want to go back for a minute because I think this chat room

1471
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Comment bears repeating

1472
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
To Arkham Asylum, Tigerclaw wanted to clarify something

1473
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
On the ending of Arkham Asylum

1474
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
He says Arkham Asylum continues on though

1475
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
After you beat the game you can still click on

1476
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Continue story and you have free roaming

1477
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Of the entire game so you can go and find

1478
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Those Riddler trophies, the alignment

1479
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Puzzles and interview tapes

1480
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Yeah but that's just for completion

1481
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So that's not really the ending

1482
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Or to do with the story itself

1483
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's like New Game Plus

1484
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You can go taunt Harley for a little while

1485
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Alright fair enough

1486
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Ok

1487
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Let's get into some release dates we're going to travel the globe

1488
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And talk about what's coming out in your neck of the woods

1489
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Starting off with the US, Loki

1490
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yes this week actually quite a few things coming out

1491
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Starting off with of course

1492
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

1493
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Woohoo

1494
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yes which will be coming out on pretty much everything

1495
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Need for Speed Shift will be coming out this week as well

1496
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and

1497
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
PSP and I believe the PC version as well

1498
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Scribblenauts will be making its way out on DS this week

1499
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Actually I believe like a week from today

1500
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I think

1501
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
No Tuesday my mistake

1502
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Actually tomorrow Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story on the DS

1503
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Some other crappy games on the DS

1504
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
My Boyfriend and Princess in Love on DS

1505
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Woohoo

1506
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah

1507
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Let's see

1508
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Animal Planet Vet Life

1509
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I just want to say though I saw Commercial for Need for Speed Shift the other day

1510
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
On TV and it looked pretty hot

1511
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Because it was in high def

1512
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's like Project Gotham

1513
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Looks kind of neat

1514
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And speaking of piracy

1515
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Batman Arkham Asylum on PC

1516
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So if you're complaining about it now you don't have it yet

1517
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Liars

1518
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Bleach the Third Phantom on DS

1519
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Chicken Blaster on DS and Wii

1520
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Another movie tie-in game

1521
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on pretty much every system except for the Playstation 2

1522
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Heroes of the Galaxy

1523
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1524
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Which looks like an OK World War 2

1525
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Played some game

1526
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
NHL you've got two games coming out this week

1527
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
NHL 10 from EA on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1528
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And NHL 2K10 on Playstation 2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360

1529
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Pinball Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360

1530
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Red Faction Guerrilla finally making its way out on PC as well as Resident Evil 5

1531
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Time of Shadows

1532
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I didn't even know they were giving that a PC release

1533
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Time of Shadows also on PC

1534
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
This week that really crappy game they played on Konami's booth at E3 this year

1535
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Tornado Outbreak formerly known as Zephyr Rise of the Elementals

1536
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
On Playstation 3 Wii and Xbox 360

1537
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
You remember that as kind of the tornado Katamari type of game

1538
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Toy Story Mania based off the ride and in 3D coming to the Wii

1539
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
A game I ranted and raved about last week

1540
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Wet coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1541
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And then finally just thought I should mention this since we talked about them around E3

1542
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily

1543
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Madballs in Babo Invasion making its PC daily

1544
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That will be coming out as well

1545
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And then finally on Xbox 360 the Q Entertainment Trilogy on Xbox 360

1546
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Qubed which features Rez, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and of course Luminous Live

1547
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And they left out 99 Nights

1548
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Well that's not Xbox Live

1549
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I know but still

1550
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And I don't think it is

1551
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Is there anything extra in this though?

1552
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You know what's funny?

1553
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Besides some of their misfires like 99 Nights

1554
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I really love Q Entertainment

1555
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Tetsuya Mizuguchi is the man

1556
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
He's one of my favorites

1557
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Most of the games he puts out I love

1558
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So I'm kind of curious if there's anything extra in the collection that would make it worth getting

1559
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Probably the download content is probably in there

1560
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I'm not positive but it would make sense

1561
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh and how did I miss this?

1562
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Naruto Shippuden, Ninja Destiny 2

1563
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Who cares about Naruto

1564
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Going over to Japan, September 17th

1565
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Fuel, the localized version for Japan finally hits on September 17th

1566
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Also Left 4 Dead gets a price drop

1567
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It moves into the Platinum Collection

1568
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
These are both on the Xbox 360

1569
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Terminator Salvation from Squeenix is putting it out over in Japan

1570
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
A game called Velvet Assassin from Ubisoft makes its way to the Xbox 360

1571
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Moving on to the Playstation 3 coming out on the 17th

1572
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Also Fuel there as well

1573
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Makai Senki Disgaea 3

1574
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Appendisk, Razz Barrel, Hen Hajime Mashita

1575
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm assuming that is some type of extra scenario for Disgaea 3

1576
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Tales of Vesperia makes its way out on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week

1577
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And then lastly Terminator Salvation and Wet

1578
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Both on the Playstation 3 this week as well in Japan on the 17th

1579
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, checking out the games there

1580
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean comes out from Nintendo in Japan this week

1581
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
House of the Dead Overkill that comes by itself and a version with the Wii Zapper

1582
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
The Wii Zapper is not dead in Japan apparently

1583
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's coming out with that little bundle out there

1584
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Or they're just trying to unload the remaining supply they had

1585
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Probably

1586
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Playstation 2 sees some price reductions this week

1587
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Bully the Scholarship Edition and Biohazard Code Veronica

1588
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Which of course is Resident Evil Code Veronica in a bundle with Resident Evil 4

1589
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Or Biohazard 4 as it is in Japan

1590
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And lastly on the handhelds

1591
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Trying to see if there's anything

1592
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Saga 2 Hyou Densetsu Goddess of Destiny comes out from Square Enix

1593
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So this must be another Saga game that's coming out in Japan this week

1594
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So I know that series has its fans

1595
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
So maybe there'll be some folks wanting to import that

1596
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Although they'll have to try and read it

1597
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And Idolmaster, Dearly Stars, DS, get it?

1598
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Idolmaster definitely has its fans in Japan

1599
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
That is coming out on the Nintendo DS this week

1600
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Do you think that's a franchise we will ever see happen over here?

1601
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Probably not

1602
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Why not?

1603
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Because

1604
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's too Japanese

1605
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Exactly

1606
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I hate to say it because it sounds weird but yeah

1607
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Quite a few games to pick from on the PSP this week in Japan

1608
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Ys 7 comes out this week

1609
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Tag Force

1610
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Katakyuu Hitman Reborn Battle Arena 2 Spirit's Burst comes out this week

1611
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
As well as a price reduction for Irregular Hunter X and Rockman Rockman value pack

1612
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I'm assuming that is just the Mega Man games all packaged together

1613
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And lastly, Iki Utsun Eloquent Fist gets a price reduction this week

1614
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I'm trying to see what game that is

1615
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I think that's one we have over here

1616
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
No

1617
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
No, one of the characters looks just like Sakura though

1618
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But like an older version

1619
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Look at that, she's like wearing the same outfit and everything

1620
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Well it is a, you know, high school uniform

1621
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I guess

1622
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That's just what it makes me think of though

1623
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And it's Ys chatroom

1624
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Ys

1625
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Ys

1626
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Okay there you go, there's your release dates for Japan

1627
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1628
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:27,000
For the UK we have, on the 15th as we discussed last week, Azuma's Revenge

1629
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And then on the 18th a whole crap ton of stuff

1630
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
We have Batman Arkham Asylum for PC, don't pirate it or you'll get laughed at

1631
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Blood Bowl, Katamari Forever for PS3

1632
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2 for Wii

1633
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Order of War, Raven Squad, Red Gorilla Faction, I'm sorry Red Faction Gorilla, sorry

1634
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I was reading Gorilla and thinking beer

1635
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Resident Evil 5, Spectrobes Origins, The Humans for DS and PC

1636
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Wacky World of Sports for Wii, and Wet

1637
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Also Yamaha Supercross for DS and Need for Speed Shift on a crap ton of systems

1638
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Hmm, very cool

1639
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So there's some new stuff finally making its way to home

1640
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And this is kind of cool, I fully endorse this

1641
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Robot Chicken is coming to the PlayStation Home Theater

1642
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I did that off camera, sorry

1643
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Dark Sakura's making sound effects in the studio

1644
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I'm singing the Robot Chicken theme

1645
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It was actually really funny, it's a bummer you couldn't hear her

1646
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I'm stealing a cookie

1647
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So now they will actually have a bunch of different clips available on their theater screen

1648
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
That once played Twilight's, I remember when they were playing the Twilight trailer on there

1649
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Well thank god they got rid of that

1650
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yes, so you'll be able to watch Robot Chicken for free even though you can pretty much on your TV as well

1651
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But neat I guess, something else to watch while you're doing the Running Man

1652
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Well I think it's nice they're putting more useful things in home, does that make sense?

1653
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You know trailers are one thing but it's kind of nice that they're actually giving those theaters something a little more

1654
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I don't know, in demand to watch

1655
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Although I heard there was a soup, you know that show The Soup?

1656
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I think there was a clip show that was supposedly on Sony Home, I couldn't find it

1657
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
But I didn't look very hard to be honest

1658
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I noticed that Sony's kind of branching out into putting some of these TV shows for free in home

1659
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And I think that's a good use of home, makes it a little more appealing in my opinion

1660
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I think it's just a matter of time before you start seeing the first episode of TV shows that they're trying to get you hooked into

1661
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Like the Glee pilot or what other pilots they've been trying to sell this year

1662
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
There are other science fiction, Caprica's pilot, some of these shows that are coming out in 2010

1663
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Trying to kind of push those in Sony Home, I bet, especially for the next fall season you start seeing more of that

1664
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Yeah

1665
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
We'll see

1666
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But that's kind of cool, I think that's a good use of Playstation Home

1667
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
By the way there's some free stuff on Home this weekend too if you haven't logged in

1668
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And search for the OLR Club, I don't actually have to invite you, if you want to join the Orange Lawns Radio

1669
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Just search for it in Clubhouses, either search for Orange Lawns Radio or O-L-R-M-Y is like the keyword for it

1670
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So search for either of those and you'll find the Clubhouse and I'll invite you in

1671
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do with Penny Arcade Expo

1672
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And some unfortunate kind of side effect of so many folks being all contained in one place

1673
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,000
PAX organizers did report this week that a confirmed swine flu case did break out at the show

1674
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And unfortunately this has grown into about a hundred cases of swine flu

1675
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Of course H1N1 is the real name for it but everybody calls it swine flu

1676
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Coming out of Penny Arcade Expo so kind of scary that you get all those people together and these types of things break out

1677
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Now it's not just the swine flu but of course the regular flu is showing up as well

1678
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You know as is various types of con things

1679
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Now this came up and we talked about this for a little bit on our phone call with Bobby Blackwolf

1680
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
That we do on his show right before we go on the air tonight

1681
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So we talked a little bit about this and you know a couple bottom lines that come out of this

1682
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Is that A, this is just an unfortunate circumstance of cons

1683
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And Jamie you said something very smart about the fatigue that goes on at cons

1684
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And why this happens a lot

1685
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Well and keep in mind I was a long time con goer ever since I moved out here

1686
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And before I moved out here

1687
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You know my first convention I slept like three hours

1688
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And it was a three day convention

1689
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So yeah

1690
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
A lot of people will do that

1691
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's a big thing

1692
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Like for people who don't you know buy their hotel room and sleep in the lobby

1693
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
People do that sorry

1694
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You are typically saving the typical con goer

1695
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
May not be thinking in terms of proper nutrition for one thing

1696
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
They'll be eating cheap con food

1697
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
They'll be bringing snacks like when Julie used to go with us to cons

1698
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
She would pack nothing but like croissants and cookies and all this crap

1699
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And I'd be like bring me some freaking carrots

1700
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You know because I can't eat that much sweet food all the time you know

1701
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And like I even ran away and got Moroccan food once

1702
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
At AX one year

1703
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So um

1704
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But people don't really think in terms of their health

1705
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And the precautions they should be taking you know

1706
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
At least have a couple of good decent meals you know with vegetables

1707
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Bring your vitamins with you take a good supplement in the morning

1708
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You know all of that contributes to your level of fatigue

1709
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And sleep please sleep

1710
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You know the con is a few days

1711
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
But you've got to live with your health for the rest of your life

1712
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Now I know that some people have kind of been wondering what my piece is going to be on this

1713
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Because you know if you were listening to show a couple months ago

1714
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You know I have been very personally affected by swine flu

1715
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I lost a good friend of mine who is only 24 years old

1716
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
She passed away of H1N1 a couple months ago

1717
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
On June 23rd right before my birthday

1718
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I realized that what happened to her is not going to happen to everybody

1719
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Okay so I don't think there needs to be paranoia out there about the swine flu

1720
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But it pisses me off when people don't take this shit seriously

1721
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And I don't think that people have to like you know

1722
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Oh my god mass hysteria like no nobody wants that

1723
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
But at the same time don't belittle what disease can do

1724
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And whether you know you know if you want to argue with me

1725
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
The whole well swine flu is just like the regular flu

1726
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Blah blah blah fine whatever

1727
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
You know yes I admit you can die from both

1728
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And I don't want to because I actually know people like on Twitter

1729
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That apparently caught this at PAX

1730
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And I don't want people to freak out like oh my gosh am I going to die

1731
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Probably not

1732
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's you know what happened with Beth was certainly an isolated circumstance

1733
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
There's still many questions

1734
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
We're never going to get answers to as to what happened there

1735
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
My point is though

1736
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Don't belittle this like it's the common cold

1737
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
If you have a high fever

1738
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Call your doctor

1739
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Go in make an appointment

1740
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Get checked out get told it's nothing

1741
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Don't wait because the longer you let it go

1742
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
The worse it's going to get and I don't want you to end up

1743
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I don't want anyone I know to have what happened to Beth happen to them

1744
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So you know please

1745
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You know and again this is not something I really get into ever on the program

1746
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
But my day job is I work for a health insurance company

1747
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company in the state

1748
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And we work directly with the members in the center that I work with

1749
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So I know and I'll tell you

1750
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Most health insurance companies at least any decent one I know mine does

1751
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Will pay for urgent care

1752
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
If you suspect you know whether you have PPO HMO whatever

1753
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It will pay for urgent care if you have symptoms

1754
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So you don't have to go to the ER because you have a high fever

1755
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You can go to an urgent care center

1756
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You can make an appointment with your doctor

1757
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Just go get checked out

1758
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Get told it's nothing get told it's the common cold

1759
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's better you do that than the alternative

1760
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And if you don't have coverage

1761
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Still a lot of those urgent care places

1762
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Will treat you for

1763
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The last one I ever went to was 75 bucks I think

1764
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
If you're uninsured you know and

1765
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
They're there for that reason

1766
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yeah go to an urgent care center not the ER for this

1767
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But get checked out for heaven's sake

1768
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You know don't sit on it and don't wait on it

1769
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And the other side I want to do with this is that

1770
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
When you go to cons

1771
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And when you go to these places

1772
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Please be hygienic

1773
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I know a lot of people make jokes about this stuff

1774
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
The whole con funk and all that stuff

1775
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But that is a very real thing that can continue to spread disease

1776
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And I want to reiterate one thing that Beth's mom Lynn

1777
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Said to the media when she was interviewed

1778
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Because Beth was the first person to die in this county from H1N1

1779
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And the one thing that her mom said to me

1780
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I will never forget this for the rest of my life

1781
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Is her on the news saying this

1782
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And I want you all to remember this

1783
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Wash your hands wash your hands wash your hands

1784
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I am not fucking around when you go to these conventions

1785
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And you're touching these controllers that hundreds of people have touched before

1786
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And so forth

1787
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Wash your hands

1788
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Please help stop the spread of disease

1789
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And wash your body while you're at it

1790
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Well I remember

1791
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't actually know if you remember this Rob

1792
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The last time that we went to E3 together

1793
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
What did I have on me all the time?

1794
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Probably hand sanitizer

1795
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Hand sanitizer

1796
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I also had antibacterial lotion on hand

1797
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I had band-aids

1798
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And now this is something else I learned being a massage therapist

1799
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
You don't want to have an exposed open wound

1800
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
When you are around that many people

1801
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You do not want to touch other people's blood

1802
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Because first of all for example hepatitis

1803
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Lives outside of the body I think for two weeks

1804
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Active, live

1805
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Even if you think you've wiped up all the blood

1806
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It'll still live on the surface of anything that's touched

1807
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Unless you wipe it off really good

1808
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That's why they always say if you're going to be around someone who's bleeding

1809
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You put on latex gloves and then you take care of them

1810
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Put on your own mask before

1811
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And speaking of latex if you're going to have con sex use a condom

1812
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Use a full body condom if you're having con sex

1813
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
But I'm saying you may not think about this

1814
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And the average person doesn't

1815
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But there are so many different ways to get sick

1816
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And I'm not saying be paranoid

1817
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
But really take precaution if you're going to be around that many people

1818
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And at least always keep hand sanitizer around you

1819
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And at least be considerate to other people

1820
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
If you've got like a paper cut or a cut on your arm or something

1821
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Put a good watertight bandage on it

1822
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So that you don't you know

1823
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I've got like for example

1824
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And no I've never had it but I have antibodies for hepatitis

1825
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Because I inherited it from somebody

1826
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But that still puts me at danger for exposing other people

1827
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So that's why I'm always extra careful

1828
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I always bandage up my cuts and things

1829
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Because I mean you always have

1830
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It's a matter of also being considerate to other people

1831
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And if you are sick and you do go

1832
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Wear one of those little paper masks

1833
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Don't cough on anyone wash your hands all the time

1834
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
You know be considerate of other people

1835
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
If you are going to be so inconsiderate

1836
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That you're going to go around other people while you're sick

1837
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And possibly contagious

1838
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
If you have a sinus infection I don't care

1839
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
That's not contagious

1840
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
If you have the flu

1841
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
If you have the cold

1842
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
If you have something that is communicable

1843
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Take a precaution that you don't share it

1844
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And honestly it's not worth it

1845
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Stay home

1846
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
There'll be another convention

1847
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Now I'm hoping you're sitting there on your chair

1848
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Going okay get on with it O.L.R.

1849
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I know this crap

1850
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
But please understand if like one person's kind of sitting there

1851
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Going oh yeah maybe I should take like

1852
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Extra soap to the ex-con I go to

1853
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Then this whole little rant was worth it

1854
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Because I see a comment in chat

1855
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Frisbee says O.L.R. dash common sense

1856
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I really hope to everybody it is common sense

1857
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
But if you've ever made the con-funk joke

1858
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Then you know it's not common sense to everybody

1859
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Okay so just please

1860
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
From your friends at O.L.R.

1861
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Wash your damn hands

1862
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And again I do see

1863
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I see the con-funk around two particular groups

1864
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
The really young

1865
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And the I have no life

1866
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I've never you know been on a date

1867
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
You know 50 year old con-van boy

1868
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's probably why they never had a date

1869
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
S.H.A. 100 Matt also wants to put out

1870
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And don't pee on the seat when you use the toilet

1871
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah don't do that Nope

1872
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I will say something this

1873
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Do not be afraid of urine on a seat

1874
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It is sterile

1875
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Just wipe it off Ew

1876
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
But I'm telling you if you see poop on the seat

1877
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
That's different No

1878
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Okay this is too much I'm done I'm done

1879
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Rob it actually is true urine is sterile

1880
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
You have more germs on your hands and mouth

1881
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Than you do on your butt

1882
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I'm done nope too much done

1883
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Just wash your hands okay

1884
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
That was the point I wanted to make

1885
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Before you pick up a controller at a gaming convention

1886
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Just wash your hands

1887
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Alright let's get into the classic game of the week

1888
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
True though I know

1889
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Somehow we always end up with the show in the toilet

1890
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Even literally

1891
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Hey every week here on Orange Lawns Radio

1892
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
We urge you kids to go visit the archives

1893
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And check out a classic video game of years past

1894
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And tonight is no different

1895
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Dark Sakura's gonna go into the vault

1896
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And pick out a game she thinks you all should be playing

1897
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Dark Sakura

1898
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1899
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's Pissarama

1900
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
No I'm kidding

1901
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I hate you

1902
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Heart heart heart heart heart

1903
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Okay no it's Space Harrier

1904
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
About damn time I did Space Harrier

1905
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I actually just got an IM from Becky

1906
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Saying that she thinks it's funny whenever I go off about pee being sterile

1907
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Will you get to the game

1908
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Get ready

1909
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Go back go back cause people have to go that far

1910
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Alright

1911
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
We're looking at an arcade version of the game here

1912
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah

1913
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
It has my catch phrase on it

1914
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Here we go

1915
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Welcome to the fantasy zone

1916
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Get ready

1917
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Now everyone knows where that comes from

1918
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That has been like what my catch phrase as long as you've known me

1919
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It's been your little quote on forums like ever since I've known you

1920
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yeah

1921
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Why why that quote of the thousands of quotes out there

1922
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Why this quote do you love so much

1923
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Because it's just cool

1924
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Welcome to the fantasy zone

1925
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Get ready

1926
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Alright

1927
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's like it really makes no sense

1928
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Um Space Harrier is my third favorite video game ever

1929
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Which is me which means I have now covered all three of my top three favorite video games

1930
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
The first being the Guardian Legend

1931
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The second being Fantasy Zone

1932
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And the third being Space Harrier

1933
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone

1934
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So moving forward

1935
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It is a game that was produced by Yu Suzuki who did a lot of Sega's really good games

1936
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And sitting right next to me is a picture of my husband shaking hands with Yu Suzuki

1937
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
That was pretty cool

1938
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So Space Harrier is a sort of a fake 3D type of game

1939
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It is a sprite based game and it scrolls towards you

1940
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Well not kind of like a real over the shoulder cam but it's from behind you

1941
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And it has 18 levels each with a boss

1942
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And you have to shoot you know everything that gets in your way before it shoots you

1943
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And you can run on the ground or you can fly in the air with a jet pack

1944
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And everything really does come at you very quickly

1945
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It's brightly covered levels

1946
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Even for you know as old as it is because it came out in 1985

1947
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It is a fantastic game and it's one of the early games to use digitized voices in it

1948
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And after you beat a boss it tells you that you're doing great

1949
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It constantly encourages you I mean how many games do that

1950
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Anyway

1951
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
By the way I just want to point out and I'm sorry Darsak if you were going to get to this

1952
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But since I was a Nintendo kid and not a Sega kid growing up

1953
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
There was a game on Nintendo called 3D World Runner

1954
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
That was a direct rip off of this game

1955
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I was going to get to it

1956
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Sorry

1957
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Actually that game was put out by Square by the way

1958
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And there was also Pony Canyon did a parody called Animal Attack Academy

1959
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That had a Japanese school girl fighting Australian animals

1960
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But yeah the game is also that along with After Burner

1961
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Was one of the first cabinets that had you in a seat

1962
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And that the whole cabinet would move along with your joystick movement

1963
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
There also is one that doesn't move that sits down and an upright version

1964
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So it was really really cool to play

1965
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I haven't played a space harrier in the you know with the full motion sit down cabinet in ages

1966
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
It also it used the same music for the most part over and over again

1967
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
But I really loved the music

1968
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I put up a link also to just the music

1969
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I will bring that up so you can hear just the music without all the explosion noise

1970
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Let's listen to a little bit of that

1971
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Not bad for a game from 85

1972
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It really is one of my favorites

1973
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Now as far as other releases we got a there was a computer a home computer version

1974
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
There was also the 32x version and one thing I will say is that the 32x version is a direct rip from the arcade

1975
01:29:52,000 --> 01:30:00,000
In fact you actually have a little trick that you can do with it where it changes from press start to insert coin

1976
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So that space harrier of course

1977
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But After Burner were both direct arcade ports

1978
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
There was a Sega Saturn version

1979
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:20,000
There was a Sharp x86000

1980
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It only came out of Japan

1981
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
All of those were supposed to be the most arcade available

1982
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
There is a Dreamcast version that is playable within Shenmue and Shenmue 2

1983
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And the Suzuki Gameworks Volume 1

1984
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
An Xbox version of course it was in Shenmue 2

1985
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And in the Sega Arcade Gallery for Gameboy Advance and the Sega Classics Collection

1986
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
For the PS2

1987
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Space Harrier 2 was the Genesis version

1988
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Which actually also just came out on Virtual Console December 2 years ago

1989
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
My head students they just came out

1990
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
In Europe it came out in October 2008

1991
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And over here on November 3, 2008

1992
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
For the Master System

1993
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Also the arcade version is unlockable in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

1994
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
For Xbox 360 and PS3

1995
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And apparently it has sound issues by everything being just off pitch

1996
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
That means I couldn't play

1997
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Actually I know that first hand because I tried to play Space Harrier

1998
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And the music sounded wrong to me

1999
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
But I also have this thing where I hear anything off pitch

2000
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Really strongly perfect pitch for listening

2001
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I can't do it

2002
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
There is also the Space Harrier Complete Edition

2003
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
But you know what

2004
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
They've done the series an injustice

2005
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Because they didn't release the sequel at home

2006
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
The sequel being Planet Harriers

2007
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Have you played Planet Harriers?

2008
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I've heard of it

2009
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I've heard you talk about it before

2010
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Actually you know what

2011
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I think that you've seen me play it

2012
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Because they had it at Great America

2013
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I probably have just seen it and don't really remember it

2014
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Well I don't know if they still have it at Great America

2015
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
But that one was pretty much a fantastic follow up to a great series

2016
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I think this game

2017
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And again sorry if I'm covering something you're about to get to

2018
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
But I'm pretty sure this game is in that Sonic Genesis Collection

2019
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That just came out

2020
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
That's what I just said

2021
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh sorry

2022
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I said it was Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

2023
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But it suffered from

2024
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Oh I was zoning reading the Twitter

2025
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So okay yeah it's there

2026
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Yeah the reason why I couldn't play it is because it had pitch problems

2027
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
All the voice and sound was just off

2028
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Gotcha

2029
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Enough to drive me nuts

2030
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I have the same problem with music on the radio too

2031
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
If they play it too fast

2032
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I hear the pitch

2033
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
But anyway I digress

2034
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
But yeah go out and play Space Harrier

2035
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It's a lot of fun

2036
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
It's one of the few games of that perspective

2037
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
That doesn't make me utterly motion sick either

2038
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Unless I'm playing it in the cabinet

2039
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
The motion cabinet

2040
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Then I will get very sick and throw up all over you

2041
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Which is not sterile

2042
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Lovely

2043
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So that's your game

2044
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Alright there it is

2045
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Your classic game of the week is Space Harrier

2046
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
And I think Dark Sakura prefers the arcade version

2047
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But there are some other places

2048
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Actually

2049
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
If I'm gonna play it at home

2050
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I'm gonna play it on the 32X

2051
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Just so I have a reason to play a good game on the giant mushroom of death

2052
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Alright then there you go

2053
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Space Harrier on the 32X is your classic game of the week

2054
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Something non-Sega next week Dark Sakura

2055
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I tried to pick something non-Sega

2056
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And then it occurred to me that I have done dozens of other games that are among my favorites

2057
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And have not done Space Harrier

2058
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Alright fair enough

2059
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But next week

2060
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I got them on a month streak of Sega

2061
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
So next week we'll have to do something non-Sega

2062
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Next week something non-Sega

2063
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Alright

2064
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Maybe I'll do something on the Atari 2600

2065
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That would be cool actually

2066
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I would love to see some Atari 2600 games

2067
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm actually just looking at a game on the Atari 2600 we have sitting around

2068
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Alright

2069
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Anyhow

2070
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
We'll get into that next week

2071
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
For now we're gonna take a break

2072
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
We will be back though in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio and Part B tonight

2073
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Twitter topics

2074
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
We're also gonna talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 13

2075
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Some more Sony news

2076
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Including news about the minis

2077
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And some Playstation 3 bundles

2078
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And we're gonna talk about a possible Wii price cut

2079
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
We'll get to all that and rapid fire news after this

2080
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:22,000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2081
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And welcome back everybody to this Orange Lounge Radio

2082
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
We are live on September the 13th of 2009

2083
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Taping live at All Games Radio

2084
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
The folks that always are kind enough to host our show

2085
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
And let us steal their bandwidth every Sunday night

2086
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
They have a new show starting by the way this week

2087
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I just heard about it on Bobby's show tonight

2088
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The Escapist Live

2089
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I'm probably getting the name of that show wrong and I apologize

2090
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But I do know the cool thing about it is that you're gonna hear

2091
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
The Yahtzee interviews early

2092
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Like that's the first place you can hear

2093
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
The Yahtzee reviews

2094
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
The zero punctuation reviews

2095
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Yahtzee's the guy that does it right?

2096
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Like the nice game?

2097
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Okay

2098
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
You're gonna hear those reviews early before they actually go out

2099
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And that's gonna be live on Tuesday nights at All Games Radio

2100
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
And it's sandwiched right in between Dead Pixel Live and Video Game Outsiders

2101
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And Video Game Outsiders are another cool bunch

2102
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's actually funny because they're very similar to us

2103
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Because it's like two guys and a chick

2104
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But they all do it over Skype

2105
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And I think one guy's in Canada

2106
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But it's funny because one of the guys on the show reminds me of you, Dark Sakura

2107
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Because he has a classic arcade game collection that he always talks about on the show

2108
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And how he's getting these new video games and so forth

2109
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Just like you have your pinball tables, right?

2110
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's kind of funny how our shows kind of complement each other, but they're very different

2111
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Like we don't...

2112
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
They play more like Warcraft and stuff

2113
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And we're more, you know, music-based games and RPGs

2114
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
They're very Xbox-centric, you know, it's just kind of funny

2115
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
That we have so many similarities yet differences

2116
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But anyway

2117
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I wasn't meaning to plug them as much

2118
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Although they are a good show

2119
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I want to plug the Escapist show that's brand new that's coming to All Games as well

2120
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You know what, I say just go to All Games on Tuesday

2121
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Just leave it running throughout the day

2122
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And you're gonna hear a lot of great radio

2123
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
That's just what you need to do

2124
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And then don't forget on Sunday nights

2125
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Come back and listen to Bobby Blackwolf and ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio

2126
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Alright

2127
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Let us move on and get into some Twitter topics

2128
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Before we get back to some news this week

2129
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And very thin on the Twitter topics tonight

2130
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I guess everybody's too busy with the Video Music Awards

2131
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And all this other garbage that's going on tonight

2132
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
We didn't get a lot of tweets

2133
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
In fact we really only have one tweet

2134
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And it's from Spazinator tonight

2135
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And the question is

2136
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Oops, it's down here a little bit

2137
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
He wrote like five tweets, good lord

2138
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
How about either Home, upcoming 1.3 update and OLR Club

2139
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
As well as sale on the PSN Video Store

2140
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I don't know what they put for sale on the PSN Video Store

2141
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It's funny enough

2142
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Because I was actually looking at what kind of offerings were in the Video Store this week

2143
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Because since my Xbox 360 is broken

2144
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I can't do Netflix right now

2145
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's kind of too bad though

2146
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Because a lot of stuff that is available on the PSN Store

2147
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And not to say the 360 is any different

2148
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
But it's a lot of movies I'm just not interested in

2149
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It's all like slasher flicks

2150
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And action packed

2151
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Which I understand who their target audience is

2152
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
But forgive me if I like a good chick flick

2153
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Or art house film every once in a while

2154
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I don't really find those on either network to be honest

2155
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
But then also the OLR Club

2156
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I did plug that at the top of the show

2157
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
But if you haven't joined the Orange Lounge Radio Club

2158
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
In Sony Playstation Home

2159
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
We do have one

2160
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So check that out

2161
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio

2162
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
ORMY is our little buzzword

2163
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And we have some arcade cabinets

2164
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
That I got from the Namco Collection demo

2165
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That we put there

2166
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So you can play like Dig Dug and stuff in our home

2167
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And I'm trying to get other furniture as I find it

2168
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
But I don't really want to pay for a lot of furniture

2169
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But I guess there's some free stuff this weekend

2170
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So if you go into the stores

2171
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
You can find some new shirts and things like that

2172
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And I guess some new furniture is free too

2173
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So I want to try and dig that up

2174
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Because I guess there's a coffin you can get for free this weekend

2175
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
So I thought maybe I'd plop a coffin on the stage

2176
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Of our Orange Lounge Radio Clubhouse

2177
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Wouldn't that be lovely?

2178
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Wouldn't you like that, Dark Sakura?

2179
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Just a coffin?

2180
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
That would be fantastic

2181
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Alright

2182
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news

2183
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And kick off with some rapid fire news tonight

2184
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Starting off with Loki

2185
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Yes

2186
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Of course, Rock Band's got new stuff coming out each week

2187
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
And this week we've got some new songs

2188
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Including Tenacious D

2189
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yes, that's right, Tenacious D will be getting a couple individual tracks

2190
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
With Rock Your Socks and Tribute

2191
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Both available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft points

2192
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm totally getting Tribute

2193
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Also part of the individual songs

2194
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
The Guess Who with Hand Me Down World and No Time

2195
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
And then finally Dinosaur Jr. with Pick Me Up and The Wagon

2196
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
All those available as individual song downloads

2197
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Of $2 each or 160 Microsoft points

2198
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Or I guess 200 Wii points

2199
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But that's a little easier to figure out

2200
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Then to kind of coincide, I guess

2201
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I know there's a new Anvil documentary coming out

2202
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Well, they have the Anvil pack

2203
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Which is available for 440 Microsoft points or $5.50

2204
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Included with that is 666, Metal on Metal

2205
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And this is 13

2206
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And those also can be purchased individually for 160 Microsoft points or $2 each

2207
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And then finally coming to the PSP

2208
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
We've got Evanescence with Bring Me to Life

2209
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And Spinal Tap with Back from the Dead

2210
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And then also we've got Forza 3 going gold

2211
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
And of course with that they announced the demo for the game

2212
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Will be hitting the Xbox Live Marketplace on September 24th

2213
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
You'll be able to check out some of the new cars

2214
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
As well as some of the tracks

2215
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And the demo will include 5 playable vehicles

2216
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Including the 2007 Porsche

2217
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Number 80 Flying Lizard 911

2218
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Looks like an Audi R8 5.2

2219
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
The Ferrari California

2220
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X

2221
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
That would be 10

2222
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Whatever

2223
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And the mini John Cooper works

2224
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That's interesting

2225
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Finally, a game I'm quite excited about

2226
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
DJ Hero will be getting its healthy dose of Daft Punk

2227
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And they will be contributing 11 unique mixes for the game

2228
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
As well as being playable characters in the game as well

2229
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Included with that would be Daft Punk Ride the World vs. Young MC Bust a Move

2230
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Defunk vs. NASA Strange Enough featuring Karen, ODB, and Fatlip

2231
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Daft Punk Defunks with Queen, another one bites the dust

2232
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Robot Rock with Hashim Al-Nayefish

2233
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I guess that's translated to the soul

2234
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I'm glad I'm not the only one that horribly butchers pronunciations on this show

2235
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Robot Rock vs. Queen, We Will Rock You

2236
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I guess that's kind of appropriate

2237
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Short Circuit vs. Boogie Down Productions Jack of Spades

2238
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Technologic vs. Gary Numan's Cars

2239
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I think there's too many tracks mixed with Cars

2240
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
That's just my guess

2241
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Television Rules the Nation vs. No Doubt Hella Good

2242
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And I'm very disappointed to see that there's not anything for like

2243
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Some of the songs One More Time or something like that

2244
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Last, well, I guess that was their last album, maybe the album before last

2245
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
But man, maybe some download content later on

2246
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And I think that all that is probably download content, all those songs, right?

2247
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Did they say that? Because I wouldn't think Daft Punk has that many songs in the game, do they?

2248
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
No, I think that's that many songs in the game

2249
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Wow, that's kind of cool

2250
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Yeah, so that was only 8 of the 11 songs too, so there's going to be more

2251
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Well, getting into the Nintendo Virtual Console releases from this week

2252
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
On Virtual Console we had the Super Return of the Jedi from the Super Nintendo

2253
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Came out this week and that was 800 Wii Points

2254
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And I think every week they've been doing a Star Wars game, I think for the month

2255
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So there you go

2256
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
DSiWare, they had Clubhouse Games Express Family Favorites

2257
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Which has games like Hearts and Bridge and so forth

2258
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
On WiiWare though, they had a game called Color Z, or Colors

2259
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Which was where you go forth in spaceships on a mission to clean up virus infested planets

2260
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I guess you absorb viruses of your color, but you want to stay away of other viruses

2261
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
But who cares about that when you have Contra Rebirth hit for 1000 Wii Points

2262
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Which is kind of like a Super Nintendo-ish looking newer version of Contra

2263
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Which, funny enough, our caller last week, nailed it

2264
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
That they thought Contra was going to be out on Labor Day and they were correct

2265
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So good job on that

2266
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Hey, Capcom vs. Tatsunoko has some new, apparently leaked, characters from poor website planning

2267
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Apparently somebody was able to mine the website and find some images that were missing on the website

2268
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
That apparently are going to be added later, which include Frank West from Dead Rising as a playable character

2269
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Ah, we knew it

2270
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
As in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom

2271
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Apparently Zero from the Mega Man series is there as well

2272
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And Yatterman number 2 and Joe Asukara

2273
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
We should have been in it to begin with, yes

2274
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
He's always the one that wants to push the button

2275
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Now see, I don't know dick about anime, so I guess Jamie's excitement has me excited too

2276
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Woo!

2277
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I guess that's good news, right?

2278
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The Pac-Man world record was broken, apparently the kill screen was reached in 3 hours 42 minutes and 4 seconds

2279
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I'm sorry, that was the old record from Chris Ira

2280
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Now it has been beat by David Race, I think is his name

2281
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
3 hours 41 minutes and 22 seconds is the new time

2282
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Wow, Billy Mitchell once held that spot

2283
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
But Billy Mitchell's a dick

2284
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I don't know, it's a movie, I'm not going to

2285
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
He really is

2286
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I don't know the guy, I'm not going to bother

2287
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Alright, let's finish off the rapid fire news, Dark Sakura

2288
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Well let's see what else we've got going on

2289
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:46,000
There's actually an ESRB rating for Castlevania The Adventure on Wii

2290
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Which really wasn't that good of a game

2291
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
It was, you know, the Game Boy one that came out

2292
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Also, and I mentioned this earlier, Braid is cheaper now on Steam

2293
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's $5 now, or £3.39

2294
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And it's a pretty cool game

2295
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And also, Final Fantasy VII on Wii has more download content

2296
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Chapter 9, The Crystals, which is the final part of the story, that's 800 Wii Points

2297
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I need to finish up that game

2298
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Yep, I thought you'd be interested in that one

2299
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yeah, I kind of stopped playing, but it was a really good Wii download game

2300
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
A little other news in WiiWare, is that for 800 Wii Points, Spaceball Revolution

2301
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Not to be confused with Spaceballs

2302
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Then 2 and 1 Solitaire, which is Spider and Klondike

2303
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And then, Sullivan's Key and Rygar for 500 and 600 Wii Points respectively

2304
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Alright, let's get back into some long discussion topics tonight, Loki

2305
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Yes, the music game sales are down

2306
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,000
But, even though they are down 46%, it is still the third best selling genre among video games

2307
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:13,000
And of course, this is coming from the NPD group, they do all these sales tracking and whatnot

2308
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And I guess, year to date sales have declined quite a bit

2309
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:24,000
But, when you look at it, they're pretty much calculating stuff from up until

2310
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Up to Guitar Hero 5 and the Beelz Rock Band

2311
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I think a lot of people were anticipating those two games

2312
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I was going to say, because I've seen this story spread like wildfire through blogs this week

2313
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And I'm like, this is completely misleading, in a way

2314
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Because the big music games for the year haven't even come out yet

2315
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Or just came out

2316
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Well, you obviously can't have that data right away

2317
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I mean, they usually release the previous month's data like halfway through the next month

2318
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I think that it's even selling half of what it used to is pretty damn impressive

2319
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
When you consider a year ago, we had Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2

2320
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I mean, those are both huge titles

2321
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
The DS games were just coming out too

2322
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Those are all huge stuff

2323
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
So, I mean, I'm not surprised

2324
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I mean, since I don't really think that Smash Hits and Metallica sold

2325
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I mean, they sold alright, but not like, you know, a Guitar Hero 5

2326
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
They're just not going to sell the way a Guitar Hero 4 or a Rock Band 2 does

2327
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Exactly, and the track packs, I mean, that doesn't really count

2328
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So, it's a little misleading

2329
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
It'd be more interesting to see what happens after the holiday

2330
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
At the end of the year

2331
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I would like to see an end of the year wrap up as compared to last year

2332
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
You think it'll be kind of in the same?

2333
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I think you'll still see a little decline

2334
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I don't think the Beatles Rock Band is going to sell quite the way Rock Band 2 did

2335
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Don't get me wrong, I think it'll still sell pretty big

2336
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And I think Guitar Hero 5 will probably be on par with Guitar Hero World Tour

2337
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Which, if I'm not mistaken, didn't Guitar Hero beat Rock Band last year in terms of sales?

2338
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Um, yes

2339
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah, because Guitar Hero is still, you know, despite the fact that, you know

2340
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Rock Band gets more press usually because they have done more download packs

2341
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And, you know, so forth, Guitar Hero still sells better

2342
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Because they have more releases

2343
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Well, and also, I would say they have better peripherals too

2344
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I wouldn't call their drum set better than the other ones

2345
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Alright, I'm basing it off the guitars, I am

2346
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
But I like the Guitar Hero guitar much better than the Rock Band

2347
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Yeah, definitely they're going to skew everything

2348
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Because now they're going to consider, you know

2349
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Each copy of Guitar Hero Van Halen that people redeem for free as a sale

2350
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
You know, just stuff like that

2351
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
It's, they do a lot to really skew their numbers

2352
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And they're like, yeah, look how much Guitar Hero is selling compared to Rock Band

2353
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
And you can't compare the two because one has way more releases than the other

2354
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Because they refuse to embrace download content on a regular basis

2355
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I mean, they do have download content on a regular basis

2356
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
But nowhere near what Rock Band has

2357
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Alright

2358
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Well, moving on with other stories

2359
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Completely out of the Music Game League

2360
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Final Fantasy XIII finally had its release date revealed

2361
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
There was actually like a little conference earlier this week

2362
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Where they finally revealed some details about the game

2363
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
But, you know, the biggest thing, because we weren't there

2364
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
We didn't get to play the playable demo

2365
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
December 17, 2009 is the release date for Final Fantasy XIII in Japan

2366
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
But, I will say this, don't forget the Playstation 3 is region free

2367
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
This game is not coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan

2368
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That was not something they said as part of the announcement

2369
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
So it is only PS3 in Japan

2370
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
And I bet you, you're going to have a lot of folks that import this

2371
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Although, it's going to be very Japanese heavy still

2372
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
That's the problem

2373
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I don't think I will though

2374
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I mean, I've done that in the past

2375
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I've played Final Fantasy games in Japanese and never had a problem

2376
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Well, look, I don't know Japanese like you guys do

2377
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I don't know Japanese

2378
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I would get nothing from this

2379
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I print out a nice little fan translation of everything and that works

2380
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That's why I played through Final Fantasy VIII when I originally imported that

2381
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
It would be cool if they had English subtitles

2382
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
But they don't want to dip into the US sales

2383
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Naturally, it's not going to be there

2384
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
However, though, that doesn't happen until the international versions

2385
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
That they have English subtitles

2386
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
My copy of Final Fantasy X-2, my Japanese one

2387
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Well, I have the international version

2388
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
It has subtitles

2389
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
No, but I haven't heard of any type of extras

2390
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
That we're going to get in Final Fantasy XIII here in the US

2391
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
With the exception of the fact that we have a 360 version

2392
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
So do you think there will even be an international version this time?

2393
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Maybe

2394
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Or maybe, I guess they could always do a remixed version

2395
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
You know how Final Fantasy X, I don't think there were a whole lot of differences there either

2396
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
But the international version had the different

2397
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
What was the name of the board where you leveled?

2398
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
You filled in the spots on the board

2399
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
That was how you leveled your characters, remember that?

2400
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
They have a different version of that board in the international version

2401
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I wonder if they'll do things like that, I don't know

2402
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
But I am certainly excited for Final Fantasy XIII

2403
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
But not excited enough to import it because I don't know Japanese

2404
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
And for me, the story is everything in Final Fantasy XIII

2405
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Well, it's not everything, but it's like 90% of it

2406
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
So I'm going to wait for the English one

2407
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Which I'll be able to comprehend

2408
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Atdeft points out in our chatroom at chat.orangewashowagerdoo.com

2409
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The international version would probably be on the 360

2410
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I don't think it will in Japan

2411
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I mean, I see where your logic is going and that's a logical thought

2412
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:24,000
But again, you have to remember the 360 has not penetrated the Japanese marketplace the way it has here

2413
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Sony is still on top, well Nintendo is still on top in Japan if I'm not mistaking

2414
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
But Sony has a clear second place

2415
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And I think Microsoft has gained some ground

2416
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
They're not a laughing stock in Japan at this point

2417
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
But they're even further back than where Sony is here

2418
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I mean, at least Sony has been gaining a lot of ground here

2419
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
In this generation

2420
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
But I think in Japan it's a whole different story

2421
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
And Game Guru says the 360 version is your extra

2422
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Keep in mind 360s aren't region free

2423
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
So if you live in Japan and for whatever reason have a 360

2424
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You're out of luck unless you can figure out a way to mod or whatever

2425
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Also, I wanted to kind of point out one thing

2426
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
This had me thinking about was Final Fantasy XIV

2427
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
When do you think we're going to start seeing more Final Fantasy XIV?

2428
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Do you think it's going to come out?

2429
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I don't know if the game itself will come out next year

2430
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But do you think we're going to see a lot more information start to spill out really quick?

2431
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
It seems to me like we're going to have our shortest window

2432
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Between Final Fantasy games with this and XIV

2433
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Being that we already know there's a playable alpha out there

2434
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
That they demoed at a show

2435
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm wondering if XIV is not going to show up at Tokyo Game Show as well

2436
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It might, they may have a little bit there

2437
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
But I don't know how finished they'll be

2438
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That's true, well maybe that same alpha that they had at the Gamescom in Germany

2439
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I don't know

2440
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
But I think it's very possible that we're going to at least see the beta

2441
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Final Fantasy XIV by next year

2442
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
One of my friends was trying to tell me it was going to be this year, the beta

2443
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I'm like dream on

2444
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
There's no way that XIV is going to be out there before XIII is

2445
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
That would just be weird

2446
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
That's like dividing by zero

2447
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
You can't do that in the Final Fantasy universe

2448
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Of course there's a lot of people that think those online games

2449
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Shouldn't be part of the regular numerology anyway

2450
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI

2451
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I sometimes tend to agree with them

2452
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Anyhow, let's keep moving on with some news, Darcyra

2453
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Well there is a rumor going around that there's supposed to be

2454
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Three different 250GB bundles of the PS3

2455
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Coming out in the UK in October

2456
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:36,000
There were FCC documents showing that there was supposed to be a PS3 Slim

2457
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:45,000
And a retail source to a Eurogamer

2458
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
That said that there was supposed to be three different bundles with different games

2459
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
As in Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, Gran Turismo 5, and Assassin's Creed 2

2460
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And they were supposed to sell for £299 which over here would be £494

2461
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And there's of course no statement made to the rumor

2462
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I don't know, are all these different bundles necessary?

2463
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I guess so, I guess bundles help drive sales

2464
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
There's a ton of different PSP bundles here in the States

2465
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
There's the Hannah Montana OMG Girls one and the Rock Band one

2466
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
No, I think that's seriously what it's called

2467
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
OMG Girls Play 2 or something like that

2468
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Kind of their way of getting girls to get Sony PSPs

2469
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Because right now they all have DS's

2470
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
That's funny

2471
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
We'll probably see something over here too

2472
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
As far as US bundles, I'm guessing

2473
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
In time for the holidays, certainly

2474
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Definitely

2475
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
So to kind of go back to something we were talking a little bit about

2476
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Or complaining about I guess in part A

2477
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Was the PSP Go

2478
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And one of the things that they were kind of showing off during E3

2479
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Well actually not so much E3, but during Gamescom was the PSP Minis

2480
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
And they said that there is a possibility though

2481
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
We will see collections of these Minis available on a single UMD

2482
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
At a later stage later on

2483
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Where maybe a publisher or whatever can put out a bunch of these little games

2484
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I guess like you see right now on the Xbox 360 every now and then

2485
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
You'll see an Xbox Live game collection or something like that

2486
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
They also said that there's a possibility that the Minis will jump to the PS3 as well

2487
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
To be downloaded

2488
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I could see that happening especially if they feel that

2489
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
They're not making up enough sales with the PSP Go

2490
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And I have a feeling that's going to be the problem

2491
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
But at the same time

2492
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And to kind of go back to what we were saying before

2493
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
What exactly does the PSP Go have going for

2494
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Other than it's more expensive and slightly smaller

2495
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I mean nothing

2496
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
It's new

2497
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh goody

2498
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So if Nintendo came out with the Wii Gold

2499
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Or something like that

2500
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
It's a gold colored Wii, but it's $500

2501
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Does that mean I have to go buy it?

2502
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I mean that's stupid

2503
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
But

2504
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Oh well

2505
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I mean to me

2506
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Saying that they're going to re-release these on UMD later on

2507
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Makes me feel that they're not really confident in the PSP Go

2508
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,000
And that they will need the supplement or sales by other means

2509
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about putting these on the PS3 as well

2510
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I mean it makes sense

2511
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
But then again we kind of talk about this

2512
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Oh you know they're going to do all this with the Minis

2513
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
We don't really know what they're going to be yet

2514
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
We haven't seen what the Minis are

2515
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Right? Like I know that little picture you have there

2516
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Looks like a little bejeweled thing

2517
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Well they have like Tetris and stuff

2518
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Do they already have some Minis out there?

2519
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Tetris is supposed to be one of the Minis

2520
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I heard by the way that there was somebody

2521
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I was trying to get them to tweet us about it

2522
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Because I didn't have a story on it

2523
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
But I heard about it

2524
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
That there's like a new Tetris in development right now

2525
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Not the Nintendo one, but like a new Tetris

2526
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
There's one for the DS I think, maybe the Wii

2527
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
No there's a different one even outside of that

2528
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Yeah

2529
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Is it now going to have like more blocks?

2530
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Tetris now with more blocks

2531
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Tetromino is made out of five cubes instead

2532
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
No I imagine it's more like probably more competitive in internet things

2533
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
You know like I'm sure there's some people out there

2534
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
They're like how many times can you do Tetris?

2535
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
But like look at Tetris DS

2536
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
A million

2537
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Yeah I mean but realistically yes you can

2538
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Because look at Tetris DS

2539
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
That was an awesome version of Tetris

2540
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
You know one series they've managed to re-release several times

2541
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And actually do a pretty good job with every time

2542
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Is Tetris

2543
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Like if you look at the original PC game

2544
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Then you look at the NES Tetris

2545
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Even Tengen Tetris versus Nintendo Tetris

2546
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And then Game Boy Tetris with its whole link play was revolutionary

2547
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And then Nintendo DS is awesome I mean

2548
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Tetris is kind of actually one game that they've done right

2549
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Many many times

2550
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Not to say it's been perfect

2551
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Because there was a Tetris on the Playstation

2552
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
By Jellico I think it was

2553
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Tetris Plus

2554
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
That was awful

2555
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
It was an awful awful game

2556
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
So it's just kind of interesting

2557
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Agreed

2558
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
You know it's kind of interesting that you can take like

2559
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
A game that's essentially the same and do it so many different ways

2560
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And sometimes it's very very good like Tetris DS

2561
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And sometimes it's very very sad like Tetris Playstation

2562
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So

2563
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Anyhow

2564
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Let me move on I didn't mean to get into a different topic

2565
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
But I did

2566
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I want to talk about Silent Hill Homecoming

2567
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Which you know was the fifth game in the series

2568
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Even though it didn't carry the number 5 on it

2569
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And was somewhat razzed here in the states

2570
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
As you know kind of because it was by an American developer and so forth

2571
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Well the game was set to make its way to Japan

2572
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
But guess what

2573
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
The website was updated this week

2574
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
The Japanese Silent Hill Homecoming website was updated to say

2575
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
The game has been cancelled

2576
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Silent Hill Homecoming will not be out in Japan

2577
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
No reason was given for the decision

2578
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
It just said on the website simply quote

2579
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Please look forward to future titles in the series

2580
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Kind of interesting that

2581
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
They

2582
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
That this game was developed in the west

2583
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Took some shit for that

2584
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
And now the Japanese aren't even going to release it at all

2585
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
But it's not too surprising considering the site hadn't had an update

2586
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Until this

2587
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Since November of 2008

2588
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I don't know what do you guys think

2589
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I don't think Silent Hill Homecoming was terrible by any means

2590
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
But I can see where

2591
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
It's different

2592
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
And maybe

2593
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I don't know I don't know it just seems weird to me

2594
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
That they're not releasing it at all

2595
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Like even under a different name or anything

2596
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Given the reviews that it got here though

2597
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
That's really not very surprising

2598
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Because it doesn't I think

2599
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
The biggest complaint about it was that it didn't have the same kind of

2600
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Scare factor that appealed to Japanese players

2601
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
It wasn't the same type of a scary game

2602
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I don't think the game was terrible it was different

2603
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
But you know I also like Silent Hill 4

2604
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I didn't say it was bad but I'm saying that it wasn't

2605
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
What was up to snuff

2606
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
For that series

2607
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
It's just interesting that

2608
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I wonder if that's because of sales figures here

2609
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I wonder if that game just didn't sell well here

2610
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I don't know Loki from your inside perspective

2611
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I don't know if you would know this but

2612
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
It didn't sell that well here

2613
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
It didn't sell well in the beginning but that's it

2614
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
It's not something that's constantly being reordered or anything

2615
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
It's too bad

2616
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Yeah

2617
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Alright let's get into tonight's mailbag

2618
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
A part of the show where you can interact with us

2619
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
By sending us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

2620
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Dark Sakura's gonna dive in head first into the mailbag

2621
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
And find some emails to read for us

2622
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I am

2623
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
You are, you is

2624
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I is, okay

2625
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Greetings Rob, Loki, Dark Sakura

2626
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Here's the dilemma

2627
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I'm a hardcore PC gamer and want a PS3

2628
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
But can't justify bringing one

2629
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Buying one because

2630
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Any of the games I like for it I can buy for the PC

2631
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And play with better graphics, cheaper and less hassle

2632
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
But I like the idea of having one

2633
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
If only for Gran Turismo and Blu-ray

2634
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
To get a system I would have to buy an HDTV

2635
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Which is expensive

2636
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And I don't know whether I should wait

2637
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
For the 3D TVs

2638
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So many questions so little time

2639
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Are there any good PS3 exclusives

2640
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
That would justify me buying this system

2641
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
And should I wait for 3D TVs

2642
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Also, how do I vote for your show

2643
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Without going through iTunes, I hate Apple

2644
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
The turtle

2645
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Wait, just wait

2646
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
And you can get a Blu-ray player, you know, for your PC

2647
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
So wait, they're getting cheaper

2648
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
The one thing that

2649
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I kind of have to say on this though

2650
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Is that, you know, one thing to consider

2651
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
And has always kind of been a drawback

2652
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Of PC gaming is that you have to constantly

2653
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Build your PC

2654
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And I realize there's PC gaming fans that are gonna

2655
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Hate me for kind of calling that out a little bit

2656
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Cause there's a lot of people that do spend the kind of money

2657
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
To keep on tip top shape

2658
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
But the nice thing about console games is that

2659
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
The metrics are already established

2660
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
On console games

2661
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And that, you know, the game is always

2662
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Going to play the way it was

2663
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Meant to be played on a certain console

2664
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Whereas on the PC sometimes you have to deal with

2665
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Frame rate issues and so forth if your PC is not up to par

2666
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
But it sounds like you are

2667
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
An established PC gamer and you have a lot of games

2668
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
On PC, you probably have a top of the line computer

2669
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
You may have hit the nail on the head

2670
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
If every game you want to play

2671
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Is coming out on PC

2672
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Then maybe you don't have a reason to get a

2673
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
PS3, Dark Soccer makes a good point

2674
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Get a Blu-ray player for your PC

2675
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
They're coming down in price

2676
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
But keep in mind too

2677
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
The Playstation is a bit of an

2678
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Entertainment hub, quote unquote

2679
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Not just the Blu-rays, but you know

2680
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Home and the download movies and so forth

2681
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I don't know if it's really enough to justify a $300

2682
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Expense, especially if you're saying you get all

2683
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Of the rest of it on your computer

2684
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
The only other thing I do want to

2685
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Say though, Sony exclusives, keep that in mind

2686
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
There are certain games that

2687
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Will not come out on the PC, period

2688
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Games like LittleBigPlanet, which are

2689
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Pretty awesome, I gotta say

2690
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Mag, the ModNation Racers

2691
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
These games are not going to ever come out

2692
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
On PC because they're made by Sony and they want you

2693
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
To have a Playstation to play it on

2694
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So, if those games are

2695
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Worth it to you, then you're going to have to take

2696
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
The plunge, but if you know the types of

2697
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Games you're getting are, you know, Batman Arkham

2698
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Asylum, Call of Duty and the games

2699
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
That do come out on PC, then

2700
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
You might be right, you don't need a

2701
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Playstation 3, so don't spend money on one

2702
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Um

2703
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I personally just love the

2704
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Controls and sitting on my couch

2705
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And all that, you know, but that's

2706
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I realize it's not for everybody, that's

2707
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Why we have choices, as far as the other part of your question

2708
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
About iTunes and you want to leave a review

2709
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
That is not on an Apple place, that's fine

2710
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
We always ask, look, just tell

2711
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
A friend about the show, you don't even have to leave a review

2712
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I think there are other places

2713
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
That take them, I don't know of any other big big site

2714
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Like, I know of one called Podcast Alley

2715
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
That has some reviews, like PodcastAlley.com

2716
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
You can always use that, or Dig.com

2717
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
If I could also say something really quick

2718
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
About iTunes reviews, I've become really pissed

2719
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Off at some of the things I've read on there, and I know I

2720
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Shouldn't care, but I kind of do

2721
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
That there's some one star reviews

2722
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
First off, there's a troll on there, and I'm not gonna

2723
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Say who they are, because I'm not gonna give them attention

2724
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
But all I'm gonna say is, when I find out your

2725
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
IP, I'm gonna ban you, so that you

2726
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Can never download the show and listen to it again

2727
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
It's not that I can't take criticism of the show

2728
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
But this person is probably

2729
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Jacking off right now to listen to me talk about

2730
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Them on the air, like, this is why you would write

2731
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
A negative review of a show over

2732
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And over again, that says nothing constructive

2733
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
About the show, so if this is you

2734
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
I want you to know you're banned from this program

2735
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
We do this for free, out of

2736
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Our spare time, because, you know

2737
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
We like to do it

2738
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
You pay nothing for this, and for you to continue

2739
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
To troll us like that is just ridiculous

2740
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
You're banned, and if I ever find out

2741
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Your IP, I will block you from the domain so you can no longer

2742
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Continue to download the show

2743
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
You better pray I never figure that out

2744
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
So, just go get fucked with a chainsaw

2745
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
If you write a negative

2746
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Review, though, and say constructive

2747
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Things, I'm fine with that

2748
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
As long as you've shown that you've listened

2749
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
To the program, because then I saw another

2750
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Review that talked about how we were

2751
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Box fanboys and fangirls

2752
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And I'm like, and that we were always too critical

2753
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Of Sony, and I'm like, okay, we're critical of

2754
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Everybody when we need to be

2755
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Critical, and especially tonight

2756
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
We've barely had any Microsoft

2757
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
News, and maybe a little bit of Sony

2758
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
News, so it's kind of unfortunate because

2759
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
That person clearly based their review off one

2760
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Episode of the show, I'm not mad

2761
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
At that person, I just wish they would've tried

2762
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
A little more before writing that, but I'm not gonna say

2763
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Oh, I'm gonna ban you because you don't like the show, that's ridiculous

2764
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
But if you're trolling, that's the difference

2765
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That other guy needs to go get fucked

2766
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
And I wish, more people need

2767
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
To report that to Apple, too, that's what I did

2768
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So hopefully, because I just, I hate that you can't

2769
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Review reviewers, you kind of

2770
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Can, you can put, was this review helpful

2771
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And I just click no all the time, but the problem

2772
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Is when he rewrites a new review

2773
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Complaining about something in the show this week

2774
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
That, you know, didn't even happen

2775
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Then it just

2776
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Gets rewritten, so

2777
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
There you go

2778
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And I'm looking at chat.orensonsrated.com

2779
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
ActDef says

2780
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Sky rant and FUs incoming, no not yet

2781
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Not yet

2782
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
SHA100Matt says the troll is a

2783
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Former all games listener that one stars every

2784
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Show, including Bobby's, that guy

2785
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Needs to go get fucked, and like I said

2786
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
He's probably jacking off right now because I'm talking

2787
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
About him on the air and he got the attention he

2788
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Looked for, so I'm going to stop talking about him

2789
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
And just hope that a meteor

2790
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Falls on his head

2791
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Next email, please

2792
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Okay

2793
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Um

2794
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Next email, um

2795
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Okay

2796
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I guess this was sent out to multiple people

2797
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
But I'm going to use the part that's addressed

2798
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
To us, um

2799
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I know what you're thinking, dslover the person who

2800
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Despises 360 wants

2801
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
One, I can't read this

2802
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Why is the grammar

2803
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Okay

2804
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Almost no

2805
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'll go read it if you need somebody

2806
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
No Rob, it's not just that

2807
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
They hardly use any punctuation

2808
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So it's hard for me to get phrasing on this

2809
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Just go slow

2810
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Um

2811
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Gosh

2812
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Okay, well if you were wondering

2813
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Why here's the things

2814
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
That pushed me over the edge

2815
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
During my boy scout, oh that's it, you're a boy scout

2816
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
You know, funded by the Mormons

2817
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
During a boy scout troops holiday

2818
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Party where we stay up all night

2819
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Playing games, I saw one of my

2820
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Friends playing Guitar Hero 2

2821
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
And we played over 13 songs, then we played

2822
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Thunder Horse, okay you use a hyphen

2823
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
In a song that doesn't even have a hyphen

2824
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
In the name, okay

2825
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Then at the end of the song, I saw an achievement unlocked

2826
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And then I saw another one of my friends

2827
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Playing Burnout Revenge after he left

2828
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
His 360 in my hands, I plugged in my

2829
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
MP3 player to the 360 and started using

2830
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
My own music like Dragon Force and Anthrax

2831
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
While doing takedowns

2832
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
And crash events made my eyes open

2833
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
And especially when I started playing with my friend

2834
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Communication, flawless, comma

2835
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Finally, compared to the PS

2836
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Doesn't even

2837
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Need a comma, okay

2838
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Compared to the PS3, it can suck my balls

2839
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Sony, I ain't buying your stupid PS3, period

2840
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
I need some recommendations

2841
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
On games and accessories to buy with my system

2842
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And I'm needing one on

2843
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Should I buy it used or new

2844
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I've been waiting for a price drop on 360

2845
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Comma, doesn't need to be there

2846
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I'm wondering which, WITCH

2847
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
By the way, configuration I should start off with

2848
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Sincerely, dslover, PS

2849
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Keep the shows rocking

2850
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
It wasn't even addressed to the right

2851
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
People, was it?

2852
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
We were in there

2853
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I don't know what type of games

2854
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
This guy likes, it's so hard

2855
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
To recommend games when I don't

2856
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Her inner grammar Nazi

2857
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Is crying

2858
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I don't know what type of games to recommend

2859
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
When, put the Dalek away

2860
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I don't know what type of games to recommend

2861
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
When I don't know what type of games you like

2862
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Did he say what type of games he likes to play

2863
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Guitar Hero 2, I don't know

2864
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Get Rock Band Beatles, Guitar Hero 3

2865
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I mean Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 5

2866
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
What game has takedowns in it

2867
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Oh, Burnout

2868
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Burnout Paradise

2869
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Ok, Burnout Paradise and Split Seconds

2870
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Gonna be very cool, and that comes out

2871
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Need for Speed, Fuel

2872
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I liked Fuel even though a lot of people gave it

2873
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Kinda mediocre reviews

2874
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Yeah, I don't know

2875
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
See, when you say what PlayStation 3 game should I get

2876
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Oh, LittleBigPlanet, I think that game's amazing

2877
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
And I think everybody should

2878
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
This person asked about Xbox 360

2879
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I thought they said PS3

2880
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
That was the previous one

2881
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Oh, they want Xbox 360 games they should have?

2882
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
No, they want, they're thinking about getting an Xbox 360

2883
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I thought they said PS3 at the end

2884
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I wanna know, I wanna know which

2885
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Version of the Xbox 360 to get

2886
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
It was the last one

2887
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That asked about what PS3 games

2888
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Were exclusive and what to buy

2889
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You need to find

2890
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
One that matches what needs

2891
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Do you have an HDTV

2892
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
That can benefit from HDMI

2893
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Do you have, you know

2894
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I don't think you need all the frills

2895
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
But I think you do need a hard drive

2896
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
So I wouldn't get the one that doesn't come with a hard drive

2897
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I think that you need to stop thinking about an Xbox 360

2898
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
You need to sell your DS

2899
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
And you need to freakin' hire a tutor

2900
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Wow

2901
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
If you would like Dark Soccer to criticize your emails

2902
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Please send us an email

2903
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2904
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Okay, last one's from Deathwishing

2905
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Um, well

2906
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Thanks to this game, oh let's talk about Beatles

2907
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Rock Band by the way

2908
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Well thanks to this game, I like the Beatles

2909
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Sure, I liked a few songs before, but now I like them all

2910
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
It doesn't even have all of them in there though

2911
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
You need to go download some

2912
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Or pay for the new albums

2913
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Yes, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay

2914
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
It's also very cool to learn about

2915
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
The, about the fan with

2916
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Photos and pictures

2917
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you saw the Jelly Babies photo

2918
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Slayers

2919
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
My favorite song by them is Here Comes the Sun

2920
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
And you know what, I think that's the part

2921
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
That makes harmonics and the

2922
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Surviving Beatles and relatives of

2923
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
The deceased ones very happy

2924
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Is that it's like a whole new generation

2925
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Discovering the Beatles, and I think what they

2926
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Would say to your email is, mission accomplished

2927
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I think that's a very good thing

2928
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So, um

2929
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Congrats to you discovering your love for

2930
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Beatles music

2931
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I don't, I always kind of

2932
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I respect the Beatles

2933
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I don't like, love them or

2934
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Foam of the Mouth about them

2935
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Or even really buy a lot of their albums, but I respect

2936
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Them, I really understand what they did for music

2937
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
And why they were so popular

2938
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
But I'm thinking that maybe playing this game

2939
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Will kind of open up the catalog, but

2940
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I also like the movie Across the Universe

2941
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Somewhat, I actually

2942
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I love that movie

2943
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I didn't like the movie, but I like the parts of the movie

2944
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
It had nice parts

2945
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I do, that's a perfect

2946
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Comparison, it has nice parts, but the whole

2947
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
It adds up to is WTF

2948
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Well, that, therefore the Xanady rating

2949
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I actually love the whole movie

2950
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Um, I was gonna

2951
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Say something else too, yeah, if you had to say

2952
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
You had a favorite song by them, Rob, what would it be?

2953
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Probably Across the Universe

2954
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
But I also know

2955
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Covers of that song that kind of, you know

2956
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Skew me a little bit like that

2957
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Don't say Fiona Apple

2958
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I do like the Fiona Apple cover, but I also like

2959
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Oh, he has one too

2960
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I also really like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

2961
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
William Shatner version? No

2962
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
And I like Strawberry Fields Forever

2963
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And I've been to Strawberry Fields

2964
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
And it's beautiful, in New York City where the

2965
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Imagine Memorial is, so I think

2966
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I think Strawberry Fields Forever

2967
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
And it does make me think of that scene in Across the Universe

2968
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Which I think is one of the better scenes in the movie

2969
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
That seriously is my favorite scene in the movie

2970
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I would say that's definitely one of my top songs

2971
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I met the guy that was

2972
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
In the movie, oh really?

2973
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
How random, I know, there you go

2974
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Well, do you have a favorite song?

2975
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
In what, in Across the Universe? No, Beatles, Beatles song in general

2976
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
No

2977
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Strawberry Fields isn't in the rock band, is it?

2978
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Uh, no

2979
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It should be

2980
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Um, I did want to say though

2981
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Um, one of my

2982
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Probably my favorite favorite song of

2983
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
The Beatles as a

2984
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Not just the band itself, but all the members

2985
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Was Imagine by John Lennon

2986
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I mean, that is a

2987
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Song that will live on forever

2988
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And it rightfully should

2989
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I mean, I think

2990
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
That song, to me, even transcends

2991
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Anything the Beatles ever did

2992
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
But that's just, that's my opinion

2993
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
So, alright, anyhow

2994
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Um, moving on

2995
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Why isn't my Sim dying, by the way?

2996
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Was that it for the mailbag? Yeah, I'm trying to kill the Sim too

2997
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Alright, cause he's a dick

2998
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Let's get into the FUs of the week

2999
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I don't have a story to inspire the FUs of the week

3000
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
But certainly Darksiders, but her Sim is a dick

3001
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Yeah, that's right, her Sim is a dick

3002
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
So the FUs of the week go to that Sim

3003
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Ooh, DarkTetsuya in chat says

3004
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Less Sims, more show, please

3005
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Um, I can do both at the same time

3006
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And you are totally not one to talk, okay?

3007
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Addict! That's right, I can text message

3008
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
At five at the same time, so she can play Sims

3009
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Rob

3010
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
You saw the video, didn't you? Yes, I saw the video

3011
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
That was fantastic!

3012
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
It was stupid! It was great!

3013
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
It was the most over-the-top thing I've ever seen

3014
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I know, but it was gorgeous

3015
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
And I've been to the Rocky Horror Picture

3016
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Show 300 times, and that text messaging

3017
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Crash video was the most over-the-top thing

3018
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Yay, my Sim is drowning! Alright, shut up

3019
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Why'd you build a wall around the pool?

3020
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
So that he couldn't get out?

3021
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
You're killing your dick, Sim

3022
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
And the Sims 3 have learned

3023
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
That they can pull themselves out of the pool

3024
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Without the ladder? Yeah

3025
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Damn it! They're always getting smarter

3026
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
She built walls around the pool

3027
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
As you should

3028
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Well, you can't put a fence around him

3029
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
But what I could do is the moving

3030
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
The move objects on, and then I put

3031
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
The little sign, neighborhood sign

3032
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Can you douse him with gasoline? No

3033
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Alright, can we get to the FUs of the week?

3034
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I guess

3035
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Um

3036
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Um

3037
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
FU to, um

3038
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Going back to work

3039
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Bogey!

3040
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Um

3041
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Huh, I had something

3042
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
And I don't remember what it was

3043
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I guess FU to

3044
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Having a bunch of new locks for my arcade cabinet

3045
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
But not any of the keys

3046
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
That's it

3047
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week

3048
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
I think, um, I've actually been in somewhat

3049
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Good mood, so, um, I don't know

3050
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
FU to the fact that I'm not

3051
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Already at Disneyland, because that's where I'm going to be in a few days

3052
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I'm so

3053
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Freaking excited I need to be there

3054
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
So, oh, did Death show up to get your little

3055
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Yep

3056
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And Death can't get to the person?

3057
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Oh yeah, Death can't do anything

3058
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Alright, anyhow

3059
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
See how Sims is derailing the show?

3060
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Now you need to drown Death in a pool too

3061
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Because that'd be ironic

3062
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Back to games, Loki

3063
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Yes, I am not going to be talking

3064
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
About The Sims

3065
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
However, I am going to be talking about Fallout

3066
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And apparently Bethesda is suing

3067
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Interplay over the

3068
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Fallout MMO

3069
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Um

3070
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I guess, uh, you know

3071
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
They wanted to make a Fallout MMO

3072
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I guess called Project

3073
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
V13

3074
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
And, um

3075
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
You know, the problem is, though, that

3076
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I believe Bethesda has the rights

3077
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
To Fallout right now

3078
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And, um, Interplay infringed on

3079
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Its trademark

3080
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So, um

3081
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Interesting

3082
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I'm surprised, though, if we did see a

3083
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Fallout MMO, that it wouldn't be coming from Bethesda

3084
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I would think that that would be kind of right up

3085
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Their alley

3086
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I think Bethesda's

3087
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Gotta be working on some MMO

3088
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Right now, but it's probably in the Elder Scrolls

3089
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Universe, not Fallout

3090
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
But, who knows? Anything's possible

3091
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Both those games are huge. How about combining

3092
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Them?

3093
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Nuclear Holocaust in, like, the medieval

3094
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Times? A nuclear holocaust hits

3095
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
The world of, what's the name of the world that

3096
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
The Elder Scrolls is set in?

3097
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I can't remember. But that's what we need

3098
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
We need a crossover game of the two

3099
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
And it's an MMO. There you go

3100
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Or that they

3101
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Turn nomadic and they're back

3102
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Now to, like, you know, medieval

3103
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Technology

3104
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
You know I still haven't played Fallout 3

3105
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Like, I'm like

3106
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
It's Oblivion with guns. I don't know how I wouldn't like

3107
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
This game, but I just somehow haven't played it

3108
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I'm too addicted to Warcraft

3109
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I have Fallout 3 and I have still not played it

3110
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I also have Left 4 Dead and still have not played it

3111
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Can I borrow your Fallout 3 if you're not gonna play it?

3112
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
See, Fallout 3 is pretty cool

3113
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Is it?

3114
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Becky's Husband was playing

3115
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Quite a bit of it and it just looks

3116
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Really cool. I liked it

3117
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
No, I've never heard anything but good things about it

3118
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
And even when I've watched it, it looks like a lot of fun

3119
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Remember guys, I don't have time to play

3120
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Every game, especially when you're addicted to an MMO

3121
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Actually, no, I take that back

3122
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I think I did sell it already

3123
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Cause I don't have a lot of

3124
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Games anymore

3125
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Wow, you unloaded all your games? Why?

3126
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Different reasons

3127
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Alright, well

3128
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Do you think Bethesda has any ground to stand on with this?

3129
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I mean, do you think they'll win, Loki?

3130
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Yeah, if they have the rights for it right now

3131
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I mean, I know Interplay I think was the one that actually

3132
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Came out with the original Fallout, but

3133
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Um

3134
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I don't know, they're saying that

3135
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
This has caused

3136
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Immediate, substantial

3137
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Inrepairable harm, I guess

3138
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I don't know

3139
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It probably wasn't going to end up working out for them anyways

3140
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Okay, well

3141
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I want to move on to one more story

3142
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Before we get to your phone calls tonight

3143
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
And it has to do with the Nintendo Wii

3144
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Apparently, Nintendo

3145
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Is going to price

3146
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
The Wii

3147
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Rumor is that the Wii is going to get its price drop

3148
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
The first week of October

3149
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Which makes sense, cause the machine still costs $250

3150
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
And you know, isn't the Xbox 360

3151
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Now $199?

3152
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Yep

3153
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
And it has been for a while, so

3154
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I think the Wii is probably going to have to move

3155
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
To a price drop

3156
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Their sales have been kind of slowing down

3157
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Well, plus it's time to update with the pack too

3158
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
You know, I think it's inevitable

3159
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
They're going to put Wii Motion Plus in it

3160
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
And Wii Sports Relevance

3161
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I think is what you're going to find

3162
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
In the new pack

3163
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
No?

3164
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
No, it's going to stay the same

3165
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Really?

3166
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I think it is

3167
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
You don't think they'll bundle in an extra game?

3168
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
No, because you can't get Wii Sports by itself

3169
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
What about a Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort bundle?

3170
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
What about it comes with Wii Sports

3171
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
No, because that would impact their sales of Wii Sports Resort

3172
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Really?

3173
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Yeah

3174
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Well, we'll see

3175
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
This is from an early version of a Walmart ad

3176
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
But apparently it is coming soon

3177
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I don't see the exact price though

3178
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
It's just apparently the ad says

3179
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
That it's coming

3180
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
So we don't know exactly what the new price is

3181
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
But

3182
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Now, Nintendo doesn't

3183
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Do Tokyo Game Show

3184
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
But they will be participating in a thing called

3185
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Kyoto Cross Media Experience 2009

3186
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
But that's at the end of September

3187
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
September 26th to October 4th

3188
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
So if they're going to announce a price drop

3189
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
That's when it's kind of expected

3190
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
To happen, because Nintendo never does

3191
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Tokyo Game Show

3192
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I don't remember the reason behind it

3193
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
They kind of do their own media thing in Japan

3194
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Got it

3195
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
So, very interesting

3196
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It is

3197
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I wonder if there will be a fitness thing

3198
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Like maybe the original Wii Fit

3199
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Or something, I don't know

3200
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Because then you'd have to throw in the Wii Fit

3201
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Balance board

3202
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I can see maybe some holiday bundles

3203
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
If they're going to do anything

3204
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
What they're going to do is some crappy

3205
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Holiday bundle later on

3206
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
That it's going to have new Super Mario Brothers

3207
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Wii bundled in it, and maybe that's it

3208
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
But, you know

3209
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
At the same time, they may think that their

3210
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Game system stands alone

3211
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
That it's just super awesome

3212
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
That they're going to drop the price a little bit

3213
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Just to kind of spark some more sales

3214
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
But, I don't know

3215
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I mean, we'll see

3216
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Yeah, I mean there's really nothing on the Wii

3217
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I'm really looking forward to

3218
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Even the new Super Mario Brothers, I'm very meh about

3219
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I kind of wish

3220
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I was just thinking the other day

3221
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Even though I understand they have the new

3222
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Super Mario Brothers and so forth

3223
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I wish they would just release a game called

3224
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Super Mario Brothers 4

3225
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
And make it very similar to like Mario 3

3226
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
But with the whole like

3227
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
New graphics and the types of things

3228
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
That you can do on the Wii

3229
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
That's not 3D

3230
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Would that be Super Mario World?

3231
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Well, I would like to just see them make a game

3232
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Called Super Mario Brothers 4

3233
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
That kind of does away with

3234
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
You know, a lot of the changes to the Mario Universe

3235
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
That might be too difficult for Grandma

3236
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Maybe

3237
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Maybe I just live in this weird fanboy bubble

3238
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Or I just miss the old school days

3239
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Of Nintendo, but

3240
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
It'd be kind of cool

3241
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Alright, I guess it's time

3242
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
For us to open up the Skype line

3243
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
We're ready to take some calls

3244
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

3245
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like to

3246
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Give a comment on any topic that you've heard about tonight

3247
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
And we'll take some calls

3248
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
To see what's on your mind

3249
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I'll ask if there's any last minute stories

3250
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Here in the studio because we have a delay

3251
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Oh, no, we just, we're getting our first call

3252
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3253
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Well, I'm the first caller, hey, this is X-Link

3254
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Well, hello X-Link, congratulations, you've

3255
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Beaten some of our serial phone callers

3256
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
That seem to get through every week

3257
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
It's been a little while since we've heard from you, what's on your mind?

3258
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Yes, actually I played

3259
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
A really cool demo on the Playstation Store this weekend

3260
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
It was called the Half Minute Hero

3261
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Which was really interesting

3262
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
It had a Final Fantasy 1

3263
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Dragon War 1

3264
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Type, you know, NES

3265
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Roleplaying type feel to it

3266
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
But they give you 30 seconds

3267
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
From the time you start

3268
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
To get to the boss

3269
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
To beat the boss

3270
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
But in order to do this

3271
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
You like, really, it plays like

3272
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Basically you're playing the game in fast forward

3273
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I've heard about this, isn't this the one, doesn't it switch

3274
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Genres too, like every 30 seconds?

3275
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I remember, there's a demo for that

3276
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Out now? Yes

3277
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Is that on PSP? It's coming soon

3278
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Yeah, it's coming

3279
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
It's coming on, it's supposedly October 20th

3280
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Is the release date for it

3281
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Is that on PSP or PS3?

3282
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
PSP

3283
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Oh, I want to check that out, that game, I remember

3284
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
When we reported on that game and I was like, oh, it's kind of like

3285
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
WarioWare, but like

3286
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
It sounds even cooler than, what was the

3287
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
WarioWare clone we got on PSP, WTF, right?

3288
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
WTF was kind of funny

3289
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
This sounds even cooler, like

3290
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I definitely want to check this out, so

3291
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Did it feel like WarioWare to you, XLink?

3292
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Was it? Kind of, yeah, but it had

3293
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
More of a, when I played it, it had

3294
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
More of the Roleplaying type feel, so it's

3295
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
More like playing Final Fantasy 1

3296
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
On fast forward, like I said before, so it was

3297
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Really good though

3298
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Cool

3299
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
How far did the demo let you go? I mean, it sounds like

3300
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
With games like that, I wouldn't think you could do much of a demo

3301
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Because, well, you start on

3302
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
This small island, and they're like, okay, you're

3303
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Here, the boss is here, go

3304
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And then they give you the 30 seconds, we'll count

3305
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Down, and then

3306
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
There's like one or two islands you can choose, the first one

3307
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Does that one, and the second one's more complicated

3308
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Where it's like, here's the

3309
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Town, here's where the

3310
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Boss is, here's where it doesn't, where you can get more gold

3311
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
For, you know, items and stuff

3312
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
But in the town, it has a statue

3313
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Where we'll reset the timer

3314
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
The 30 seconds, depending on how much

3315
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Gold per time you do it

3316
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
So the demo

3317
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Was cool enough for you to go pre-order the game?

3318
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Oh, definitely, I would definitely

3319
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Pre-order it

3320
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
It had like

3321
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Other elements I saw from the

3322
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Trailer, which really piqued my interest

3323
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Like shootings and stuff like that

3324
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
And summons

3325
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
A successful demo, thank you for calling me

3326
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
To tell me about it, because I'm gonna go

3327
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Put that in my queue to download my PSP

3328
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
No, no problem

3329
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I got to get my PS3 and PSP to work together

3330
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
And I got a better memory card for my PSP

3331
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I'm all about checking out all the latest

3332
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Demos and so forth, because I know I've been critical

3333
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Of the PSP as a gaming device

3334
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
But there are some gems out there, there's some real

3335
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Gems out there, definitely, and I'm looking forward to

3336
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Two percent, which comes out in about two weeks

3337
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I already had that pre-ordered and paid for

3338
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Awesome, well anything

3339
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Else on your mind tonight, buddy?

3340
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Nah, not really, I've been too busy

3341
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Doing my live journal game, so I've been

3342
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Really trying to catch up back on the

3343
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
News here during the weekend, so

3344
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Of course I'll send it to you guys and give you guys five stars

3345
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I know what you're talking about, and I hope it's

3346
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Fun for you, in fact I'm going to be talking about

3347
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Live journal games on this show in a couple weeks

3348
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Because I'm going to be hosting another one, and I want people to

3349
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Sign up and play

3350
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Real quickly, it was very unique

3351
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
The way some of you guys approached me and told me

3352
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Oh hey, if you like doing this kind of stuff

3353
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
You might like doing this, so I signed up for it

3354
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
It was very unique and very fun

3355
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
And I got to meet a lot of

3356
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
New people through it, and if

3357
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Everybody has to do it or wants to do it

3358
02:25:35,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I'll give you more details in a couple weeks here on Orange Lawns Radio

3359
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
He kind of already had it lined out

3360
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
He spoke very well, obviously tested

3361
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
This connection before, and you know

3362
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Just kind of laid it all out there

3363
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
When I asked him if there was anything else, he kind of

3364
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Added a little more, and I just

3365
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Very good, everybody take notes

3366
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
From that last call, so sorry about that

3367
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Rama, now you have to follow that

3368
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I'm not trying to say we get bad calls

3369
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I'm just saying that if you want to know what I think

3370
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
A perfect phone call is, that last call was great

3371
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
So now you have to follow it Rama

3372
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
What's on your mind tonight?

3373
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Well, I will do my best, but first off

3374
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Me and Jodea, we went to a

3375
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Classic gaming convention yesterday

3376
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Called Gamecore

3377
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
First of them post

3378
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
A link in the chat

3379
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Makes for great radio, doesn't it?

3380
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Yes, exactly, that's okay, I'll forgive you

3381
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Thank you, the pictures are on

3382
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Small and large size, because it was

3383
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
A lot of stuff

3384
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I can call this convention like

3385
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Jamie's vault

3386
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Game six, that's how much

3387
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Stuff was there, you had a lot of

3388
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Classic arcade machines there

3389
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
That were for sale, such as the

3390
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Simpsons arcade machine for like 400 bucks

3391
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Oh my god, I would have went home with that

3392
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Seriously? Even though I'm supposed to be

3393
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Saving for a new car right now, I would have went home with that

3394
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Dude, it was cash and carry

3395
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Do they really?

3396
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Oh my god, I should get an arcade machine

3397
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
For my house, you should

3398
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Wouldn't my roommate fucking love that?

3399
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Sorry, by the way

3400
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Rob, I met your picture gallery, there's a lot of broken pictures

3401
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
You might want to check that out

3402
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I don't know if it's me or...

3403
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
It's an issue with the gallery sulfur, but if you click on the broken

3404
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Link, the picture will actually show up

3405
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Okay, I probably shouldn't look at them all

3406
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
During the show, but I am looking at some of these things

3407
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Yeah, I see some things that are reminiscent

3408
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Of classic gaming expos, certainly, did they have a lot

3409
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Of playable stuff out there?

3410
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Pretty much they did, a lot of

3411
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Arcade machines, they had a

3412
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Roll of Dreamcast set up to celebrate

3413
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
The tenth anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast

3414
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
There was an actual Neo Geo

3415
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
MVS machine set up, not the whole

3416
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Arcade unit, but the actual console

3417
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
And board, you know?

3418
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I have an MVS board now

3419
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Sweet

3420
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Dude, what is up with everybody getting fucking Neo Geo

3421
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
MVS boards? You, Bobby

3422
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
No, okay, here's the thing

3423
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
They threw it in with my cabinet

3424
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Because I was testing

3425
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
To test my cabinet, they plugged an MVS board

3426
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
In there, and they're like, okay

3427
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
And he's all, hey, you want this board for

3428
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
You know, 60 bucks, and I'll throw in this bootleg

3429
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
48-in-1 cart with him, like

3430
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
What?

3431
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
What? I am so uncool

3432
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I have to get one

3433
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I have to fit in with

3434
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Everybody else, I'm gonna have to get a fucking Neo Geo

3435
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Now, just so I can feel cool

3436
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Sorry, Rama, I didn't mean to derail your call

3437
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
See, this is an example of where the hosts

3438
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Derail your call

3439
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Which happens, what town was this

3440
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Convention in again?

3441
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Oaks, Pennsylvania, it was about

3442
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
20 minutes outside of Philly

3443
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
I wonder

3444
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Was it at, like, an actual classic gaming store

3445
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Or is there one, like, right nearby?

3446
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
No, it was an actual

3447
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Convention center

3448
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Oddly enough, a lot of the people that are selling

3449
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Old school games and accessories

3450
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Were right out of Jersey

3451
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Because there was a classic gaming store in Pennsylvania

3452
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
I was gonna visit when I was out there

3453
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Because, you know, I spent several weeks in Allentown for work

3454
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
And I just never got out to the store I was gonna go to

3455
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I don't even know if it's still in business, it was a few years ago

3456
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I'm sorry

3457
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Did they do panels or anything else at this con

3458
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Or was it just mostly, like, a sales floor

3459
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
That you could test the merchandise

3460
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
There were panels there

3461
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
But I didn't get a chance to check them out

3462
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
But what they were mostly also focusing on was

3463
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Nerdcore rappers

3464
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And Chiptunes music

3465
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Nice

3466
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
The list of people that were there

3467
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Performing was MC Lars, YT Cracker

3468
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Super 8-Bit Brothers

3469
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Armadillo Tank

3470
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
This is cool

3471
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Yes, yes

3472
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Did you go to the concerts at all?

3473
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I went to a couple of the concerts

3474
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I walked in on Super 8-Bit Brothers

3475
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And since I was dressed as Luigi

3476
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I got a lot of props and shout-outs

3477
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Very nice

3478
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
There was actually a couple of classic cars there

3479
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Such as the DeLorean and Kit

3480
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Huh

3481
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Well, sounds like you had a lot of fun at the convention

3482
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Is this something that travels

3483
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Or was it just the one place

3484
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I was talking to some of the people

3485
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
That helped create it

3486
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And they were seeing some ups and downs

3487
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
They had with it

3488
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
So they're looking to do things a little bit differently

3489
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
For next year

3490
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
And also I have a bit of a game review too

3491
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Oh, please

3492
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Yes

3493
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
There was a company there called Storm City Games

3494
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Independent publishing group

3495
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
They had a game there

3496
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
They were demoing out called Hands-On Tangrams

3497
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Like the Tangrams

3498
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Like we used to play with in junior high school

3499
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
That game came out a long time ago

3500
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Interesting

3501
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Alright, well how was it

3502
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Did you get your Tangram on

3503
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Yes I did

3504
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
And for 20 bucks I think it was well worth it

3505
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
This is like a perfect time waster

3506
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
If you need to kill 10-20 minutes while you're waiting for something

3507
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I came out back in spring

3508
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Okay, Debbie Downer

3509
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Hands-On Tangrams

3510
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
They said they had the demo

3511
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
And this is actually coming out October

3512
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Maybe it's a new platform or a new version

3513
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Maybe that's what's going on

3514
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Probably so

3515
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Alright, well Rama we're going to let you go get some more calls

3516
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
But I'm glad you had fun at the convention

3517
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Sure, sure, sure

3518
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Can we talk to Jamie for one quick second please

3519
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I suppose

3520
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Hello

3521
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Hello

3522
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Hi

3523
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
While we were there they were actually

3524
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Doing viewings for

3525
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Nerdcore Rising

3526
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Which is the film by

3527
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
MC Frontalot

3528
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
And they were actually giving a couple of them out

3529
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
I

3530
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Had asked Rama to go up there

3531
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
And see if he could win one

3532
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And he did

3533
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
So we're going to be giving it to you Jamie

3534
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
What

3535
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Yes

3536
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
It's a copy of Nerdcore Rising

3537
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And if you open it up on the DVD itself

3538
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It is signed by

3539
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
MC Frontalot

3540
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
And it says

3541
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Win win win on there, we don't know exactly

3542
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Who wrote that on the DVD

3543
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
But we think it was Lars

3544
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Sweet, we're not exactly sure

3545
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
But yeah, just wanted to let you know that

3546
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
And who is this on the phone right now

3547
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
This would be Giove Day, Patty

3548
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Hello, well welcome to the show, I don't think you've ever

3549
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Called in before, but what a great first

3550
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Call, we like when new

3551
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
People on the show give stuff away

3552
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I don't remember her talk, I know she's been in

3553
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Chat and Twitter and all that

3554
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
We've heard her

3555
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
With Rama before

3556
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Well that's awesome

3557
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
And then you have to deliver it to me in person

3558
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I will attempt that

3559
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I swear to God

3560
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I will try and attempt that one

3561
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
If not, I am actually

3562
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Looking to get to New York, possibly as soon as

3563
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
The end of the year, so I may just have to come pick it up

3564
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
That would work too

3565
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
On behalf of Dark Soccer

3566
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And then I can forget to give it to her

3567
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I'm just

3568
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Just kidding, no that sounds really awesome

3569
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
That's so awesome

3570
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Of some of our listeners to do

3571
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Thank you guys

3572
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
And how did you like the con, Giove Day

3573
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
How did you like it

3574
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I liked it a lot, it was

3575
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
I'm not really big into loud

3576
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Crazy conventions, it was nice, it was mellow

3577
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
But there was enough stuff there to do

3578
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
That you didn't feel that you were bored

3579
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Alright

3580
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Very cool, and any favorite classic game

3581
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
That you discovered or something that you played

3582
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
No, I was actually

3583
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
In the booth most of the time

3584
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Chatting with the guy next to us

3585
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Who was selling all the D&D

3586
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Stuff and he sold me

3587
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
D&D dice for two bucks

3588
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
That made me happy

3589
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Hey, nerds need their dice

3590
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Yes, we do

3591
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Well, we're gonna let you go so we can roll the dice

3592
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
On another phone call, but thank you so much you guys

3593
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
That sounds like an awesome present and you guys didn't have to

3594
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Do that, so I know Dark Soccer

3595
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Is bouncing as she's playing The Sims

3596
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Hey, I'm bouncing in like

3597
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Most of my parts, they're quivering with joy

3598
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Alright

3599
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Before this gets dirty, I'm gonna have to let you go

3600
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Night guys

3601
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Alright, take care

3602
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
We've had some good phone calls tonight

3603
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Any call that gives Dark Soccer like something

3604
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Free is always gonna be a good call

3605
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
That makes my liver quiver

3606
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
There's just no way that that's gonna be a bad call

3607
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch, wait, did I answer this one?

3608
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
There we go, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3609
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
This is Cheeseburger

3610
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Hi, Cheeseburger, have you been on the show before?

3611
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I don't think you've ever called

3612
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
No, I haven't, I've been in chat

3613
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
You've got a deeper voice than I imagined

3614
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I've heard your name before

3615
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Like reading the Twitters and the chat and all that

3616
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
And I just want to point out

3617
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
The icon on Skype is

3618
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
A picture of a cheeseburger

3619
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Why do you go by cheeseburger?

3620
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I know why I guess by cheeseburger, because I read his emails

3621
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Are you just a big fan of cheeseburgers?

3622
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
No, it's extremely similar to my last name

3623
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Oh

3624
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
See, I know

3625
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Okay, I get it

3626
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
If you go on the wiki, I put it on there

3627
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Alright, cheeseburger, I'll stop interrogating you

3628
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Because you called us, what's on your mind tonight?

3629
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I know you played WoW for a while

3630
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
And I just want to know why you got back into it

3631
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I didn't know you got back into it

3632
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I'm trying to think how far I want to get into this on a public radio show

3633
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
The reason why I had to stop playing WoW

3634
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Was I found myself kind of getting too involved

3635
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
With some of the stuff that was going on in the guild

3636
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
And unfortunately

3637
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
As seems to always happen in various guilds in WoW

3638
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
There was some very unfortunate guild drama

3639
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Where people went their separate ways

3640
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
And it really kind of turned me off to the game

3641
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Because part of me

3642
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Actually, all of me felt it was very unnecessary

3643
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,000
And that I think if people across the board

3644
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Had been a little more reasonable

3645
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
And open minded and hadn't reacted

3646
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
And I think some very selfish things were done by certain people

3647
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And god, I hope I'm going to get in deep hot water

3648
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
For getting into this on my radio show

3649
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
But unfortunately, that's just kind of how I view things

3650
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
And I just thought

3651
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
You know, I am taking this too much

3652
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
For something that's an online game

3653
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
I need to just step away and involve real life for a while

3654
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
And you know, at the same time

3655
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I was starting to date somebody new

3656
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
And kind of get into a relationship

3657
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,000
And you know, anything that happens in real life

3658
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Is more important than WoW

3659
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
WoW is what you go to when you're bored

3660
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
So the reason why I got back in

3661
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Well, I found a new group of people to play with

3662
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
That have different goals in the game

3663
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
That aren't so focused on the end game rating

3664
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And so forth

3665
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And just kind of rediscovering what makes WoW fun

3666
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,000
And also I dumped the guy I was seeing

3667
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,000
So I have a little more spare time now

3668
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,000
It's kind of like what I told one of my friends

3669
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
When she criticized me, she's like

3670
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I can't believe you went back to Warcraft

3671
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I said, this is what depressed people do

3672
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I wouldn't really say I'm depressed

3673
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
It's just, you know, it's a time waster

3674
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
But like I said, I think real life

3675
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
If there's stuff going on in real life

3676
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
It will always be better than WoW

3677
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
And this is kind of what I tell people

3678
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I don't watch a lot of TV

3679
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
There's some things I watch

3680
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
But I don't watch as much as probably most people do

3681
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I'm playing while I'm not playing as many console games

3682
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
It's just my entertainment of choice

3683
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
But, you know, finding a balance is important

3684
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
What realm do you play on?

3685
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Right now I am playing Alliance on Blade's Edge

3686
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Is the server I'm playing on

3687
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Is it alright if I join your guild?

3688
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Possibly, send me an email after the show

3689
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
It's not my guild

3690
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
That's the difference this time

3691
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Actually, I wasn't in charge of the guild before

3692
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
But I knew the people in charge more

3693
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Than I know the ones here

3694
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
As long as you're not a dick

3695
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Which you don't sound like from your phone call

3696
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I don't see why not

3697
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Cool!

3698
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Alright, well you take care of yourself

3699
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Thanks for the call, okay?

3700
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Alright, you too. See ya. Take care

3701
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
See, I was gonna say at the end of that phone call

3702
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
For the Horde! But then I was like, oh shit, I'm Alliance now

3703
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I can't say that. I'm playing one of each

3704
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
You're playing what? One of each

3705
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
One of each? You're on a different server, right?

3706
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I am, but I'll play on another

3707
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I think I'm actually gonna pay for it

3708
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
But I'm playing

3709
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
A blood elf

3710
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
And I'm playing a goat girl

3711
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Alright, fair enough

3712
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
You know what I mean by a goat girl

3713
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yes, Draenai

3714
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Draeno!

3715
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

3716
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
And those were all excellent calls tonight, so thank you very much

3717
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I think we'll leave it at that

3718
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I do still see calls coming in

3719
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
But no offense, all those guys that are calling in

3720
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Have been on the show before

3721
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
So we're gonna leave this as a

3722
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
New caller, well even though Rama's not a new caller

3723
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
So

3724
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Two out of three at best

3725
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Plus about three phone calls

3726
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Tonight's good, so

3727
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
If you didn't get through tonight though

3728
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Twitter topics next week, we didn't get a lot tonight

3729
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
And don't forget you can always interact with the chat room

3730
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Mailbag! Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

3731
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Always plenty of ways to interact with the program

3732
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
So let's get into some

3733
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Last minute stories, I never

3734
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Allowed Loki the chance

3735
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
I'm not gonna steal one more cookie, because they're delicious

3736
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
That's fine, they're there for stealing

3737
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
And we can throw away all the

3738
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Bacon stuff, except for my plate

3739
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
I need that plate

3740
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Well, why don't we feed all the bacon stuff to Dan?

3741
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Well, if he wants it

3742
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
What the hell is this crap

3743
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Anyways, Sonic is

3744
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Possibly gonna come back in the way that it

3745
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Should've been coming back in the first place

3746
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
None of these 3D

3747
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Crapfests with were

3748
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Hedgehogs and that kind of stuff

3749
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
No, we're actually gonna get a brand

3750
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
New 2D HD

3751
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Sonic the Hedgehog game

3752
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
It's gonna be as old school fun

3753
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
As it can get

3754
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
And it's in the early planning stages right now

3755
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
But they do have a wonderful teaser for

3756
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
What they're calling as Project Needlemouse

3757
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
The working title for the game

3758
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
So that's kinda neat

3759
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
King of Fighters

3760
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
You may remember that they had a

3761
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Japanese

3762
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Shoot-em-up version of King of Fighters

3763
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Called Sky Stage

3764
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
To Xbox Live Arcade

3765
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Well now it's also making its way

3766
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
To arcades as well

3767
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And

3768
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I don't know man

3769
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
I've seen screenshots and video of this

3770
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
It just looks weird

3771
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I don't think King of Fighters really translates itself

3772
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Well into

3773
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
It's one of those things I wanna see just once though

3774
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Just like for the WTF value

3775
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Yeah

3776
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
By the way, the Sonic 2D thing

3777
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
I'm a little nervous about that

3778
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
And I'm with everybody else in the camp

3779
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Of OMG Awesome

3780
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Sonic 2D

3781
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Hopefully it's kinda influenced by Mega Man 9

3782
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Just to go back to your damn roots

3783
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
But I am a little worried because

3784
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
This is like the third time Sonic has been

3785
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Reinvented

3786
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And the last few have not been that great

3787
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
So I really hope this one's good

3788
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I'm hopeful

3789
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
But I'm a little apprehensive and I think I have the right to be

3790
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
As do all the rest of you

3791
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Yeah

3792
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
And then

3793
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Also to kinda go along with

3794
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Some stuff we were talking about before

3795
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
You may remember that porn has been

3796
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Kind of

3797
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Making its way to the Playstation 3

3798
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Playstation Network

3799
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
In Japan

3800
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Well now apparently Vivid Entertainment

3801
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Is hoping to do the same thing in the US

3802
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
They're making a stand

3803
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Trying to convince

3804
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Sony that their porn

3805
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Should be on

3806
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
The Playstation Network

3807
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Bravo I say

3808
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
So that'll be kind of interesting

3809
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
And

3810
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Apparently

3811
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
You know to kinda go back to some of the

3812
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Piracy stuff we were talking about

3813
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
We may have talked about this in the past

3814
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
But yes

3815
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
They have finally released the sequel

3816
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
The official sequel to

3817
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Don't Copy That Fluffy

3818
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Don't Copy That 2

3819
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
And let me tell you this much

3820
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
And then promptly copied a floppy

3821
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
And it's horrible

3822
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
If I still had a floppy I would copy it

3823
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And my favorite

3824
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Thing about this is they're talking about how

3825
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Oh copying is a crime and stuff

3826
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And yeah piracy is a crime

3827
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Whatever but the guy that they show

3828
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
At the very end there's like a real pirate

3829
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I guess who

3830
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
He was selling copies of stuff

3831
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Okay I think that's something

3832
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
That's gonna probably land you in jail more than

3833
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Pirating games for your own use

3834
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Can I get into this a little bit

3835
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Because I haven't seen the video

3836
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
I've purposely not watched the video because I

3837
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Thought maybe I would watch it here on the show

3838
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
So how long is it? Is it long?

3839
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
No it shouldn't be that long

3840
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
About five minutes

3841
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Well it's got a funny song

3842
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
He raps in it

3843
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
And we can laugh at it

3844
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I don't know legally how much of it we can play here on the show

3845
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
It's a YouTube clip

3846
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
I think they want it

3847
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Freely distributed everywhere

3848
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Even if we're critical of it?

3849
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Even if we're critical of it

3850
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
So are we gonna copy the

3851
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
The thing

3852
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Read that in a minute DarkSocker I know what you're looking at

3853
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
It's related

3854
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Where is it here who linked it in chat here

3855
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
It's this right

3856
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Okay hold on I'm bringing it up in studio sorry

3857
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Okay here it is

3858
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Don't copy that floppy 2

3859
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Welcome back to 90's Time Trip

3860
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
It's that anti-piracy classic

3861
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Don't copy that floppy

3862
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Can I just skip ahead here

3863
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
I don't wanna watch this whole damn thing

3864
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
I just wanna see what the song sounds like

3865
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
And I wanna see that bit at the end

3866
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
He looks kinda like Max Headroom but black

3867
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Like is it just me?

3868
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
But that's kinda what it looks like

3869
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Sorta

3870
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Don't copy it

3871
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Oh he does

3872
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
See?

3873
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
I don't know it's not

3874
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
As funny as the other one was

3875
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
I think the old 90's

3876
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Value of the first one is what made it so

3877
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Funny and catchy but this one

3878
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Is like

3879
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Technically enough is a copy of a copy

3880
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And you know how copies of copies

3881
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Like lose quality over time

3882
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
That's what I feel this is

3883
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Like a unnecessary

3884
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Sequel okay I wanna see the bit

3885
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Woah what happened the thing stopped

3886
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Don't do that

3887
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Don't stoppie my floppy alright

3888
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Let me see the bit at the end

3889
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
It's about the last minute is where the pirate shows up

3890
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Um yeah even

3891
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I wanna see

3892
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I wanna see the little like

3893
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Message to kids

3894
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Would I be immature for making fun of his voice?

3895
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Because

3896
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I wondered if that was a woman

3897
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I don't mean to sound rude

3898
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
And or petty and I should really

3899
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Not be the first to talk but

3900
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Like

3901
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
He doesn't sound like he's ever gone through puberty

3902
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Maybe that's

3903
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Is that a disease?

3904
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
See what happens when you copy

3905
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Does piracy

3906
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Does selling pirated

3907
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Does selling pirated games cause

3908
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Your balls to go back into your body

3909
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Or something like

3910
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I think being in prison causes your balls to go back

3911
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Into your body

3912
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I had to look at his neck

3913
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I guess it's okay for me to make fun of him because he is a felon

3914
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I had to look at his neck

3915
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
To see if there was an Adam's apple?

3916
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Oh he's got too much facial hair

3917
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Even if that was drugs

3918
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
A woman can grow that much facial hair

3919
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
With hormonal therapy yes really

3920
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I wanna see the rest

3921
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Can I see the rest of this uplifting message here

3922
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Oh he's

3923
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Sad face

3924
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
It was just a sad face that was the end of it

3925
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Nevermind

3926
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
So now he's serving four years in jail

3927
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I learned my lesson

3928
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
And now he's being made fun of on the internet

3929
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Well how about you don't

3930
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Sell pirated copies of stuff

3931
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Stupid

3932
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Of course see that's the people that they go after

3933
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Is the big piracy rings that

3934
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Cause companies money because they're actually

3935
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Selling bootleg copies

3936
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Amazetatsuma in chat says his body

3937
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Copied too much estrogen

3938
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
And Rama says and people wonder why

3939
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Software is so fucking expensive

3940
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
By the way that's a free download

3941
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
At iTunes

3942
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Yeah better be it wouldn't be worth

3943
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Someone should go copy it

3944
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Ha ha ha

3945
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Oh you gotta love irony

3946
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Alright guess who's never gonna download that

3947
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Me

3948
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
DarkSocker you had a last minute story and then we'll let Loki

3949
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Finish up if he has anything else

3950
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Yeah it's actually somebody

3951
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
To quote Silent Scope

3952
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Let's play Metal Gear for real

3953
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
A guy

3954
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
In France who was

3955
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Accused of killing

3956
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
The

3957
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
There's an actor Roland Gerard

3958
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
He was convicted with

3959
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Well supposed to be going actually in jail waiting

3960
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Trial for killing the guys daughter

3961
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And her friend

3962
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
He escaped

3963
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
From jail in a box

3964
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
In a box

3965
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Playing Metal Gear

3966
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Not really

3967
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
He had put himself

3968
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
In a box that was

3969
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Being

3970
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Loaded onto a truck to take to southeast

3971
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Of Paris

3972
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And he broke free

3973
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
And the driver didn't even figure it out until later

3974
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
And so the guys from what I can

3975
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
See is still at large

3976
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
His name is

3977
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Jean-Pierre Trebert

3978
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I think so

3979
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Trebek

3980
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Not Trebek

3981
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
But uh

3982
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I just thought it was kind of funny

3983
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
That he shipped himself out in a box

3984
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Like Solid Snake

3985
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
It's myself in a box

3986
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Anyhow sorry

3987
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Like Solid Snake you know

3988
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Oh no

3989
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Cause you know in the game he was in a box

3990
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
And he moved the box in the truck

3991
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
And says oh no the truck have started to move

3992
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
The truck have started to move I love that

3993
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I need to play through old school NES Metal Gear

3994
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Hey that gaming marathon

3995
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
We're doing on the 17th

3996
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
I want to play Metal Gear for an hour

3997
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Old school

3998
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
What?

3999
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Yeah

4000
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Hey by the way

4001
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I hate you

4002
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
The other thing I wanted to say

4003
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
I was watching Saturday Night Live last night

4004
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Those of you that follow me on Facebook

4005
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Probably saw I made a little joke

4006
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
I'm watching Saturday Night Live drinking wine and eating ice cream

4007
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
And two of the three things are good

4008
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
There was actually

4009
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
One funny thing they had on Saturday Night Live last night

4010
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
It was a repeat but I never watched Saturday Night Live

4011
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
So it was new to me

4012
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
But they had like a sequel to the Dick in the Box thing

4013
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
With Justin Timberlake and whoever that guy

4014
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Andy Samberg is that his name?

4015
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
It was like something like

4016
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
We're gonna fuck each other's moms for Mother's Day

4017
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Or something like that

4018
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
It was actually really funny

4019
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I hadn't heard that one

4020
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
That was the one funny thing I saw on that show

4021
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
It's not on the album

4022
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Cause they tried to do this parody of the Governors of New York

4023
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
For a very long time

4024
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Where it's like you're just watching someone embarrass themselves

4025
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
And you're like please stop

4026
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Please stop

4027
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Much like you probably do listening to this show

4028
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Did you see that Tina Fey won an award?

4029
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
For what?

4030
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
For her portrayal of Sarah Palin

4031
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Well she deserves it

4032
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Everybody thinks that Sarah Palin

4033
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Actually said I can see Russia from my house

4034
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
She never actually said that

4035
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
People think she did

4036
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
I just think it's funny

4037
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
So Mother Lover is what it's called

4038
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
And that's what they're saying in chat there

4039
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Thank you

4040
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Alright anyhow, Loki did you have any other last minute stories?

4041
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I don't have any last minute stories

4042
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
That's it, we're done, we're out of here, time to go

4043
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Time to say goodnight

4044
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I guess that's it

4045
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4046
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
But before we close the door on tonight's program

4047
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
We do have to go around and get everybody's

4048
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Final thoughts

4049
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Darth Sockery your final thought tonight

4050
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Bacon

4051
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I have now officially

4052
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Given up pork

4053
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Good luck with that

4054
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Well I'm gonna be very sick tonight

4055
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
So it's fine

4056
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Have you ever talked about why you're doing that?

4057
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Or is that not something you want to get into on Orland?

4058
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
I don't want to get into it

4059
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

4060
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
My final thought is I'm gonna be working on my cabinet all week

4061
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Yay

4062
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
My final thought is

4063
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Disneyland

4064
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Yay

4065
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Yay

4066
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000

4072

Oh my god that scared the hell out of me

4073
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
We had the window open and Dan walked up to the window

4074
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
That scared the hell out of me

4075
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
That was like Satan on my shoulder

4076
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Telling something

4077
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Did that get picked up on the mic?

4078
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000

4079
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
