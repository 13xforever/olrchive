00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:19,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, September 13th, 2009, you can emulate Commodore 64 on your iPhone, then you can't.

2
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:25,825
[SPEAKER_09]: An intentional glitch outs pirates of a popular game, and a popular franchise's sequel gets canned in Japan.

3
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:36,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:42,159
[SPEAKER_14]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:48,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Here with you over the next three hours, live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

6
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:54,385
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts, here with you for the next few hours, also with me as well, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:54,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Beer.

8
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:55,726
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

9
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:56,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Beer fiend?

10
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:56,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Beer.

11
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:57,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Beer-licious?

12
00:00:58,087 --> 00:00:59,588
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of beer tonight?

13
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:00,749
[SPEAKER_04]: 250th Anniversary Guinness.

14
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,405
[SPEAKER_14]: And what makes it so dang special?

15
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's 250th anniversary Guinness.

16
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:05,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

17
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

18
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:09,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

19
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,129
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you, Loki?

20
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:10,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good.

21
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:11,369
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

22
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:17,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, of course, before we get into gaming weeks, usually, we somehow start off the show as Orange Lounge Radio Foodio.

23
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:21,154
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight is no exception to the cause here.

24
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:23,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what the hell did you bring with you tonight?

25
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have to admit, it actually looks kind of disgusting.

26
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:32,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I brought parts of Bacon Fest 2009, as Nelly would call it.

27
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:34,339
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the bacon-themed birthday party.

28
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:41,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the food that we served there, including bacon muffins, which they're cornbread muffins.

29
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:47,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm seriously looking at all this food.

30
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

31
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,364
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just too much.

32
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:52,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't get me wrong.

33
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:56,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I love bacon, but this is too much bacon.

34
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Bacon is meat candy.

35
00:01:58,693 --> 00:01:59,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sorry to interrupt.

36
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so it's...

37
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:05,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let me just run down the list here.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,660
[SPEAKER_12]: The bacon muffins.

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,066
[SPEAKER_12]: They're basically cornbread muffins with... Well, initially it had a little bit of reserved bacon fat in there to give it the kind of bacon flavor, and there's bacon inside of it.

40
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:21,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Nellie decided that they didn't quite taste like enough bacon, and she...

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,271
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

42
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:52,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Green Onion and Bacon.

43
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,025
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like a spicy...

44
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,404
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

45
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,216
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

46
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,492
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the jelly bean?

47
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see enough appreciation for jelly beans out there.

48
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be jelly bellies.

49
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:47,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, forget it.

50
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:57,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the last one is, it's shrimp wrapped in bacon with barbecue sauce and mozzarella cheese broiled on top of it.

51
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,964
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's actually, the shrimp's pretty good.

52
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:01,565
[SPEAKER_12]: We ate mostly the shrimp.

53
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it had candied bacon.

54
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:04,608
[SPEAKER_12]: It was with...

55
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:07,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

56
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:40,091
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Irene and Nathan brought these mashed potato ball things that have bacon and stuff.

57
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So I haven't tried those, but everyone liked those, I think.

58
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:44,412
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's go to our chat room.

59
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:46,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we do talk about video games occasionally on this show.

60
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:48,954
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me go to the chat room and introduce them.

61
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Howdy, guys, at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

62
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,115
[SPEAKER_14]: They're always with us, the ever-present fourth guest on the show.

63
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:58,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Tiger Claw says, you guys should take a picture of this and post on the OLR gallery.

64
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:00,277
[SPEAKER_14]: We are one step ahead of you, sir.

65
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura, I think, already did that.

66
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:28,955
[SPEAKER_14]: They should be on their way up to the OLR Gallery So if you want to check out the food Go to orangelaunchradio.com Click on, I think it's galleries And you'll see If you're smart, you'll figure it out Click on pictures or galleries I don't have it in front of me And then you can find the bacon stuff Sadly, the one thing that wasn't there was Super Bacon Just because I thought I had plenty of bacon And I actually ran short of bacon I had bought like five packages of bacon And it was still not enough

67
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,517
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

68
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:37,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Salacious Pop in chat says popcorn jelly bellies equal vom.

69
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room, by the way, is called Kevin.

70
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:45,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to point out, though, that I actually like the popcorn jelly beans quite a bit, but my favorite is toasted marshmallow.

71
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Jelly belly makes a toasted marshmallow jelly bean that is delicious.

72
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,233
[SPEAKER_03]: In honor of Bacon Fest, the chat room is called Kevin.

73
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:53,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin.

74
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:56,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very sorry, I did not refer to them by their proper name.

75
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I still don't understand this whole renaming the chatroom to names of people you know.

76
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:01,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You are Kevin!

77
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:02,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine.

78
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:06,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, um, there you go.

79
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:11,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay, I'm going to try one of these bacon shrimp things, even though my pancreas hurts just looking at it, dear God.

80
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:12,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's two of them.

81
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:13,147
[SPEAKER_12]: There's two of them.

82
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:14,628
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to separate that.

83
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:16,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here we go.

84
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Careful, and chew carefully because, like you said, it's a little choky.

85
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:26,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,342
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good, but damn.

87
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:46,644
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably all I'm going to have.

88
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have another piece of shrimp.

89
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:52,789
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys can see in the picture gallery, and even if you're listening on the podcast, you can go on the website.

90
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it'll still be there.

91
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,352
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go in that picture gallery and look, and it's too much.

92
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:57,492
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too much.

93
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:00,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there is such a thing as too much bacon, and it is sitting in front of us tonight.

94
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:05,399
[SPEAKER_03]: The important thing today, Rob, is that all I've had is a salad, so I could safely eat this bacon.

95
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,673
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what type of video games have you been playing this week?

96
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell this is.

97
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Enough with the bacon.

98
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Put the bacon down.

99
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Step away from the bacon.

100
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to have Loki go first?

101
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Loki, how was your gaming week?

102
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:47,369
[SPEAKER_12]: My gaming week was awesome.

103
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know.

104
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Played the usual stuff, New Grand Theft Auto, whatnot.

105
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:03,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Also got around to playing a little bit of Scribblenauts, which... It's alright, but I haven't really gotten past the tutorial stuff yet because I've only played it for a little bit.

106
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:09,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been busy messing with the little front-end thing where you can spawn wherever you want and stuff.

107
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,413
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me tell you, and I know this really sucks to say it, but...

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, does it get old after five minutes.

109
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,861
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, that is really sad.

110
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:19,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew it.

111
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew that's what was going to happen with this game.

112
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:27,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played it yet, so I just... You know, it's one of those things, I think it's like the Nintendogs of this year.

113
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:33,925
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like one of those things that's going to be cute as hell for 30 minutes, and then you're going to be like, okay, I did all the lulzy things I wanted to do, and...

114
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much.

115
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,571
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I'm sure the puzzles and stuff are going to be fun.

116
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:44,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't quite gotten there yet because I'm still doing the fucking tutorial stuff, which is annoying.

117
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:50,035
[SPEAKER_12]: But just as far as messing with stuff, it's kind of boring.

118
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,596
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing that I don't really care for in it is the control.

119
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:57,377
[SPEAKER_12]: The control, you have to use the stylus and you click to where you want Maxwell to go.

120
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's so non-responsive.

121
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,178
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just...

122
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:06,931
[SPEAKER_12]: So Loki played with the playground and not the actual game and called it old.

123
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:33,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm telling you what I played.

124
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:35,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

125
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:40,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I'd be able to play this playground part and just, you know, have a lot of fun with it for quite a while.

126
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I mean, dude, I made a cat.

127
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:50,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first thing I did was I did what the ESRB had, you know, where they said you can lure a lion with meat strapped to a baby.

128
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:54,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So I strapped meat to a baby and, you know, lured a lion with that.

129
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:54,678
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was kind of funny.

130
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:59,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I strapped a laser to a cat and tried to make a laser cat, but that didn't work.

131
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, it just didn't know what I wanted it to do.

132
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:16,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but yeah, I'm sure the puzzles are fun, but like I said, I haven't played there yet, and I'm just saying what, this is my impression so far, it's a really quick impression, but yeah, it's not as much fun as I thought it would be.

133
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough, I guess.

134
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:27,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, now, the other thing, too, uh, this week is I finally, finally, finally got my arcade cabinet.

135
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:35,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went down to the, um, San Jose and picked up my Astro City candy cab and brought it home.

136
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,314
[SPEAKER_12]: And also with that, I got a...

137
00:10:39,767 --> 00:11:06,732
[SPEAKER_12]: was it um an MVS um Neo Geo board a single slot with a 48 in one which I'm sure is absolutely not legit one bit um 48 in one Neo Geo cart that's got a lot of King of Fighters and Metal Slug and whatnot on there but um you know basically I have that to hold me over until I finish my main computer and all that stuff um but it's kind of cool so I'm putting that all together and um

138
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:13,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually going to be painting the whole thing black, so I'm going to have to do that as well because it's kind of scuffed up.

139
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:23,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried to find a white paint or something that might match it, but you can't match the color of the plastic there, so it's just easier to paint the whole thing black.

140
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:29,784
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got some pics on my LiveJournal right now of just the cabinet.

141
00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:31,004
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of taken apart a little bit.

142
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,145
[SPEAKER_12]: The control panel wasn't on there.

143
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,506
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to re-screw that back on there because they gave me...

144
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,521
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

145
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,091
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:26,610
[SPEAKER_12]: This was $22.38, so I had to go order that specially online from Atlanta, and they had apparently some of these Toshiba fluorescent lights, so I had that.

147
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you are still taking late donations for your cabinet.

148
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:29,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

149
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, good, because I never donate.

150
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:35,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to do it on Friday, but I got sidetracked, so I'm going to give you a late donation.

151
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:37,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I still got lots of stuff I got to get online.

152
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm planning on refurbing my...

153
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:51,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually rebuilding my DDR pads and I have an email into Channel Beat about Dance Maniacs sensors because I have the actual Dance Maniacs machine.

154
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:56,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two upper sensors but I need two lower sensors and if I can get them for a good price I'm going to buy them from them.

155
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:58,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Now where did you put all these machines?

156
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you putting them in your garage?

157
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't have a Dance Maniacs machine.

158
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the motherboard inside of it.

159
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but you used to have your candy cab.

160
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:06,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's that going?

161
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,537
[SPEAKER_12]: The candy cab's in the garage right now, but it's going to go in the middle room.

162
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:10,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

163
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:19,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm taking the TV, the HDTV, and there's an HDTV and a Stanford in the room right now, and that's leaving our room, going into our bedroom.

164
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:22,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have to put the toys in the middle bedroom so the wife can close the door and not see it.

165
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:23,792
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

166
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:58,908
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was a marathon session of Beatles Rock Band, which I really loved.

167
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time playing, especially doing harmony, because everybody doesn't have to do all the harmony, but you get more bonuses if you harmonize properly.

168
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a really good time with that.

169
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:14,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of fun, except that my hand started hurting after a while playing some of the guitar.

170
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:15,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

171
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, I forgot, I also did play Beal's Rock Band and Rock Band 2.

172
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:29,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you know, actually, and this is kind of neat, I just tried it because I wasn't sure if it worked, that the old Karaoke Revolution mics from the PlayStation 2 actually work on the 360 version of Rock Band?

173
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:31,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know the Lips mics also work on it?

174
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:37,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know if they patched that stuff in yet, but I know they were supposed to be getting patched in soon.

175
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:48,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dan made it out of his conference with a double set of Lips mics, and so we used those.

176
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a really good time.

177
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was great.

178
00:14:51,314 --> 00:15:00,801
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys both feel... No, you kind of already gave your review last week, Loki, and you said, I'm not a fan of the Beatles, so I'm not as yippy about this, but I see where people are getting excited about it.

179
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:19,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was alright, but I think we came away with it like, wow, the Beatles had some really tripped out shit in there, and their songs were weird, because we had Nathan singing the stuff, and he's just like, holy crap, I didn't know that they had these weird songs, but after about maybe 10 minutes of it, we're just like, okay, let's go to Rock Band 2, because we just got tired of it.

180
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:20,994
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:15:44,740 --> 00:16:06,956
[SPEAKER_03]: and which is actually really easy and fun to sing it's the only one I beat on expert and then something was on there which is another one I like and we also the the theme was we had a discussion on who had the better hair and we all agreed that George Harrison had better hair and um now quick question have you explored download content because you know some of the okay because some of it's there we just rented it because Dan was a button didn't pre-order it for me I see

182
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:07,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I, I, I

183
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: There were really some fun ones in there, like Taxman was in there, and I think I saw She Came In Through the Bathroom Window, which is a cool song.

184
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,822
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff, you know, but of course then I had to go and listen to all the stuff that Tiare gave me.

185
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:46,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually listened to Rubber Soul like three times all the way through.

186
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel so uncool.

187
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like the only person that didn't play Beatles Rock Band this week.

188
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And granted, it's my own damn fault.

189
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,682
[SPEAKER_14]: My Xbox 360 is still broke and I need to go get it fixed.

190
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:02,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just been complacent doing all this other stuff and I've just been busy with some other things in my personal life so I haven't really gotten out to get it fixed.

191
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:07,049
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm not going to re-buy the instruments just for the PS3 version.

192
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,771
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I have all these money invested in instruments on the 360.

193
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,692
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where I want to get Beatles Rock Band.

194
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:12,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just a little behind.

195
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,935
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the time I'm ready to play it, there'll probably be nobody left playing it online.

196
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:47,079
[SPEAKER_03]: well um I also um like I'm doing right now play Sims 3 because I love Sims 3 and um it's actually really easy to uh run it during the show cause I have to always be doing something um I also um what else did I play no I don't think I played I was gonna play a Dreamcast game and I didn't you know thought about it didn't do it played some pinball

197
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

198
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I've played twice!

199
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Clearly I have issues because I'm already like level 24, but I have some friends that are playing, so whatever.

200
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,135
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes it go by faster.

201
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:26,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure there's people that are going to be like, you could have gotten your Xbox fixed, but you've been playing World of Warcraft.

202
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:26,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't judge me!

203
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what else?

204
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been playing... I have been playing some stuff on the PlayStation as well.

205
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kind of mostly the same stuff.

206
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Wipeout and...

207
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:46,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Home, even I got some more invites to the club on there taken care of, so if you were waiting for that, then you probably got that.

208
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, just kind of...

209
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:50,088
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

210
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:14,722
[SPEAKER_14]: After having been missing frequency and amplitude for so long, it's kind of cool to have this.

211
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:19,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I do miss the techno music, but Rock Band Unplugged has a decent song list.

212
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm satisfied.

213
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all right.

214
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.

215
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:28,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's get into our housekeeping tonight.

216
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,963
[SPEAKER_14]: In tonight's housekeeping, there may or may not be a show next week.

217
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:35,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking, and I kind of have to ask this live on air.

218
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,386
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

219
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:37,207
[SPEAKER_14]: No show?

220
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:38,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you out?

221
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:38,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.

222
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:40,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so then we're not going to do it.

223
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:44,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I have stuff that needs to get done on Sunday night.

224
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, then fine.

225
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:48,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I was going to suggest we do it late because my flight gets in at 5.30 so maybe we can start the show at 7.

226
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,754
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll just not do it then if you have stuff going on too.

227
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,194
[SPEAKER_14]: So free night for Loki, woo!

228
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to work in the cabinet, woo!

229
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:58,376
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is I am also going to be out

230
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,037
[SPEAKER_14]: The First Weekend of October

231
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,633
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, I guess, for housekeeping.

232
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, you can always follow us on Twitter.

233
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,674
[SPEAKER_14]: We're Orange Lounge on... I'm sorry, OLR on Twitter.

234
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,155
[SPEAKER_14]: We're OLRmy on Facebook.

235
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:32,438
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a club, so you have to search for OLRMY and Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, although I don't think we've posted to LiveJournal in about a year, but it's there.

236
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:35,019
[SPEAKER_14]: I should cross-post some of mine.

237
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,640
[SPEAKER_14]: You should actually cross-post some of it to Orange Lounge.

238
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be nice to see that being updated.

239
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,601
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

240
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

241
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:41,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

242
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:41,762
[SPEAKER_14]: See you next time.

243
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,715
[SPEAKER_12]: regarding Kurt Cobain's appearance in Guitar Hero 5, apparently.

244
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,476
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is her two posts that she had on Twitter.

245
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:14,782
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, this Guitar Hero shit is breach of contract on Bully's part, and there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction.

246
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:18,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And then she followed up with, we are going to sue the shit out of Activision...

247
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:27,326
[SPEAKER_12]: We being the Trusty Estates, the LLC, and the various LLCs, Cobain Enterprise.

248
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:32,760
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be a completely unrelated statement, but I just have to get this off my chest.

249
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:38,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't this fascinating that we live in a world now where Twitter is like a late-breaking news source?

250
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:42,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the reason why is because celebrities on Twitter are unfiltered.

251
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:45,327
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going through their publicists and writing things like this.

252
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:49,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why, but seven years ago when we started this show, we would never have a story like this.

253
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,471
[SPEAKER_14]: But now it's kind of weird that...

254
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,093
[SPEAKER_14]: We're reading about Courtney being pissed off, like, through her Twitter.

255
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:59,454
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just weird that Twitter is, like, this news source all of a sudden.

256
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:00,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's my thing.

257
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:00,515
[SPEAKER_12]: It's weird.

258
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Why the hell is anyone reading Courtney Loves Twitter?

259
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously.

260
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:06,698
[SPEAKER_12]: She has fans.

261
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:08,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Who?

262
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:09,379
[SPEAKER_12]: She does?

263
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, convicts?

264
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, who?

265
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:12,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

266
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:14,155
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

267
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Violet by Hole Violet by Hole

268
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:12,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Lip Sync Thingy because everybody else was doing lollipop, lollipop and all this stupid shit and all dressed and clear cut and here we are going out on stage and drag singing Violet and it was all kinds of awesome.

269
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,361
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how we did?

270
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,404
[SPEAKER_14]: We got last place.

271
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Last place.

272
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:19,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Courtney Love.

273
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:23,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, okay, they had a... I was a hot-ass Courtney Love, though.

274
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:24,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I will just put that out there.

275
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:28,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they did have a picture of Courtney Love on Kotaku during one of the stories.

276
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,937
[SPEAKER_12]: It actually was one of the good pictures of her.

277
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:32,159
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, wow, she was hot at one time.

278
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:33,720
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck happened there?

279
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:36,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm guessing a lot of drugs, but, you know, hey.

280
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:38,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, back to the story.

281
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:42,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So, she was pissed off that, you know, Kurt Cobain is...

282
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:52,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos regarding this.

283
00:23:52,779 --> 00:24:01,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, these artists can be unlocked as playable characters in the game, so therefore you can make them sing any retarded song that's in this game.

284
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:05,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Including, I think they had one that had Flava Flav in it.

285
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:09,886
[SPEAKER_12]: So they had the clip, of course, of Kurt Cobain lip-synced to...

286
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:14,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Flava Flav, and I mean, that's just blasphemy right there.

287
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:22,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Activision responded, of course, after these stupid Twitter updates saying that Courtney Love signed a, you know, contract for this and, you know,

288
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,054
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

289
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:42,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

290
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:07,986
[SPEAKER_12]: While we are aware of Kurt's image being used with the two Nirvana songs, we didn't know that the players had the ability to unlock the character.

291
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:12,950
[SPEAKER_12]: This feature allows the character to be used with any kind of song the player wants.

292
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,974
[SPEAKER_12]: We urge Activision to do the right thing in relocking Kurt's character so that this won't continue in the future.

293
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:26,659
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to watch an image of Kurt pantomiming other artists alongside cartoon characters.

294
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Kurt Cobain wrote songs that hold a lot of meaning to people all over the world.

295
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:32,563
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:54,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

297
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:22,256
[SPEAKER_12]: They said that they, you know, of course, they know that they signed the agreement, but they didn't know that he was going to be used in that way.

298
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:23,136
[SPEAKER_12]: That kind of thing.

299
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,198
[SPEAKER_12]: This says it all right here.

300
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:27,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly where this whole thing is coming from.

301
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,922
[SPEAKER_14]: They signed the agreement, but didn't know that it was going to be used in that way.

302
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the thing.

303
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:32,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

304
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:33,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

305
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have a rant on this.

306
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:35,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

307
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,008
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's actually it.

308
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:38,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

309
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

310
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:49,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, there's multiple sides to every story, but having covered this crap as long as we have, I think I have a pretty good idea what's going on here.

311
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm probably wrong, and I'm pulling this out of my ass.

312
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,183
[SPEAKER_14]: It's complete speculation, but here's my thought.

313
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,704
[SPEAKER_14]: When this was shown to the people that it needed to be shown to, they didn't show the clip of Kurt Cobain doing Flava Flav.

314
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:05,746
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't say anything about Kurt Cobain being an unlockable character in the game.

315
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:14,050
[SPEAKER_14]: They probably showed clips of Kurt Cobain doing the actual Nirvana songs, and then the proper signatures were obtained or what have you.

316
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I hear that Courtney Love, she signed it, then she resisted it.

317
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:18,752
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

318
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

319
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

320
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.

321
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:19,659
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, motion capture data that they basically collected for these different songs.

322
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com and reading comments, DarkTetsuya says, I could understand him having a problem with him singing stuff from other artists.

323
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:29,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see why they couldn't just lock him to only the Nirvana stuff.

324
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,583
[SPEAKER_14]: See, well, A, there's two things to that.

325
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:34,804
[SPEAKER_14]: A, you can't patch games on the Wii, and you can't patch games on the PlayStation 2.

326
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:36,944
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's done.

327
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:39,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they could recall the game, but what's...

328
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:43,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't mean to be disrespectful but I guess I am

329
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,190
[SPEAKER_12]: You're putting him in a video game.

330
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:02,991
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you expect?

331
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,412
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this isn't... This is Guitar Hero.

332
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:10,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if you want respectful treatment of artists, you need to go to Rock Band.

333
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:10,576
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

334
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Burn.

335
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Does Rock Band really... They don't have artist likeness in the games, do they?

336
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:18,202
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they don't.

337
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for the Beatles Rock Band, but that's the way you do it.

338
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:21,385
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, I'm sorry.

339
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:24,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... God, it's Guitar Hero.

340
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:26,129
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, get over it, people.

341
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,211
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't like his likeness in the game, don't buy the game.

342
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:30,472
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

343
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:36,130
[SPEAKER_12]: or if you bought the game and it's too late return it at the same time

344
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't it just a game?

345
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't this just a type of artistic impression?

346
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:56,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what's to stop me from going on YouTube and making a sock puppet effigy of Kurt Cobain singing whatever songs I want and then pretending to have that sock puppet effigy put a shotgun in his mouth and do away with himself?

347
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:58,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it in bad taste?

348
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:58,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

349
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,839
[SPEAKER_14]: But can Courtney Love really sue me over that?

350
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:01,799
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because it's art.

351
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,700
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can kind of do whatever the fuck I want.

352
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, keep in mind, though, her perspective, too.

353
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:16,878
[SPEAKER_03]: She is his widow, and that's going to put a different emotional push on it for her than it would for anyone else.

354
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,130
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,701
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, in my opinion, before I signed, that's what I would have wanted to see.

356
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,902
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have a feeling that didn't happen.

357
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:56,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

358
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Azure Edge in a chat says, you should do that.

359
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to do that.

360
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:10,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, I may not be the biggest Nirvana fan in the world, but that is extremely disrespectful, what I just suggested doing, and I'm not going to do it.

361
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,786
[SPEAKER_12]: That's time out of my day.

362
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:13,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

363
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:14,387
[SPEAKER_14]: I could be playing WoW.

364
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:14,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

365
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:16,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna make a mess.

366
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:19,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, do you know how much red corn syrup that would take?

367
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:23,351
[SPEAKER_12]: At least, at least it's not Revolution X, okay?

368
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,713
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they could have had it worse.

369
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:30,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Frisbee says even if it's not art, lol, freedom of speech.

370
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:38,458
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I suppose the difference though is that if I were to make that whole YouTube as disrespectful as it might be, I'm not charging for it and I'm not making money off of it.

371
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:43,121
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's probably the big difference is that, you know, Activision makes a ton of money off Guitar Hero.

372
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:48,685
[SPEAKER_12]: No offense, I'm sorry, but I can't see people going, oh my god, Kurt Cobain's in this game, I must buy it.

373
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

374
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:51,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

375
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure maybe there is one or two, but I mean, come on.

376
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think people are going to buy a game just because an artist is in it.

377
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:03,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless it's like the Beatles rock band where it's all about the artist.

378
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:07,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I can understand if it's Guitar Hero Navarro or something like that.

379
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:09,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Or even the Metallica Guitar Hero, the Van Halen.

380
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:18,097
[SPEAKER_14]: There are going to be people, as much as we've kind of made fun of Van Halen, Guitar Hero, there's going to be people that really want that because they're just diehard Van Halen fans.

381
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:18,958
[SPEAKER_14]: I get that.

382
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:21,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, ma'am.

383
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,280
[SPEAKER_04]: We need Van Hagar.

384
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Different topic altogether.

385
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:29,831
[SPEAKER_14]: GS68 in chat says, Kurt Cobain confirmed for Super Smash Bros.

386
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:29,831
4.

387
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:33,396
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Silent Hill?

388
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:34,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that's bad taste.

389
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:41,703
[SPEAKER_14]: SalaciousPop says, when he finds his way into Space Channel 5-3, I'll be impressed.

390
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:45,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be funny if she just didn't realize?

391
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:49,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see people make YouTubes of Kurt Cobain in other video games now.

392
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:54,248
[SPEAKER_14]: This should become the new meme or whatever you want to call it that's out there.

393
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:56,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody should do that.

394
00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:00,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Put Kurt Cobain's face on Ulala's head and have him doing the choo-choo and all that.

395
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:05,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be funny, though, if she accidentally signed off on his appearance being

396
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:20,580
[SPEAKER_12]: In any Activision game, like Call of Duty or, you know, some Madagascar game or... Well, the other thing to consider, too, is how intoxicated was she when she signed?

397
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now...

398
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:25,443
[SPEAKER_14]: That's her own fucking fault then.

399
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:25,744
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

400
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:34,830
[SPEAKER_03]: If she can prove that she was sufficiently drunk enough or intoxicated enough, then it actually could be considered null and void under federal business law.

401
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,211
[SPEAKER_14]: You have got to be kidding me.

402
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:37,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if witnesses signed it too?

403
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:39,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I took business law.

404
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should that be an excuse?

405
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Sober the fuck up before you sign something.

406
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing applies to weddings too.

407
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:48,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

408
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:16,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they shouldn't have got her to sign it, but, you know, she can say, Hey, I was really drunk at the time, then... And who wouldn't believe her?

409
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:19,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there is cause to take it to court.

410
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she'd be smart enough to realize that, but... You wouldn't be able to prove that.

411
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:29,010
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be... Salacious Poppinchat says, It is not legal to enter contract with an impaired person.

412
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Then how did they ever get her to sign?

413
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:32,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Ever.

414
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, she's drunk.

415
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:35,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get her to sign.

416
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:40,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, isn't there... Surely... I don't know.

417
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:43,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking, does she have soul... We can't tell the difference.

418
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Does she have soul power of attorney over everything?

419
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:47,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

420
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,580
[SPEAKER_14]: She probably does, huh?

421
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,200
[SPEAKER_14]: There wouldn't be like a lawyer involved or anybody else that signs off, right?

422
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she was listed full executor, wasn't she?

423
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:55,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think their daughter's 18 yet.

424
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:55,722
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

425
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:56,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no.

426
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:58,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Although she's an attractive young lady.

427
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you've seen pictures of her.

428
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:01,183
[SPEAKER_14]: She's aging very well.

429
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:02,364
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just after her dad.

430
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:02,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

431
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:12,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyhow, sorry, we're talking a bit too much about this, and I think everybody's got their thoughts out on this, but yeah, honestly, I don't think there's anything that can be done.

432
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:19,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the stink is out there, I don't think her lawsuit is going to hold much weight unless, maybe DarkSakura's onto something, honestly.

433
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:26,846
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be very interesting if that is the defense that comes up in court, is that she was too high to sign the documents.

434
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:32,409
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a drugged up bitch, and that's, clearly, she can't enter into any contracts.

435
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm fucked up Frisbee says zombies ate my cart

436
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:58,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, shush.

437
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:02,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on to some more news and talk about zombies of a different sort.

438
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:05,728
[SPEAKER_14]: And the type of zombies that are in Left 4 Dead 2.

439
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:09,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you know we've been talking about the boycotts of Left 4 Dead 2.

440
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:14,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've talked about it previously on this show about how there was this thing out there where all these people were signing it.

441
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:19,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't be making Left 4 Dead 2 because you haven't supported Left 4 Dead 1 enough.

442
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the agreement among us here in studio was get over it.

443
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:25,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Because...

444
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:26,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

445
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:58,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's an interesting tactic by Valve.

446
00:36:58,568 --> 00:36:59,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually have to hand it to them.

447
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,832
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually invited the two Steam users who started the boycott.

448
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:07,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Their online names are WalkingTarget and AgentOfChaos.

449
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:15,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Right after the game was announced at E3 2009, they invited these guys to Valve's offices to play the game, interview members of the development team.

450
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:21,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the interesting thing is that the resolution of this is that these two guys say they're going to continue boycotting the upcoming title.

451
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:28,203
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, reported that the game seemed balanced and tight and did not feel like a rush jobs.

452
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:54,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, of course, the people that all signed this petition, there's a lot of them saying, it's corrupt, you guys are corrupt, and now you guys should step down, you should no longer be admins of this, and the guys that went say, hey, what we did, we did way more than most people thought we'd get done, meaning they have over 40,000 members in the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott group on Steam.

453
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:55,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

454
00:37:55,706 --> 00:38:03,913
[SPEAKER_14]: and they are still demanding that Valve release this as a low-cost expansion pack to the original F for Dead is what the community is bitching for.

455
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think... I really don't think that it's in any way kind of selling out.

456
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that Valve offered an olive branch.

457
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:17,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't think these guys sold out by any means.

458
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:21,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they, out of...

459
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think it's a very mature thing that they did.

460
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:31,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Humoring them, looking at it, trying to see if maybe...

461
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They were justified or not, you know what I mean?

462
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:42,773
[SPEAKER_14]: But doesn't that strike you as weird that on one hand they're saying we're going to continue the boycott and on the other hand they're saying, but the game doesn't feel rushed, it does feel pretty complete.

463
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:47,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, don't you get the sense that they're only continuing the boycott because they don't want to have that perception?

464
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:49,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, imagine they come home and drop the boycott.

465
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:51,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, what's that going to make them look like?

466
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:53,776
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to make it look like their silence was bought, right?

467
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:54,717
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

468
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:59,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you wonder if that's coming into play, that they just don't want their integrity questioned?

469
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:13,266
[SPEAKER_03]: See, if they came out and said, we played the game, and, you know, we'd like to retract our position, everything that we complained about, we were wrong.

470
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:17,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is bigger balls and shows more integrity.

471
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're, if they, have they provided a reason that they're still going to continue their boycott?

472
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:26,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they say it still doesn't feel like a sequel?

473
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:27,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...

474
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:35,904
[SPEAKER_14]: To be fair, I'm reading this off of another news release, so I don't have their full statement on whatever it is they went and visited.

475
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:38,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to wait to see if they say why they're continuing.

476
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:39,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if I can find that.

477
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:43,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Chatters, feel free to help out if you have a link to something that they said.

478
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:44,946
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a safe face on their part.

479
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:45,827
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all it really is.

480
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:51,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, like you said, if they came back and said, oh, the game's awesome, we should drop our boycott, then...

481
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:56,569
[SPEAKER_12]: 39,998 people go, you're fucking retarded.

482
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:58,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here's another quote from them I found on another news source.

483
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,814
[SPEAKER_14]: What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question and it will only get better.

484
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:09,736
[SPEAKER_14]: But they will continue the boycott until their, quote, individual concerns are addressed.

485
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:13,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, you know, I don't... Big fat paycheck.

486
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,620
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't think it has anything to do with that.

487
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, again, it's that they've dug themselves in too deep in this boycott now.

488
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:26,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think Valve was under any obligation to do what they did.

489
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:33,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was actually kind of nice of Valve and sets kind of a sad precedence is that if you bitch enough about something, they'll fly you out to fix it.

490
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,766
[SPEAKER_14]: It almost kind of makes me go, hmm, where do I want to travel?

491
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:37,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I would like to kind of go to Boston.

492
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:42,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Beatles' Rock Band blows, and it was released way too soon after Rock Band 2.

493
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know they're going to release Rock Band 3.

494
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:45,528
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

495
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:50,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Rock Band 3 needs to be an expansion to Rock Band 2, a cheap upgrade.

496
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:51,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's right.

497
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I said it.

498
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,250
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucks.

499
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Come sign my petition.

500
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, free trip to Boston.

501
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

502
00:40:58,972 --> 00:41:00,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just worried about the precedent that sets.

503
00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:04,074
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, I'm not blaming Valve.

504
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:04,954
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very cool of them.

505
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but this has been a very big thing.

506
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:08,876
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a big gathering.

507
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you may have people go... If you had like a hundred people or so, that would be big enough.

508
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:21,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've got, you know, in the tens of thousands, you know, they've got a big following.

509
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:33,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I almost kind of think that hits the nail on the head.

510
00:41:33,415 --> 00:41:44,939
[SPEAKER_14]: If these guys feel that strongly about it, you know, and I realize we've debated this topic to death on the show, and I really don't want to rehash the whole damn thing, but if you really feel that strongly about it, the best message you could send is don't buy it.

511
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:52,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, at the end of the day, no petition you sign or anything like that is going to have the impact that your wallet has at the store.

512
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:55,348
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

513
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see.

514
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:03,873
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 exists because what Valve wants to do requires a sequel.

515
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:10,377
[SPEAKER_14]: SalaciousPop says Valve has already done a ton of stuff that is anthema to pretty much every other developer.

516
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:10,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Anathema.

517
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:11,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Anathema.

518
00:42:13,348 --> 00:42:14,530
[SPEAKER_14]: using big words in my chat.

519
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:14,991
[SPEAKER_14]: How dare you?

520
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:15,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

521
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:19,840
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, there was a somewhat related story going on.

522
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:33,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's a campaign going on to fly the Valve boss, Gabe Newell, over to Australia to actually look at a Left 4 Dead campaign that was made called Shotgun Sunrise.

523
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:41,045
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a custom campaign that they want to fly the guy out there to release this.

524
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,446
[SPEAKER_14]: They raised $3,000 in donations and...

525
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,304
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

526
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:11,965
[SPEAKER_14]: People suck.

527
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:39,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

528
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:45,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the Left 4 Dead community, some of them, I think they should be happy where they're being angry.

529
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a waste of money.

530
00:43:48,203 --> 00:43:48,384
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

531
00:43:48,854 --> 00:44:02,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I can understand if you feel passionately enough about something, especially if you put a whole lot of work into it, and you have enough other people that enjoy your work that they are willing to contribute to that, yeah, but in the end, it's a game, you know?

532
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:08,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not save that $3,000 for, you know, people who need it, you know?

533
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:12,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Aren't we in a global recession?

534
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:14,403
[SPEAKER_14]: God damn, they raised that much money over this?

535
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:17,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kind of surprised.

536
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:20,884
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that could go into an arcade cabinet.

537
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:24,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Shush.

538
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:31,026
[SPEAKER_14]: TheRobD in chat says, I would love, love for Valve to cancel Left 4 Dead 2 just to see how they would react.

539
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:35,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that's going to happen, and I don't think you should let a few bad apples spoil the barrel, so to speak.

540
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:40,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I don't see how this is different from the sports games that come out every year.

541
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:45,771
[SPEAKER_14]: and the DDRs and music games that get re-released every year that people buy.

542
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:53,297
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't see how this is that much different except it actually sounds like Valve is doing more than what a lot of these other games that come out every year do.

543
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,959
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually sounds like there's more to it.

544
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:57,561
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

545
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:58,702
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they should be happy.

546
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some people just need to get over themselves.

547
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:02,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on.

548
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:03,005
[SPEAKER_14]: More news.

549
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:05,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what came out for iPhone?

550
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:07,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Commodore 64 emulator.

551
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:09,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that great?

552
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:10,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

553
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Where can I download it?

554
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:11,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.

555
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:12,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't.

556
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have found problems that will be problems for Apple, actually.

557
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:27,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there were ways to access basic programming, like the language basic.

558
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Apple's like, no, and stopped it.

559
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:37,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, isn't there some type of clause that you can't release an application that it programs or something like that?

560
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:43,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you can't have an application on the iPhone that can program the iPhone to do anything you want?

561
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:50,780
[SPEAKER_03]: All they have to do is edit the emulator just to disinclude the basic...

562
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:56,295
[SPEAKER_14]: What's funny is I think people are going to constantly find ways to get to BASIC.

563
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:59,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Because obviously they figured out a way to abort the game somehow and get into BASIC.

564
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,059
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would think they're going to keep doing this somehow.

565
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,741
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess if they patch this to keep Apple happy, then that's kind of cool.

566
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:08,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I grew up on the Commodore 64.

567
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:12,986
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my gaming system until our family had an NES.

568
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:15,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my gaming system from ages like 5 to 10.

569
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:19,871
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would love to relive some of those games for my youth, but...

570
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been resubmitted so we'll see if it hangs around.

571
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:27,587
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be kind of cool.

572
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:32,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder, though, if the games that are being released on this emulator are legal.

573
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I know they say that they have kind of like this mix of games.

574
00:46:36,632 --> 00:46:40,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, is the guy getting permission from these companies, or does he have to?

575
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:45,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe copyright laws are up, because it's been about 25 years since most of these games were released.

576
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:45,937
[SPEAKER_14]: What, like 84?

577
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:48,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, about 25 years since most of these games came out.

578
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:51,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe copyright law comes into play if none of these companies got their... It's only a handful.

579
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon's Den, Le Mans, Jupiter Lander, Arctic Shipwreck, and Jack Attack Early JogCon

580
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:22,021
[SPEAKER_14]: You held down the little fire button to drive and you turned the paddle back and forth to kind of move back and forth on the track.

581
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:23,401
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a lot of fun.

582
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:26,422
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to avoid other cars and so forth and you could race forever.

583
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:33,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though that's the type of game I think would throw me for five minutes now, like hours I played this game as a kid.

584
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,506
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was like I guess you could call it a first party or whatever.

585
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:38,947
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually put out by Commodore.

586
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:43,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering if all these games don't have Commodore's sort of blessing or what's going on.

587
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:44,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

588
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Frisbee in chat says, Dear Apple, what about some open source on the iPhone?

589
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:59,273
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't think you're going to see that happen because what they're probably worried about is people getting into the phone aspect of it.

590
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:07,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Using all these programming, hacking it so that the phones get open and suddenly you can make phone calls without having to pay for it and so on.

591
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,383
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think they're really worried about how far you can hack these devices.

592
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:14,507
[SPEAKER_14]: GS68 says, I want to see MSX games on the iPhone.

593
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:14,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn it.

594
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:15,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait.

595
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:17,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Americans don't care about MSX.

596
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:21,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see the original Metal Gear Solid 2.

597
00:48:21,473 --> 00:48:24,676
[SPEAKER_14]: The original Metal Gear, for one, before it was Nintendo-fied.

598
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:27,179
[SPEAKER_14]: And the original Metal Gear 2.

599
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:29,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wouldn't mind seeing Gartic.

600
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:33,584
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is, who's going to translate those?

601
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:34,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Fans!

602
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,147
[SPEAKER_12]: You better learn how to speak Japanese.

603
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:37,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like that.

604
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, coming to the PSP is yet another firmware.

605
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, why not?

606
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:45,397
[SPEAKER_12]: They have plenty of other firmwares.

607
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Like all the other firmwares, it's been cracked already.

608
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:49,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that that's really important.

609
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:58,626
[SPEAKER_12]: But what this firmware does hint at, though, is some things that possibly will be coming out later on, including game rentals.

610
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:06,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, as part of the changelog, they have ways that you can now group different folders.

611
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:11,949
[SPEAKER_12]: It says games now can be grouped and displayed in folders based on their expire dates under game.

612
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:18,791
[SPEAKER_12]: So that means that there's going to be some sort of trials or something that's going to expire after a certain amount of time.

613
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:38,370
[SPEAKER_12]: And then of course, some other stuff, you know, they changed, you know, settings, network updates have been changed to system update, the number of colors that can be selected on our settings has been increased, and revisions to strengthen security, of course, with the internet browser.

614
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:50,206
[SPEAKER_12]: The others, of course, before they already have support now for video rentals, so maybe now they're going to do it with games.

615
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it has to be something big like that because what else justifies the 6.0?

616
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:57,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's not like 5.3 or 5.0.

617
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:01,902
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a major release or they wouldn't call it 6.0.

618
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,483
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a PSP Go because it's coming out in like two weeks.

619
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:05,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that makes sense too.

620
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:07,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fair enough.

621
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think though that game rentals is something?

622
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:20,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's nothing I ever thought of before, but then when I thought, oh my gosh, like companies get mad at the game rental industry because they don't see any of those profits.

623
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,291
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

624
00:50:46,047 --> 00:50:48,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know how bad the PSP is doing.

625
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:50,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's hardly selling anything.

626
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,631
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot of good games out for it.

627
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:56,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Most stores do not bring in PSP as a rental category.

628
00:50:56,955 --> 00:51:00,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but only a matter of time then before it's on PlayStation 3.

629
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:05,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Although those games are ginormous, I don't know the feasibility of that, but...

630
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:10,344
[SPEAKER_14]: We're years away from that being possible.

631
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:12,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, technology gets better, data moves faster.

632
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:20,609
[SPEAKER_14]: We're five years away from a PS3 game being downloadable as fast as a Super Nintendo ROM is these days.

633
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:27,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but in five years it's going to be a PlayStation 4 and no one's going to give a crap about PlayStation 3 titles that are downloadable.

634
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like PlayStation 1 titles that come out now.

635
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:34,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's kind of cool that they're re-releasing them again, but really, is it such a big deal?

636
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:36,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, is it even something that you would go rent?

637
00:51:37,296 --> 00:51:41,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, especially when the titles are like $10, what are they going to charge for rentals?

638
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:41,839
$2?

639
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:44,520
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just not really...

640
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:46,827
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

641
00:52:11,052 --> 00:52:15,975
[SPEAKER_12]: We could put out demos for free so that you can test our products and see if it's something that you want.

642
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:17,696
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, we're going to be assholes about it.

643
00:52:17,756 --> 00:52:23,379
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to allow you to buy a demo, basically, of this game, rent it for a little bit, and decide if you want it.

644
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:25,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And that way, if you don't like it, hey, we still got some of your money.

645
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:32,584
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, what about we drop $60 on a game that we play for a week and then never play again?

646
00:52:32,784 --> 00:52:35,106
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, imagine if we could spend only $10.

647
00:52:35,366 --> 00:52:38,067
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, $9.99 to rent the game for a week.

648
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,048
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be...

649
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe something I'd rather do for a lot of games.

650
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:46,153
[SPEAKER_14]: I would go rent them at your mom and pop rental store.

651
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,014
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're always out!

652
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:51,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine if I can go onto this digital thing, click a button, it's downloading, I got it.

653
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:55,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Well good, if that's an option for you, I mean, that's awesome.

654
00:52:55,616 --> 00:53:10,079
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing is, I mean, it's always good to have more options, but I don't want them to forego demos for this rental stuff because they feel that they can make more money if you don't have a way to try out this game.

655
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:12,256
[SPEAKER_12]: without paying money.

656
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:18,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think, especially PSP games, I think you're going to see, and you're right, I may...

657
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:27,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think PSP games are really rented at stores, so I don't think you're going to see this dig into the real rental market right now, but it's about setting a precedent.

658
00:53:28,202 --> 00:53:35,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with PSP Go being digital download only, and that they think this thing's going to be huge, although I don't think it is.

659
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:42,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're setting the stage for this whole rental thing that is first party, and we haven't seen anything like it before.

660
00:53:44,393 --> 00:54:12,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a pretty big deal on what's coming and I think probably it sounds like by the holidays this is going to be something that's launched oh man the PSP Go is going to be it's going to fail so bad don't get me wrong I like the PSP 3000 I just yeah well I hate going over the same territory but still I mean there's other stories I'm sure we have coming up um

661
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:21,588
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, what exactly are you doing different with the PSP Go other than charging me a lot more money and not having the ability to play UMD games?

662
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:25,249
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's really nothing that's going to be exclusive to that.

663
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:28,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe rentals are exclusive to the PSP Go?

664
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:28,490
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

665
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Question mark?

666
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be, because you know why?

667
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:35,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if they do it exclusive to the PSP Go, then they lose out on all the PSP 3000 stuff.

668
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:37,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't know.

669
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:40,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Deathwishing in chat says, I love renting PSP games.

670
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:42,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Renting PSP games are awesome when you go on trips.

671
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:45,170
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes sense.

672
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're going to go on a long road trip, why not rent a game?

673
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:55,518
[SPEAKER_12]: They do have PSP rentals and NDS rentals with the kiosks and airports and stuff like that.

674
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,119
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do that.

675
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a place in the airport here that has a rental thing and you drop it off in the box.

676
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:03,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh good, I'm going to LA next week and I'm flying.

677
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:04,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I'll have to utilize that.

678
00:55:04,906 --> 00:55:05,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.

679
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:10,790
[SPEAKER_12]: You rent it where you're flying out of and you can drop it off.

680
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:13,973
[SPEAKER_12]: They have one in every single airport, major airport, yeah.

681
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:16,012
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, there's still quite a few people that are very into their PC gaming, love it.

683
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:45,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And Batman Arkham Asylum, of course, was released on the Games for Windows platform so that those folks could play it there as well.

684
00:55:45,148 --> 00:55:49,192
[SPEAKER_14]: But, of course, where there is PC gaming, there is piracy.

685
00:55:49,612 --> 00:56:00,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess an early version of this game leaked out, and there was a user that actually posted on the official Eidos forums with a post that went something like this, that he had a glitch with his PC version of the game.

686
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:00,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Quote,

687
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,283
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a problem.

688
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:15,936
[SPEAKER_14]: When it's time to use Batman's glide in the game, when I hold the comma like it's said to to jump from one platform to another, Batman tries to open his wings again and again instead of gliding, so he falls down into poison gas.

689
00:56:16,357 --> 00:56:18,119
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody could tell me what should I do here?

690
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:24,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was actually replied to by an admin on the forums, Kier, responded to the thread and said...

691
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:25,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that Entrapment?

692
00:56:53,753 --> 00:57:14,274
[SPEAKER_12]: um no because they're not really implicating them it's just so that they have an unplayable copy of it if they but here's the thing here's the funny thing about it one they've done this before with Grand Theft Auto um if you pirated Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC they had this thing basically it was drunk cam all the time it was shaking around making it really hard to play um

693
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:20,721
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other thing is this problem with Batman Arkham Asylum got patched within like a day.

694
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It was only effective for about a day and then that was it.

695
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:29,235
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what Tigerclaw says in chat as well, is that the glitch was later fixed.

696
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I think we're all not surprised to hear that.

697
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,722
[SPEAKER_14]: But how many people do you think think to find the fix?

698
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:47,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that maybe this does still defeat a lot of pirates because they'll get the game, play it, go, this sucks, and delete it without ever thinking to look for a patch?

699
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:47,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

700
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:49,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, no.

701
00:57:49,935 --> 00:58:02,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe stupid people that, you know, are not really normally pirating games, but a lot of people will get frustrated with it, and then, like, a week later, they'll read on the forums that this was intentional, and then they'll redownload it again.

702
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:03,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's...

703
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:09,790
[SPEAKER_12]: El no nombre hombre in our chatroom says, No, it's not entrapment because they're A, not law enforcement, and B, they aren't asking them to pirate.

704
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:39,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I meant that I thought that they had called the police on them, but no, they haven't.

705
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:42,553
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it looks like they just banned this guy from their forums or what have you.

706
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:45,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, well, to be fair, couldn't they report it?

707
00:58:46,096 --> 00:58:49,679
[SPEAKER_15]: They could report it, but they sort of set him up.

708
00:58:50,976 --> 00:59:09,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I'm kind of reminded of, and this is going to make me sound super gay But Madonna, when one of her albums was leaked to the internet It was actually something Madonna's record label released themselves And it would start the song and you would hear the first 15 seconds And then you would hear Madonna's voice come on and go, what the fuck are you doing?

709
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:18,091
[SPEAKER_14]: So she basically put out all these bogus mp3s that started off like the real thing And then would just cut off and it would be her going, what the fuck are you doing?

710
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of reminded of that.

711
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:27,316
[SPEAKER_14]: This is essentially the video game equivalent of that, except the game doesn't taunt you.

712
00:59:27,657 --> 00:59:31,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it taunts you without directly taunting you, if that makes sense.

713
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:36,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if entrapment would be the word I would use, though.

714
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:38,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that wasn't quite what I was thinking of.

715
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:50,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what legal recourse they could seek with this because, yeah, but I certainly think it's a good way to out the people that aren't supporting them.

716
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:55,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, to go so far, it's pretty bold to download a pirated copy of the game and post on the forums about it.

717
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:05,303
[SPEAKER_14]: That is kind of a stupid thing to do, in my opinion, is that if you're going to steal... But I don't think that they had any way of knowing that it was an intentional glitch.

718
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:13,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Salacious Pop in chat says that it would defer anyone, even the idiot makes it worth it, in my opinion.

719
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:28,725
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of tend to agree with that statement because, you know, even if it took a day for that patch to come out that fixed it, that was still one day where you might have some of these pirates get fed up with waiting and go, I'm just going to buy it.

720
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:30,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked cool enough from what I saw.

721
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:32,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to buy it.

722
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:39,011
[SPEAKER_14]: And even if that drove sales, it did curb a low percentage of the piracy and had more of an impact than not doing anything at all.

723
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:40,372
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

724
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:41,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess.

725
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,885
[SPEAKER_14]: TheRobD in chat says the best part would be if the game crashed before the final boss.

726
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,786
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the best middle finger to the pirates.

727
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:52,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember Earthbound?

728
01:00:53,108 --> 01:01:03,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but the problem with Earthbound is one thing, but I think the problem with what RobD is suggesting, as funny and clever as that is, I think that most people would say at that point, I played enough of the game, forget it.

729
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:05,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I love the Earthbound thing.

730
01:01:05,516 --> 01:01:06,897
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked about it a couple weeks on the show.

731
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:12,178
[SPEAKER_14]: It doubled the number of monsters and would crash your game, delete the save and everything.

732
01:01:12,258 --> 01:01:15,719
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think there's a lot of people that at that point would just go, Ah, fuck it.

733
01:01:15,779 --> 01:01:17,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need to worry about this game anymore.

734
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to move on and steal something else.

735
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:26,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, after having seen the last boss and ending of the game, first of all, the last boss is actually kind of easy.

736
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Uber Joker.

737
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:33,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ending was less than a minute long.

738
01:01:34,244 --> 01:01:34,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

739
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:35,385
[SPEAKER_14]: For Arkham Asylum?

740
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:38,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was short.

741
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:40,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Spoiler free, please.

742
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:44,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Less than five minutes is fair, although I don't remember it even being that long.

743
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:44,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

744
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:46,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fair enough.

745
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:53,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob D in chat says, I think that if they played that long, they would be really frustrated with the inability to finish it.

746
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:54,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, to some extent.

747
01:01:54,464 --> 01:02:08,291
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do think – I think Eidos did a funny thing here because I think people that are going to be bold enough to steal and then complain about their stolen game on the official forums, I think they deserve to kind of be made a mockery of.

748
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,271
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

749
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,734
[SPEAKER_14]: So he kind of got us just desserts, and I think that's where a lot of us are doing the Nelson here going –

750
01:02:17,022 --> 01:02:17,502
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

751
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: LucasArts is actually working on a new game.

752
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Loom 2!

753
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:56,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish.

754
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:57,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I so wish.

755
01:02:58,355 --> 01:03:03,459
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is actually kind of cool because they said that they took their inspiration from games that are like Braid.

756
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course Braid was pretty freaking cool.

757
01:03:07,123 --> 01:03:09,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, has gone down in price on Steam.

758
01:03:10,326 --> 01:03:10,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on sale.

759
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:12,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

760
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:18,331
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Lucidity, which is supposed to be an Xbox Live arcade game.

761
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:23,154
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rumors of a PC version, but they didn't say anything about that.

762
01:03:23,614 --> 01:03:28,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 2D side-scrolling platformer, but it has puzzle elements.

763
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We play as a girl called Sophie, and she keeps moving.

764
01:03:34,281 --> 01:03:36,102
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to move things out of her way.

765
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of Lemmings-ish, right?

766
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,745
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of what it sounds like to me a little bit.

767
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess your goal is to get her from point A to point B. But is she stupid?

768
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:48,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, lemmings were stupid.

769
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:48,985
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the whole point of the game.

770
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:52,928
[SPEAKER_14]: They would just keep walking right off a cliff if they, you know, needed to.

771
01:03:52,948 --> 01:03:56,451
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that she's like in her abstract dream world.

772
01:03:57,632 --> 01:03:59,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe she's just dreaming.

773
01:04:00,454 --> 01:04:01,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of out of it.

774
01:04:02,135 --> 01:04:06,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But the art style is supposed to be the cut paper look of a pop-up book.

775
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's going to sound neat.

776
01:04:08,659 --> 01:04:11,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to look like an old school children's book.

777
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:11,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

778
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:12,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Paper Mario.

779
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,801
[SPEAKER_12]: She's dreaming stupid.

780
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:24,683
[SPEAKER_14]: When was the last time we got a game from LucasArts that wasn't Star Wars related?

781
01:04:25,323 --> 01:04:26,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Lego Indiana Jones?

782
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:26,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

783
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:28,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I didn't realize they were buying the Lego games.

784
01:04:28,704 --> 01:04:29,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It is LucasArts.

785
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Indiana Jones.

786
01:04:30,585 --> 01:04:31,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, gotcha.

787
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:35,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this sounds like it could be cool, but I'll wait to see if there's a demo.

788
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:38,015
[SPEAKER_14]: And then before that, there was Fracture.

789
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so there's just games I missed somehow.

790
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:42,262
[SPEAKER_14]: There's too many video games.

791
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:42,883
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't play them all.

792
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:44,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was them.

793
01:04:44,105 --> 01:04:44,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Fracture.

794
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:45,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Fracture sucked.

795
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:46,329
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.

796
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:47,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Underachiever.

797
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:53,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to go back for a minute because I think this chat room comment bears repeating to Arkham Asylum.

798
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:56,232
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw wanted to clarify something on the ending of Arkham Asylum.

799
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,633
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, Arkham Asylum continues on though.

800
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:08,136
[SPEAKER_14]: After you beat the game, you can still click on continue story and you have free roaming of the entire game so you can go and find those Riddler trophies, the alignment puzzles, and interview tapes.

801
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2

802
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:39,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, which will be coming out on pretty much everything.

803
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:52,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Need for Speed Shift will be coming out this week as well on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PSP, and I believe the PC version as well.

804
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:57,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Scribblenauts will be making its way out on DS this week.

805
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:00,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I believe like a week from today, I think.

806
01:06:02,246 --> 01:06:03,687
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Tuesday, my mistake.

807
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:05,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

808
01:06:06,954 --> 01:06:11,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, tomorrow, Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story on the DS.

809
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Some other crappy games on the DS.

810
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,963
[SPEAKER_12]: My Boyfriend and Princess in Love on DS.

811
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:20,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo-hoo.

812
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:21,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

813
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:24,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

814
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Animal Planet, Vet Life.

815
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:32,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say, though, I saw a commercial for Need for Speed Shift the other day on TV, and it looked pretty hot, because it was in high def.

816
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:34,155
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Project Gotham, yeah.

817
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:34,756
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks kind of neat.

818
01:06:34,996 --> 01:06:36,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

819
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,381
[SPEAKER_12]: And speaking of piracy, Batman Arkham Asylum on PC.

820
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:44,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're complaining about it now, you don't have it yet.

821
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:45,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Liars.

822
01:06:46,982 --> 01:06:48,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Bleach the Third Phantom on DS.

823
01:06:49,863 --> 01:06:51,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Chicken Blaster on DS and Wii.

824
01:06:53,284 --> 01:06:58,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Another movie tie-in game, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on pretty much every system except for the PlayStation 2.

825
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Heroes Over Europe on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

826
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:16,310
[SPEAKER_12]: NHL 10 from EA on PS3 and Xbox 360 NHL 2K10 on PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360 People Hall of Fame The Williams Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360 Red Faction Guerrilla finally making its way out on PC as well as Resident Evil 5

827
01:07:35,226 --> 01:07:38,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Time of Shadows I didn't even know they were giving that a PC release.

828
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

829
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Time of Shadows, also on PC.

830
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:53,298
[SPEAKER_12]: This week, that really crappy game they played on Konami's booth at E3 this year, Tornado Outbreak, formerly known as Zephyr Rise of the Elementals on PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.

831
01:07:53,858 --> 01:07:56,900
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that as kind of the Tornado Katamari type of game.

832
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Toy Story Mania, based off the ride and in 3D, coming to the Wii.

833
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:04,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Madballs and Babbo Invasion

834
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:35,571
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, on Xbox 360, the Q Entertainment Trilogy on Xbox 360 Cubed, which features Rez, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and of course, Luminous Live.

835
01:08:36,192 --> 01:08:37,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And they left out 99 Nights.

836
01:08:39,372 --> 01:08:40,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's not Xbox Live.

837
01:08:41,053 --> 01:08:41,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but still.

838
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:45,688
[SPEAKER_14]: is there anything extra in this though?

839
01:08:46,328 --> 01:09:10,047
[SPEAKER_14]: you know what's funny besides some of their misfires like 99 Nights I really love Q Entertainment Tetsuya Mizuguchi is the man he's one of my favorites most of the games he puts out I love so I'm kind of curious if there's anything extra in the collection that would make it worth getting probably the download content is probably in there I'm not positive but it would make sense um

840
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:12,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and how did I miss this?

841
01:09:13,493 --> 01:09:15,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Naruto Shippuden, Ninja Destiny 2.

842
01:09:15,814 --> 01:09:16,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, who cares?

843
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:17,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Who cares about Naruto?

844
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:25,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Going over to Japan, September 17th, Fuel, the localized version for Japan, finally hits on September 17th.

845
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:27,498

846
01:09:27,518 --> 01:09:28,779

852
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:10,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, checking out the games there.

853
01:10:10,495 --> 01:10:15,558

854
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,701
[SPEAKER_14]: House of the Dead Overkill, that comes by itself, and a version with the Wii Zapper.

855
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,702
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii Zapper's not dead in Japan, apparently.

856
01:10:22,483 --> 01:10:23,964
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming out with that little bundle out there.

857
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:27,461
[SPEAKER_14]: or they're just trying to unload the remaining supply they had.

858
01:10:28,282 --> 01:10:31,184
[SPEAKER_14]: PlayStation 2 sees some price reductions this week.

859
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:40,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Bully the Scholarship Edition and Biohazard Code Veronica which of course is Resident Evil Code Veronica in a bundle with Resident Evil 4 or Biohazard 4 as it is in Japan.

860
01:10:41,434 --> 01:10:44,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly on the handhelds

[SPEAKER_14]: Saga 2, Hyou Densetsu, Goddess of Destiny

862
01:11:00,734 --> 01:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe there'll be some folks wanting to import that, although they'll have to try and read it.

863
01:11:04,815 --> 01:11:08,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And Idolmaster, Dearly Stars, DS, get it?

864
01:11:08,856 --> 01:11:10,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Idolmaster definitely has its fans in Japan.

865
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:12,717
[SPEAKER_14]: That is coming out on the Nintendo DS this week.

866
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:15,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that's a franchise we will ever see happen over here?

867
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:16,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

868
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:17,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

869
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:20,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's too Japanese.

870
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:20,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

871
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to say it because I...

872
01:11:23,308 --> 01:11:24,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sounds weird, but yeah.

873
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:28,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite a few games to pick from on the PSP this week in Japan.

874

878
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:47,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming that is just the Mega Man games all packaged together.

879
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,582
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly...

880
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:54,204
[SPEAKER_14]: and Ikiutsun Eloquent Fist gets a price reduction this week.

881
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:55,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to see what game that is.

882
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:57,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that's one we have over here.

883
01:11:58,487 --> 01:11:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

884
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,049
[SPEAKER_14]: No, one of the characters looks just like Sakura, though, but like an older version.

885
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:02,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

886
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:03,970
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like wearing the same outfit and everything.

887
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is a, you know, high school uniform.

888
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:07,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess.

889
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:09,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just what it makes me think of, though.

890
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:10,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Ys.

891
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:12,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom.

892
01:12:13,155 --> 01:12:13,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Ys.

893
01:12:15,116 --> 01:12:15,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Ys.

894
01:12:16,477 --> 01:12:17,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, there you go.

895
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:18,358
[SPEAKER_14]: There's your release dates for Japan.

896
01:12:18,398 --> 01:12:19,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura, how about the U.K.? ?

897
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:26,163
[SPEAKER_03]: For the UK, we have on the 15th, as we discussed last week, Azuma's Revenge.

898
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:29,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 18th, the whole crap ton of stuff.

899
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:32,408
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Batman Arkham Asylum for PC.

900
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:35,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't pirate it, or you'll get laughed at.

901
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:49,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood Bowl, Katamari Forever for PS3, One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2 for Wii, Order of War, Raven Squad, Red Gorilla Faction, I'm sorry, Red Faction Gorilla, sorry.

902
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:51,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading Gorilla and thinking beer.

903
01:12:53,111 --> 01:13:02,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil 5, Spectrobes Origins, The Humans for DS and PC, Wacky World of Sports for Wii, and WET.

904
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Yamaha Supercross for DS, and Need for Speed Shift on McCrap Tennis Systems.

905
01:13:12,006 --> 01:13:12,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Very cool.

906
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:18,876
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's some new stuff finally making its way to home.

907
01:13:19,296 --> 01:13:20,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is kind of cool.

908
01:13:20,217 --> 01:13:21,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I fully endorse this.

909
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:24,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Robot Chicken is coming to the PlayStation Home Theater.

910
01:13:28,107 --> 01:13:29,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I did that off camera, sorry.

911
01:13:30,309 --> 01:13:32,091
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's making sound effects in the studio.

912
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:34,214
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm singing the Robot Chicken theme.

913
01:13:34,505 --> 01:13:35,346
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually really funny.

914
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:36,887
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bummer you couldn't hear her.

915
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:38,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm stealing a cookie.

916
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:50,359
[SPEAKER_12]: So now they will actually have a bunch of different clips available on their theater screen that once played Twilight's... I remember when they were playing the Twilight trailer on there.

917
01:13:50,379 --> 01:13:51,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank God they got rid of that.

918
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:52,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

919
01:13:52,941 --> 01:14:00,187
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll be able to watch Robot Chicken for free, even though you can pretty much on your TV as well.

920
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:03,335
[SPEAKER_12]: But neat, I guess.

921
01:14:03,995 --> 01:14:06,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Something else to watch while you're doing The Running Man.

922
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:11,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think it's nice they're putting more useful things in home.

923
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense?

924
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:19,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, trailers are one thing, but it's kind of nice that they're actually giving those theaters something a little more...

925
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:22,662
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

926
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's just a matter of time before you start seeing like the first episode of TV shows that they're trying to get you hooked into.

927
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:54,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, the Glee pilot or what other pilots they've been trying to sell this year.

928
01:14:54,785 --> 01:14:56,786
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other science fiction, Caprica's pilot.

929
01:14:57,066 --> 01:15:03,089
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, some of these shows that are coming out in 2010, you know, trying to kind of push those in Sony home.

930
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:06,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet, you know, especially for the next fall season, you start seeing more of that.

931
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'll see.

932
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:09,292
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's kind of cool.

933
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:11,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a good use of a PlayStation Home.

934
01:15:11,413 --> 01:15:14,815
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, there's some free stuff on Home this weekend, too, if you haven't logged in.

935
01:15:15,295 --> 01:15:16,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And search for the OLR Club.

936
01:15:16,776 --> 01:15:17,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't actually have to invite you.

937
01:15:18,016 --> 01:15:21,838
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to join the Orange Lounge Radio, just search for it in Clubhouses.

938
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:26,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Either search for Orange Lounge Radio or OLRMY is like the keyword for it.

939
01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:30,403
[SPEAKER_14]: So search for either of those and you'll find the Clubhouse and I'll invite you in.

940
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:42,353
[SPEAKER_14]: One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do with Penny Arcade Expo and some unfortunate kind of side effect of so many folks being all contained in one place.

941
01:15:42,934 --> 01:15:52,039
[SPEAKER_14]: PAX organizers did report this week that a confirmed swine flu case did break out at the show and unfortunately this has grown into about 100 cases of swine flu.

942
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:58,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course H1N1 is the real name for it but everybody calls it swine flu coming out of Penny Arcade Expo so

943
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:02,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of scary that you get all those people together and these types of things break out.

944
01:16:02,907 --> 01:16:08,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, it's not just the swine flu, but of course the regular flu is showing up as well, as is various types of con things.

945
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:15,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this came up, and we talked about this for a little bit on our phone call with Bobby Blackwolf that we do on his show right before we go on the air tonight.

946
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:23,663
[SPEAKER_14]: So we talked a little bit about this, and a couple bottom lines that come out of this is that A, this is just an unfortunate circumstance of cons.

947
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:28,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jamie, you said something very smart about the fatigue that goes on at cons and why this happens a lot.

948
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:33,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and keep in mind, I was a long-time con-goer ever since I moved out here.

949
01:16:33,953 --> 01:16:38,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I moved out here, you know, my first convention, I slept like three hours.

950
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a three-day convention.

951
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

952
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will do that.

953
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,642
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big thing.

954
01:16:45,822 --> 01:16:50,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for people who don't, you know, buy their hotel room and sleep in the lobby, people do that.

955
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:50,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

956
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:55,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You are typically saving the typical con-goer.

957
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:57,492
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

958
01:17:21,825 --> 01:17:26,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I even ran away and got Moroccan food once at AX one year.

959
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But people don't really think in terms of their health and the precautions they should be taking.

960
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:40,235
[SPEAKER_03]: At least have a couple of good decent meals with vegetables.

961
01:17:40,675 --> 01:17:41,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring your vitamins with you.

962
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:44,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a good supplement in the morning.

963
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that contributes to your level of fatigue.

964
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And sleep.

965
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Please sleep.

966
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:58,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The con is a few days, but you've got to live with your health for the rest of your life.

967
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:10,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I know that some people have kind of been wondering what my piece is going to be on this, because if you were listening to the show a couple months ago, you know I have been very personally affected by swine flu.

968
01:18:10,224 --> 01:18:12,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost a good friend of mine who is only 24 years old.

969
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:18,146
[SPEAKER_14]: She passed away of H1N1 a couple months ago on June 23rd, right before my birthday.

970
01:18:20,286 --> 01:18:25,729
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize that what happened to her is not going to happen to everybody, okay?

971
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:28,890
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think there needs to be paranoia out there about the swine flu.

972
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:33,172
[SPEAKER_14]: But it pisses me off when people don't take this shit seriously.

973
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:37,895
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think that people have to like, you know, oh my god, mass hysteria.

974
01:18:37,935 --> 01:18:39,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, no, nobody wants that.

975
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,217
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, don't belittle...

976
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:43,999
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

977
01:18:54,766 --> 01:19:01,033
[SPEAKER_14]: and I don't want people because I actually know people like on Twitter that apparently caught this at PAX and I don't want people to freak out like, oh my gosh, am I going to die?

978
01:19:01,614 --> 01:19:02,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

979
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:07,660
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, you know, what happened with Beth was certainly an isolated circumstance.

980
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,022
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still many questions.

981
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,084
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never going to get answers to as to what happened there.

982
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:12,866
[SPEAKER_14]: My point is, though,

983
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:15,155
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

984
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,312
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

985
01:19:58,081 --> 01:20:03,266
[SPEAKER_14]: If you suspect, whether you have PPO, HMO, whatever, it will pay for urgent care if you have symptoms.

986
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:05,287
[SPEAKER_14]: So you don't have to go to the ER because you have a high fever.

987
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:06,629
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go to an urgent care center.

988
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:08,030
[SPEAKER_14]: You can make an appointment with your doctor.

989
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:09,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Just go get checked out.

990
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:10,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Get told it's nothing.

991
01:20:10,612 --> 01:20:11,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Get told it's the common cold.

992
01:20:11,733 --> 01:20:13,615
[SPEAKER_14]: It's better you do that than the alternative.

993
01:20:13,915 --> 01:20:23,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have coverage, still a lot of those urgent care places will treat you for – the last one I ever went to was $75, I think.

994
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:28,166
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're uninsured... They're there for that reason.

995
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:30,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, go to an urgent care center, not the ER for this.

996
01:20:30,648 --> 01:20:33,429
[SPEAKER_14]: But get checked out for heaven's sake.

997
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:35,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't sit on it and don't wait on it.

998
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:42,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other side I want to do with this is that when you go to cons and when you go...

999
01:20:43,462 --> 01:20:46,224
[SPEAKER_14]: To these places, please be hygienic.

1000
01:20:46,404 --> 01:20:54,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of people make jokes about this stuff, the whole con funk and all that stuff, but that is a very real thing that can continue to spread disease.

1001
01:20:54,950 --> 01:21:02,935
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to reiterate one thing that Beth's mom, Lynn, said to the media when she was interviewed because Beth was the first person to die in this county from H1N1.

1002
01:21:03,355 --> 01:21:09,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one thing that her mom said to me, and I will never forget this for the rest of my life, is her on the news saying this, and I want you all to remember this.

1003
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Wash your hands.

1004
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Wash your hands.

1005
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:13,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Wash your hands.

1006
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:16,462
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not fucking around.

1007
01:21:16,522 --> 01:21:24,544
[SPEAKER_14]: When you go to these conventions and you're touching these controllers that hundreds of people have touched before and so forth, wash your hands.

1008
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:27,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Please help stop the spread of disease.

1009
01:21:27,684 --> 01:21:29,025
[SPEAKER_14]: And wash your body while you're at it.

1010
01:21:30,645 --> 01:21:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, I don't actually know if you remember this Rob, the last time that we went to E3 together.

1011
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:39,834
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I have on me all the time?

1012
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:40,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably hand sanitizer.

1013
01:21:40,774 --> 01:21:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand sanitizer.

1014
01:21:41,975 --> 01:21:45,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I also had antibacterial lotion on hand.

1015
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:46,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I had band-aids.

1016
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is something else I learned being a massage therapist.

1017
01:21:51,604 --> 01:21:52,124
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1018
01:22:07,452 --> 01:22:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Active, live.

1019
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:13,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you think you've wiped up all the blood, it'll still live on the surface of anything.

1020
01:22:13,314 --> 01:22:16,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's touched unless you wipe it off really good.

1021
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:21,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they always say if you're going to be around someone who's bleeding, you put on latex gloves and then you take care of them.

1022
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:24,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Put on your own mask before.

1023
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:28,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of latex, if you're going to have con sex, use a condom.

1024
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Use a full body condom if you're having con sex.

1025
01:22:34,048 --> 01:23:01,131
[SPEAKER_03]: um but I'm saying you know you may not think about this and the average person doesn't but there are so many different ways to get sick and I'm not saying be paranoid but if but really take precaution if you're going to be around that many people and at least always keep hand sanitizer around you and if at least be considerate to other people if you've got like a paper cut or a cut on your arm or something put a good watertight bandage on it so that you don't you know if you've

1026
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:09,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, for example, and no, I've never had it, but I have antibodies for hepatitis because I inherited it from somebody.

1027
01:23:10,138 --> 01:23:15,283
[SPEAKER_03]: But that still puts me at danger for exposing other people.

1028
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:17,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I'm always extra careful.

1029
01:23:17,985 --> 01:23:20,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I always bandage up my cuts and things.

1030
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:21,588
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1031
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:53,630
[SPEAKER_03]: take a precaution that you don't share it and honestly, it's not worth it stay home, there'll be another convention

1032
01:23:54,558 --> 01:24:07,267
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping you're sitting there on your chair going, okay, get on with it, OLR, I know this crap, but please understand if one person's kind of sitting there going, oh yeah, maybe I should take extra soap to the next con I go to, then this whole little rant was worth it.

1033
01:24:07,487 --> 01:24:11,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I see a comment in chat, Frisbee says, OLR-common sense.

1034
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:19,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope to everybody it is common sense, but if you've ever made the con funk joke, then you know it's not common sense to everybody.

1035
01:24:20,335 --> 01:24:23,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So just please, from your friends at OLR, wash your damn hands.

1036
01:24:24,535 --> 01:24:42,556
[SPEAKER_03]: and again I do see I see the confunk around two particular groups the really young and the I have no life I've never you know been on a date you know 50 year old con fanboy that's probably why they never had a date

1037
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: SJ100 Matt also wants to put out, and don't pee on the seat when you use the toilet.

1038
01:24:46,267 --> 01:24:46,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, don't do that.

1039
01:24:47,107 --> 01:24:47,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1040
01:24:47,828 --> 01:24:48,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say something to this.

1041
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:50,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not be afraid of urine on a seat.

1042
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It is sterile.

1043
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wipe it off.

1044
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:57,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I'm telling you, if you see poop on the seat, that's different.

1045
01:24:58,356 --> 01:24:58,656
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1046
01:24:58,676 --> 01:24:59,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, this is too much.

1047
01:25:00,097 --> 01:25:00,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm done.

1048
01:25:00,757 --> 01:25:01,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1049
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:02,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, it actually is true.

1050
01:25:02,499 --> 01:25:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Urine is sterile.

1051
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,542
[SPEAKER_03]: You have more germs on your hands and mouth than you do on your butt.

1052
01:25:07,222 --> 01:25:07,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1053
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:07,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Too much.

1054
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:08,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Done.

1055
01:25:10,044 --> 01:25:11,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wash your hands, okay?

1056
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:12,166
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the point I wanted to make.

1057
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:13,739
[SPEAKER_14]: True, though.

1058
01:25:13,799 --> 01:25:14,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I know.

1059
01:25:26,263 --> 01:25:29,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Somehow we always end up with the show in the toilet, even literally.

1060
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:36,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we urge you kids to go visit the archives and check out a classic video game of years past.

1061
01:25:36,452 --> 01:25:37,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight is no different.

1062
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:41,096
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and pick out a game she thinks you all should be playing.

1063
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,417
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1064
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:45,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pissarama.

1065
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,740
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

1066
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:47,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate you.

1067
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:50,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

1068
01:25:50,664 --> 01:25:51,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, Space Harrier.

1069
01:25:51,925 --> 01:25:54,507
[SPEAKER_03]: About damn time I did Space Harrier.

1070
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:03,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just got an IM from Becky saying that she thinks it's funny whenever I go off about pee being sterile.

1071
01:26:03,418 --> 01:26:04,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you get to the game?

1072
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:08,943
[SPEAKER_15]: No, go back, go back, because people have to hear that part.

1073
01:26:09,243 --> 01:26:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1074
01:26:11,545 --> 01:26:12,967
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking at an arcade version of the game here.

1075
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:13,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1076
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It has my catchphrase on it.

1077
01:26:15,048 --> 01:26:15,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1078
01:26:19,184 --> 01:26:21,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everyone knows where that comes from.

1079
01:26:21,886 --> 01:26:24,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That has been, like, what, my catchphrase as long as you've known me?

1080
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:27,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been your little quote on forums, like, ever since I've known you.

1081
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:30,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Why that quote of the thousands of quotes out there?

1082
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:31,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Why this quote do you love so much?

1083
01:26:31,531 --> 01:26:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just cool.

1084
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the fantasy zone.

1085
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Get ready.

1086
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:34,973
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1087
01:26:34,993 --> 01:26:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it really makes no sense.

1088
01:26:36,974 --> 01:26:43,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Harrier is my third favorite video game ever, which is me, which means I have now covered...

1089
01:26:44,498 --> 01:26:47,422
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of my top three favorite video games.

1090
01:26:48,163 --> 01:26:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The first being The Guardian Legend, the second being Fantasy Zone, and the third being Space Harrier.

1091
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone.

1092
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:06,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, moving forward, it is a game that was produced by Yu Suzuki, who did a lot of Sega's really good games.

1093
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:10,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And sitting right next to me is a picture of my husband shaking hands with Yu Suzuki.

1094
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,320
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

1095
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Space Harrier is a...

1096
01:27:18,556 --> 01:27:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of a fake 3D type of game.

1097
01:27:21,057 --> 01:27:29,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a sprite-based game, and it scrolls towards you from an over-the-shoulder... Well, not kind of like a real over-the-shoulder cam, but it's from behind you.

1098
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:37,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has 18 levels, each with a boss, and you have to shoot everything that gets in your way before it shoots you.

1099
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:38,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1100
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:43,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run on the ground or you can fly in the air with a jetpack.

1101
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:46,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything really does come at you very quickly.

1102
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's brightly covered levels.

1103
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:55,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Even for as old as it is, because it came out in 1985, it is a fantastic game.

1104
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:00,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the early games to use digitized voices in it.

1105
01:28:02,002 --> 01:28:04,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And after you beat a boss, it tells you that you're doing great.

1106
01:28:05,183 --> 01:28:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It constantly encourages you.

1107
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:08,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many games do that?

1108
01:28:08,505 --> 01:28:08,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1109
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:20,392
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, I just want to point out, and I'm sorry, DarkSakura, if you were going to get to this, but since I was a Nintendo kid and not a Sega kid growing up, there was a game on Nintendo called 3D World Runner that was a direct ripoff of this game.

1110
01:28:21,173 --> 01:28:22,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get to it.

1111
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:23,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1112
01:28:24,055 --> 01:28:25,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that game was put out by Square, by the way.

1113
01:28:26,896 --> 01:28:34,422
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was also Pony Canyon did a parody called Animal Attack Academy that had a Japanese schoolgirl fighting Australian animals.

1114
01:28:37,628 --> 01:28:52,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the game is also... That along with Afterburner was one of the first cabinets that had you in a seat and the whole cabinet would move along with your joystick movement.

1115
01:28:53,152 --> 01:28:57,113
[SPEAKER_03]: There also is one that doesn't move that sits down and an upright version.

1116
01:28:57,713 --> 01:28:59,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really, really cool to play.

1117
01:28:59,854 --> 01:29:06,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played a Space Harrier with the full motion sit-down cabinet in ages.

1118
01:29:07,476 --> 01:29:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it also, it used the same music for the most part over and over again, but I really love the music.

1119
01:29:15,321 --> 01:29:18,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I put up a link also to just the music.

1120
01:29:20,664 --> 01:29:25,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I will bring that up so you can hear just the music without all the explosion noise.

1121
01:29:25,187 --> 01:29:26,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's listen to a little bit of that.

1122
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad for a game from 85.

1123
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:28,990
Yeah.

1124
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is one of my favorites.

1125
01:29:40,754 --> 01:29:45,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as far as other releases, we got a... There was a home computer version.

1126
01:29:46,358 --> 01:29:47,959
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also the 32X version.

1127
01:29:48,019 --> 01:29:52,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I will say is that the 32X version is a direct rip from the arcade.

1128
01:29:53,423 --> 01:30:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: um in fact you actually have a little trick that you can do with it where it changes from press start to insert coin so that in space uh not space area um well space area of course but uh after burner we're both direct to arcade courts

1129
01:30:10,255 --> 01:30:11,697
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Sega Saturn version.

1130
01:30:11,897 --> 01:30:15,923
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Sharp X86000.

1131
01:30:17,865 --> 01:30:21,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It only came out in Japan.

1132
01:30:23,773 --> 01:30:25,476
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those are supposed to be the most arcade faithful.

1133
01:30:26,136 --> 01:30:31,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreamcast, Shenmue, Shenmue 2, Yu Suzuki Gameworks Vol.

1134
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:41,906
[SPEAKER_03]: 1, Xbox, Sega Arcade Gallery for Game Boy Advance, and Sega Classics Collection for the PS2.

1135
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:49,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Harrier 2 was the Genesis version, which actually also just came out on Virtual Console December 2 years ago.

1136
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to say it just came out.

1137
01:30:52,772 --> 01:30:53,893
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe it came out in October 2008.

1138
01:30:53,933 --> 01:30:53,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1139
01:30:55,974 --> 01:30:58,375
[SPEAKER_03]: and over here on November 13,008 for the Master System thing.

1140
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:14,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the arcade version is unlockable in the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3.

1141
01:31:15,243 --> 01:31:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it has sound issues by everything being just off-pitch.

1142
01:31:19,485 --> 01:31:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I couldn't play.

1143
01:31:20,826 --> 01:31:25,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I know that firsthand because I tried to play Space Harrier and the music sounded wrong to me.

1144
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:32,330
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also have this thing where I hear anything off-pitch really strongly.

1145
01:31:32,651 --> 01:31:33,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect pitch for listening.

1146
01:31:33,691 --> 01:31:34,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it.

1147
01:31:34,992 --> 01:31:35,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1148
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:39,974
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the Space Hero Complete Edition.

1149
01:31:40,554 --> 01:31:42,415
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1150
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:48,399
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done the series an injustice because they didn't release the sequel at home.

1151
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:50,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequel being Planet Harriers.

1152
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you played Planet Harriers?

1153
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:53,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard of it.

1154
01:31:53,481 --> 01:31:54,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard you talk about it before.

1155
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:55,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what?

1156
01:31:55,262 --> 01:32:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you've seen me play it because they had it at Great America.

1157
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:02,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I probably have just seen it and don't really remember it.

1158
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if they still have it at Great America, but that one was pretty much a fantastic follow-up to a great series.

1159
01:32:11,535 --> 01:32:18,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this game, and again, sorry if I'm covering something you're about to get to, but I'm pretty sure this game's in that Sonic Genesis Collection that just came out.

1160
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:18,640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I just said.

1161
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry.

1162
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:25,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it was Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection, but it suffered from... Oh, I was zoning reading the Twitter, so okay, yeah.

1163
01:32:25,404 --> 01:32:25,744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's there.

1164
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:30,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the reason why I couldn't play it is because it had pitch problems.

1165
01:32:31,248 --> 01:32:34,553
[SPEAKER_03]: All the voice and sound was just off.

1166
01:32:34,653 --> 01:32:35,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1167
01:32:35,113 --> 01:32:35,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough to drive me nuts.

1168
01:32:38,106 --> 01:32:40,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the same problem with music on the radio too if they play it too fast.

1169
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:42,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear the pitch.

1170
01:32:42,489 --> 01:32:43,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I digress.

1171
01:32:44,831 --> 01:32:47,672
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, go out and play Space Harrier.

1172
01:32:47,732 --> 01:32:48,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.

1173
01:32:49,734 --> 01:32:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the few games of that perspective that doesn't make me utterly motion sick either unless I'm playing it in the cabinet.

1174
01:32:55,558 --> 01:32:56,238
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion cabinet.

1175
01:32:56,258 --> 01:32:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will get very sick and throw up all over you.

1176
01:32:59,020 --> 01:32:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not sterile.

1177
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:00,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Lovely.

1178
01:33:01,322 --> 01:33:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's your game.

1179
01:33:02,981 --> 01:33:03,501
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, there it is.

1180
01:33:03,521 --> 01:33:06,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Your classic game of the week is Space Harrier.

1181
01:33:06,922 --> 01:33:08,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think DarkSakura prefers the arcade version.

1182
01:33:09,403 --> 01:33:10,224
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are some other places.

1183
01:33:10,344 --> 01:33:15,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if I'm going to play it at home, I'm going to play it on the 32X.

1184
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:18,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so I have a reason to play a good game on the giant mushroom of death.

1185
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,268
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, then there you go.

1186
01:33:20,748 --> 01:33:23,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Harrier on the 32X is your classic game of the week.

1187
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Something non-Sega next week, DarkSakura.

1188
01:33:26,051 --> 01:33:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to pick something non-Sega, and then it occurred to me that I have done dozens of other games that are among my favorites and have not done Space Harrier.

1189
01:33:35,456 --> 01:33:36,056
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, fair enough.

1190
01:33:36,076 --> 01:33:36,596
[SPEAKER_14]: But next week.

1191
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week.

1192
01:33:37,857 --> 01:33:41,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I got them on a month streak of Sega, so next week we'll have to do something non-Sega.

1193
01:33:41,379 --> 01:33:42,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, something non-Sega.

1194
01:33:42,459 --> 01:33:42,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1195
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll do something on the Atari 2600.

1196
01:33:46,142 --> 01:33:47,183
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be cool, actually.

1197
01:33:47,223 --> 01:33:48,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to see some Atari 2600 games.

1198
01:33:48,144 --> 01:33:51,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm actually just looking at a game on the Atari 2600 we have sitting around.

1199
01:33:51,986 --> 01:33:52,246
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1200
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:54,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, we'll get into that next week.

1201
01:33:54,768 --> 01:33:55,689
[SPEAKER_14]: For now, we're going to take a break.

1202
01:33:55,769 --> 01:34:00,092
[SPEAKER_14]: We will be back, though, in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio on Part B tonight, Twitter topics.

1203
01:34:00,332 --> 01:34:07,396
[SPEAKER_14]: We're also going to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XIII, some more Sony news, including news about the minis and some PlayStation 3 bundles.

1204
01:34:08,117 --> 01:34:10,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to talk about a possible Wii price cut.

1205
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:13,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get to all that and rapid-fire news after this.

1206
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,622
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1207
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:24,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And welcome back, everybody, to this Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,593
[SPEAKER_14]: The Zero Punctuation Reviews

1209
01:35:18,866 --> 01:35:19,346
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1210
01:35:45,914 --> 01:36:11,677
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have so many similarities yet differences but anyway I wasn't meaning to plug them as much although they are a good show I want to plug the Escapist show that's brand new that's coming to all games as well just you know what I say just go to all games on Tuesday just leave it running throughout the day and you're going to hear a lot of great radio that's just what you need to do and then don't forget on Sunday nights come back and listen to Bobby Blackwolf and ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio alright

1211
01:36:12,512 --> 01:36:13,453
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1212
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:34,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops, it's down here a little bit.

1213
01:36:34,891 --> 01:36:35,892
[SPEAKER_14]: He wrote like five tweets.

1214
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:36,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Good lord.

1215
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:43,457
[SPEAKER_14]: How about either home, upcoming 1.3 update, and OLR Club, as well as sale on the PSN Video Store?

1216
01:36:44,827 --> 01:37:11,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what they put for sale on the PSN video store it's funny enough because I was actually looking at what kind of offerings were in the video store this week because since my Xbox 360 is broken I can't do Netflix right now it's kind of too bad though because a lot of stuff that is available on the PSN store and not to say the 360 is any different but it's a lot of movies I'm just not interested in it's all like slasher flicks and action packed which I understand who their target audience is but

1217
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:16,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Forgive me if I like a good chick flick or arthouse film every once in a while.

1218
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really find those on either network, to be honest.

1219
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,426
[SPEAKER_14]: But then also the OLR Club.

1220
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:29,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I did plug that at the top of the show, but if you haven't joined the Orange Lounge Radio Club in Sony PlayStation Home, we do have one.

1221
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:30,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So check that out.

1222
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:32,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

1223
01:37:32,653 --> 01:37:34,695
[SPEAKER_14]: R-M-Y is our little buzzword.

1224
01:37:35,115 --> 01:37:39,459
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have some arcade cabinets that I got from the Namco Collection demo that we put there.

1225
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:41,901
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can play like Dig Dug and stuff in our home.

1226
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:44,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm trying to get other furniture as I find it.

1227
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:47,386
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't really want to pay for a lot of furniture.

1228
01:37:47,727 --> 01:37:49,628
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess there's some free stuff this weekend.

1229
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:53,332
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you go into the stores, you can find some new shirts and things like that.

1230
01:37:53,752 --> 01:37:54,052
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1231
01:38:18,056 --> 01:38:21,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, of course, rock bands got new stuff coming out each week.

1232
01:38:21,919 --> 01:38:28,104
[SPEAKER_12]: And this week, we've got some new songs, including Tenacious D. Yes, that's right.

1233
01:38:28,144 --> 01:38:36,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Tenacious D will be getting a couple individual tracks with Rock Your Socks and Tribute, both available for $2 each or 160 Microsoft points.

1234
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm totally getting Tribute.

1235
01:38:39,507 --> 01:38:45,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Also part of the individual songs, The Guess Who with Hand Me Down World and No Time.

1236

01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:50,696
[SPEAKER_12]: with Pick Me Up and The Wagon.

1238
01:38:51,377 --> 01:38:55,300
[SPEAKER_12]: All those available as individual song downloads of $2 each or 160 Microsoft points.

1239
01:38:57,918 --> 01:38:58,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Anvil Pack $5.50

1240
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:20,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Included with that is 666, Metal on Metal, and this is $13.

1241
01:39:21,931 --> 01:39:26,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are also going to be purchased individually for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.

1242
01:39:27,215 --> 01:39:34,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, coming to the PSP, we've got Evanescence with Bring Me to Life and Spinal Tap with Back from the Dead.

1243
01:39:36,441 --> 01:39:36,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1244
01:39:37,654 --> 01:39:38,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Forza 3 Going Gold

01:40:03,816 --> 01:40:19,610

1246
01:40:21,672 --> 01:40:22,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1247
01:40:23,097 --> 01:40:29,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And finally, a game I'm quite excited about, DJ Hero will be getting its healthy dose of Daft Punk.

1248
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:37,447
[SPEAKER_12]: And they will be contributing 11 unique mixes for the game, as well as being playable characters in the game as well.

1249
01:40:37,947 --> 01:40:43,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Included with that would be Daft Punk, Rattle the World vs. Young MC, Bust a Move.

1250
01:40:44,111 --> 01:40:49,475
[SPEAKER_12]: DaFunk vs. NASA's Strange Enough featuring Karen, ODB, and Fatlip.

1251
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:54,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Daft Punk, DaFunks, with Queen, another one bites dust.

1252
01:40:55,124 --> 01:41:02,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Robot Rock, with Hashim Al Naifish, I guess it's translated to the soul.

1253
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:06,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad I'm not the only one that horribly butchers pronunciations on this show.

1254
01:41:08,307 --> 01:41:10,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Robot Rock vs. Queen, We Will Rock You.

1255
01:41:10,948 --> 01:41:12,549
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's kind of appropriate.

1256
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:17,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Short Circuit vs. the Boogie Down Productions Jack of Spades.

1257
01:41:18,192 --> 01:41:20,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Technologic vs. Gary Newman's Cars.

1258
01:41:21,293 --> 01:41:23,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's too many tracks mixed with cars.

1259
01:41:24,575 --> 01:41:25,255
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just my guess.

1260
01:41:25,675 --> 01:41:29,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Television Rules the Nation vs. No Doubt, Hella Good.

1261
01:41:30,298 --> 01:41:34,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm very disappointed to see that there's not anything for like...

1262
01:41:36,769 --> 01:41:38,610
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1263
01:42:07,585 --> 01:42:08,045
[SPEAKER_14]: On WiiWare though...

1264
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:36,590
[SPEAKER_14]: ColorZ, Contra Rebirth Hit for 1,000 Wii Points

1265
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:58,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Nintendo-ish looking newer version of Contra, which funny enough, our caller last week nailed it.

1266
01:42:58,711 --> 01:43:02,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Said that they thought Contra was going to be out on Labor Day and they were correct.

1267
01:43:02,534 --> 01:43:03,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So good job on that.

1268
01:43:04,275 --> 01:43:10,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Capcom versus Tatsunoko has some new apparently leaked characters.

1269
01:43:11,221 --> 01:43:12,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Asukara Joe Asukara Joe Asukara

1270
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:41,104
[SPEAKER_03]: She should have been in it to begin with, yes.

1271
01:43:42,385 --> 01:43:44,126
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always the one that wants to push the button.

1272
01:43:44,686 --> 01:43:49,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Now see, I don't know dick about anime, so I guess Jamie's excitement has me excited too.

1273
01:43:49,149 --> 01:43:49,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Woo!

1274
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:52,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's good news, right?

1275
01:43:53,873 --> 01:43:56,495
[SPEAKER_14]: The Pac-Man world record was broken.

1276
01:43:56,676 --> 01:44:03,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently the kill screen was reached in 3 hours, 42 minutes, and 4 seconds.

1277
01:44:04,302 --> 01:44:06,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, that was the old record from Chris Ira.

1278
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:11,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it has been beat by David Race, I think is his name.

1279
01:44:12,568 --> 01:44:16,811
[SPEAKER_14]: 3 hours, 41 minutes, and 22 seconds is the new time.

1280
01:44:18,192 --> 01:44:18,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1281
01:44:19,113 --> 01:44:21,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Billy Mitchell once held that spot, but no longer has it.

1282
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:22,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy Mitchell's a dick.

1283
01:44:24,838 --> 01:44:25,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1284
01:44:25,999 --> 01:44:26,539
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a movie.

1285
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna... He really is.

1286
01:44:29,842 --> 01:44:30,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1287
01:44:30,243 --> 01:44:30,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the guy.

1288
01:44:31,003 --> 01:44:31,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna bother.

1289
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:35,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's finish off the rapid fire news, DarkSakura.

1290
01:44:35,787 --> 01:44:38,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see what else that we've got going on.

1291
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:44,694
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually an ESRB rating for Castlevania The Adventure on Wii.

1292
01:44:46,616 --> 01:44:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Which really wasn't that good of a game.

1293
01:44:49,698 --> 01:44:52,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, the Game Boy when they came out.

1294
01:44:53,381 --> 01:44:58,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, and I mentioned this earlier, Braid is cheaper now on Steam.

1295
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:03,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $5 now, or $3.39.

1296
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:07,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a pretty cool game.

1297
01:45:07,745 --> 01:45:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Final Fantasy VII on Wii has more download content.

1298
01:45:15,368 --> 01:45:18,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Chapter 9, The Crystals, which is the final part of the story.

1299
01:45:18,649 --> 01:45:19,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 800 Wii points.

1300
01:45:21,633 --> 01:45:22,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to finish up that game.

1301
01:45:23,294 --> 01:45:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I thought you'd be interested in that one.

1302
01:45:24,915 --> 01:45:28,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I kind of stopped playing, but it was a really good Wii download game.

1303
01:45:28,917 --> 01:45:49,209
[SPEAKER_03]: A little other news in WiiWare is that for 800 Wii points, Spaceball Revolution, not to be confused with Spaceballs, then 2-in-1 Solitaire, which is Spider and Klondike, and then Solomon's Key and Rygar for 500 and 600 Wii points, respectively.

1304
01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:53,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's get back into some long discussion topics tonight, Loki.

1305
01:45:54,182 --> 01:46:07,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the music game sales are down, but even though they are down 46%, it is still the third best-selling genre among video games.

1306
01:46:07,575 --> 01:46:13,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, this is coming from the NPD group that, you know, they do all the sales tracking and whatnot, and...

1307
01:46:14,722 --> 01:46:26,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess year-to-date sales have declined quite a bit, but when you look at it, I mean, they're pretty much calculating stuff from, you know, up until, you know, up to Guitar Hero 5 and the Beatles Rock Band.

1308
01:46:26,909 --> 01:46:28,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think a lot of people were anticipating those two games.

1309
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:39,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, isn't this, these, because I've seen this story spread like wildfire through blogs this week, and I'm like, this is completely misleading, in a way, because the big music games for the year haven't even come out yet, or just came out.

1310
01:46:39,817 --> 01:46:41,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, I mean, they're a little bit, I mean...

1311
01:46:42,698 --> 01:46:46,601
[SPEAKER_12]: You obviously can't have that data right away.

1312
01:46:46,661 --> 01:46:51,764
[SPEAKER_12]: They usually release the previous month's data halfway through the next month.

1313
01:46:52,164 --> 01:46:55,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it's even selling half of what it used to is pretty damn impressive.

1314
01:46:55,507 --> 01:46:59,189
[SPEAKER_14]: When you consider a year ago we had Guitar Hero World Tour, Rock Band 2.

1315
01:46:59,689 --> 01:47:00,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are both huge titles.

1316
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:02,972
[SPEAKER_14]: The DS games were just coming out too.

1317
01:47:03,272 --> 01:47:03,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1318
01:47:03,892 --> 01:47:04,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are all huge stuff.

1319
01:47:05,934 --> 01:47:07,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not surprised.

1320
01:47:08,115 --> 01:47:15,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, since I don't really think that Smash Hits and Metallica sold... I mean, they sold alright, but not like, you know, a Guitar Hero 5 or a World 4 or something.

1321
01:47:15,563 --> 01:47:19,247
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just not gonna sell the way a Guitar Hero 4 or a Rock Band 2 does.

1322
01:47:19,448 --> 01:47:22,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, and the trackpacks, I mean, that doesn't really count, so...

1323
01:47:24,219 --> 01:47:25,019
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little misleading.

1324
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:28,821
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be more interesting to see what happens after the holiday.

1325
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:29,421
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end of the year.

1326
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:32,222
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see an end of the year wrap up as compared to last year.

1327
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: You think it'll be kind of in the same?

1328
01:47:34,003 --> 01:47:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you'll still see a little decline.

1329
01:47:36,484 --> 01:47:40,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think the Beatles rock band is going to sell quite the way Rock Band 2 did.

1330
01:47:40,606 --> 01:47:41,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't get me wrong.

1331
01:47:41,126 --> 01:47:42,387
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it'll still sell pretty big.

1332
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:50,670
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think Guitar Hero 5 will probably be on par with Guitar Hero World Tour, which, if I'm not mistaken, didn't Guitar Hero beat Rock Band last year in terms of sales?

1333
01:47:52,071 --> 01:47:52,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1334
01:47:52,682 --> 01:47:55,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero still sells better because they have more releases.

1335
01:47:55,446 --> 01:47:57,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say they have better peripherals too.

1336
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:13,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't call their drum set better than the Rock Band.

1337
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:48,296
[SPEAKER_12]: you can't compare the two because one has way more releases than the other because they refuse to embrace download content on a regular basis I mean they do have download content on a regular basis but nowhere near what Rock Band has

1338
01:48:50,339 --> 01:48:51,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Final Fantasy XIII

1339
01:49:14,474 --> 01:49:17,635
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I will say this, don't forget the PlayStation 3 is region free.

1340
01:49:17,915 --> 01:49:20,295
[SPEAKER_14]: This game is not coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1341
01:49:20,335 --> 01:49:22,316
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not something they said as part of the announcement.

1342
01:49:22,356 --> 01:49:24,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is only PS3 in Japan.

1343
01:49:24,997 --> 01:49:27,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And I bet you, you're going to have a lot of folks that import this.

1344
01:49:27,577 --> 01:49:31,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, it's going to be very Japanese heavy still.

1345
01:49:31,258 --> 01:49:31,858
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the problem.

1346
01:49:32,058 --> 01:49:32,939
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I will though.

1347
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:34,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've done that in the past.

1348
01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:38,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played Final Fantasy games in Japanese and never had a problem.

1349
01:49:39,223 --> 01:49:41,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, look, I don't know Japanese like you guys do.

1350
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:43,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't get nothing from this.

1351
01:49:44,071 --> 01:49:47,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I print out a nice little fan translation of everything and that works.

1352
01:49:47,938 --> 01:49:50,783
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I played through Final Fantasy VIII when I originally imported that.

1353
01:49:51,906 --> 01:49:54,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be cool if they had English subtitles, but they won't.

1354
01:49:54,247 --> 01:49:55,348
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't want to dip into the U.S.

1355
01:49:55,368 --> 01:49:55,688
[SPEAKER_14]: sales.

1356
01:49:55,888 --> 01:49:56,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Naturally, it's not going to be there.

1357
01:49:57,289 --> 01:50:03,793
[SPEAKER_03]: However, though, that doesn't happen until the international versions that they have English subtitles.

1358
01:50:04,134 --> 01:50:10,337
[SPEAKER_03]: My copy of Final Fantasy X-2, my Japanese one, I have the international version.

1359
01:50:11,358 --> 01:50:13,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It has subtitles.

1360
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:20,444
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but I haven't heard of any type of extras that we're going to get in Final Fantasy XIII here in the U.S.

1361
01:50:20,504 --> 01:50:22,825
[SPEAKER_14]: with the exception of the fact that we have a 360 version.

1362
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:25,347
[SPEAKER_14]: So do you think there will even be an international version this time?

1363
01:50:27,008 --> 01:50:27,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

1364
01:50:27,968 --> 01:50:30,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe, I guess they could always do like a remixed version.

1365
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:38,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know how like Final Fantasy X, I don't think there were a whole lot of differences there either, but like the international version had the different, what was the name of the board where you leveled?

1366
01:50:38,575 --> 01:50:43,038
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you filled in the spots on the board, that was how you leveled your characters, remember that?

1367
01:50:43,058 --> 01:50:43,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1368
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:44,594
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1369
01:51:05,748 --> 01:51:23,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft points out in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com the international version would probably be on the 360 I don't think it will in Japan I see where your logic is going and that's a logical thought but again you have to remember the 360 has not penetrated the Japanese marketplace the way it has here

1370
01:51:24,537 --> 01:51:25,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony is still on top.

1371
01:51:25,518 --> 01:51:27,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Nintendo is still on top in Japan, if I'm not mistaking.

1372
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,861
[SPEAKER_14]: But Sony has a clear second place.

1373
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:32,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think Microsoft's gained some ground.

1374
01:51:32,903 --> 01:51:35,344
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not a laughing stock in Japan at this point.

1375
01:51:35,705 --> 01:51:40,087
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're even further back than where Sony is here.

1376
01:51:40,468 --> 01:51:45,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, at least Sony has been gaining a lot of ground here in this generation.

1377
01:51:46,592 --> 01:51:48,193
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think in Japan, it's a whole different story.

1378
01:51:49,053 --> 01:51:49,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1379
01:51:50,274 --> 01:51:52,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And GameGuru says the 360 version is your extra.

1380
01:51:52,816 --> 01:52:00,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep in mind, 360s aren't region-free, so if you live in Japan and for whatever reason have a 360, you're out of luck unless you can figure out a way to mod or whatever.

1381
01:52:01,723 --> 01:52:05,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I wanted to kind of point out one thing this had me thinking about was Final Fantasy XIV.

1382
01:52:06,747 --> 01:52:09,549
[SPEAKER_14]: When do you think we're going to start seeing more of Final Fantasy XIV?

1383
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:10,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think it's going to come out?

1384
01:52:10,909 --> 01:52:16,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't know if the game itself will come out next year, but do you think we're going to see a lot more information start to spill out really quick?

1385
01:52:16,873 --> 01:52:22,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it seems to me like we're going to have our shortest window between Final Fantasy games with this and XIV.

1386
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:25,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Being that we already know there's a playable alpha out there.

1387
01:52:25,498 --> 01:52:28,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's that they demoed at a show.

1388
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:32,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if XIV's not going to show up at Tokyo Game Show as well.

1389
01:52:32,742 --> 01:52:33,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It might.

1390
01:52:33,383 --> 01:52:35,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they may have a little bit there, but I don't, you know.

1391
01:52:36,323 --> 01:52:37,063
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1392
01:53:05,984 --> 01:53:06,244
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura

1393
01:53:19,398 --> 01:53:20,639
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1394
01:53:38,133 --> 01:53:57,828
[SPEAKER_03]: and a retail sourced to a quote Eurogamer that said that there was supposed to be three different bundles with different games as in Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, Gran Turismo 5 and Assassin's Creed 2 and they were supposed to sell for £299 which over here would be £494.

1395
01:53:58,068 --> 01:54:03,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's of course no statement made to the rumour.

1396
01:54:06,357 --> 01:54:06,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1397
01:54:06,777 --> 01:54:09,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Are all these different bundles necessary?

1398
01:54:10,359 --> 01:54:10,899
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

1399
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:12,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess bundles help drive sales.

1400
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,821
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a ton of different PSP bundles here in the States.

1401
01:54:16,181 --> 01:54:21,923
[SPEAKER_14]: There's the Hannah Montana OMG Girls one and the Rock Band one.

1402
01:54:21,983 --> 01:54:24,944
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think that's seriously what it's called.

1403
01:54:24,964 --> 01:54:27,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Like OMG Girls Play 2 or something like that.

1404
01:54:28,066 --> 01:54:33,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of their way of getting girls to get Sony PSPs because right now they all have DSs.

1405
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:48,669
[SPEAKER_12]: um that's funny I don't know if we'll probably see something over here too as far as US bundles I'm guessing because in time for the holidays certainly definitely um

1406
01:54:49,528 --> 01:54:57,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So to kind of go back to something we were talking a little bit about, or complaining about I guess in Part A, was the PSP Go.

1407
01:54:57,714 --> 01:55:09,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that they were kind of showing off during E3, well actually not so much E3, but during Gamescom was the PSP Minis.

1408
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:10,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And

1409
01:55:11,164 --> 01:55:20,033
[SPEAKER_12]: They said that there is a possibility, though, we will see collections of these minis available on a single UMD at a later stage, later on.

1410
01:55:20,574 --> 01:55:24,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So where maybe a publisher or whatever can put out a bunch of these little games.

1411
01:55:24,858 --> 01:55:32,726
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess like you see right now on the Xbox 360 every now and then you'll see an Xbox Live

1412
01:55:33,578 --> 01:55:34,179
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1413
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:59,237
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, and to kind of go back to what we were saying before, what exactly does PSP Go have going for other than it's more expensive and slightly smaller?

1414
01:56:00,137 --> 01:56:00,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, nothing.

1415
01:56:00,798 --> 01:56:02,119
[SPEAKER_12]: It's new.

1416
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:03,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, goody.

1417
01:56:04,101 --> 01:56:09,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, if Nintendo came out with the Wii Gold or something like that, it's a gold-colored Wii, but it's $500.

1418
01:56:10,306 --> 01:56:12,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that mean I have to go buy it?

1419
01:56:12,728 --> 01:56:14,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's stupid, but...

1420
01:56:16,758 --> 01:56:25,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well, I mean, to me, seeing that they're going to re-release these on UMD later on makes me feel that they're not really confident in the PSP Go.

1421
01:56:28,074 --> 01:56:32,180
[SPEAKER_12]: And that they will need to supplement their sales by other means.

1422
01:56:33,385 --> 01:56:36,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was interesting that they were talking about putting these on the PS3 as well.

1423
01:56:36,686 --> 01:56:37,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it makes sense.

1424
01:56:37,726 --> 01:56:42,708
[SPEAKER_14]: But then again, you know, we kind of talk about this, oh, you know, they're going to do all this with the minis, but we don't really know what they're going to be yet.

1425
01:56:42,748 --> 01:56:45,488
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't seen what the minis are, right?

1426
01:56:45,508 --> 01:56:48,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I know that little picture you have there looks like a little bejeweled thing.

1427
01:56:48,449 --> 01:56:50,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they have, like, Tetris and stuff.

1428
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:51,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they already have some minis out there?

1429
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:53,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Tetris is supposed to be one of the minis.

1430
01:56:54,691 --> 01:57:02,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard, by the way, that there was somebody was, I was trying to get them to tweet us about it because I didn't have a story on it, but I heard about it, that there's like a new Tetris in development right now.

1431
01:57:02,861 --> 01:57:04,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the Nintendo one, but like a new Tetris.

1432
01:57:04,683 --> 01:57:06,045
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one for the DS, I think.

1433
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:06,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the Wii.

1434
01:57:06,946 --> 01:57:09,429
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there's a different one even outside of that, but yeah.

1435
01:57:11,932 --> 01:57:14,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it now going to have like more blocks?

1436
01:57:16,283 --> 01:57:17,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Tetris, now with more blocks.

1437
01:57:17,724 --> 01:57:19,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Tetromino is made out of five cubes instead.

1438
01:57:20,106 --> 01:57:23,528
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I imagine it's probably more competitive in internet things.

1439
01:57:23,928 --> 01:57:27,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure there's some people out there that are like, how many times can you do Tetris?

1440
01:57:27,671 --> 01:57:28,271
[SPEAKER_14]: A million.

1441
01:57:28,331 --> 01:57:29,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Realistically, yes, you can.

1442
01:57:33,014 --> 01:57:34,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at Tetris DS.

1443
01:57:34,274 --> 01:57:36,335
[SPEAKER_14]: That was an awesome version of Tetris.

1444
01:57:36,695 --> 01:57:43,997
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, one series they've managed to re-release several times and actually do a pretty good job with every time is Tetris.

1445
01:57:44,337 --> 01:57:56,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, if you look at the original PC game, then you look at the NES Tetris, even Tenjin Tetris versus Nintendo Tetris, and then Game Boy Tetris with its whole link play was revolutionary.

1446
01:57:56,481 --> 01:57:58,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Nintendo DS is awesome.

1447
01:57:58,241 --> 01:58:00,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Tetris is kind of...

1448
01:58:01,082 --> 01:58:04,423
[SPEAKER_14]: actually one game that they've done right many, many times.

1449
01:58:05,003 --> 01:58:13,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to say it's been perfect, because there was a Tetris on the PlayStation by Jellico, I think it was, Tetris Plus, that was awful.

1450
01:58:14,486 --> 01:58:16,146
[SPEAKER_14]: It was an awful, awful game.

1451
01:58:16,766 --> 01:58:17,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just kind of interesting.

1452
01:58:17,687 --> 01:58:18,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Agreed.

1453
01:58:18,547 --> 01:58:23,208
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of interesting that you can take a game that's essentially the same and do it so many different ways.

1454
01:58:23,528 --> 01:58:27,949
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes it's very, very good, like Tetris DS, and sometimes it's very, very sad, like Tetris PlayStation.

1455
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:29,690
[SPEAKER_13]: So, anyhow.

1456
01:58:32,218 --> 01:58:32,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me move on.

1457
01:58:32,818 --> 01:58:35,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean to get into a different topic, but I did.

1458
01:58:35,659 --> 01:58:47,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk about Silent Hill Homecoming, which was the fifth game in the series, even though it didn't carry the number five on it, and was somewhat razzed here in the States because it was by an American developer and so forth.

1459
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:51,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the game was set to make its way to Japan, but guess what?

1460
01:58:51,502 --> 01:58:53,042
[SPEAKER_14]: The website was updated this week.

1461
01:58:53,342 --> 01:58:56,103
[SPEAKER_14]: The Japanese Silent Hill Homecoming website was updated to say...

1462
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:58,385
[SPEAKER_14]: The game has been cancelled.

1463
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:01,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Silent Hill Homecoming will not be out in Japan.

1464
01:59:01,928 --> 01:59:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: No reason was given for the decision.

1465
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:08,875
[SPEAKER_14]: It just said on the website, simply, quote, Please look forward to future titles in the series.

1466
01:59:10,357 --> 01:59:17,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of interesting that this game was developed in the West, took some shit for that, and now the Japanese aren't even going to release it at all.

1467
01:59:18,795 --> 01:59:19,695
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1468
01:59:41,335 --> 01:59:46,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the reviews that it got here, though, that's really not very surprising.

1469
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:55,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest complaint about it was that it didn't have the same kind of scare factor that appealed to Japanese players.

1470
01:59:55,908 --> 01:59:58,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the same type of scary game.

1471
01:59:59,631 --> 02:00:00,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think the game was terrible.

1472
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:01,473
[SPEAKER_14]: It was different.

1473
02:00:01,573 --> 02:00:02,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I also like Silent Hill 4.

1474
02:00:02,373 --> 02:00:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say it was bad, but I'm saying that it wasn't what was up to snuff for that series.

1475
02:00:10,242 --> 02:00:10,963
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just interesting.

1476
02:00:12,263 --> 02:00:14,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if that's because of sales figures here.

1477
02:00:14,384 --> 02:00:16,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if that game just didn't sell well here.

1478
02:00:16,465 --> 02:00:19,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, Loki, from your inside perspective, I don't know if you would know this.

1479
02:00:19,386 --> 02:00:20,446
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't sell that well here.

1480
02:00:20,926 --> 02:00:22,547
[SPEAKER_12]: It sold well in the beginning, but that's it.

1481
02:00:22,687 --> 02:00:25,148
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not something that's constantly being reordered or anything.

1482
02:00:25,368 --> 02:00:26,309
[SPEAKER_14]: That's too bad.

1483
02:00:28,789 --> 02:00:40,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's get into tonight's mailbag, a part of the show where you can interact with us by sending us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura is going to dive in headfirst into the mailbag and find some emails to read for us.

1484
02:00:42,228 --> 02:00:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

1485
02:00:43,049 --> 02:00:43,709
[SPEAKER_14]: You are.

1486
02:00:44,109 --> 02:00:44,730
[SPEAKER_14]: You is.

1487
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I is.

1488
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:46,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1489
02:00:47,171 --> 02:00:49,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Greetings, Rob, Loki, DarkSakura.

1490
02:00:49,413 --> 02:00:50,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the dilemma.

1491
02:00:50,193 --> 02:01:01,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hardcore PC gamer and want a PS3, but can't justify buying one because any of the games I like for it I can buy for the PC and play with better graphics cheaper and less hassle.

1492
02:01:01,541 --> 02:01:04,403
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the idea of having one if only for Gran Turismo and Blu-ray.

1493
02:01:04,723 --> 02:01:11,067
[SPEAKER_03]: To get a system, I would have to buy an HDTV, which is expensive, and I don't know whether I should wait for the 3D TVs.

1494
02:01:13,309 --> 02:01:32,684
[SPEAKER_03]: so many questions in a little time are there any good PS3 exclusives that would justify me buying this system and should I wait for 3D TVs also, how do I vote for your show without going through iTunes, I hate Apple the turtle wait, just wait and you can get a Blu-ray player for your PC so wait, they're getting cheaper

1495
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:45,724
[SPEAKER_14]: The one thing that I kind of have to say on this though is that, you know, one thing to consider and has always kind of been a drawback of PC gaming is that you have to constantly upgrade your PC.

1496
02:01:46,325 --> 02:01:53,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And I realize there's PC gaming fans that are going to hate me for kind of calling that out a little bit because there's a lot of people that do spend the kind of money to keep on tip-top shape.

1497
02:01:54,213 --> 02:01:56,756
[SPEAKER_14]: But the nice thing about console games is that...

1498
02:01:57,617 --> 02:02:00,539
[SPEAKER_14]: The metrics are already established on console games.

1499
02:02:00,739 --> 02:02:06,882
[SPEAKER_14]: And that, you know, the game is always going to play the way it was meant to be played on a certain console.

1500
02:02:06,902 --> 02:02:11,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas on the PC, sometimes you have to deal with frame rate issues and so forth if your PC is not up to par.

1501
02:02:11,624 --> 02:02:15,686
[SPEAKER_14]: But it sounds like you are an established PC gamer and you have a lot of games on PC.

1502
02:02:15,726 --> 02:02:17,287
[SPEAKER_14]: You probably have a top of the line computer.

1503
02:02:17,887 --> 02:02:18,968
[SPEAKER_14]: You may have hit the nail on the head.

1504
02:02:19,408 --> 02:02:22,010
[SPEAKER_14]: If every game you want to play is coming out on PC...

1505
02:02:23,151 --> 02:02:23,651
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1506
02:02:48,157 --> 02:02:51,181
[SPEAKER_14]: The only other thing I do want to say though, Sony exclusives, keep that in mind.

1507
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:55,185
[SPEAKER_14]: There are certain games that will not come out on the PC, period.

1508
02:02:55,385 --> 02:02:58,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Games like LittleBigPlanet, which are pretty awesome, I gotta say.

1509
02:02:58,449 --> 02:03:01,132
[SPEAKER_14]: MAG, the Mod Nation Racers.

1510
02:03:01,232 --> 02:03:06,398
[SPEAKER_14]: These games are not going to ever come out on PC because they're made by Sony and they want you to have a PlayStation to play it on.

1511
02:03:07,379 --> 02:03:24,455
[SPEAKER_14]: so if those games are worth it to you then you're going to have to take the plunge but if the types of games you're getting are Batman Arkham Asylum Call of Duty and the games that do come out on PC then you might be right you don't need a Playstation 3 so don't spend money on one um

1512
02:03:25,894 --> 02:03:32,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I personally just love the controls and sitting on my couch and all that, you know, but that's, I realize it's not for everybody.

1513
02:03:32,136 --> 02:03:33,576
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, that's why we have choices.

1514
02:03:34,056 --> 02:03:39,118
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as the other part of your question about iTunes and you want to leave a review that is not on an Apple place, that's fine.

1515
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:41,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We always ask, look, just tell a friend about the show.

1516
02:03:41,999 --> 02:03:43,299
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't even have to leave a review.

1517
02:03:43,799 --> 02:03:45,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are other places that take them.

1518
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know of any other big, big site.

1519
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:51,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I know of one called Podcast Alley that has some reviews like podcastalley.com.

1520
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:52,922
[SPEAKER_14]: You can always use that or dig.com.

1521
02:03:53,522 --> 02:03:54,323
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1522
02:04:09,722 --> 02:04:12,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ban you so that you can never download this show and listen to it again.

1523
02:04:13,323 --> 02:04:19,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that I can't take criticism of the show, but this person is probably jacking off right now to listening to me talk about them on the air.

1524
02:04:20,024 --> 02:04:25,965
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why you would write a negative review of a show over and over again that says nothing constructive about the show.

1525
02:04:26,385 --> 02:04:29,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So if this is you, I want you to know you're banned from this program.

1526
02:04:29,246 --> 02:04:34,327
[SPEAKER_14]: We do this for free out of our spare time because we like to do it.

1527
02:04:34,807 --> 02:04:35,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1528
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:51,274
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1529
02:05:08,382 --> 02:05:30,874
[SPEAKER_14]: when we need to be critical and especially tonight we've barely had any Microsoft news and maybe a little bit of Sony news so it's kind of unfortunate because that person clearly based their review off one episode of the show I'm not mad at that person I just wish they would have tried a little more before writing that but I'm not going to say oh I'm going to ban you because you don't like the show that's ridiculous but if you're trolling that's the difference that other guy needs to go get fucked

1530
02:05:31,823 --> 02:05:34,304
[SPEAKER_14]: and I wish... More people need to report that to Apple too.

1531
02:05:34,344 --> 02:05:34,925
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I did.

1532
02:05:34,985 --> 02:05:38,226
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully... I hate that you can't review reviewers.

1533
02:05:38,707 --> 02:05:39,467
[SPEAKER_14]: You kind of can.

1534
02:05:39,787 --> 02:05:41,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You can put, was this review helpful?

1535
02:05:41,328 --> 02:05:42,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just click no all the time.

1536
02:05:42,729 --> 02:05:49,593
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is when he rewrites a new review complaining about something in the show this week that didn't even happen, then...

1537
02:05:50,788 --> 02:05:51,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It just gets rewritten.

1538
02:05:52,209 --> 02:05:53,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So, there you go.

1539
02:05:55,431 --> 02:05:57,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm looking at chat.org.com.

1540
02:05:58,313 --> 02:06:00,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft says, SkyRant and FU is incoming.

1541
02:06:00,615 --> 02:06:01,455
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not yet.

1542
02:06:02,296 --> 02:06:02,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet.

1543
02:06:03,436 --> 02:06:08,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Ssh100Matt says, The Troll is a former All Games listener that one-stars every show, including Bobby's.

1544
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,001
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy needs to go get fucked.

1545
02:06:10,601 --> 02:06:20,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And like I said, he's probably jacking off right now because I'm talking about him on the air and he got the attention he looked for, so I'm going to stop talking about him and just hope that a meteor falls on his head.

1546
02:06:21,709 --> 02:06:22,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Next email, please.

1547
02:06:23,470 --> 02:06:23,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1548
02:06:26,813 --> 02:06:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1549
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:35,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I guess this was sent out to multiple people, but I'm going to use the part that's addressed to us.

1550
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're thinking.

1551
02:06:37,721 --> 02:06:41,504
[SPEAKER_03]: DS Lover, the person who despises 360, wants one.

1552
02:06:42,365 --> 02:06:43,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read this.

1553
02:06:45,367 --> 02:06:49,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is the grammar... Okay, almost no...

1554
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:51,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go read it if you need somebody.

1555
02:06:52,378 --> 02:06:53,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I have bad grammar.

1556
02:06:53,298 --> 02:06:53,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand it.

1557
02:06:53,839 --> 02:06:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Rob, it's not just that.

1558
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:58,542
[SPEAKER_03]: They hardly use any punctuation, so it's hard for me to get phrasing on this.

1559
02:06:58,863 --> 02:06:59,523
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, just go slow.

1560
02:07:02,786 --> 02:07:03,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh.

1561
02:07:05,242 --> 02:07:10,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, if you were wondering why, here's the things that pushed me over the edge.

1562
02:07:10,983 --> 02:07:14,624
[SPEAKER_03]: During my Boy Scout, oh, that's it, you're a Boy Scout, you know, funded by the Mormons.

1563
02:07:15,284 --> 02:07:25,386
[SPEAKER_03]: During a Boy Scout Troops holiday party where we stay up all night playing games, I saw one of my friends playing Guitar Hero 2, and we played over 13 songs, then we played Thunder Horse.

1564
02:07:25,786 --> 02:07:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you use a hyphen in a song that doesn't even have a hyphen in the name.

1565
02:07:29,927 --> 02:07:38,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then at the end of the song, I saw an achievement unlocked, and then I saw another one of my friends playing Burnout Revenge after he left his 360 in my hands.

1566
02:07:38,192 --> 02:07:54,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I plugged in my MP3 player to the 360 and started using my own music like Dragon Force and Anthrax while doing takedowns and crash events made my eyes open, and especially when I started playing with my friend online communication, flawless, comma, finally, compared to the PS... It doesn't even...

1567
02:07:55,462 --> 02:07:56,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Need a comma.

1568
02:07:56,143 --> 02:07:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1569
02:07:56,803 --> 02:07:59,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to the PS3, it can suck my balls, Sony.

1570
02:07:59,146 --> 02:08:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't buying your stupid PS3.

1571
02:08:00,667 --> 02:08:01,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1572
02:08:02,089 --> 02:08:09,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I need some recommendations on games and accessories to buy with my system, and I'm needing one on should I buy it used or new.

1573
02:08:09,175 --> 02:08:10,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting for a price drop on 360.

1574
02:08:11,318 --> 02:08:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Comma.

1575
02:08:11,898 --> 02:08:12,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't need to be there.

1576
02:08:13,059 --> 02:08:17,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering which W-I-T-C-H, by the way, configuration I should start off with.

1577
02:08:17,283 --> 02:08:18,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, DSLoverPS.

1578
02:08:18,885 --> 02:08:19,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the shows rocking.

1579
02:08:21,872 --> 02:08:22,573
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1580
02:08:42,249 --> 02:08:44,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what type of games to recommend when I don't know what type of games you like.

1581
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:46,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he say what type of games he likes to play?

1582
02:08:46,372 --> 02:08:46,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero 2?

1583
02:08:46,853 --> 02:08:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1584
02:08:47,933 --> 02:08:48,234
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1585
02:08:48,274 --> 02:08:49,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Get Rock Band Beatles?

1586
02:08:49,214 --> 02:08:49,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero 3?

1587
02:08:50,315 --> 02:08:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: What game has takedowns in it?

1588
02:08:54,018 --> 02:08:54,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Madden?

1589
02:08:54,938 --> 02:08:55,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Burnout!

1590
02:08:55,579 --> 02:08:58,201
[SPEAKER_14]: He said Burnout Paradise.

1591
02:08:58,641 --> 02:09:02,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Burnout Paradise and Split Seconds is going to be very cool when that comes out.

1592
02:09:02,744 --> 02:09:03,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Need for Speed?

1593
02:09:03,845 --> 02:09:04,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuel?

1594
02:09:04,265 --> 02:09:07,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked Fuel, even though a lot of people gave it kind of mediocre reviews.

1595
02:09:07,848 --> 02:09:07,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1596
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:09,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't know.

1597
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:14,211
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you say... See, when you say what PlayStation 3 game should I get, I go LittleBigPlanet.

1598
02:09:14,311 --> 02:09:15,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that game's amazing.

1599
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:18,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think everybody should... This person asked about Xbox 360.

1600
02:09:19,192 --> 02:09:19,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought they said PS3.

1601
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,032
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the previous one.

1602
02:09:21,352 --> 02:09:21,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1603
02:09:21,792 --> 02:09:23,332
[SPEAKER_14]: They want Xbox 360 games they should have?

1604
02:09:23,392 --> 02:09:27,013
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they want... They're thinking about getting an Xbox 360.

1605
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:28,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought they said PS3 at the end.

1606
02:09:28,953 --> 02:09:33,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know... I want to know which version of the Xbox 360 to get.

1607
02:09:34,574 --> 02:09:38,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the last one that asked about what PS3 games were exclusive and what to buy.

1608
02:09:40,424 --> 02:09:42,306
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to find one that matches what needs.

1609
02:09:42,326 --> 02:09:45,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have an HDTV that can benefit from HDMI?

1610
02:09:45,808 --> 02:09:51,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have, you know, I don't think you need all the frills, but I think you do need a hard drive.

1611
02:09:51,393 --> 02:09:52,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wouldn't get the one that doesn't come with a hard drive.

1612
02:09:52,914 --> 02:09:55,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you need to stop thinking about an Xbox 360.

1613
02:09:55,496 --> 02:09:58,318
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to sell your DS and you need to freaking hire a tutor.

1614
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:01,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1615
02:10:02,422 --> 02:10:05,344
[SPEAKER_14]: If you would like DarkSakura to criticize your emails, please send us an email.

1616
02:10:05,384 --> 02:10:07,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1617
02:10:08,223 --> 02:10:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Deathwishing Beatles Rock Band Beatles

1618
02:10:24,296 --> 02:10:25,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Or pay for the new albums.

1619
02:10:25,076 --> 02:10:26,597
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite song by them is Here Comes the Sun.

1620
02:10:43,351 --> 02:10:43,951
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

1621
02:10:44,031 --> 02:10:54,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the part that makes Harmonix and the surviving Beatles and relatives of the deceased ones very happy is that it's like a whole new generation discovering the Beatles.

1622
02:10:54,334 --> 02:10:57,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what they would say to your email is, mission accomplished.

1623
02:10:58,316 --> 02:10:59,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very good thing.

1624
02:10:59,935 --> 02:11:04,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So congrats to you discovering your love for Beatles music.

1625
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:08,222
[SPEAKER_14]: I always kind of respect the Beatles.

1626
02:11:08,683 --> 02:11:15,129
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't love them or foam in the mouth about them or even really buy a lot of their albums, but I respect them.

1627
02:11:15,209 --> 02:11:17,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I really understand what they did for music and why they were so popular.

1628
02:11:18,552 --> 02:11:21,995
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm thinking that maybe playing this game will kind of open up the catalog.

1629
02:11:22,836 --> 02:11:25,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I also like the movie Across the Universe somewhat.

1630
02:11:25,858 --> 02:11:27,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I love that movie.

1631
02:11:27,058 --> 02:11:30,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't like the movie, but I liked the parts of the movie.

1632
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:31,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It had nice parts.

1633
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So you give it the Xanity rating?

1634
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:33,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

1635
02:11:34,301 --> 02:11:35,521
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a perfect comparison.

1636
02:11:35,561 --> 02:11:38,342
[SPEAKER_14]: It has nice parts, but the whole it adds up to is WTF.

1637
02:11:38,662 --> 02:11:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, therefore the Xanity rating.

1638
02:11:41,083 --> 02:11:42,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually love the whole movie.

1639
02:11:44,624 --> 02:11:46,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say something else too.

1640
02:11:46,224 --> 02:11:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had to say you had a favorite song by them, Rob, what would it be?

1641
02:11:50,447 --> 02:11:51,408
[SPEAKER_14]: William Shatner version?

1642
02:11:51,688 --> 02:11:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1643
02:11:51,949 --> 02:11:53,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like Strawberry Fields Forever.

1644
02:12:10,127 --> 02:12:13,828
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been to Strawberry Fields and it's beautiful in New York City where the Imagine Memorial is.

1645
02:12:14,148 --> 02:12:16,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think Strawberry Fields forever.

1646
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:20,129
[SPEAKER_14]: And it does make me think of that scene in Across the Universe, which I think is one of the better scenes in the movie.

1647
02:12:20,449 --> 02:12:22,090
[SPEAKER_03]: That seriously is my favorite scene in the movie.

1648
02:12:22,270 --> 02:12:24,570
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say that's definitely one of my top songs.

1649
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:27,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I met the guy that was in the movie.

1650
02:12:27,751 --> 02:12:28,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, really?

1651
02:12:28,211 --> 02:12:28,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I got his autograph.

1652
02:12:29,091 --> 02:12:29,511
[SPEAKER_12]: How random.

1653
02:12:29,911 --> 02:12:30,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1654
02:12:30,251 --> 02:12:30,611
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1655
02:12:30,671 --> 02:12:31,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, do you have a favorite song?

1656
02:12:32,412 --> 02:12:32,792
[SPEAKER_12]: In what?

1657
02:12:32,812 --> 02:12:33,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Across the Universe?

1658
02:12:33,612 --> 02:12:34,112
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Beatles.

1659
02:12:34,292 --> 02:12:35,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Beatles song in general.

1660
02:12:36,012 --> 02:12:36,132
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1661
02:12:37,073 --> 02:12:38,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Strawberry Fields isn't in the rock band, is it?

1662
02:12:40,866 --> 02:12:41,067
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1663
02:12:41,747 --> 02:12:42,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be.

1664
02:12:44,309 --> 02:12:54,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I did want to say, though, probably my favorite, favorite song of the Beatles as a, not just the band itself, but all the members, was Imagine by John Lennon.

1665
02:12:55,175 --> 02:13:01,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that is a song that will live on forever, and it rightfully should.

1666
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:06,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think that song, to me, even transcends anything the Beatles ever did.

1667
02:13:07,574 --> 02:13:07,974
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1668
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:46,003
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, less Sims, more show, please.

1669
02:13:47,445 --> 02:13:50,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do both at the same time, and you are totally not one to talk, okay?

1670
02:13:50,969 --> 02:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Addict.

1671
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:54,994
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, I can text message and drive at the same time, so she can play Sims.

1672
02:13:55,134 --> 02:13:55,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob.

1673
02:13:57,068 --> 02:13:58,129
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw the video, didn't you?

1674
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I saw the video.

1675
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:00,091
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fantastic.

1676
02:14:00,391 --> 02:14:01,652
[SPEAKER_14]: It was stupid.

1677
02:14:01,812 --> 02:14:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

1678
02:14:02,533 --> 02:14:05,235
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the most over-the-top thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

1679
02:14:05,275 --> 02:14:06,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but it was gorgeous.

1680
02:14:06,496 --> 02:14:07,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the gore.

1681
02:14:07,637 --> 02:14:12,761
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been to the Rocky Horror Picture Show 300 times, and that text messaging crash video was the most over-the-top thing.

1682
02:14:12,781 --> 02:14:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, my Sim is drowning!

1683
02:14:13,602 --> 02:14:14,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, shut up.

1684
02:14:14,883 --> 02:14:16,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Why'd you build a wall around the pool?

1685
02:14:16,524 --> 02:14:17,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So that he couldn't get out.

1686
02:14:18,344 --> 02:14:19,744
[SPEAKER_14]: You're killing your dick, Sim.

1687
02:14:19,844 --> 02:14:20,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

1688
02:14:20,585 --> 02:14:26,026
[SPEAKER_12]: So Sims and The Sims 3 have learned that they can pull themselves out of the pool without the ladder?

1689
02:14:26,186 --> 02:14:26,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1690
02:14:26,806 --> 02:14:27,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it!

1691
02:14:28,086 --> 02:14:29,506
[SPEAKER_12]: They're always getting smarter.

1692
02:14:29,526 --> 02:14:30,947
[SPEAKER_12]: She built walls around the pool.

1693
02:14:31,667 --> 02:14:32,487
[SPEAKER_12]: As you should.

1694
02:14:33,147 --> 02:14:40,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't put a fence around him, but what I could do is the move objects on, and then I put the little sign, neighborhood sign.

1695
02:14:40,689 --> 02:14:42,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you douse him with gasoline?

1696
02:14:42,609 --> 02:14:42,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1697
02:14:42,749 --> 02:14:44,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, can we get to the FUs of the week?

1698
02:14:44,409 --> 02:14:44,929
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

1699
02:14:45,069 --> 02:14:45,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1700
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1701
02:14:49,822 --> 02:14:53,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to, um, going back to work.

1702
02:14:54,663 --> 02:14:55,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki!

1703
02:14:57,224 --> 02:15:01,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, huh, I had something, and I don't remember what it was.

1704
02:15:01,965 --> 02:15:08,547
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess F you to having a bunch of new locks for my arcade cabinet, but not any of the keys.

1705
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,168
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

1706
02:15:12,408 --> 02:15:14,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.

1707
02:15:14,409 --> 02:15:18,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I've actually been in somewhat of a good mood, so I don't know.

1708
02:15:19,812 --> 02:15:23,194
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to the fact that I'm not already at Disneyland, because that's where I'm going to be in a few days.

1709
02:15:23,274 --> 02:15:26,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so freaking excited I need to be there.

1710
02:15:27,836 --> 02:15:30,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, did Death show up to get your little... Yep.

1711
02:15:31,558 --> 02:15:32,699
[SPEAKER_14]: And Death can't get to the person?

1712
02:15:33,099 --> 02:15:34,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Death can do anything.

1713
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:35,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyhow.

1714
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:35,880
[SPEAKER_14]: He's dead!

1715
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,001
[SPEAKER_14]: See how Sims is derailing the show?

1716
02:15:38,141 --> 02:15:41,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you need to drown Death in a pool too, because that'd be ironic.

1717
02:15:43,484 --> 02:15:44,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to games, Loki

1718
02:16:09,256 --> 02:16:18,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Bethesda has the rights to Fallout right now, and Interplay infringed on its trademark.

1719
02:16:22,087 --> 02:16:27,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised if we did see a Fallout MMO that it wouldn't be coming from Bethesda.

1720
02:16:27,372 --> 02:16:29,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I would think that would be right up their alley.

1721
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:38,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Bethesda's got to be working on some MMO right now, but it's probably in the Elder Scrolls universe, not Fallout.

1722
02:16:39,135 --> 02:16:39,976
[SPEAKER_14]: But who knows?

1723
02:16:40,036 --> 02:16:40,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything's possible.

1724
02:16:40,796 --> 02:16:42,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, both those games are huge.

1725
02:16:42,258 --> 02:16:43,138
[SPEAKER_14]: How about combining them?

1726
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:47,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Nuclear Holocaust in the medieval times?

1727
02:16:47,662 --> 02:16:53,186
[SPEAKER_14]: A nuclear holocaust hits the world of... What's the name of the world that Elder Scrolls is set in?

1728
02:16:53,266 --> 02:16:53,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember.

1729
02:16:54,146 --> 02:16:55,167
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's what we need.

1730
02:16:55,187 --> 02:16:57,949
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a crossover game of the two, and it's an MMO.

1731
02:16:58,430 --> 02:16:58,810
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1732
02:17:00,535 --> 02:17:06,162
[SPEAKER_12]: or that they've turned nomadic and they're back now to medieval technology.

1733
02:17:07,268 --> 02:17:08,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I still haven't played Fallout 3.

1734
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:11,892
[SPEAKER_14]: It's oblivion with guns.

1735
02:17:11,932 --> 02:17:15,235
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how I wouldn't like this game, but I just somehow haven't played it.

1736
02:17:15,335 --> 02:17:16,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm too addicted to Warcraft.

1737
02:17:16,556 --> 02:17:18,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I have Fallout 3 and I've still not played it.

1738
02:17:18,958 --> 02:17:21,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I also have Left 4 Dead and still have not played it.

1739
02:17:21,059 --> 02:17:23,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I borrow your Fallout 3 if you're not going to play it?

1740
02:17:24,022 --> 02:17:24,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout 3 is pretty cool.

1741
02:17:25,283 --> 02:17:25,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

1742
02:17:25,823 --> 02:17:31,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Becky's husband was playing quite a bit of it and it just looks really cool.

1743
02:17:31,428 --> 02:17:31,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1744
02:17:32,108 --> 02:17:33,728
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've never heard anything but good things about it.

1745
02:17:33,768 --> 02:17:35,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And even when I've watched it, it looks like a lot of fun.

1746
02:17:35,889 --> 02:17:41,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, just remember, guys, I don't have time to play every game, especially when you're addicted to an MMO.

1747
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:42,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, no, I take that back.

1748
02:17:42,771 --> 02:17:44,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I did sell it already.

1749
02:17:44,591 --> 02:17:44,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

1750
02:17:45,371 --> 02:17:48,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't have a lot of games anymore.

1751
02:17:49,553 --> 02:17:51,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, you unloaded all your games?

1752
02:17:51,533 --> 02:17:51,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1753
02:17:52,573 --> 02:17:53,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Different reasons.

1754
02:17:54,914 --> 02:17:57,395
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, do you think Bethesda has any ground to stand on with this?

1755
02:17:57,475 --> 02:17:59,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, do you think they'll win, Loki?

1756
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:01,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if they have the rights for it right now.

1757
02:18:01,101 --> 02:18:08,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know Interplay, I think, was the one that actually came out with the original Fallout, but I don't know.

1758
02:18:08,566 --> 02:18:17,492
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying that this has caused immediate, substantial, and irreparable harm, I guess.

1759
02:18:19,193 --> 02:18:19,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1760
02:18:20,634 --> 02:18:22,755
[SPEAKER_12]: It probably wasn't going to end up working out for them anyways.

1761
02:18:24,986 --> 02:18:31,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, I want to move on to one more story before we get to your phone calls tonight, and it has to do with the Nintendo Wii.

1762
02:18:31,529 --> 02:18:36,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, Nintendo is going to price drop the Wii.

1763
02:18:37,091 --> 02:18:42,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Rumor is that the Wii is going to get its price drop the first week of October, which makes sense, because the machine still costs $250.

1764
02:18:42,773 --> 02:18:45,854
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, isn't the Xbox 360 now $199?

1765
02:18:46,335 --> 02:18:46,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1766
02:18:47,255 --> 02:18:53,077
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, and it has been for a while, so I think the Wii is probably going to have to move to a price drop.

1767
02:18:53,097 --> 02:18:54,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Their sales have been kind of slowing down, too.

1768
02:18:54,838 --> 02:18:57,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, plus it's time to update the pack, too.

1769
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,701
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think it's inevitable.

1770
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:05,264
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to put Wii Motion Plus in it and Wii Sports Resort, I think, is what you're going to find in the new pack.

1771
02:19:05,505 --> 02:19:05,685
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

1772
02:19:05,965 --> 02:19:06,965
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's going to stay the same.

1773
02:19:07,846 --> 02:19:08,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

1774
02:19:08,406 --> 02:19:08,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it is.

1775
02:19:10,167 --> 02:19:11,648
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't think they'll bundle in an extra game?

1776
02:19:12,189 --> 02:19:14,490
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because you can't get Wii Sports by itself.

1777
02:19:16,671 --> 02:19:19,073
[SPEAKER_14]: What about a Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort bundle?

1778
02:19:19,113 --> 02:19:20,654
[SPEAKER_14]: What about it comes with Wii Sports?

1779
02:19:21,474 --> 02:19:23,716
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because that would impact their sales of Wii Sports Resort.

1780
02:19:24,292 --> 02:19:24,572
Really?

1781
02:19:24,893 --> 02:19:25,033
Yeah.

1782
02:19:25,433 --> 02:19:25,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1783
02:19:26,875 --> 02:19:27,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll see.

1784
02:19:27,936 --> 02:19:33,742
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, the rumor comes from an early version of a Walmart ad, but apparently it is coming soon.

1785
02:19:33,902 --> 02:19:35,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see the exact price, though.

1786
02:19:35,964 --> 02:19:38,647
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just apparently the ad says that it's coming.

1787
02:19:39,468 --> 02:19:41,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't know exactly what the new price is.

1788
02:19:42,271 --> 02:19:42,552
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

1789
02:19:43,901 --> 02:20:10,946
[SPEAKER_14]: now Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show but they will be participating in a thing called Kyoto Cross Media Experience 2009 but that's at the end of September September 26th to October 4th so if they're going to announce a price drop that's when it's kind of expected to happen because Nintendo never does Tokyo Game Show I don't know what, I don't remember the reason behind it but they just don't they kind of do their own media thing in Japan so very interesting

1790
02:20:12,605 --> 02:20:17,106
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if there will be a fitness thing, like maybe the original Wii Fit or something.

1791
02:20:17,146 --> 02:20:17,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1792
02:20:17,526 --> 02:20:19,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, Loki seems to think it won't cut in.

1793
02:20:19,207 --> 02:20:22,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Because then you'd have to throw in the Wii Fit balance board.

1794
02:20:22,988 --> 02:20:25,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could see maybe some holiday bundles.

1795
02:20:26,029 --> 02:20:32,790
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're going to do anything, what they're going to do is some crappy holiday bundle later on that it's going to have new Super Mario Bros.

1796
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:34,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii bundled in it, and maybe that's it.

1797
02:20:35,171 --> 02:20:35,391
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

1798
02:20:36,238 --> 02:20:37,638
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of wish, I was just thinking the other day

1799
02:21:00,919 --> 02:21:01,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Mario Bros.

1800
02:21:01,639 --> 02:21:02,280
[SPEAKER_14]: 4 Super Mario Bros. 4

1801
02:21:25,728 --> 02:21:29,389
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of does away with a lot of the changes to the Mario universe over time.

1802
02:21:29,409 --> 02:21:30,890
[SPEAKER_14]: That might be too difficult for Grand Moff.

1803
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:31,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1804
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:39,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I just live in this weird fanboy bubble, or I just miss the old school days of Nintendo, but it'd be kind of cool.

1805
02:21:41,161 --> 02:21:44,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I guess it's time for us to open up the Skype line.

1806
02:21:44,402 --> 02:21:45,422
[SPEAKER_14]: We're ready to take some calls.

1807
02:21:45,442 --> 02:21:49,063
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1808
02:21:49,463 --> 02:21:55,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like to give a comment on any topic that you've heard about tonight and we'll take some calls.

1809
02:21:56,285 --> 02:21:56,985
[SPEAKER_14]: See what's on your mind.

1810
02:21:57,825 --> 02:22:00,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio because we have a delay.

1811
02:22:00,666 --> 02:22:02,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, we're getting our first call.

1812
02:22:02,807 --> 02:22:03,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1813
02:22:03,707 --> 02:22:04,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1814
02:22:04,773 --> 02:22:05,373
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Link, Half Minute Hero

1815
02:22:22,779 --> 02:22:23,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 1, Dragon War 1

1816
02:22:36,192 --> 02:22:39,255
[SPEAKER_07]: from the time you start to get to the boss, to beat the boss.

1817
02:22:39,355 --> 02:22:44,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But in order to do this, you like really, it plays like basically you're playing the game and fast forward.

1818
02:22:44,679 --> 02:22:45,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard about this.

1819
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't this the one?

1820
02:22:46,381 --> 02:22:47,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't it switch genres too?

1821
02:22:47,802 --> 02:22:48,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Like every 30 seconds?

1822
02:22:49,043 --> 02:22:51,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember there's a demo for that out now.

1823
02:22:51,986 --> 02:22:52,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1824
02:22:52,506 --> 02:22:53,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that on PSP?

1825
02:22:53,667 --> 02:22:54,268
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming soon.

1826
02:22:55,766 --> 02:23:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's coming on, it's supposedly October 20th is the release date for it.

1827
02:23:01,128 --> 02:23:03,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that on PSP or PS3?

1828
02:23:04,189 --> 02:23:04,609
[SPEAKER_14]: PSP.

1829
02:23:05,169 --> 02:23:06,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I want to check that out.

1830
02:23:06,570 --> 02:23:14,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when we reported on that game and I was like, oh, it's kind of like WarioWare, but like, it sounds even cooler than, what was the WarioWare clone we got on PSP?

1831
02:23:14,692 --> 02:23:15,372
[SPEAKER_14]: WTF, right?

1832
02:23:15,773 --> 02:23:17,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though WTF was kind of funny.

1833
02:23:17,753 --> 02:23:18,653
[SPEAKER_14]: This sounds even cooler.

1834
02:23:18,733 --> 02:23:20,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I definitely want to check this out.

1835
02:23:20,174 --> 02:23:23,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So, did it feel like WarioWare to you, Xlink?

1836
02:23:23,115 --> 02:23:23,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it...

1837
02:23:23,615 --> 02:23:33,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, yeah, but it had more of a, when I played it, it had more of the role-playing type deal, so it's more like playing Final Fantasy 1 on fast-forward, like I said before, so it was really good, though.

1838
02:23:35,711 --> 02:23:36,571
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1839
02:23:56,616 --> 02:23:59,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Demo was cool enough for you to go pre-order the game?

1840
02:24:15,498 --> 02:24:15,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, definitely.

1841
02:24:15,958 --> 02:24:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I would definitely pre-order it.

1842
02:24:18,841 --> 02:24:20,182
[SPEAKER_07]: A big role-playing type thing.

1843
02:24:20,242 --> 02:24:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It had other elements I saw from the trailer, which really piqued my interest, like shootings and stuff like that, and summons.

1844
02:24:29,031 --> 02:24:30,052
[SPEAKER_14]: A successful demo.

1845
02:24:30,072 --> 02:24:34,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for calling me to tell me about it because I'm going to go put that in my queue to download my PSP.

1846
02:24:35,155 --> 02:24:36,175
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no problem.

1847
02:24:36,275 --> 02:24:48,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that I've learned how to get my PS3 and PSP to work together and I got a better memory card for my PSP, I'm all about checking out all the latest demos and so forth because I know I've been critical of the PSP as a gaming device, but there are some gems out there.

1848
02:24:48,562 --> 02:24:49,583
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some real gems out there.

1849
02:24:49,803 --> 02:24:53,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely, and I'm looking forward to 2% which comes out in about two weeks too.

1850
02:24:53,465 --> 02:24:55,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I already had that pre-ordered and paid for.

1851
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:56,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1852
02:24:56,747 --> 02:24:58,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

1853
02:24:59,028 --> 02:24:59,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, not really.

1854
02:24:59,889 --> 02:25:06,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been too busy doing my LiveJournal game, so I've been really trying to catch up back on the news here during the weekend.

1855
02:25:06,613 --> 02:25:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well good.

1856
02:25:08,475 --> 02:25:11,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what you're talking about, and I hope it's fun for you.

1857
02:25:11,737 --> 02:25:17,701
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I'm going to be talking about LiveJournal games on this show in a couple weeks, because I'm going to be hosting another one, and I want people to sign up and play.

1858
02:25:19,142 --> 02:25:26,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quickly, it was very unique the way some of you guys approached me and told me, oh, hey, if you like doing this kind of stuff, you might like doing this, so I signed up for it.

1859
02:25:26,829 --> 02:25:35,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very unique and very fun, and I got to meet a lot of new people through it, and if anybody hasn't done it or wants to do it, I suggest to do it.

1860
02:25:36,217 --> 02:25:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you more details in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1861
02:25:38,599 --> 02:25:40,121
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you so much, X-Links, for calling in.

1862
02:25:40,161 --> 02:25:40,721
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no problem.

1863
02:25:40,801 --> 02:25:41,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

1864
02:25:42,677 --> 02:25:49,338
[SPEAKER_14]: by the way, I just want to point out to everybody out there that was a perfect phone call that was a wonderful phone call because dude knew

1865
02:25:50,627 --> 02:25:52,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1866
02:25:52,668 --> 02:25:52,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1867
02:25:53,629 --> 02:25:54,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Ranma, the second guy.

1868
02:25:54,969 --> 02:25:55,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

1869
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:59,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you wanted to talk, but I just wanted to praise X-Link a little more here for that call.

1870
02:25:59,652 --> 02:26:03,854
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a perfect phone call because he knew exactly what he wanted to talk about.

1871
02:26:04,194 --> 02:26:06,255
[SPEAKER_14]: He kind of already had it lined out.

1872
02:26:06,335 --> 02:26:11,978
[SPEAKER_14]: He spoke very well, obviously tested his connection before, and just kind of laid it all out there.

1873
02:26:11,998 --> 02:26:15,640
[SPEAKER_14]: When I asked him if there was anything else, he kind of added a little more, and I just...

1874
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:16,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1875
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:18,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody take notes from that last call.

1876
02:26:18,922 --> 02:26:20,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

1877
02:26:20,483 --> 02:26:22,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Ranma, now you have to follow that.

1878
02:26:24,085 --> 02:26:25,846
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to say we get bad calls.

1879
02:26:25,886 --> 02:26:30,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying that if you want to know what I think a perfect phone call is, that last call was great.

1880
02:26:30,729 --> 02:26:31,970
[SPEAKER_14]: So now you have to follow it, Ranma.

1881
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:32,730
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind tonight?

1882
02:26:33,311 --> 02:26:34,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will do my best.

1883
02:26:34,952 --> 02:26:40,795
[SPEAKER_08]: But first off, me and Judea, we went to a classic gaming convention yesterday called GameCore.

1884
02:26:42,437 --> 02:26:43,197
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, I'm going to

1885
02:26:43,854 --> 02:26:45,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Post a link in the chat.

1886
02:26:45,775 --> 02:26:46,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes for great radio, doesn't it?

1887
02:26:47,355 --> 02:26:48,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, exactly.

1888
02:26:48,416 --> 02:26:48,936
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1889
02:26:48,976 --> 02:26:49,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgive you.

1890
02:26:50,316 --> 02:26:50,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1891
02:26:51,117 --> 02:26:54,858
[SPEAKER_08]: The pictures are on small and large size because it was a lot of stuff.

1892
02:26:55,198 --> 02:27:00,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I would call this convention like Jamie's Vault x6.

1893
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:02,420
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how much stuff was there.

1894
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:07,062
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a lot of classic arcade machines there that were for sale, such as

1895
02:27:07,418 --> 02:27:09,960
[SPEAKER_08]: The Simpsons arcade machine for like 400 bucks.

1896
02:27:10,060 --> 02:27:11,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I would have went home with that.

1897
02:27:12,182 --> 02:27:12,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously?

1898
02:27:13,223 --> 02:27:16,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though I'm supposed to be saving for a new car right now, I would have went home with that.

1899
02:27:16,485 --> 02:27:18,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, it was cash and carry.

1900
02:27:18,807 --> 02:27:19,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they really?

1901
02:27:19,668 --> 02:27:20,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1902
02:27:20,088 --> 02:27:22,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I should get an arcade machine for my house.

1903
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:23,010
[SPEAKER_12]: You should.

1904
02:27:23,070 --> 02:27:24,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't my roommate fucking love that?

1905
02:27:26,813 --> 02:27:27,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1906
02:27:27,274 --> 02:27:29,115
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, Ranma, I'm at your picture gallery.

1907
02:27:29,135 --> 02:27:30,296
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of broken pictures.

1908
02:27:30,977 --> 02:27:31,757
[SPEAKER_14]: You might want to check that out.

1909
02:27:31,817 --> 02:27:32,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's...

1910
02:27:33,098 --> 02:27:38,021
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an issue with the gallery software, but if you click on the broken link, the picture will actually show up.

1911
02:27:38,221 --> 02:27:38,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1912
02:27:38,801 --> 02:27:41,583
[SPEAKER_14]: I probably shouldn't look at them all during the show, but I am looking at some of these things.

1913
02:27:41,603 --> 02:27:45,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, I see some things that are reminiscent of Classic Gaming Expo, certainly.

1914
02:27:45,525 --> 02:27:47,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they have a lot of playable stuff out there?

1915
02:27:48,607 --> 02:27:49,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much they did.

1916
02:27:49,307 --> 02:27:50,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a lot of arcade machines.

1917
02:27:50,868 --> 02:27:56,151
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a row of Dreamcasts set up to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Sega Dreamcast.

1918
02:27:56,571 --> 02:27:59,353
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an actual Neo Geo MVS machine set up.

1919
02:27:59,413 --> 02:28:01,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the whole arcade unit, but the actual...

1920
02:28:01,792 --> 02:28:03,252
[SPEAKER_08]: console, and board, you know?

1921
02:28:04,513 --> 02:28:06,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an MVS board now.

1922
02:28:07,133 --> 02:28:07,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

1923
02:28:07,873 --> 02:28:11,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, what is up with everybody getting fucking Neo Geo MVS boards?

1924
02:28:11,274 --> 02:28:12,734
[SPEAKER_12]: You, Bobby, Jamie?

1925
02:28:12,874 --> 02:28:13,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, here's the thing.

1926
02:28:13,614 --> 02:28:27,357
[SPEAKER_12]: They threw it in with my cabinet because I was testing, to test my cabinet, they plugged an MVS board in there and they're like, okay, hey, you want this board for 60 bucks and I'll throw in this bootleg 48-in-1 cart with it.

1927
02:28:27,377 --> 02:28:28,537
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, what?

1928
02:28:28,577 --> 02:28:28,837
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1929
02:28:31,303 --> 02:28:32,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so uncool.

1930
02:28:33,164 --> 02:28:33,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to get one.

1931
02:28:34,965 --> 02:28:36,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to fit in with everybody else.

1932
02:28:36,666 --> 02:28:39,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to get a fucking Neo Geo now just so I can feel cool.

1933
02:28:40,028 --> 02:28:40,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Ranma.

1934
02:28:40,789 --> 02:28:41,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean to derail your call.

1935
02:28:42,049 --> 02:28:47,132
[SPEAKER_14]: See, this is an example of where the hosts derail your call, which happens.

1936
02:28:47,413 --> 02:28:48,933
[SPEAKER_14]: What town was this convention in again?

1937
02:28:49,854 --> 02:28:50,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Oaks, Pennsylvania.

1938
02:28:50,875 --> 02:28:53,116
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about 20 minutes outside of Philly.

1939
02:28:54,397 --> 02:28:59,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder, was it at like an actual classic gaming store or is there one like right nearby?

1940
02:29:01,095 --> 02:29:01,956
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1941
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:30,081
[SPEAKER_08]: MC Lars, YT Cracker, 8-Bit Brothers, Armadillo Tank

1942
02:29:51,206 --> 02:29:52,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you go to the concerts at all?

1943
02:29:52,867 --> 02:29:54,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to a couple of the concerts.

1944
02:29:54,708 --> 02:29:59,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I walked in on Super 8-Bit Brothers, and since I was dressed as Luigi, I got a lot of props and shoutouts.

1945
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:00,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

1946
02:30:02,711 --> 02:30:05,833
[SPEAKER_08]: There was actually a couple of classic cars there, such as the DeLorean and Kit.

1947
02:30:09,417 --> 02:30:11,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, sounds like you had a lot of fun at the convention.

1948
02:30:11,719 --> 02:30:14,903
[SPEAKER_14]: So is this something that travels or was it just at the one place?

1949
02:30:15,603 --> 02:30:16,745
[SPEAKER_08]: It was at this one place.

1950
02:30:16,885 --> 02:30:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking to some of the people that helped create it and they were seeing some ups and downs they had with it.

1951
02:30:22,791 --> 02:30:27,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're looking to do things a little bit differently for next year.

1952
02:30:28,857 --> 02:30:30,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I have a bit of a game review too.

1953
02:30:31,159 --> 02:30:31,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, please.

1954
02:30:32,401 --> 02:30:32,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1955
02:30:33,112 --> 02:30:37,674
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a company there called Storm City Games, independent publishing group.

1956
02:30:38,014 --> 02:30:41,955
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a game they were demoing out called Hands-On Tangrams.

1957
02:30:43,696 --> 02:30:46,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the tangrams we used to play with in junior high school?

1958
02:30:46,657 --> 02:30:48,597
[SPEAKER_14]: That game came out a long time ago.

1959
02:30:50,078 --> 02:30:50,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1960
02:30:51,358 --> 02:30:52,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, how was it?

1961
02:30:52,539 --> 02:30:54,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you get your tangram on?

1962
02:30:54,659 --> 02:30:57,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did, and for $20, I think it was well worth it.

1963
02:30:57,660 --> 02:31:02,062
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a perfect time waster if you need to kill 10-20 minutes while you're waiting for something.

1964
02:31:02,574 --> 02:31:04,074
[SPEAKER_12]: I came out back in spring.

1965
02:31:05,155 --> 02:31:06,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Debbie Downer.

1966
02:31:06,555 --> 02:31:07,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Hands on tangrams.

1967
02:31:07,975 --> 02:31:12,136
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they had the demo and this is actually coming out October.

1968
02:31:12,296 --> 02:31:14,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's a new platform or a new version.

1969
02:31:14,417 --> 02:31:14,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1970
02:31:14,857 --> 02:31:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's what's going on.

1971
02:31:16,257 --> 02:31:16,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably so.

1972
02:31:17,417 --> 02:31:20,638
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but I'm glad you had fun at the convention.

1973
02:31:20,718 --> 02:31:21,318
[SPEAKER_14]: One more thing.

1974
02:31:21,338 --> 02:31:21,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

1975
02:31:21,998 --> 02:31:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we talk to Jamie for one quick second, please?

1976
02:31:24,119 --> 02:31:24,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose.

1977
02:31:25,059 --> 02:31:25,339
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1978
02:31:25,599 --> 02:31:25,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1979
02:31:25,999 --> 02:31:26,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1980
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:29,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1981
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:29,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1982
02:31:30,868 --> 02:31:31,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1983
02:31:31,608 --> 02:31:32,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1984
02:31:33,149 --> 02:31:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: While we were there, they were actually doing viewings for Nerdcore Rising, which is the film by MC Frontalot.

1985
02:31:42,571 --> 02:31:42,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1986
02:31:43,611 --> 02:31:46,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were actually giving a couple of them out.

1987
02:31:47,672 --> 02:31:52,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I had asked Rama to go up there and see if he could win one, and he did.

1988
02:31:54,073 --> 02:31:56,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be giving it to you, Jamie.

1989
02:31:56,534 --> 02:31:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1990
02:31:56,794 --> 02:31:57,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1991
02:31:57,574 --> 02:31:57,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1992
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:06,162
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a copy of Nerdcore Rising, and if you open it up on the DVD itself, it is signed by MC Frontalot.

1993
02:32:06,482 --> 02:32:07,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is so cool!

1994
02:32:08,562 --> 02:32:10,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says Win Win Win on there.

1995
02:32:11,083 --> 02:32:15,445
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know exactly who wrote that on the DVD, but we think it was Lars.

1996
02:32:15,885 --> 02:32:16,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet!

1997
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:19,921
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not exactly sure, but yeah, just wanted to let you know that.

1998
02:32:20,061 --> 02:32:21,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And who is this on the phone right now?

1999
02:32:21,962 --> 02:32:23,642
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be Giove Day, Patty.

2000
02:32:24,063 --> 02:32:25,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, well, welcome to the show.

2001
02:32:25,423 --> 02:32:28,444
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you've ever called in before, but what a great first call.

2002
02:32:28,504 --> 02:32:31,045
[SPEAKER_14]: We like when new people on the show give stuff away.

2003
02:32:31,065 --> 02:32:32,306
[SPEAKER_14]: She's talked before on the show.

2004
02:32:32,406 --> 02:32:33,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember her talking.

2005
02:32:33,466 --> 02:32:35,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I know she's been in chat and Twitter and all that.

2006
02:32:35,607 --> 02:32:39,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but she's called in like a couple times with Ranma before.

2007
02:32:39,848 --> 02:32:40,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's awesome.

2008
02:32:40,909 --> 02:32:41,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so cool.

2009
02:32:41,389 --> 02:32:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to deliver it to me in person.

2010
02:32:45,226 --> 02:32:45,727
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

2011
02:33:11,089 --> 02:33:11,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're great people.

2012
02:33:12,069 --> 02:33:13,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And how did you like the con, Giovedeo?

2013
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,510
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you like it?

2014
02:33:15,271 --> 02:33:16,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot.

2015
02:33:16,271 --> 02:33:20,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really big into loud, crazy conventions.

2016
02:33:20,413 --> 02:33:20,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.

2017
02:33:20,993 --> 02:33:21,653
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mellow.

2018
02:33:22,114 --> 02:33:25,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was enough stuff there to do that you didn't feel that you were bored.

2019
02:33:26,516 --> 02:33:26,836
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2020
02:33:27,736 --> 02:33:28,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

2021
02:33:28,176 --> 02:33:32,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And any favorite classic game that you discovered or something that you played that you really enjoyed?

2022
02:33:33,601 --> 02:33:45,744
[SPEAKER_01]: now I was actually in the booth most of the time chatting with the guy next to us who was selling all the D&D stuff and he sold me D&D dice for two bucks so that made me happy cool

2023
02:33:46,178 --> 02:33:47,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, nerds need their dice.

2024
02:33:47,858 --> 02:33:48,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.

2025
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:49,799
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2026
02:33:50,099 --> 02:33:53,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to let you go so we can roll the dice on another phone call.

2027
02:33:53,099 --> 02:33:54,200
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you so much, you guys.

2028
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:56,360
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like an awesome present and you guys didn't have to do that.

2029
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:59,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know DarkSakura is bouncing as she's playing The Sims.

2030
02:34:00,081 --> 02:34:03,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm bouncing in like most of my parts.

2031
02:34:03,141 --> 02:34:04,182
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quivering with joy.

2032
02:34:04,342 --> 02:34:04,642
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2033
02:34:06,162 --> 02:34:08,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Before this gets dirty, I'm going to have to let you go.

2034
02:34:09,223 --> 02:34:09,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Night, guys.

2035
02:34:09,723 --> 02:34:09,963
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2036
02:34:09,983 --> 02:34:10,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

2037
02:34:12,042 --> 02:34:13,542
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had some good phone calls.

2038
02:34:13,722 --> 02:34:17,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Any call that gives DarkSakura something free is always going to be a good call.

2039
02:34:17,964 --> 02:34:19,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes my liver quiver.

2040
02:34:19,284 --> 02:34:21,264
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just no way that that's going to be a bad call.

2041
02:34:21,324 --> 02:34:22,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch.

2042
02:34:22,785 --> 02:34:23,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, did I answer this one?

2043
02:34:24,085 --> 02:34:24,385
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

2044
02:34:24,405 --> 02:34:25,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2045
02:34:25,405 --> 02:34:25,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2046
02:34:26,626 --> 02:34:27,486
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Cheeseburger.

2047
02:34:27,746 --> 02:34:28,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Cheeseburger.

2048
02:34:28,906 --> 02:34:30,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you been on the show before?

2049
02:34:30,347 --> 02:34:31,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you've ever called.

2050
02:34:32,168 --> 02:34:32,688
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't.

2051
02:34:32,808 --> 02:34:33,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been in chat.

2052
02:34:34,009 --> 02:34:35,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a deeper voice than I imagined.

2053
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:45,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard your name before as we've, like, you know, reading the Twitters and the chat and all that, but I just, and I just want to point out the icon on Skype is a picture of a cheeseburger.

2054
02:34:46,355 --> 02:34:47,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do you go by cheeseburger?

2055
02:34:47,495 --> 02:34:49,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I know why he goes by cheeseburger because I read his emails.

2056
02:34:50,297 --> 02:34:52,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you just a big fan of cheeseburgers?

2057
02:34:52,978 --> 02:34:55,119
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's extremely similar to my last name.

2058
02:34:55,700 --> 02:35:00,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you played WoW for a while, and I just want to know why you got back into it.

2059
02:35:00,583 --> 02:35:01,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know you got back into it.

2060
02:35:14,108 --> 02:35:18,650
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think how far I want to get into this on a public radio show.

2061
02:35:19,271 --> 02:35:28,636
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I had to stop playing WoW was I found myself kind of getting too involved with some of the stuff that was going on in the guild.

2062
02:35:28,916 --> 02:35:38,201
[SPEAKER_14]: And unfortunately, as seems to always happen in various guilds in WoW, there was some very unfortunate guild drama where people went their separate ways.

2063
02:35:38,741 --> 02:35:59,422
[SPEAKER_14]: and it really kind of turned me off to the game because part of me actually all of me felt it was very unnecessary and that I think if people across the board had been a little more more reasonable and open-minded and hadn't reacted and I think some very selfish things were done by certain people and god I hope I'm gonna get in deep hot water for getting into this on my radio show but

2064
02:36:00,102 --> 02:36:01,083
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2065
02:36:25,333 --> 02:36:35,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I found a new group of people to play with that have different goals in the game that aren't so focused on the endgame rating and so forth, and just kind of rediscovering what makes WoW fun.

2066
02:36:36,182 --> 02:36:43,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, I dumped the guy I was seeing, so I have a little more spare time now.

2067
02:36:45,851 --> 02:36:47,532
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like what I told one of my friends.

2068
02:36:47,592 --> 02:36:51,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, when she criticized me, she's like, I can't believe you went back to Warcraft.

2069
02:36:51,135 --> 02:36:52,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, this is what depressed people do!

2070
02:36:54,929 --> 02:36:56,069
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't really say I'm depressed.

2071
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:57,290
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a time waster.

2072
02:36:57,610 --> 02:37:04,392
[SPEAKER_14]: But like I said, I think real life, if there's stuff going on in real life, it will always be better than WoW.

2073
02:37:05,132 --> 02:37:06,253
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is kind of what I tell people.

2074
02:37:06,413 --> 02:37:07,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't watch a lot of TV.

2075
02:37:08,053 --> 02:37:11,154
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some things I watch, but I don't watch as much as probably most people do.

2076
02:37:11,614 --> 02:37:13,835
[SPEAKER_14]: When I'm playing WoW, I'm not playing as many console games.

2077
02:37:13,935 --> 02:37:15,276
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just my entertainment of choice.

2078
02:37:15,836 --> 02:37:18,037
[SPEAKER_14]: But finding a balance is important.

2079
02:37:20,277 --> 02:37:22,238
[SPEAKER_11]: What realm do you play on?

2080
02:37:22,913 --> 02:37:26,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now I am playing Alliance on Blade's Edge is the server I'm playing on.

2081
02:37:27,176 --> 02:37:28,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it alright if I join your guild?

2082
02:37:29,158 --> 02:37:29,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibly.

2083
02:37:29,758 --> 02:37:31,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Send me an email after the show.

2084
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:33,361
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not my guild that's the difference this time.

2085
02:37:34,222 --> 02:37:38,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I wasn't in charge of the guild before, but I knew the people in charge more than I know the ones here.

2086
02:37:39,866 --> 02:37:45,731
[SPEAKER_14]: But as long as you're not a dick, which you don't sound like from your phone call, I don't see why not.

2087
02:37:48,133 --> 02:37:48,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool!

2088
02:37:48,933 --> 02:37:50,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well you take care of yourself.

2089
02:37:50,074 --> 02:37:50,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for the call, okay?

2090
02:37:51,544 --> 02:37:51,984
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, you too.

2091
02:37:52,145 --> 02:37:52,465
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2092
02:37:52,725 --> 02:37:52,965
[SPEAKER_14]: See ya.

2093
02:37:53,286 --> 02:37:53,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

2094
02:37:53,906 --> 02:37:56,208
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I was going to say at the end of that phone call, for the Horde!

2095
02:37:56,288 --> 02:37:57,830
[SPEAKER_14]: But then I was like, oh shit, I'm Alliance now.

2096
02:37:57,890 --> 02:37:58,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say that.

2097
02:37:58,410 --> 02:37:59,251
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm playing one of each.

2098
02:38:00,532 --> 02:38:01,013
[SPEAKER_14]: You're playing what?

2099
02:38:01,253 --> 02:38:01,633
[SPEAKER_03]: One of each.

2100
02:38:01,994 --> 02:38:02,314
[SPEAKER_14]: One of each?

2101
02:38:03,395 --> 02:38:04,416
[SPEAKER_14]: You're on a different server, right?

2102
02:38:04,576 --> 02:38:05,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, but I'll play on another.

2103
02:38:05,757 --> 02:38:07,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I'm actually going to pay for it.

2104
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:13,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm playing a blood elf, and I'm playing a goat girl.

2105
02:38:14,865 --> 02:38:15,606
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, fair enough.

2106
02:38:15,626 --> 02:38:16,567
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean by goat girl.

2107
02:38:17,745 --> 02:38:18,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Dranai.

2108
02:38:19,106 --> 02:38:19,346
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2109
02:38:20,006 --> 02:38:20,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Drano.

2110
02:38:20,967 --> 02:38:21,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Drano.

2111
02:38:21,467 --> 02:38:21,667
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2112
02:38:21,687 --> 02:38:23,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2113
02:38:23,188 --> 02:38:25,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And those were all excellent calls tonight, so thank you very much.

2114
02:38:25,449 --> 02:38:28,211
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we'll leave it at that.

2115
02:38:28,891 --> 02:38:31,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I do still see calls coming in, but no offense.

2116
02:38:31,473 --> 02:38:34,575
[SPEAKER_14]: All those guys that are calling in have been on the show before, so we're going to leave this as a...

2117
02:38:35,703 --> 02:38:36,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Week of new callers.

2118
02:38:36,743 --> 02:38:38,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, even though Ranma's not a new caller.

2119
02:38:39,044 --> 02:38:40,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So, two out of three.

2120
02:38:40,424 --> 02:38:41,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes Angus excited.

2121
02:38:41,404 --> 02:38:41,644
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2122
02:38:43,204 --> 02:38:44,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus about three phone calls a night.

2123
02:38:44,425 --> 02:38:44,725
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good.

2124
02:38:44,905 --> 02:38:45,665
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all right.

2125
02:38:45,705 --> 02:38:46,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2126
02:38:46,865 --> 02:38:49,226
[SPEAKER_14]: If you didn't get through tonight, though, Twitter topics next week.

2127
02:38:49,246 --> 02:38:50,066
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't get a lot tonight.

2128
02:38:50,226 --> 02:38:51,486
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't forget, you can always interact.

2129
02:38:51,526 --> 02:38:51,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat room.

2130
02:38:51,906 --> 02:38:52,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag.

2131
02:38:52,366 --> 02:38:53,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

2132
02:38:54,507 --> 02:38:56,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Always plenty of ways to interact with the program.

2133
02:38:56,887 --> 02:38:59,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's get into some last-minute stories.

2134
02:38:59,668 --> 02:39:01,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I never allowed Loki the chance.

2135
02:39:02,199 --> 02:39:04,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to steal one more cookie because they're delicious.

2136
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:04,960
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

2137
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,001
[SPEAKER_12]: They're there for stealing.

2138
02:39:07,101 --> 02:39:10,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can throw away all the bacon stuff, except for my plate.

2139
02:39:10,783 --> 02:39:12,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we feed all the bacon stuff to Dan?

2140
02:39:13,344 --> 02:39:13,984
[SPEAKER_12]: If he wants it.

2141
02:39:16,018 --> 02:39:17,720
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is this crap?

2142
02:39:19,121 --> 02:39:23,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Sonic is possibly going to come back in the way that it should have been coming back in the first place.

2143
02:39:24,127 --> 02:39:29,773
[SPEAKER_12]: None of these 3D crap fests with were-hedgehogs and that kind of stuff.

2144
02:39:30,414 --> 02:39:35,259
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're actually going to get a brand new 2D HD Sonic the Hedgehog game.

2145
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:35,860
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be...

2146
02:39:36,881 --> 02:39:37,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Sky Stage Xbox Live Arcade

2147
02:40:02,915 --> 02:40:05,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now it's also making its way to arcades as well.

2148
02:40:06,619 --> 02:40:09,182
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know, man.

2149
02:40:10,204 --> 02:40:11,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen screenshots and video of this.

2150
02:40:11,966 --> 02:40:12,767
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looks weird.

2151
02:40:13,728 --> 02:40:19,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't think King of Fires really translates itself well into... It's one of those things I want to see just once, though.

2152
02:40:19,655 --> 02:40:21,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like for the WTF value.

2153
02:40:21,858 --> 02:40:22,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2154
02:40:23,355 --> 02:40:27,218
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, the Sonic 2D thing, I'm a little nervous about that.

2155
02:40:27,498 --> 02:40:33,402
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm with everybody else in the camp of OMG awesome Sonic 2D.

2156
02:40:33,502 --> 02:40:37,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully it's kind of influenced by Mega Man 9, just to go back to your damn roots.

2157
02:40:38,025 --> 02:40:42,869
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am a little worried because this is like the third time Sonic has been reinvented.

2158
02:40:43,489 --> 02:40:45,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last few have not been that great.

2159
02:40:45,711 --> 02:40:46,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So I really hope...

2160
02:40:47,512 --> 02:40:48,152
[SPEAKER_14]: This one's good.

2161
02:40:48,432 --> 02:40:53,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hopeful, but I'm a little apprehensive, and I think I have the right to be, as do all the rest of you.

2162
02:40:54,794 --> 02:40:56,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2163
02:40:57,415 --> 02:41:10,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, also to kind of go along with some stuff we were talking about before, you may remember that porn has been kind of making its way to the PlayStation 3 PlayStation Network in Japan.

2164
02:41:11,348 --> 02:41:15,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now apparently Vivid Entertainment is hoping to do the same thing in the U.S.

2165
02:41:16,250 --> 02:41:25,073
[SPEAKER_12]: They are making a stand trying to convince Sony that their porn should be on the PlayStation Network.

2166
02:41:26,133 --> 02:41:27,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Bravo, I say.

2167
02:41:27,614 --> 02:41:29,454
[SPEAKER_12]: So that'll be kind of interesting.

2168
02:41:30,575 --> 02:41:33,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently...

2169
02:41:35,418 --> 02:41:38,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Go back to some of the piracy stuff we were talking about.

2170
02:41:39,202 --> 02:41:47,108
[SPEAKER_12]: We may have talked about this in the past, but yes, they have finally released the sequel, the official sequel to Don't Copy That Floppy.

2171
02:41:47,909 --> 02:41:49,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't Copy That 2.

2172
02:41:49,970 --> 02:41:52,913
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me tell you this much, I watched it and it's horrible.

2173
02:41:52,933 --> 02:41:54,334
[SPEAKER_12]: And then promptly copied a floppy.

2174
02:41:55,075 --> 02:41:55,515
[SPEAKER_12]: It's horrible.

2175
02:41:55,715 --> 02:41:57,977
[SPEAKER_12]: If I still had a floppy, I would copy it.

2176
02:41:59,324 --> 02:42:03,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And my favorite thing about this is they're talking about how, oh, copying is a crime and stuff.

2177
02:42:03,888 --> 02:42:06,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, piracy is a crime, whatever.

2178
02:42:06,850 --> 02:42:14,477
[SPEAKER_12]: But the guy that they show at the very end, there's like a real pirate, I guess, who... He was selling copies of stuff, okay?

2179
02:42:14,737 --> 02:42:18,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's something that's gonna probably land you in jail more than...

2180
02:42:18,740 --> 02:42:20,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Pirating games for your own use It's a YouTube clip

2181
02:42:44,111 --> 02:42:48,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they want it freely distributed everywhere.

2182
02:42:48,073 --> 02:42:49,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if we're critical of it?

2183
02:42:49,774 --> 02:42:50,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if we're critical of it.

2184
02:42:50,614 --> 02:42:54,656
[SPEAKER_14]: So are we going to copy the thing?

2185
02:42:55,176 --> 02:42:56,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Read that in a minute, DarkSakura.

2186
02:42:56,217 --> 02:42:58,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what you're looking at, and it's related.

2187
02:42:59,198 --> 02:42:59,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is it here?

2188
02:42:59,798 --> 02:43:00,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Who linked it in chat here?

2189
02:43:01,099 --> 02:43:03,080
[SPEAKER_14]: It's this, right?

2190
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:03,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2191
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:04,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, hold on.

2192
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:05,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm bringing it up in studio.

2193
02:43:05,381 --> 02:43:05,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

2194
02:43:05,621 --> 02:43:06,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here it is.

2195
02:43:06,521 --> 02:43:07,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't copy that floppy 2.

2196
02:43:09,745 --> 02:43:12,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to 90s Time Trip.

2197
02:43:12,926 --> 02:43:16,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that anti-piracy classic, Don't Copy That Floppy.

2198
02:43:16,767 --> 02:43:17,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I just skip ahead here?

2199
02:43:17,927 --> 02:43:19,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to watch this whole damn thing, okay?

2200
02:43:19,667 --> 02:43:22,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see what the song sounds like, and I want to see that bit at the end.

2201
02:43:23,228 --> 02:43:25,749
[SPEAKER_10]: He looks kind of like Max Headroom, but black.

2202
02:43:25,969 --> 02:43:26,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is it just me?

2203
02:43:26,549 --> 02:43:28,189
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's kind of what it looks like.

2204
02:43:39,312 --> 02:43:39,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorta.

2205
02:43:39,753 --> 02:43:40,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't copy it!

2206
02:43:40,574 --> 02:43:41,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he does.

2207
02:43:41,034 --> 02:43:41,274
[SPEAKER_14]: See?

2208
02:43:41,314 --> 02:43:41,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2209
02:44:00,296 --> 02:44:00,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2210
02:44:00,997 --> 02:44:03,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not as funny as the other one was.

2211
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:08,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the old 90s value of the first one is what made it so funny and catchy.

2212
02:44:09,023 --> 02:44:13,847
[SPEAKER_14]: But this one is like, ironically enough, is a copy of a copy.

2213
02:44:14,968 --> 02:44:18,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know how copies of copies lose quality over time?

2214
02:44:18,571 --> 02:44:19,692
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I feel this is.

2215
02:44:20,373 --> 02:44:22,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Like an unnecessary sequel.

2216
02:44:22,775 --> 02:44:23,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I want to see the bit.

2217
02:44:24,056 --> 02:44:24,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa, what happened?

2218
02:44:24,796 --> 02:44:25,357
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing stopped.

2219
02:44:26,057 --> 02:44:26,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't do that.

2220
02:44:28,339 --> 02:44:29,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't stop me, my floppy.

2221
02:44:29,524 --> 02:44:29,806
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2222
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:31,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see the bit at the end.

2223
02:44:31,714 --> 02:44:33,602
[SPEAKER_14]: What, it's about the last minute is where the pirate shows up?

2224
02:44:34,330 --> 02:44:41,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, even... I want to see... I want to see the little, like, message to kids.

2225
02:44:41,792 --> 02:44:46,272
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jeremiah Mondello, and I want you to know that pirating software is no joke.

2226
02:44:46,933 --> 02:44:50,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serving four years for selling pirated software on the web.

2227
02:44:50,753 --> 02:44:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, for the rest of my life, I'll be labeled a felon and an ex-con.

2228
02:44:55,054 --> 02:44:56,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make the same mistakes I did.

2229
02:44:56,894 --> 02:44:59,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a copy, it's a crime.

2230
02:44:59,775 --> 02:45:01,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Would I be immature for making fun of his voice?

2231
02:45:02,457 --> 02:45:05,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Because... I wondered if that was a woman.

2232
02:45:07,181 --> 02:45:12,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't mean to sound rude and or petty and I should really not be the first to talk, but like...

2233
02:45:14,611 --> 02:45:16,291
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't sound like he's ever gone through puberty.

2234
02:45:17,212 --> 02:45:18,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a disease?

2235
02:45:18,772 --> 02:45:20,132
[SPEAKER_14]: See what happens when you copy?

2236
02:45:21,273 --> 02:45:30,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Does selling pirated games cause your balls to go back into your body or something?

2237
02:45:30,595 --> 02:45:34,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I think being in prison causes your balls to go back into your body.

2238
02:45:34,615 --> 02:45:36,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Rob, I had to look at his neck.

2239
02:45:36,816 --> 02:45:39,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's okay for me to make fun of him because he is a felon, right?

2240
02:45:40,017 --> 02:45:41,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to look at his neck.

2241
02:45:41,769 --> 02:45:43,350
[SPEAKER_14]: to see if there was an Adam's apple?

2242
02:45:43,851 --> 02:45:47,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he's got too much facial hair, even if that was drugs.

2243
02:45:47,593 --> 02:45:50,816
[SPEAKER_03]: A woman can grow that much facial hair with hormonal therapy.

2244
02:45:50,856 --> 02:45:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, really.

2245
02:45:52,457 --> 02:45:55,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I see the rest of this uplifting message here?

2246
02:45:57,841 --> 02:45:59,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he's just a sad face.

2247
02:45:59,602 --> 02:46:00,903
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just a sad face.

2248
02:46:00,943 --> 02:46:01,564
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the end of it.

2249
02:46:01,604 --> 02:46:01,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind.

2250
02:46:04,315 --> 02:46:06,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So now he's serving four years in jail.

2251
02:46:06,476 --> 02:46:07,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned my lesson.

2252
02:46:08,397 --> 02:46:14,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And now he's being made fun of on the internet by... Well, how about you don't sell pirated copies of stuff, stupid?

2253
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:23,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, see, that's the people they go after is the big piracy rings that, you know, cause companies money because they're actually selling bootleg copies.

2254
02:46:24,423 --> 02:46:27,404
[SPEAKER_14]: AmazeSatsuma in chat says, his body copied too much estrogen.

2255
02:46:30,606 --> 02:46:33,527
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rama says, and people wonder why software is so fucking expensive.

2256
02:46:34,631 --> 02:46:36,274
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, that's a free download at iTunes.

2257
02:46:38,518 --> 02:46:39,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, better be.

2258
02:46:39,199 --> 02:46:42,264
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't be worth... Someone should go copy it.

2259
02:46:44,487 --> 02:46:45,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you gotta love irony.

2260
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:48,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess who's never gonna download that?

2261
02:46:48,714 --> 02:46:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Me.

2262
02:46:49,315 --> 02:46:53,056
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, you had a last-minute story, and then we'll let Loki finish up if he has anything else.

2263
02:46:53,196 --> 02:47:00,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's actually somebody... To quote Silent Scope, let's play Metal Gear for real.

2264
02:47:01,557 --> 02:47:17,080
[SPEAKER_03]: A guy in France who was accused of killing... There's an actor, Roland Gerard, he was convicted with... Well, supposed to be going, actually, in jail, waiting trial for killing the guy's daughter and her friend.

2265
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:17,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2266
02:47:19,644 --> 02:47:22,014
[SPEAKER_03]: He escaped from jail in a box.

2267
02:47:23,871 --> 02:47:24,271
[SPEAKER_03]: In a box.

2268
02:47:25,092 --> 02:47:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Metal Gear-ish.

2269
02:47:27,334 --> 02:47:27,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

2270
02:47:27,954 --> 02:47:37,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had put himself in a box that was being loaded onto a truck to take to southeast of Paris.

2271
02:47:38,543 --> 02:47:41,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And he broke free and the driver didn't even figure it out until later.

2272
02:47:42,046 --> 02:47:45,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the guy, from what I can see, is still at large.

2273
02:47:46,410 --> 02:47:50,553
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Jean-Pierre Trebert, I think.

2274
02:47:50,834 --> 02:47:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

2275
02:47:51,855 --> 02:47:53,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Trebek It's myself in a box

2276
02:48:07,133 --> 02:48:07,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, sorry.

2277
02:48:07,693 --> 02:48:09,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Solid Snake, you know.

2278
02:48:10,074 --> 02:48:10,535
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way.

2279
02:48:10,695 --> 02:48:11,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

2280
02:48:11,735 --> 02:48:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know in the game he was in a box and he moved the box in the truck.

2281
02:48:15,237 --> 02:48:16,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, oh, no, the truck have started to move.

2282
02:48:16,877 --> 02:48:18,018
[SPEAKER_14]: The truck have started to move.

2283
02:48:18,078 --> 02:48:18,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that.

2284
02:48:18,978 --> 02:48:20,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the truck have started to move.

2285
02:48:20,219 --> 02:48:21,899
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to play through old school NES Metal Gear.

2286
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:22,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out of jail.

2287
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:26,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, that gaming marathon we're doing on the 17th, I want to play Metal Gear for an hour.

2288
02:48:27,162 --> 02:48:27,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2289
02:48:27,582 --> 02:48:27,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Old school.

2290
02:48:28,402 --> 02:48:28,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob.

2291
02:48:28,803 --> 02:48:29,003
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2292
02:48:29,143 --> 02:48:29,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:48:30,563 --> 02:48:30,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob.

02:48:31,324 --> 02:48:31,544
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

02:48:31,964 --> 02:48:32,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2297
02:48:33,264 --> 02:48:33,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, by the way.

2298
02:48:34,065 --> 02:48:34,245
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2299
02:48:35,526 --> 02:48:35,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate you.

2300
02:48:51,056 --> 02:48:53,638
[SPEAKER_14]: There was actually one funny thing they had on Saturday Night Live last night.

2301
02:48:53,678 --> 02:48:56,039
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a repeat, but I never watched Saturday Night Live, so it was new to me.

2302
02:48:56,519 --> 02:49:02,002
[SPEAKER_14]: But they had a sequel to the Dick in the Box thing with Justin Timberlake and whoever that guy, Andy Samberg, is that his name?

2303
02:49:03,123 --> 02:49:07,665
[SPEAKER_14]: It was something like, we're gonna fuck each other's moms for Mother's Day or something like that.

2304
02:49:07,745 --> 02:49:08,926
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually really funny.

2305
02:49:09,246 --> 02:49:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't heard that one.

2306
02:49:10,146 --> 02:49:11,747
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the one funny thing I saw on that show all night.

2307
02:49:11,807 --> 02:49:12,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on the album.

2308
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:13,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah Palin

2309
02:49:36,721 --> 02:49:37,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was...

2310
02:50:02,657 --> 02:50:03,057
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's it.

2311
02:50:03,077 --> 02:50:03,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Good night!

2312
02:50:03,917 --> 02:50:05,978
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2313
02:50:06,938 --> 02:50:11,699
[SPEAKER_14]: But before we close the door on tonight's program, we do have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2314
02:50:12,039 --> 02:50:13,299
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2318
02:50:22,380 --> 02:50:24,961

2319
02:50:25,741 --> 02:50:28,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever talked about why you're doing that, or is that not something you want to get into on Oil Arm?

2320
02:50:28,622 --> 02:50:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get into it.

2321
02:50:29,702 --> 02:50:30,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's fine.
