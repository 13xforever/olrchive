Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Lokey!

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, September 27th, 2009, a controversial rumor hints at big Sega and Sony plans.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
A PlayStation Home spin-off is PSP-bound, and is the sequel to one of this year's biggest hits already in the works.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that video game program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
So pull up a chair and join us for the next three hours as we talk about video games.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
It'll be myself, Rob Roberts, and, as always, your lovely co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
How are you, my friend?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I am, uh, contemplative.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Contemplative?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes, that's a very good word for how I am right now.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Things you want to talk about on air or private things?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Um...

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
You want to have a Dr. Phil therapy session here in Oprah moment, if you will?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Live on our video game program?

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, um, uh, I am, uh, going to only be here for about an hour, and then I'm going to a temple tonight.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, okay.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
For, uh, services.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, you have fun, and, um, sorry that you won't be here for the whole show, but certainly understanding.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
When you have other commitments, you have other commitments.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Try not to ruin my house.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I'll try.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You know, this isn't the first time we've taped a show at Studio DarkSakura without DarkSakura.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
It's going to be a little creepy.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
But you will be here for a little while to, uh, give your colorful insight, as always.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, yes.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
But what are we going to do?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Because I don't have Sims 3 on my laptop.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Actually, what we'll do, we'll have DarkSakura bring it up on her computer and just put the microphone kind of, like, at a distance from the speaker.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I turn off the sound during the show.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And it'll be, it'll be like she's here.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And then we'll hear the Simlish every once in a while.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And it'll be, that'll be her input.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Sounds about right.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So, what did you think about Tokyo Game Show this year, DarkSakura?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I thought about it, well, actually, you know, I'll tell you what, I had a friend that went.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Did you really?

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, one of my, uh, friends from Berkeley, she lives in Japan now, and she went to Tokyo Game Show and posted lots of pictures of the cosplay and the win.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I heard it was kind of a mixed bag this year.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
Our, uh, buddy Bobby Black Wolf, who, of course, tapes before us at All Games Radio, where we always tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, but starting at 5 Pacific.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Gotta, gotta plug All Games, because they let us steal their bandwidth every week.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
Um, but, of course, there's a bunch of great shows on All Games, and the one before us is Bobby Black Wolf, and he was kind of talking, you know, his piece, and we were doing a little phone call at the end of his show, as we always do, and he had mentioned that some of the things he had heard on Tokyo Game Show this year, not so hot.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
And I think that it depends on what you go there for.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I mean, I think she was just going there just to see and to look around, so I think she had a good time.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
Right. And I got the impression, like, he didn't say who it was for whatever reason, which is fine, but, you know, I got the impression maybe because it was an industry person, so I didn't want to say who it was.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
So, probably, maybe from the industry perspective, it's eh, but the kind of, the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is open to the public.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
That's something E3 is not.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
So, it is like E3 meets Penny Arcade Expo, in a way, I guess you could say, in Japan.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I mean, I don't think we should really compare Expos to each other. They're all kind of different.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
But the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is an open to the public trade show of sorts.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
So, I think if you're like a private citizen kind of going and not really into the whole industry, but you're just a gaming enthusiast, I bet it's a heck of a lot of fun.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So, there you go.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I agree.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Alright.

03:41.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, we do like to think of ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio as kind of like, you know, friends getting together for, like, post-arcade, night at the arcade dinner, meeting up at a diner, because that's what we actually used to do.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
That's how Dark Soccer, Loki, and myself all met. We used to go to this little diner called Brookfield's in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land after a night of DDR and fighting games and who knows what else we would play back in the day.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Sadly, arcades have gone downhill in the past eight years, but we're still here doing our thing, and we always invite you guys to come to the table with us.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
Join us at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, if you want to chat with us during the program.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
We are back after a week off last week.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Unfortunately, we're a little spotty in our schedule right now.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We're going to be out next week as well.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
But I have some good news.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
We are going to have a best-of show airing next week with some new content.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
We're going to get together next week and tape some new content.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
So we won't be live next week sadly, but you will get to hear some of our best bits going back a little ways too.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So some of our new fans in the past year or two.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And this will actually go to the podcast feed as well.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
So you'll be able to hear it.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It'll air live first, of course as it always does.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.180
it always does and then go to the podcast feed a little later so if you

04:46.180 --> 04:49.280
want to be the first to hear it just stay tuned after Bobby next week like

04:49.280 --> 04:53.960
you always are sadly we won't be here live but then after that that should be

04:53.960 --> 04:57.760
it for the rest of the year we'll be here every show up through Christmas I

04:57.760 --> 05:00.220
don't think Christmas is on a Sunday this year and New Year's and all that so

05:00.220 --> 05:07.400
I think we'll be fine so anyhow um I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com

05:07.400 --> 05:11.920
actdeft says the OLR dinner table yay I want to welcome all of our new

05:11.920 --> 05:15.460
chatters as well I'm not sure who exactly all in chat is new tonight but I

05:15.460 --> 05:18.600
do want to say welcome if you are new to the program and of course welcome to our

05:18.600 --> 05:21.560
veteran folks as well especially those of you that have been with us for a long

05:21.560 --> 05:25.880
time like dark Tetsuya I think he's been here every week since episode 1 you got

05:25.880 --> 05:30.280
to love that he was literally there for episode 1 so props to you longtime

05:30.280 --> 05:34.280
listeners and new time listeners tonight so if you're new then you ought to know

05:34.280 --> 05:36.760
that we always start off every show with a little bit of how was your gaming

05:36.760 --> 05:42.880
week start Sakura how was your gaming week it was not very eventful I should

05:42.880 --> 05:47.960
say I really I really didn't play much of anything this week Rob except for

05:47.960 --> 05:55.160
like a game of pinball and cuz I was gonna I haven't paid for my World of

05:55.160 --> 05:59.160
Warcraft account because of financial issues here at home which hopefully I'll

05:59.160 --> 06:03.560
be able to rectify next week but I had no idea that back I played some Sims I

06:03.560 --> 06:08.160
actually did for about 20 minutes I have to say as far as the pinball thing goes

06:08.160 --> 06:11.480
one game that I played a little bit of this week not a lot but was the Zen

06:11.480 --> 06:14.680
pinball on PlayStation 3 and I know Bobby was giving you some crap about

06:14.680 --> 06:16.840
that a while ago saying you gotta check it out you gotta check it out well I'm

06:16.840 --> 06:19.560
gonna I'm gonna jump on board and say you got to check it out cuz it is a

06:19.560 --> 06:24.040
pretty good pinball collection and some fun tables on there I was finally

06:24.040 --> 06:26.960
getting into one of them I think it's called v12 it's like a racing table and

06:26.960 --> 06:29.460
it's one of those things where there's like a field on top and then a play

06:29.460 --> 06:33.160
field underneath the glass and the way they do it on the PlayStation 3 is kind

06:33.160 --> 06:38.320
of neat so um it's worth checking out we know this week is you know remember if

06:38.320 --> 06:42.400
it's this week or last week but uh what was it the pinball Hall of Fame

06:42.400 --> 06:46.120
Williams collection will be out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 you know I

06:46.120 --> 06:48.760
already own the game on we did they talk about if they're doing anything new with

06:48.760 --> 06:53.440
that it's all high-res and stuff I guess that's cool but I do own it on we the

06:53.440 --> 06:58.160
uh we version though they're getting the one that came out in the UK they got a

06:58.160 --> 07:03.960
little collection become out here in November so it's a great week great week

07:03.960 --> 07:07.320
to be a pinball enthusiast apparently I would like to see more tables come to

07:07.320 --> 07:10.320
Zen pinball I think they only have the one table and I know there's a very

07:10.320 --> 07:16.120
comparable game on the Xbox 360 and I apologize the name escapes me but I know

07:16.120 --> 07:20.000
there's a and somebody in chattel name and I know it but they have a

07:20.000 --> 07:23.280
comparable pinball game over there and they get a lot of they've had quite a

07:23.280 --> 07:27.160
few tables I think two or at least three there's a pair table one time well I

07:27.160 --> 07:30.800
think it's probably the same table that's on Zen pinball so kind of funny

07:30.800 --> 07:35.140
uh Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games mainly I

07:35.140 --> 07:42.640
played Grand Theft Auto lost and damned this time though since they went and

07:42.640 --> 07:46.680
broke our modded games which you know how to suppress for a while we didn't

07:46.680 --> 07:50.640
really know what the hell we're gonna do with the game now so the killer time

07:50.640 --> 07:54.480
until the new expansion comes out we've been playing ranked games actually and

07:54.480 --> 07:58.480
it's quite fun cuz we kick the crap out of everybody that plays with us

07:58.480 --> 08:02.800
everybody just and normally I don't talk crap through my games over if there's

08:02.800 --> 08:07.480
someone else that's playing outside of a group I talk shit the entire time it's

08:07.480 --> 08:13.320
awesome but wait so you now go now ever since they banned your private games

08:13.320 --> 08:16.480
because you were doing the hack thing or whatever yeah you now go out on the

08:16.480 --> 08:20.160
public and play public now yeah we play ranked games all time and it's funny so

08:20.160 --> 08:23.400
will you now take challenges from all our listeners well ranked games it's

08:23.400 --> 08:26.920
just kind of a matter of chance getting in the same game okay honestly right now

08:26.920 --> 08:30.800
there's so few people playing ranked games like at lunch at sometimes because

08:30.800 --> 08:34.880
we have five consoles that all happen to be gold accounts I can literally put all

08:34.880 --> 08:38.880
five consoles in a game and just take sniper shots at heads and stuff to kind

08:38.880 --> 08:44.280
of boost my stats a bit but cheater cheater no I only do it for the costumes

08:44.280 --> 08:47.800
and crap because really there's no point in getting up the leaderboard I guess if

08:47.800 --> 08:52.680
you get the rank 10 or whatever you get 20 points big fucking whoop I mean it

08:52.680 --> 08:55.520
let me put it this way I'm at rank 4 right now and then to get to the next

08:55.520 --> 09:01.600
look next rank is $100,000 and you get maybe about in your average game $1,500

09:01.600 --> 09:08.120
so it's just it's killing time until the new one comes out basically I do want to

09:08.120 --> 09:11.680
say real quick before we get too far away from the topic but pinball FX is

09:11.680 --> 09:15.680
the name of the pinball game on Xbox 360 thank you hit stun who said it first and

09:15.680 --> 09:18.520
black wolf points out it's the same company that makes both games that's why

09:18.520 --> 09:22.840
some of the tables hop across both of those games and vidpower wants to point

09:22.840 --> 09:26.440
out if you're listening live on this Sunday night pinball FX is on sale for

09:26.440 --> 09:29.880
the rest of today so if you are looking for any I do have that game on 360 I

09:29.880 --> 09:34.520
just haven't played it in a long time I still have a bork 360 so I'm finally

09:34.520 --> 09:40.080
taking care of that this week but it's a it's a it's a decent pinball game as

09:40.080 --> 09:43.080
well I mean it's pretty much the same thing on the PlayStation 3 so I would

09:43.080 --> 09:46.680
totally urge you to check it out sorry lucky yeah but yeah we're not really

09:46.680 --> 09:49.920
just cheating and stuff we're just doing it the kind of because the other thing

09:49.920 --> 09:54.120
too that happens a lot of times is it will roll back our stats so like I was

09:54.120 --> 10:00.200
ranked for the other day then it like the next day I was back $25,000 and back

10:00.200 --> 10:06.160
to rank 3 again so their leaderboards kind of fucked up anyways and you know

10:06.160 --> 10:10.520
instead of just wasting another 20 days to get you know the same amount of money

10:10.520 --> 10:15.120
we're just going in there and doing like you know headshot kills and stuff like

10:15.120 --> 10:18.240
that but yeah actually when we get into the games with everybody else so I

10:18.240 --> 10:24.280
definitely hold my own so it's no problem then on top of that then really

10:24.280 --> 10:27.920
it's not game playing but I've been working on my arcade cabinet that I got

10:27.920 --> 10:34.680
and it's actually pretty much done I mean it's I finished sanding the whole

10:34.680 --> 10:41.320
thing and then respraying it with black spray paint and I got replacement

10:41.320 --> 10:46.200
buttons replacement joysticks I actually converted the panel I had because it was

10:46.200 --> 10:49.840
a two-player panel with three buttons each and I drilled three more holes in

10:49.840 --> 10:56.720
there for the other six buttons and it's close to what's supposed to look like

10:56.720 --> 11:02.320
you know drilling stuff into steel doesn't really a line up sometimes and

11:02.320 --> 11:08.360
then I've just been kind of putting everything back together so I got most

11:08.360 --> 11:12.040
of it done yesterday before I had to go get dinner and end up watching TV but

11:12.040 --> 11:15.760
hopefully this week it'll be all put together and I can start moving it into

11:15.760 --> 11:20.240
the house and I also sought to build the computer I have all the parts that build

11:20.240 --> 11:24.720
the computer but I just haven't got around to doing it yet so that's kind of

11:24.720 --> 11:33.640
exciting and I played a little bit more scribble knots so I had to go to the ER

11:33.640 --> 11:37.640
for something Nellie thought she had like some eye infection thing and it

11:37.640 --> 11:40.520
ended up being nothing but okay I was gonna say she's okay though right no

11:40.520 --> 11:44.880
she's fine she's just wanted to go the ER so I sat there playing scribble knots

11:44.880 --> 11:50.360
until my battery ran out five minutes later so I don't know it's still the

11:50.360 --> 11:54.480
same I did find though that you can drop anything in lava and they'll kill it so

11:54.480 --> 11:58.360
you can drop Cthulhu in lava and he died drop little babies in lava and they die

11:58.360 --> 12:07.840
I don't know we I just have fun that's it all right my gaming week I did play

12:07.840 --> 12:10.760
some new games this week and I do want to point out cuz I'm Brad from pod

12:10.760 --> 12:14.360
culture another podcast we enjoy here at orange orange radio was razzing me in

12:14.360 --> 12:19.200
our chat room a little bit saying you're 360 still broken damn dude get the thing

12:19.200 --> 12:24.400
fixed already um honestly I my gaming tastes have been satiated by the

12:24.400 --> 12:28.040
PlayStation 3 as of late there hasn't been anything on the 360 I've been

12:28.040 --> 12:31.640
dying to go out and play except rock band beatles but I know I'll get to that

12:31.640 --> 12:37.880
in time it's a boy if once my life stops me so crazy and I'm going on all these

12:37.880 --> 12:41.640
trips and stuff I will or I'm just gonna get the damn thing at some point too but

12:41.640 --> 12:45.800
we'll rock out a couple more weeks and DJ here I'll be out man rocket builds

12:45.800 --> 12:50.040
like whatever well we'll see but honestly you know between that and you

12:50.040 --> 12:52.480
know I've been getting back in a while lately and you all know how that goes

12:52.480 --> 12:56.080
but that's not it I actually did play some new games this week I got it I

12:56.080 --> 12:59.680

12:59.680 --> 13:05.640
yes I did isn't it awesome oh my god I cannot wait that was gonna be a whole

13:05.640 --> 13:10.440
new crack right there that was the greatest thing no I can't go back yes

13:10.440 --> 13:16.240
looks amazing all right um here's the thing I want to talk about some new

13:16.240 --> 13:19.360
games I played this week funny enough I played some portable games I played on

13:19.360 --> 13:22.680
the PSP fantasy star portable I decided to pick up because I was traveling this

13:22.680 --> 13:25.640
week and you guys know I like to play portable games the most when I'm

13:25.640 --> 13:28.800
traveling as I'm sure a lot of you do so I picked up fantasy star portable which

13:28.800 --> 13:32.440
is kind of a port of fantasy star universe to the PSP which is weird

13:32.440 --> 13:36.280
because fantasy star universe is an online game but fancy star portable

13:36.280 --> 13:39.800
doesn't really have that it has an ad hoc mode so you can play with local

13:39.800 --> 13:43.960
people but you can't really go online and universe is like online as in like

13:43.960 --> 13:49.360
fancy star online was online where you can play it offline though um well

13:49.360 --> 13:53.040
Phantasy Star Universe has both a single-player campaign and an online

13:53.040 --> 13:56.560
mode. Yeah. Phantasy Star Online was pretty much only online. It was the only place you could play it.

13:56.560 --> 14:01.360
I always played Phantasy Star Online offline. Well you had to have a hacked disc or something to do that, I think.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.840
No. Or you just make your own private rooms or something, right? No, you just play it offline.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.160
Could you do that? Yeah, you could do that. I don't even remember. It's been so

14:08.160 --> 14:11.720
long I can't even remember. Because I didn't want to do dial-up because that was...

14:11.720 --> 14:17.480
Yeah, kind of slow. But, um, Phantasy Star Portable is kind of a port of a single

14:17.480 --> 14:20.840
player campaign. It is not the same campaign, I want to make that clear. It's a much

14:20.840 --> 14:21.680
different story

14:21.680 --> 14:25.280
going on to the PSP. But it's weird because they made some weird decisions

14:25.280 --> 14:25.660
with it.

14:25.660 --> 14:29.680
A, they added voice acting, which is kind of not that great.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.320
And the interesting thing that they changed when they ported

14:33.320 --> 14:36.320
Phantasy Star Universe to the PSP is that they made the

14:36.320 --> 14:40.640
space station, the home base where you basically are, they made it all 2D.

14:40.640 --> 14:45.760
You don't really walk around. You just kinda highlight little icons on a mini-map

14:45.760 --> 14:48.880
and that's how you talk to people. That's how you visit shops.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.280
And I hate it. Like, I think that was a really bad game design decision.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.520
It's pretty bad because it says, well, if a person's name is green

14:57.520 --> 15:00.400
they have new information for you. But I don't want to just kinda like sit there

15:00.400 --> 15:02.720
and highlight different icons on a 2D map.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.760
It's like you're browsing the mall map at the mall saying, oh, I want to go to Hot

15:06.760 --> 15:08.640
Topic. I want to go to Sears. I want to go, you know.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.320
I just didn't like that design choice. But that's

15:12.320 --> 15:15.360
that's my negative for the game. The positive for the game is that it

15:15.360 --> 15:18.920
they did a pretty good job porting it over to the PSP graphically.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.640
The game still looks, you know, you can tell it scaled down a little bit but not

15:23.640 --> 15:26.000
that bad at all. You expect you're gonna get a little bit of that.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.080
The PSP is a pretty powerful piece of hardware. It

15:29.080 --> 15:31.880
carries the game very well, especially with the full motion video and some of the

15:31.880 --> 15:33.020
things they put in there. So

15:33.020 --> 15:35.820
it does make a pretty solid single-player campaign, especially if

15:35.820 --> 15:37.520
you're a fan of Phantasy Star Universe.

15:37.520 --> 15:41.400
Unfortunately, I think the biggest flaw of Phantasy Star Universe

15:41.400 --> 15:45.160
all together and thusly Phantasy Star Portable

15:45.160 --> 15:47.840
and I think I'm gonna get some shit for this but this is the reason why I

15:47.840 --> 15:48.440
couldn't

15:48.440 --> 15:53.160
continue to play the game online. It's too damn repetitive. It doesn't have

15:53.160 --> 15:56.880
the variety that an online game such as

15:56.880 --> 16:02.120
WoW, Final Fantasy, even some of these other, you know, MMOs we've talked about

16:02.120 --> 16:07.400
in the history of our gaming. It just, I'm sorry, I love the idea of an

16:07.400 --> 16:09.780
action-based MMO but honestly

16:09.780 --> 16:13.640
I feel so constrained as to what you really can do. You do these same sword

16:13.640 --> 16:16.520
moves over and over. Granted, you can pick different weapons.

16:16.520 --> 16:20.980
Yes, I realize there's skill-ups but you don't really mix and match things. There's

16:20.980 --> 16:24.740
not a lot of strategy as to what you mix and match, like how you

16:24.740 --> 16:29.360
chain things in Final Fantasy based around the elements or how you,

16:29.360 --> 16:32.540
you know, have, like PvP is very intensive in

16:32.540 --> 16:35.680
World of Warcraft and even some of the boss strategies

16:35.680 --> 16:39.000
go way beyond hack and slash. I think that's part of the reason why Phantasy

16:39.000 --> 16:41.520
Star Universe just didn't end up being that fun.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.480
I think in a lot of people I know that played this game, just played it for a

16:44.480 --> 16:45.440
little while and was like,

16:45.440 --> 16:48.900
eh, bored, and I think that's why it kinda, you know, got old quick.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.240
Phantasy Star Online I think was a little different because I think at the time we

16:52.240 --> 16:55.720
really didn't have anything like it. I think of a game, honestly, and I know I'm

16:55.720 --> 16:57.240
gonna get crap for saying this but I don't care,

16:57.240 --> 17:00.880
as much as I love Phantasy Star Online, I've played both

17:00.880 --> 17:04.200
online and universe pretty extensively, as much as I do love and respect Phantasy Star

17:04.200 --> 17:04.680
Online,

17:04.680 --> 17:08.780
I think if that game came out now, it would tank. But,

17:08.780 --> 17:12.360
granted, it's unfair to say, well, this game came out 10 years ago, let's hold it

17:12.360 --> 17:13.200
to today's standards.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.560
It was important for what it did 10 years ago and it's always gonna hold a

17:16.560 --> 17:18.360
place in gaming history, but I just think

17:18.360 --> 17:22.720
the problem is Phantasy Star Universe didn't evolve on that as much as it should have,

17:22.720 --> 17:26.020
and that's its biggest weakness. I think they should have a Gauntlet Legends

17:26.020 --> 17:29.520
Online, like a version of Gauntlet Legends where

17:29.520 --> 17:33.320
you can basically throw as many players as you want,

17:33.320 --> 17:37.200
you know, together and it just, the game scales itself based on that, that'd be

17:37.200 --> 17:37.880
pretty awesome.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.720
XLink in our chat room, chat.orangelaundry.com, says,

17:41.720 --> 17:44.640
part 2 for the Phantasy Star Portable is coming out next year. Yeah, that is one

17:44.640 --> 17:46.960
story that didn't make our show world tonight, but that came out of Tokyo Game

17:46.960 --> 17:47.520
Show this week.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.800
They are making a Phantasy Star Portable 2 and that looks pretty cool

17:50.800 --> 17:53.720
that they're doing and that is, the reason why I say that's cool is because it's

17:53.720 --> 17:55.560
going to have online multiplayer,

17:55.560 --> 17:59.080
but even then, what are they gonna do to make the game not so repetitive?

17:59.080 --> 18:03.000
That's my biggest question. Hardcore fans of Phantasy Star Universe are going to

18:03.000 --> 18:03.480
enjoy

18:03.480 --> 18:07.240
Phantasy Star Portable. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play the game to

18:07.240 --> 18:08.520
completion just because

18:08.520 --> 18:11.720
I'm not seeing enough variety in the game, but we'll see. Sometimes,

18:11.720 --> 18:15.640
sometimes I form these opinions of games then I can't yet, yet I can't put it down.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.160
I probably, I'm traveling again this upcoming week, that's why we're not having a

18:18.160 --> 18:18.880
show next weekend.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.120
I will probably still continue to play this game.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.800
Another game that I played is not really a game and it's a DS

18:25.800 --> 18:29.960
title. I played a game called Personal Trainer Walking.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.160
Yes, tease me all you want. I picked up Personal Trainer Walking because

18:34.160 --> 18:37.800
I've been getting into walking lately. It's like a form of exercise. I like to go on

18:37.800 --> 18:40.880
long walks and I kinda want to see what this game would do for that.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.840
The game comes with a little pedometer. I'm actually really interested in this because I walk

18:44.840 --> 18:45.480
regularly.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.800
It comes with two pedometers actually. They're these little pedometers. You put it in your

18:48.800 --> 18:50.800
little pocket and you carry it with you everywhere you go

18:50.800 --> 18:54.280
and you'll notice that, like as I walk them down, see how the light's flashing red right now?

18:54.280 --> 18:58.720
Just like my old Pikachu. It's because I haven't reached my 3,000 step goal for

18:58.720 --> 19:01.920
the day yet. Once you hit your 3,000 step goal for the day, it turns green.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.280
There really is no game in Personal Trainer Walking. All it does is that you

19:06.280 --> 19:07.080
communicate.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.520
The pedometer has an infrared device and so does the cartridge,

19:10.520 --> 19:14.280
which I thought was very interesting. You hold the device to the cartridge and you

19:14.280 --> 19:16.320
press a little button and it communicates like a graph.

19:16.320 --> 19:21.160
Here's how you walk today. Here's where the hours were that you did the most walking.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.600
If you were an animal, you would be a night owl or you would be a morning deer

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
or whatever it is.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.400
Owls don't walk. That's stupid. Well, that's kinda smart though.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.920
I don't think it says like that. It's tracking your activity in general.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.280
It is. But here's the thing, and I can't stress this enough,

19:36.280 --> 19:39.960
there is really no game to this. This is a tool.

19:39.960 --> 19:44.420
They did add some frilly little things. You can use your Miis. It's actually the

19:44.420 --> 19:45.880
first DS game where you can actually

19:45.880 --> 19:49.000
take your Miis from your Wii and put it on the DS.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.680
So you can use your Miis in some of the online things, which is...

19:52.680 --> 19:55.720
Take your Miis from your Wii on your DS.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.160
Yes, exactly. It's a poet.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.440
There's these modes where

20:02.440 --> 20:06.380
the number of steps you walk cumulatively will trace these pictures

20:06.380 --> 20:09.000
and you fill up a little globe. It's like a trophy room.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.440
Or you compete, because the game actually comes with two pedometers, so you can

20:12.440 --> 20:13.960
compete with somebody in your own house.

20:13.960 --> 20:18.760
The game will kind of pit you against each other and see

20:18.760 --> 20:22.840
who's generating more power for the house. And then the only online mode that

20:22.840 --> 20:24.360
this thing has is that you

20:24.360 --> 20:28.560
communicate with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection

20:28.560 --> 20:31.760
and it will send your steps and it will say

20:31.760 --> 20:35.360
this is how many steps the world has walked cumulatively.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.120
You can put it in this mode called Walk the World and you can see how long it

20:39.120 --> 20:41.360
took for everybody to walk from the world

20:41.360 --> 20:45.120
to the moon. And that took about three months. So right now everybody that's

20:45.120 --> 20:47.040
playing personal training is trying to walk to Mars.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.360
And they're about a third of the way to Mars from the moon. That's kind of cool.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.280
Yeah, but it's a little silly. Well, I think it's a fun kind of silly.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.320
That's a little no-be-no-be void. I was just thinking that.

20:56.320 --> 21:01.040
But here's the thing. Here's the thing is that unfortunately

21:01.040 --> 21:05.560
there's a lot more that could have been done here.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.520
What about me getting to compete with my friends?

21:08.520 --> 21:12.320
I also don't think the challenges are particularly that challenging.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.400
3,000 steps in a day, either the device is very generous in what it's

21:16.400 --> 21:17.000
measuring

21:17.000 --> 21:20.520
or, but looking at the graphs I can kind of remember, oh yeah, this is my

21:20.520 --> 21:23.120
lunch. This is when I was walking down to get coffee for the day.

21:23.120 --> 21:27.040
You know, it's kind of funny that you remember those things. But I didn't find 3,000 steps

21:27.040 --> 21:30.040
particularly challenging. I kind of do that in a normal day. Maybe it's because I'm a

21:30.040 --> 21:32.560
teacher and I pace the room as I teach. Well, can you increase it?

21:32.560 --> 21:36.600
No. At least I haven't seen that happen yet. You can set your own goals for

21:36.600 --> 21:39.280
yourself, but the game always challenges you to get to 3,000.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.720
I think it's, from what it seems like, it's actually trying to encourage

21:42.720 --> 21:45.960
an average number of steps. Like, especially if people are,

21:45.960 --> 21:49.960
you know, not really, like, for example, me.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.840
If I'm working at my desk job, I'm not supposed to get up from my desk that much.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.120
I normally wouldn't get up, except I

21:56.120 --> 22:00.520
get up and walk all the time. You know what I mean? It's to encourage people to have a

22:00.520 --> 22:01.200
normal

22:01.200 --> 22:03.840
amount of activity. And I think that's what the game is ultimately trying to do. And I

22:03.840 --> 22:05.560
think the other thing I want to point out is that

22:05.560 --> 22:10.720
the game also, you know, it gives you these little mini goals like,

22:10.720 --> 22:14.360
hey, your mini goal for today, watch the number of calories you consume.

22:14.360 --> 22:19.280
Or go for the longest walk you possibly can today. It does give you little mini goals,

22:19.280 --> 22:22.160
but the game doesn't really reward you or punish you if you don't meet them. You track

22:22.160 --> 22:23.160
them on a calendar, that's it.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.640
I find this game to be an enhancement

22:26.640 --> 22:30.320
to an already, you know, if you think this kind of information is worth it to you,

22:30.320 --> 22:32.880
like, you want to be able to track your walking patterns,

22:32.880 --> 22:36.520
you want a little bit of incentive, go for it. But I think there could have been

22:36.520 --> 22:38.280
a lot more that could have been done with this game.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.480
I don't think it's worth $50. What they should have done, and what I'm

22:41.480 --> 22:45.320
guessing they probably didn't do because this is Nintendo and they take the easy way out,

22:45.320 --> 22:49.880
is they should have been integrated this game where you can track that data

22:49.880 --> 22:54.440
for Wii Fit Plus. They probably didn't do that because then that would mean

22:54.440 --> 22:58.000
effort and they're not going to put that effort in. Yeah, I just,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.080
or I think a better comparison would be EA Active. I think EA Active probably does the

23:02.080 --> 23:04.880
best job that I've seen so far out of all the games that have really given you

23:04.880 --> 23:06.600
like a plan and having you stick to it.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.520
So proceed with caution with personal trainer walking. If you are,

23:10.520 --> 23:13.840
you know, interested in this, I don't think you absolutely need it.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.920
Really what you need, not this game, is Walk It Out from Konami.

23:17.920 --> 23:21.600
A game where you're not only walking, you're fake walking

23:21.600 --> 23:24.640
in a game, listening to music.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.200
So you're basically marching in place. This sounds

23:28.200 --> 23:31.360
idiotic. It's a walking game. It's a rhythm

23:31.360 --> 23:35.160
music game that's walking. You walk to a rhythm, basically.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.160
You know what, that reminds me of what I used to do about

23:38.160 --> 23:43.160
13 years ago when I would stay in my bedroom listening to Sunscream,

23:43.160 --> 23:46.440
if anyone remembers that group. No. I see these in my closet there.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.120
And just jumping around my room like an

23:50.120 --> 23:53.280
idiot with the door closed because that was my exercise. Nice.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.000
So again, proceed with caution with personal trainer walking. I think there is

23:57.000 --> 24:00.520
benefit to be had in it, but at $50, I think that's asking a bit much, even

24:00.520 --> 24:02.000
though it does come with two pedometers.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.480
I want to answer a question in chat, and they didn't change their nickname, but it's a

24:05.480 --> 24:06.560
good question. It's

24:06.560 --> 24:09.760
8283 in our chat room. They get just

24:09.760 --> 24:13.920
barcode numbers. Ask a vet how to change your nickname if you want me to read your real

24:13.920 --> 24:14.840
name in the future.

24:14.840 --> 24:18.840
Do you have to leave your DS on to track it? No. The little pedometer

24:18.840 --> 24:22.240
must have a pretty powerful battery in there because it just works.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.560
You just communicate with your DS once a day, you know, and then

24:25.560 --> 24:28.880
you don't have to leave your DS on at all. The little pedometer is very tiny. It's about the

24:28.880 --> 24:29.480
size

24:29.480 --> 24:33.640
a little larger than a silver dollar, honest. Well, maybe not.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.120
Maybe like a quarter of the size of the iPhone is about how big it is.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.360
And you just leave it in your pocket, and that does all the tracking for you. So

24:40.360 --> 24:40.880
there you go.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.400
All right. We're going to get into some housekeeping real quick, and then we're going to mix it up a

24:45.400 --> 24:47.960
little bit. I want to start tonight with release dates because we want to get to those

24:47.960 --> 24:49.120
before Dark Sakura leaves.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.840
So we'll start tonight with release dates and then get into the normal gaming news.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.200
But some housekeeping tonight. Next week, again, we won't be here live. There will be

24:56.200 --> 24:58.440
a Best Of with new content on the feed

24:58.440 --> 25:02.480
tape, so look out for that. I do also want to say this. This is a bit of

25:02.480 --> 25:04.720
unfortunate news. I don't like having to

25:04.720 --> 25:07.840
kind of go on this and backtrack on something, but

25:07.840 --> 25:11.120
we here at Orange Launch Radio also have personal lives as well, and sometimes

25:11.120 --> 25:11.880
things come up.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.920
There was a charity event that we planned on doing on October 17th for

25:15.920 --> 25:16.800
Extra Life.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.960
We unfortunately are going to have to back out of that, and that's not an easy thing to have to

25:20.960 --> 25:23.380
say or do, especially when you consider it's charity.

25:23.380 --> 25:26.800
However, there is a conflict has arisen with my day job.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.640
It is one I have to do, and I'm sure as you can all understand, work comes first

25:30.640 --> 25:34.160
even before some of these other things. So unfortunately, we will have to back out of

25:34.160 --> 25:36.280
the Extra Life event and not participate.

25:36.280 --> 25:40.280
But, we will make a nice donation on behalf of Orange Launch Radio to one of

25:40.280 --> 25:40.800
the groups

25:40.800 --> 25:44.160
participating. There may yet be something

25:44.160 --> 25:48.360
to be mentioned later. We might do something in the future

25:48.360 --> 25:53.200
that we'll do, but as far as

25:53.200 --> 25:56.120
us doing our show for 24 hours and all that, we're not going to be able to do

25:56.120 --> 25:58.480
that because unfortunately I'm just not going to be available. I have work

25:58.480 --> 25:59.360
commitments.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.800
Yeah, so that's a really sucky thing, but you know,

26:02.800 --> 26:06.720
best of luck to those guys. I think it's for a great cause. We'll certainly be donating

26:06.720 --> 26:10.080
and, you know, again, good luck. I hope we can do our own charity thing

26:10.080 --> 26:15.360
in the winter. Also, I believe Bobby Blackwell's Friday Night Gaming is doing

26:15.360 --> 26:16.780
something in the next couple weeks.

26:16.780 --> 26:20.440
I think they're doing it like two weeks after, and I apologize if I misstating

26:20.440 --> 26:21.360
anything, but I think

26:21.360 --> 26:24.960
he mentioned something about that. So lots of fun charity events coming up,

26:24.960 --> 26:29.480
all for good causes, so keep your eyes out for that.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.240
Okay, we're going to get into release dates tonight. Let's start off, we're a little

26:33.240 --> 26:35.840
bit out of turn tonight. We'll get into long discussion news, but I wanted to get to

26:35.840 --> 26:38.640
release dates before DarkSakura has to go. Let's start off with US,

26:38.640 --> 26:42.400
or you want to start with UK tonight? I could do that, since we're completely going out of order.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.400
Sure, why not? I just have to check on what today is.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.640
Okay, for our UK release dates,

26:48.640 --> 26:51.920
we have on the 29th,

26:51.920 --> 26:56.160
Jam Sessions 2 for DS, and Left 4 Dead Crash Course,

26:56.160 --> 26:59.160
and Tales of Monkey Island, Lair of the Leviathan,

26:59.160 --> 27:02.840
and on the 30th, Fate Unlimited codes.

27:02.840 --> 27:08.080
Also, on the first Fallout 3, Operation Anchorage,

27:08.080 --> 27:11.960
Fallout 3 The Pit, and Gran Turismo for PSP.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.560
There's Beta Raider

27:16.560 --> 27:20.160
on PSP, and Dead Space Extraction,

27:20.160 --> 27:23.600
FIFA 10, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2,

27:23.600 --> 27:29.120
and Risen for PC. I just want to quickly say, Bobby in chat clarified

27:29.120 --> 27:32.720
his charity event as October 30th. That's him and his Friday Night Gaming

27:32.720 --> 27:36.600
project, so keep an eye out for that. Beta Raider, that's the Timbaland game, right?

27:36.600 --> 27:40.760
on PSP? Yes, it is. Beta Raider. That just sounds vile.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.200
It does a little bit. It's a little bit dirty. Sounds like Beta operator.

27:44.200 --> 27:48.360
Okay, you had to go there. Yes, I did. Why don't we do US next, Loki?

27:48.360 --> 27:52.360
Ah, yes. US, well, we're getting quite a bit of stuff this week.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.480
Starting off with the re-release of Midnight Club LA,

27:55.480 --> 27:58.520
the complete edition with all the download content intact,

27:58.520 --> 28:02.880
available for 30 bucks on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

28:02.880 --> 28:06.320
Also this week, Tornado Outbreak

28:06.320 --> 28:09.880
on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.400
Family Feud coming out on the DS

28:13.400 --> 28:17.160
and the PC and Wii. Battle of Giants Dragons

28:17.160 --> 28:22.320
on the Nintendo DS. Also, Animal Kingdom Wildlife Expedition

28:22.320 --> 28:26.200
on the Wii from Tecmo. Family Fun Football

28:26.200 --> 28:29.320
also on the Wii. Ninja Gaiden 2

28:29.320 --> 28:32.720
or Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, or Gaiden,

28:32.720 --> 28:36.120
sorry, I keep mispronouncing that. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2

28:36.120 --> 28:39.240
will be coming out this week as well on PlayStation 3.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.320
Hidden Mysteries Titan. Just remember, he's not gay.

28:42.320 --> 28:47.280
He's banging Irene, remember? The old school games? He's getting it on with Irene at the end.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.720
Okay. Alright, just saying.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.320
Anyways, Hidden Mysteries Titanic on the Wii and DS.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.560
My Sims Agents on DS and Wii.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.800
Kinda funny, I found out one of my friends is actually doing the artwork

29:00.800 --> 29:05.120
on the My Sims games, and she's really talented. Family Party

29:05.120 --> 29:10.880
30 Great Games Outdoor Fun on the Wii. Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 Days

29:10.880 --> 29:14.520
on the Nintendo DS. On PC, Fallen Earth,

29:14.520 --> 29:19.440
Welcome to the Apocalypse. The Wizard of Oz will be on the Yellow Brick Road

29:19.440 --> 29:23.960
on Nintendo DS this week. Imagine Salon Stylist

29:23.960 --> 29:29.360
on the DS. Really? Really. Do you chop hair with your stylist or something?

29:29.360 --> 29:32.600
I think you do. Undead Knights

29:32.600 --> 29:36.480
on PSP from Tecmo. Deca Sports 2

29:36.480 --> 29:39.880
on the Wii. Valhalla Knights Eldar Saga

29:39.880 --> 29:44.280
on the Wii. And see here.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.360
Gran Turismo PSP.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.880
Coming to the PSP. And

29:51.880 --> 29:55.120
then about a week from today actually

29:55.120 --> 29:59.280
we're gonna be getting Wii Sports, or not Wii Sports, Wii Fit Plus

29:59.280 --> 30:02.360
which will be available in the game only and bundle

30:02.360 --> 30:05.740
that's coming out on the Wii. But the game only is 20 bucks.

30:05.740 --> 30:08.720
Which kinda surprised us. We thought Nintendo might try to gouge a little bit on the

30:08.720 --> 30:10.000
price but they're actually kinda

30:10.000 --> 30:13.400
you know, giving a little break. Only 20 bucks for all the new stuff. Well, the game's exactly the same

30:13.400 --> 30:17.560
except for a few slight changes. Yeah, I hope that they give a break. Well, doesn't it have like an internet thing now?

30:17.560 --> 30:21.080
Which is what I was thinking this personal trainer should have.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.840
You can customize your training

30:24.840 --> 30:27.920
schedule or guests in there and you can also, there's a few more minigames and stuff.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.240
But it's essentially the same damn game just re-released and enhanced.

30:31.240 --> 30:36.720
Alright, fair enough. Dreamer Top Model on DS and wrapping things up.

30:36.720 --> 30:40.200
Risen

30:40.200 --> 30:46.000
on PC. Alright. Quickly going over the Japanese release dates. Coming out on

30:46.000 --> 30:47.200
October 1st

30:47.200 --> 30:50.560
we have Gears of War 2. The Game of the Year edition makes its way.

30:50.560 --> 30:54.400
That's actually in the other Asia regions, not just Japan. So keep an eye out for that.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.680
Also coming out on the 1st of October, X-Edge Dash comes out on the Xbox 360 as

30:58.680 --> 30:59.200
well as

30:59.200 --> 31:03.360
Shin Sangoku Mosu multi-raid special comes out from Koei.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.200
Moving on over to the PlayStation 3.

31:07.200 --> 31:11.200
Pulling up those release dates. Which if I remember correctly, the multi-raid one now,

31:11.200 --> 31:13.660
they actually have added in the costumes from

31:13.660 --> 31:17.680
Ninja Gaiden as well. Yes, and I think that's coming up a little later in the show. Sorry.

31:17.680 --> 31:21.520
No, that's okay. Spoiled it. That's alright. I think it came out of Tokyo Game Show and

31:21.520 --> 31:24.040
I think there's a little vice versa going on. We'll get into that later.

31:24.040 --> 31:29.080
Trinity Universe comes out on the PlayStation 3 also in a limited edition

31:29.080 --> 31:32.920
case if you're looking for that. I'm not sure what kind of game that is. I haven't

31:32.920 --> 31:35.040
even heard of this. It looks like some type of

31:35.040 --> 31:40.200
role-playing game but I guess it's kinda more of a light and fun.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.960
Due to a freak accident during an important ceremony

31:43.960 --> 31:48.480
you are turned into the Puppy Demon Lord. Oh, that sounds unfortunate.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.800
That's on the PlayStation 3.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.840
It looks like it could be interesting.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.280
It's got the Disgaea Penguins in it. What the hell are these things

31:58.280 --> 32:01.840
named? I can't remember.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.840
The little penguin dudes from... God damn it.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.760
Somebody will remember in chat. We have to say goodbye to Dark Sakura by the way.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.640
She's on her way out.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.680
I think that's actually the Trinity thing. I think that's actually one of those

32:12.680 --> 32:15.180
games. It's a cross game where they have the characters from everything.

32:15.180 --> 32:19.280
Prinny! Thank you Jay Dizzle who was first to say it in chat. God, the name was on the tip of my tongue.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.760
I'm gonna go ahead and leave my name in chat just in case anyone wants to send me a message.

32:22.760 --> 32:26.360
Alright. Take care Dark Sakura. Have a good night and hopefully we'll see you when you get back.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.120
I don't know if we'll still be on or not but we'll see.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.520
Should be. Alright. Moving on to some other releases

32:31.520 --> 32:34.720
on the Nintendo Wii

32:34.720 --> 32:39.360
on October 1st. I have a long way to scroll because of all the releases here.

32:39.360 --> 32:43.040
Wii Fit Plus makes its way to Japan. Of course that is also coming with the board

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
and a mat if you want it.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.600
Dead Space Extraction comes out as well as

32:48.600 --> 32:51.800
some karaoke games are making their way out.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.840
Moving on to...

32:53.840 --> 32:58.440
They're not branded games though. On to the PlayStation 2.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.720
Yes, they are still cranking out the games for PlayStation 2 over there.

33:01.720 --> 33:05.320
They all have very long complicated names. I'll give you a taste of them.

33:05.320 --> 33:09.400
Hiro no Kakeru Shin Tamayori Hime Denshuu comes out.

33:09.400 --> 33:16.040
And also Momosuke Kofu no Misasagi O comes out.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.040
But I know you guys are probably very interested in Beatmania 2DX16

33:20.040 --> 33:23.080
Empress Plus Premium Best. That is coming out in two weeks.

33:23.080 --> 33:27.680
That's like the uber Beatmania 2DX game coming out. That's supposed to have like 150 songs in it.

33:27.680 --> 33:31.600
Like something nuts. That's pretty awesome. Well it's like the last PS2 game I think they're doing.

33:31.600 --> 33:36.000
So, keep an eye out for that. Moving on to the handhelds real quick.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
On the Nintendo DS this week.

33:38.000 --> 33:45.600
Nothing I recognize with name stuff by name, but I do notice Blue Dragon is next week.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.600
There's a Blue Dragon game coming out on the DS over there.

33:47.600 --> 33:53.400
Coming out on the PSP if anything this week.

33:53.400 --> 33:58.000
Gran Turismo comes out in Japan just like it's coming out over here on the PSP.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.600
Also Macross Ultimate Frontier.

34:01.600 --> 34:06.800
You know, I actually missed quite a few titles here for the US as well.

34:06.800 --> 34:13.600
Real quick, we're also getting the Beater Raider on the PSP.

34:13.600 --> 34:20.400
There's going to be a new Kebales game, Big Game Hunter 2010 also on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

34:20.400 --> 34:25.600
Sideswiped on the DS which looks like a pretty cool kind of full auto game.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.400
Rapala Wii Fish on the Wii.

34:28.400 --> 34:34.400
And Obscure the Aftermath on PSP.

34:34.400 --> 34:38.200
And then some other games, but I'm not going to mention those.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.800
Alright, now we can get into some news.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.400
So we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.600
And now it's just Loki and I just holding down the fort over the next few hours.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.000
But you guys in chat as well.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.600
So, Loki's going to steal Jamie's chair.

34:52.600 --> 34:56.600
That chair is way uncomfortable and too small and I'm getting a headache from sitting on it.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.200
Oh no. I'll have to figure out something in the future.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.000
Oh yeah, that's much better.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.400
You know what's funny? I think I have a folding chair in my car, of all places.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.800
I don't care. This chair is much better.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.600
Alright, fair enough. Well, it is her throne after all.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.400
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?

35:12.400 --> 35:17.000
So, in case you weren't aware, there was a Wii price drop today.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.200
It dropped down to $1.99. It was one of those really well-kept secrets, I guess.

35:24.200 --> 35:29.800
You know, it's not like numerous ads leaked out and leaks everywhere.

35:29.800 --> 35:34.400
Okay, so maybe it wasn't so secret, but it is official now.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.600
And that's kind of cool.

35:38.600 --> 35:43.400
To kind of go along with that though, in Europe, you don't get a price drop. Sorry.

35:43.400 --> 35:50.400
However, you do get a new bundle, and they're going to be including both Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort in that bundle.

35:50.400 --> 35:55.200
So, I guess a little more bang for your buck, which is kind of cool.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.000
You know what's funny? Is that on last week's show, I predicted that that would be a bundle.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.400
So, I was kind of half right, because I kind of meant that it would be a bundle here,

36:02.400 --> 36:04.600
but it ends up that it's going to be a bundle over there.

36:04.600 --> 36:10.400
Yeah, I mean, it's... I don't know. We may see something like that come over here if they're really hurting for sales,

36:10.400 --> 36:14.800
but I don't think that right now they're going to bring it over here.

36:14.800 --> 36:20.600
I don't know if you did see, though, Wii Sports Resort, though, is going to be getting a different bundle over here,

36:20.600 --> 36:27.000
actually, in a few months, where they're going to be including two Wii Motion Pluses with it instead of just one.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
So, you get a, you know, a little bit of a savings there as well.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
Hoping they'll drive some more sales for that, I guess.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.400
I have to read this little Z-statement in chat first before we discuss this story.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.000
I'm amazed that Suma, in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com, says,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.600
Headache for sitting in a chair. Guess we know where Loki's brain was located.

36:46.600 --> 36:52.800
It's a tension headache from my neck, because it's bad posture in that chair, and I have to sit forward,

36:52.800 --> 36:58.400
and there's, I mean, literally, the back of the chair comes up to, like, almost my waist, and that's it.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.800
Yeah, you insensitive ass.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.800
And I had to drive from Oakland, okay? So, that's enough to give you a headache.

37:04.800 --> 37:11.400
Alright, and all's there is this. Loki, is this going to help sales of the Wii over there?

37:11.400 --> 37:14.000
Well, I mean, of course it's going to help sell more Wiis,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.600
but is it going to keep the Wii the number one system this holiday season, you think?

37:17.600 --> 37:22.400
Well, right now, the problem is that they've, I mean, there's already plenty of systems out there,

37:22.400 --> 37:25.400
so they're going to be the number one system. I'm sure this will help.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.600
The Wii's going to be popular anyways.

37:28.600 --> 37:35.800
Software-wise, so there's nothing really, other than New Super Mario Bros. Wii, that's that amazing.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.000
A triple-A title.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.200
There's no real, like, must-have titles coming out this fall.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.800
I mean, there's going to be good titles coming out, but nothing like,

37:42.800 --> 37:47.600
oh my god, it's a new Zelda game, or oh my god, you know, it's, you know.

37:47.600 --> 37:51.200
I guess it's a new Mario game, but, I mean, it's kind of, like,

37:51.200 --> 37:57.200
literally putting in the least amount of effort possible into a Mario game, is what I'm seeing there,

37:57.200 --> 38:01.800
because it's not like, you know, transitioning from, like, Mario World to Mario 64,

38:01.800 --> 38:07.800
where those are completely different, and you can tell that, you know, this was something that they really thought out.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.400
New Super Mario Bros. Wii just seems like,

38:10.400 --> 38:15.400
eh, let's throw, you know, a game where there's four players and stuff like that, and kind of run with it.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.600
And if I remember correctly, isn't that the one that plays the game for yourself, or plays the game for you or something?

38:19.600 --> 38:23.200
Yeah, it has that whole little controversial pause and skip ahead mode,

38:23.200 --> 38:26.800
but I was just going to say, old school is new school, remember?

38:26.800 --> 38:27.300
Yeah.

38:27.300 --> 38:31.600
That's not, I'm not so hung up on the graphics and all that stuff, like, I'm cool with the way they're doing the game.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.400
I actually, I would like to see a Mario game like that.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.800
No, I'm fine with the game being that way. I'm talking, like, the effort put into it.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.000
I'm not saying that they, you know, went and improved the graphics or anything.

38:39.000 --> 38:50.400
I'm saying, like, you know, I guess the example would be, like, you know, Mario 1 to Mario 2 in Japan, okay?

38:50.400 --> 38:55.200
There was some new levels in there, but they didn't go and add anything really new as far as the game and stuff,

38:55.200 --> 39:01.600
you know, whereas Mario 3 was completely new, you know, Mario World was completely new.

39:01.600 --> 39:07.200
It's just, I don't know, this doesn't really seem, like, it's like half-assed releases is what it is.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.200
You know what's funny, though? I think this game is still going to be huge.

39:10.200 --> 39:14.000
You know why? Everybody fucking loves Mario Brothers.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.200
Everybody, and when I say everybody, I don't mean just gamers.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.000
Everybody knows Super Mario Brothers, the old school Nintendo game.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.800
People are retarded. They will buy anything that has Mario in it.

39:23.800 --> 39:28.600
That's why Mario Tennis sells well. It's a fucking tennis game.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.600
But it's got Mario, so I must buy it, you know?

39:31.600 --> 39:35.800
If they came out with, like, and you know what they're going to fucking do?

39:35.800 --> 39:38.200
This is how they're going to sell that crappy Vitality sensor.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.000
It's going to be Mario, like, Dr. Mario's Vitality sensor or some shit like that.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.200
Dr. Mario visits trauma center? What's this?

39:44.200 --> 39:46.400
No, Vitality sensor.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.000
They're going to have, like, a-

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
If Dr. Mario was a puzzle game, that doesn't get your Vitality.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.600
It doesn't matter. The character Dr. Mario will be in there, you know, because people will be like,

39:52.600 --> 39:55.000
Oh my God, Mario must buy it!

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
So, I don't know.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
Well, it's effort for trying, but it's going to be hard with not that many big releases coming out,

40:04.000 --> 40:08.200
whereas the 360 and PlayStation 3 have a lot of releases coming out that are going to be really big titles.

40:08.200 --> 40:13.800
But you know, then again, you know, the people that buy the Wii aren't necessarily looking for the big titles.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.200
They're just going to buy Mario games.

40:15.200 --> 40:21.200
And honestly, I just want to go on record and say I think this new Super Mario Brothers game is,

40:21.200 --> 40:23.200
for that audience, the game.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.000
You know what I mean? I don't think you're giving it enough credit.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.200
From a gamer perspective, I get what you're saying,

40:28.200 --> 40:32.400
but from an accessibility perspective and selling to the soccer moms of America,

40:32.400 --> 40:37.000
I totally get what they're doing here, and I think the game will sell pretty well.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.200
If it were Mario Galaxy 2 right now, it'd be a little bit different.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.200
Weird that that's not out already.

40:43.200 --> 40:48.200
I mean, they have teased that game that it is coming out, but it's surprising it's not coming out this holiday season.

40:48.200 --> 40:53.200
These are first-party games now. It's only like one or two a month, or not even a month.

40:53.200 --> 41:00.200
It's like, let's say there's some really obscure DS games out there that suck and end up being like something else.

41:00.200 --> 41:04.200
Like, okay, Professor Layton's pretty awesome. Okay, that did well.

41:04.200 --> 41:10.200
Fossil Fighters, though, is exactly the same as this other game that was put out called Fossil League DTS, I think.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.200
And it came out from Sega a while ago.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.200
I mean, it's literally almost exactly the same game.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.200
And it did pretty horrible.

41:19.200 --> 41:24.200
And Legend of, what is it, Legendary Starfie or something like that, which was a series that was only in Japan,

41:24.200 --> 41:28.200
they finally brought it out over here in June, and that tanked as well.

41:28.200 --> 41:34.200
And so there's a lot of DS titles that they keep putting out that really tank, even though they're kind of okay titles.

41:34.200 --> 41:39.200
And then the Wii games, like, you know, I thought Excitebots would have been fucking awesome.

41:39.200 --> 41:44.200
You know, it's a sequel to Excite Truck, and it kind of tanked.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.200
And then Wii Sports Resort, it's doing well.

41:47.200 --> 41:52.200
But I don't think as well as someone would figure for a Wii Sports sequel,

41:52.200 --> 41:55.200
you would think that that thing would be flying off the shelves, like selling millions of copies.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.200
I think it's going to be a gradual sell throughout Christmas.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.200
I think that that's going to be under a lot of Christmas trees this season.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.200
And, you know, Wii Fit Plus, I mean, come on.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.200
It's just, stop releasing the same damn games.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.200
Do something absolutely new. Something groundbreaking.

42:11.200 --> 42:17.200
Again, I think all these games, the new Super Mario Brothers, the Wii Sports Resort, the Wii Fit Plus,

42:17.200 --> 42:20.200
these games are going to show up under many Christmas trees this holiday season.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.200
Those games are still going to sell very well.

42:22.200 --> 42:26.200
And I get, believe me, as a hardcore gamer, I get what you're saying.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.200
They cashed out. That's what they did. They cashed out.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.200
They sold out.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.200
They sold out.

42:30.200 --> 42:34.200
But you know what? They're making, they're shitting money at this point.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.200
Can you blame them? Can you blame them?

42:36.200 --> 42:41.200
Exactly. But it's the point, you know, just like a musician, you know,

42:41.200 --> 42:44.200
you get to the point where you're so rich that you can go and do those crazy ass things

42:44.200 --> 42:47.200
because if they fail, it doesn't matter. You're fucking rich.

42:47.200 --> 42:51.200
So that's the thing. They need to go out and start doing the crazy shit.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.200
But no, they're playing it safe.

42:53.200 --> 42:57.200
They need to take out the motorbike and they need to try and jump the shark.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.200
And you can't play it safe and win American Idol. Okay.

43:00.200 --> 43:10.200
I never thought the wife getting you into American Idol would ever help your perspectives here on the program,

43:10.200 --> 43:11.200
but you just proved me wrong.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.200
Hey, I want to read some comments from the chat room.

43:13.200 --> 43:16.200
And there was an interesting perspective from Tiger Claw in our chat room

43:16.200 --> 43:21.200
at chat.orangestonesradio.com talking about the Mario being hoarded in all the different games.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.200
They did soccer, baseball, and tennis.

43:23.200 --> 43:27.200
The next game would have to be Mario hockey.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.200
Now wouldn't that be fun? You could just clock Mario in the face in a ringside fight.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.200
I think that's why they haven't done Mario hockey.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
They haven't done Mario hockey, yeah.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.200
And because hockey is just not popular right now.

43:40.200 --> 43:49.200
I mean, as far as a game, hockey and sadly enough, soccer are just the dogs of sports games.

43:49.200 --> 43:55.200
And soccer or football around the world is literally the biggest sport worldwide.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.200
But in the Americas, it sucks balls.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.200
Or at least in North America.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.200
Is it big in Japan?

44:02.200 --> 44:03.200
It is big in Japan, yes.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.200
Football is really big in Japan.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.200
But baseball is really big in Japan.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
Yeah, baseball is huge in Japan.

44:08.200 --> 44:13.200
And it's just, over here, it's just tanks.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.200
But they had Mario Strikers.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.200
And it did okay.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.200
But, you know, not...

44:19.200 --> 44:22.200
Well, what else to sell to soccer moms but a soccer game?

44:22.200 --> 44:25.200
They had Mario Football, you know, or something like that.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.200
I don't know, maybe that would sell better.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.200
But it's just...

44:30.200 --> 44:32.200
And then again, it doesn't matter because it has Mario in it.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.200
Seriously, when I'm selling this to my customers, you know, if I said,

44:35.200 --> 44:40.200
Hey, look, it's Mario Dodgeball or something, or not even dodgeball.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.200
Let me think of a crappier sport.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.200
Mario Curling, okay?

44:43.200 --> 44:45.200
And they'd be like, Oh, Mario, I'm buying that.

44:45.200 --> 44:50.200
You know, it could be something completely crappy.

44:50.200 --> 44:53.200
Wow.

44:53.200 --> 44:58.200
You know, Mario Water Polo or Mario...

44:58.200 --> 45:04.200
Hey, we might have some water polo players that kind of resent that remark you're making.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.200
What they need is like a Mario snowboarding game.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.200
That'd be pretty sweet.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.200
How about another Mario Paint?

45:10.200 --> 45:11.200
That's what I want to see.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.200
Oh, yeah.

45:12.200 --> 45:18.200
And where the fuck is that damn Bob Ross game that they promised us from a long-ass time ago?

45:18.200 --> 45:19.200
Where the hell is that shit?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
Did it get canceled?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.200
Didn't we have a story on that a while back that got canceled?

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
It's a painting game.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
Come on.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.200
It's perfect.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.200
All right.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.200
And I do know that they do have a Mario snowboarding game.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
It's Mario and Sonic, but whatever.

45:31.200 --> 45:32.200
All right.

45:32.200 --> 45:36.200
Let's move on and talk about something besides Mario.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.200
But we will stay on the topic of price drops, and we'll talk about Microsoft.

45:39.200 --> 45:42.200
Granted, we already know that the Xbox 360 recently got a price drop.

45:42.200 --> 45:47.200
But there, of course, is a mole out there that helps out the website Ars Technica.

45:47.200 --> 45:52.200
And apparently, they had reported earlier this week that there was going to be some

45:52.200 --> 45:54.200
other types of price drops going on.

45:54.200 --> 45:59.200
And apparently, there's going to be a holiday bundle that includes Pure and Lego Batman

45:59.200 --> 46:04.200
with an Xbox 360 Elite, kind of like a little bundle coming out over there, which apparently

46:04.200 --> 46:06.200
Joystick has their own mole.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
That's Joystick with a Q.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.200
They've got a picture of what it looks like, although it looks like it might be like an

46:09.200 --> 46:12.200
Australian box because of the ratings on the cover there.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.200
You have the banner that they have.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.200
The other ones are US.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.200
Gotcha.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.200
Yeah.

46:17.200 --> 46:22.200
So once pictures surface, you kind of know that's going to happen.

46:22.200 --> 46:23.200
I don't think it was Photoshopped either.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
It looked pretty legit.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.200
Yeah.

46:25.200 --> 46:32.200
Also, supposedly getting a price drop over in Microsoft's world, the 802.11n adapter.

46:32.200 --> 46:33.200
I'm sorry.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.200
That is the new one because it's n.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.200
That's coming out for $100.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.200
The G is getting the price drop to $79.99.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.200
Still way too damn expensive.

46:41.200 --> 46:46.200
For a feature that you should consider that the PlayStation 3 has built into it.

46:46.200 --> 46:55.200
And seriously, you could go buy a wireless switch or whatever way cheaper than that,

46:55.200 --> 46:56.200
and it would work perfectly.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.200
Yeah.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
I have a non-Xbox 360 router.

46:58.200 --> 47:03.200
I have a wireless gaming router that's supposed to work with all my systems that I just basically

47:03.200 --> 47:06.200
run a CAT5 from my box to this gaming router, and it works fine.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.200
It works perfect.

47:07.200 --> 47:13.200
And when I had my PlayStation 2 online once in a while for the DDR games that were online

47:13.200 --> 47:17.200
and Amplitude and stuff, I would just switch out the CAT5 from the Xbox and the PlayStation

47:17.200 --> 47:18.200
2 and it worked fine.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.200
It worked great.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.200
Yeah.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.200
So, you know.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.200
And I think the original Xbox I would use that with too.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.200
So it worked great for all those systems.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.200
Well, they overcharge for everything.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.200
I mean, look at how much their fucking hard drives are.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.200
And hard drives are damn cheap.

47:32.200 --> 47:38.200
You know, for a hundred bucks, you can get a terabyte now.

47:38.200 --> 47:43.200
So, why is it a hundred dollars for a hundred and twenty gigs?

47:43.200 --> 47:44.200
You know, seriously.

47:44.200 --> 47:47.200
Bring down the price.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.200
Some comments in chat.

47:48.200 --> 47:52.200
ACDEF says there's going to be a bundle that includes the wireless adapter, a media controller,

47:52.200 --> 47:54.200
one thousand Microsoft points, and three months of live.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.200
Yes.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.200
And it looks like a big box of popcorn.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.200
How cute.

47:59.200 --> 48:03.200
I guess is that targeted at the Netflix audience?

48:03.200 --> 48:04.200
Probably.

48:04.200 --> 48:05.200
Probably.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.200
All right.

48:06.200 --> 48:10.200
Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchery.com as we tape on this

48:10.200 --> 48:12.200
lovely Sunday evening at allgames.com.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.200
No, it's not too big of a surprise.

48:14.200 --> 48:17.200
I mean, because the Japanese love their Final Fantasy.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.200
So, of course.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.200
I love my Final Fantasy.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.200
I'm with Japan there.

48:21.200 --> 48:22.200
I do too.

48:22.200 --> 48:29.200
And, you know, announced at Tokyo Game Show to go along with the going to be, you know,

48:29.200 --> 48:31.200
epic release of Final Fantasy 13.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.200
Of course, the Final Fantasy 13 PlayStation 3.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Oh, but it gets better.

48:36.200 --> 48:39.200
It's also got 250 gigabyte hard drive.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.200
Yes.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Apparently the FCC doesn't lie.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.200
Oh, but wait a second.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.200
The FCC is only in the U.S.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.200
So, maybe that's coming out over here later on.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.200
But it is.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.200
Oh, interesting.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.200
But it is coming out in Japan.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.200
It's got...

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
Fuck!

48:53.200 --> 48:55.200
I wish I'd waited for the PlayStation 3 then.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.200
If they're going to release a Final Fantasy 13 one here.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.200
That sounds awesome.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.200
And it dropped in price.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.200
But anyways.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.200
Does yours have backwards compatibility?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
No.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.200
I have like the crappiest PlayStation 3 possible.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.200
It's a fat and it doesn't have backwards compatibility.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.200
And I bought it six months before the price dropped.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.200
I'm just praying mine doesn't die.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.200
Because I've got full backwards compatibility.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.200
And I use it.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.200
Never.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.200
Hmm.

49:19.200 --> 49:23.200
Well, you know, backwards compatibility might be coming back.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.200
But that's in the future.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.200
We'll get to that story later.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.200
Not a big thing.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.200
At a price.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
Anyways.

49:30.200 --> 49:37.200
So this new system is going to be coming out for 41,600 yen.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.200
And also it's got...

49:41.200 --> 49:47.200
It basically looks like a white, possibly silver system with like a pink silkscreen on it.

49:47.200 --> 49:51.200
So a little bit on the fruity side there.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.200
If you ask me.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.200
I would think a black silkscreen.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.200
Which makes it awesome.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.200
A black silkscreen would look better.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.200
It would show up better.

49:58.200 --> 50:03.200
Because it's a little hard to see.

50:03.200 --> 50:08.200
But then also of course with a matching white controller and that kind of thing.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.200
And to go along with that though.

50:11.200 --> 50:14.200
There's going to be some more bundles coming out.

50:14.200 --> 50:19.200
Of course not in the US because god forbid we actually announce something over here.

50:19.200 --> 50:24.200
They're going to be having a 250GB system for quite a few different games.

50:24.200 --> 50:28.200
Including the new Ratchet and Clank, Crack in Time.

50:28.200 --> 50:36.200
Also Assassin's Creed 2, FIFA 10, Need for Speed Shift, and Uncharted 2.

50:36.200 --> 50:43.200
And these are all kind of leaked out of a Norwegian GameStop database.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
Wow.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.200
Yes.

50:45.200 --> 50:52.200
So you better believe if they're getting it over there we're probably going to get it over here.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.200
Maybe not that many bundles.

50:53.200 --> 50:57.200
That would be really freaking crazy.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
In time for Christmas though right?

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
I'm sure we'll get something.

50:59.200 --> 51:02.200
They're going to announce something in time for Christmas.

51:02.200 --> 51:06.200
Just a cash in on that I guess.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.200
I don't know.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.200
Well you know if you see Xbox 360 getting one.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.200
You know that Playstation 3 is going to have one as well.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.200
Not necessarily.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.200
I mean they do one every year.

51:14.200 --> 51:18.200
They've done it for the last three years with the Xbox 360.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.200
You know this year they're actually.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.200
Because the arcade I think last year had one game bundled with it.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.200
And then the other ones had two.

51:24.200 --> 51:30.200
They had the Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.

51:30.200 --> 51:33.200
These games we had a million extra copies of sitting over here.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.200
Actually the Lego one sold pretty good huh?

51:35.200 --> 51:38.200
But that Kung Fu Panda couldn't have been a huge.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.200
It's actually supposed to be pretty good.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
Is it?

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
Yeah.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
I'll shut up.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
It's like my kids first action game.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.200
Alright.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.200
Loki is now going to take us to the next story.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.200
Which is probably in my opinion.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.200
I think kind of the biggest news story this week.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.200
Even though it is a huge fat rumor right?

51:53.200 --> 51:55.200
It's not a fat rumor.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.200
It's absolutely true.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.200
And the reason why it's absolutely true.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.200
Is it's coming from Sega's FTP site.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.200
It just got leaked out there.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.200
And they're like oh shit.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.200
Pulled it back.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.200
But it's absolutely true.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.200
It's their minutes from a meeting that they had.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.200
Now there's a few things in there that don't really make any sense.

52:11.200 --> 52:16.200
But for a while though they did have a link straight to that file on their FTP site.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.200
Were you able to grab it when it was up there?

52:17.200 --> 52:18.200
I wasn't able to grab it.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.200
I wasn't able to get it either.

52:19.200 --> 52:23.200
But they have it basically transposed on here so.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.200
It's everything you know.

52:25.200 --> 52:28.200
But here's what it did entail though.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.200
Lots of new.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.200
Back up.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.200
So this was from a meeting between Sega and Sony.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
Apparently that occurred.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.200
This was like the minutes.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.200
August 6th.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.200
We're sitting on the FTP.

52:36.200 --> 52:39.200
I guess August 5th was when the meeting was.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.200
And then August 6th they kind of you know.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.200
Put a new draft or something up there.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.200
But basically it covered a bunch of different stuff.

52:48.200 --> 52:52.200
It also mentioned PlayStation 2 emulation on the PlayStation 3.

52:52.200 --> 52:57.200
Also saying that they want to sell PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.200
We knew it.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.200
And some other things.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.200
So let's run down the list here real quick.

53:02.200 --> 53:06.200
Let's see.

53:06.200 --> 53:08.200
So the motion controller.

53:08.200 --> 53:10.200
They were talking a little bit about that.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.200
A lot of stuff that was pretty much at Tokugame show.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.200
Mentioned it's coming out in the spring.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.200
Which I think they've already mentioned anyways.

53:16.200 --> 53:21.200
You know seeing that they can differentiate with a PlayStation.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.200
Or different PlayStation Skew or something like that with it.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.200
Talking about Alpha Protocol.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.200
Planet 51.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.200
Let me see here.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.200
Let's get through the good stuff.

53:31.200 --> 53:36.200
Let's see.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.200
PlayStation 2 emulator for PlayStation 3.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.200
Confidential.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.200
Don't leak this out.

53:40.200 --> 53:45.200
Apparently they want to sell all PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.200
See how that works.

53:47.200 --> 53:51.200
Why bother giving you a free update that includes the emulator for your system.

53:51.200 --> 53:56.200
When we can sell you every single game all over again for a price.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.200
But it's weird they're going to.

53:58.200 --> 54:01.200
I mean you know we kind of saw this coming.

54:01.200 --> 54:05.200
But isn't it weird though that they're going to have some PlayStation 3's out there that can just do it.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.200
And some that can't.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.200
I mean that's so weird.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.200
I would hope that.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.200
I mean if they were sporting like that.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.200
I would hope that they would actually update it like they did with the PlayStation.

54:15.200 --> 54:21.200
Well actually I think the original PlayStation 3's had the PlayStation 1 emulation already built into it.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.200
They still do.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.200
Mine will still play PS1 games.

54:24.200 --> 54:27.200
Yeah they'll still play it because the software emulation is built in there.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.200
But this is something they could add with a patch.

54:29.200 --> 54:34.200
If it's running through software where you could be able to play the PlayStation 2 games straight from your drive.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.200
They're just not because they're assholes.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.200
Well we don't know.

54:38.200 --> 54:40.200
But we're assuming.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.200
You are making an assumption here.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.200
We don't know this for sure.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.200
I'm making an assumption.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.200
And the memo's not even out.

54:44.200 --> 54:49.200
But we're kind of making an assumption based on just how long we've been following the gaming industry.

54:49.200 --> 54:51.200
And what we just kind of expect is going to happen.

54:51.200 --> 54:55.200
Sony's going to find a way to cash in on this and that's why.

54:55.200 --> 55:00.200
I don't anticipate them being generous with that.

55:00.200 --> 55:04.200
Do you remember a theory I had a while ago that the PSP Go.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.200
Because I was like why the hell would.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.200
I mean honestly we're trying to find reasons to buy a PSP Go.

55:10.200 --> 55:11.200
We can't think of anything.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.200
Don't get me wrong.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.200
PSP 3000.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.200
I can think of plenty of reasons to get that.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.200
PSP Go can't really think of one.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.200
Unless you need a smaller system.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.200
I guess that would be one.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.200
But I had theorized a while ago.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.200
What if the PS2 games you can only play on the PSP Go.

55:24.200 --> 55:28.200
But the thought is no there's no real change in the hardware on the PSP Go.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.200
So what have you.

55:29.200 --> 55:33.200
But that would make a little more sense to me.

55:33.200 --> 55:39.200
And it's a little weird that they are going to lose one big perk about the PS1 games paying for them on the PlayStation Network.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.200
Because that is one thing you can't do.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.200
Even if you have the PS1 disc.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.200
You can't just beam it to your PSP.

55:44.200 --> 55:47.200
You can only do that with the downloaded ones.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.200
Yeah.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.200
And the thing I could see them adding the backwards compatibility.

55:50.200 --> 55:54.200
Because really the PlayStation 2 is at the end of its life cycle.

55:54.200 --> 55:59.200
You know a lot of game series already have cut their PlayStation 2 versions.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.200
It's slowly dying out.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.200
It'll probably be gone by the end of next year.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.200
But I don't know.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.200
It's just interesting.

56:07.200 --> 56:08.200
Alright.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.200
And then other things that's interesting.

56:10.200 --> 56:15.200
They were talking about the possibility of import games coming out over here.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
Which is kind of neat.

56:16.200 --> 56:20.200
So it might be neat to see some of those over there.

56:20.200 --> 56:24.200
And they're saying that also with the PlayStation 2 emulation.

56:24.200 --> 56:28.200
I guess they're saying.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.200
Now this doesn't make any sense because it's all abbreviated.

56:31.200 --> 56:37.200
But it says for company marketing money show PlayStation 3 controller on TV ads.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.200
Similar to the sports spots.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.200
I don't even know what the hell that means.

56:40.200 --> 56:44.200
PSP titles.

56:44.200 --> 56:48.200
Massive franchises.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.200
I don't know.

56:49.200 --> 56:54.200
But get to the good stuff.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.200
I don't know.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.200
All this is pretty boring.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.200
What about the Dreamcast stuff?

56:58.200 --> 56:59.200
I remember that was in there.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.200
Something about the Dreamcast games are going to be coming to the PlayStation 3, right?

57:02.200 --> 57:03.200
Wasn't that something that was in there?

57:03.200 --> 57:04.200
Yeah.

57:04.200 --> 57:08.200
I'd rather read the abbreviated stuff here.

57:08.200 --> 57:13.200
Definitely they were talking about the Dreamcast stuff coming in.

57:13.200 --> 57:18.200
The possibilities of Japanese import games.

57:18.200 --> 57:22.200
And the possibility of Dreamcast titles on the PlayStation Network.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.200
But it was interesting because they talked about exclusive.

57:24.200 --> 57:28.200
So that maybe that might give away that they're going to come out on Xbox 360 as well.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.200
But that they might have kind of an exclusive window on PlayStation 3.

57:31.200 --> 57:32.200
Yeah.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.200
Because there was also something on here that was talking about the.

57:35.200 --> 57:40.200
They were going to be doing a Sonic anniversary title with a bunch of the old Sonic games on one Blu-ray disc.

57:40.200 --> 57:45.200
And they were saying the best of Sonic around $100 is what it would cost.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.200
I wouldn't buy a game for $100.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.200
I don't care how many Sonic games it has on there.

57:49.200 --> 57:54.200
I just want to say, I don't think the DC Dreamcast emulator is as big of a deal as some might make it out to be.

57:54.200 --> 57:58.200
Because there already are ways out there that you can get the Dreamcast games emulated.

57:58.200 --> 58:01.200
Like GameTap has some of the Dreamcast games available on it.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.200
And since the PS3 is supposed to basically be a computer, right?

58:04.200 --> 58:06.200
And the Xbox 360 is to an extent too.

58:06.200 --> 58:09.200
It's not surprising that they're able to emulate Dreamcast on it.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.200
And they are giving them the option to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.

58:12.200 --> 58:18.200
It says if we give them a long period of exclusivity, they will give us more marketing support.

58:18.200 --> 58:25.200
And it says if we provide a list of Dreamcast titles, Sony will let us know which ones they're interested in having exclusively.

58:25.200 --> 58:29.200
So there may be some that you see exclusive because they're going to go where the money is.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.200
So it makes perfect sense.

58:31.200 --> 58:36.200
How about a patch that lets my PS3 read my Dreamcast discs? Wouldn't that be amazing?

58:36.200 --> 58:41.200
Yeah, too bad Dreamcast discs are a proprietary technology. I know that's not going to happen, but a man can dream.

58:41.200 --> 58:45.200
Not that proprietary. I mean, shit, I can read them on my computer.

58:45.200 --> 58:50.200
Was there something special to them, though, where you had to compress some Dreamcast games to fit on a CD?

58:50.200 --> 58:53.200
Because they actually held somewhere between a CD and a DVD.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.200
It was like GD-ROM or something, right?

58:55.200 --> 58:58.200
Yeah, that was the whole thing they were saying.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.200
Oh, I'm thinking Saturn, my mistake.

59:02.200 --> 59:05.200
Yeah, I remember they were saying that it's unhackable and stuff like that.

59:05.200 --> 59:11.200
I remember actually going to a thing and there was some guy from Sega there, one of the developers or something like that,

59:11.200 --> 59:15.200
talking about how their disc format was unhackable and everything.

59:15.200 --> 59:23.200
This was the same time I'm playing burn discs on my Dreamcast. I'm going, you're full of shit.

59:23.200 --> 59:27.200
But anyways, yeah, interesting. All that's true.

59:27.200 --> 59:31.200
I think a lot of it is still, you have to consider, is in negotiation.

59:31.200 --> 59:35.200
That doesn't mean all of this is happening tomorrow or at the end of the year.

59:35.200 --> 59:41.200
You were talking about talks between two companies and this whole leak might also change things dramatically.

59:41.200 --> 59:47.200
Heads are rolling over this shit right now about the fact that this got out on the internet, whoever uploaded it.

59:47.200 --> 59:51.200
Even if it was an accident. I mean, it's going to be huge.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.200
And could actually damage the relationship between the two companies.

59:53.200 --> 59:58.200
Although I think ultimately, you know...

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
Sony just can't keep a secret.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.200
To be fair, neither can Microsoft.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:10.200
Well, I know, I understand it, but a big nugget like that with backwards compatibility, or the whole PlayStation...

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.200
They really got screwed at E3 this year. Remember how Jack Trenton came out there and he was like,

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.200
Hey, there's one thing you didn't spoil, Final Fantasy XIV, huh?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.200
You didn't see that one coming, did you?

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.200
Everything else got screwed on, but at least we got to allow you once.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.200
That was fun.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200
Remember that?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:33.200
Hey, speaking of Sony, it is official, there will be no UMD conversion program for the PSP Go.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.200
Meaning, if you wanted to convert your UMD discs, they were talking about this whole, you know, you could do a kiosk and all this stuff.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.200
Eh, not happening.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.200
It all boils down to it, actually, the way it's phrased kind of makes sense.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.200
Let me read the quote here.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:51.200
We were evaluating a UMD conversion program due to legal and technical reasons we will not be offering the program at this time.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.200
This was a Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson in an interview with Kotaku.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:04.200
But, not surprising, the reasons that kind of when you further get into it have to do with the game distribution licensing and probably the agreements with the developers.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200
It actually makes sense.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200
I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:16.200
I think they could go back and get a lot of these games to be transferable, but it's probably a violation of whatever contracts they have with developers.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.200
Although it still sucks, it doesn't tell you.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.200
That's not my problem that you have these issues with your contracts.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
Exactly, exactly.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.200
It's kind of what it boils down to.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.200
However, it is your problem because I'm not buying your system.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200
Now, I do want to point out, though, that there will be doing a type of incentive program in Europe.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:47.200
It's called the PSP Go Rewards, and if you get a PSP Go by March 31st, 2010, and I think you have to connect your old PSP model to the PlayStation Network,

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.200
so it's like they know you have both, basically.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.200
It's not just for buying the machine, you have to connect your old one.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.200
You will get three free UMD, I'm sorry, UMD-less games, but they are from a list.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200
You don't get any old games.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:08.200
You have to pick from a list that includes Killzone Liberation, Wipeout Pure, Patapon, some of the Buzzbrain and Buzzmaster games, and so forth.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.200
You know, it's more of an incentive than we're getting here, at least.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.200
But still, I mean, even with the three free games, I'm kind of sitting here going, eh.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200
So let me get this straight.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.200
Your system is more expensive.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:27.200
There's no way for me to transfer my old games that I bought to this new system.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.200
The system doesn't do anything differently.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:36.200
I can't play my UMD games on it.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.200
But it's chic, and it's new technology, and it fits in your pocket.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200
It's not really new technology.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200
It's like an iPhone, but no home.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.200
But it's got PSP Minis.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:51.200
Oh, wait, I can get this on the 3000, or the 2000, or any other PSP system out there.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.200
It's just like, there's no reason for anyone to buy this.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.200
And I'm afraid that's what's going to happen.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.200
You're either the people that have to have every system buying it, or want this system because it's new and it has a slidy screen.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Whoop the shit.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200
And then that's it.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.200
It's going to die a slow death.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.200
I think this system is going to bomb terribly.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.200
And I'm not saying that as a fanboy.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.200
I'm saying that as a, I can imagine, people going into their local GameStopper game crazy,

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.200
just knowing the type of people that usually work there at the front desk making decent recommendations.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.200
There's going to be a lot of these people that say, you know what?

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.200
They're going to be telling parents looking to buy these systems for kids.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.200
And the parents are going to be saying, what's the difference between the two?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:36.200
You know, the folks that work there, I think most of the time are going to get the honest answer of, eh, not much.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.200
If they're smart, they'd be like this.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.200
Okay, listen.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.200
You can get this game, but he can't get any games unless he actually has an online account, a credit card.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200
That's where it comes in.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200
A credit card, you need a credit card or these points cards.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.200
And the parents are going to say, fuck that.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:56.200
And it's in GameStop or GameCrazy's best interest to sell the ones that require the discs anyway, right?

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:02.200
And on top of that, I mean, come on, on top of that, and I hope this doesn't happen over here,

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.200
because really it's just like, you did what?

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.200
On top of that, they're dropping the price of the 3,000.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.200
What?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200
Are you stupid?

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.200
I mean, the system's more expensive.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.200
Well, no, that's great, because the PSP 3,000 is the system you should be getting.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200
Exactly.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200
And I would recommend you get it.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.200
Exactly, but it's like you're not going to sell more PSP Go's.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.200
It's like they're putting it out there to get people to go, well, you know, hey, I want a PlayStation Portable,

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.200
but I'm not buying this Go.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
I'm going to buy the 3,000.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200
Ha, we tricked you.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.200
You bought a PlayStation Portable.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Seriously, yeah, I can't see any GameStop employee or whatever recommending the PSP Go when they can say,

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.200
okay, listen, you can get a 3,000 and you can get a game or two for the same price,

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.200
which would look better when they're just stocking, I think, the system with a couple games.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.200
Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the sales figures look.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200
This system comes out this week, right?

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200
It's this week that the PSP goes out, right?

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.200
Yeah, it's coming a week.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200
All right.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.200
On to another story about Squeenix teaming up with PopCap.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.200
That's right, the king company of role-playing games and the king company of casual games are teaming up.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.200
It's a game called Gyromancer.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.200
The interesting thing about this, Gyromancer is basically Bejeweled Twist,

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.200
which came out earlier this year from PopCap,

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.200
but Square Enix is kind of putting their own spin on it, making it kind of an RPG-ish type of game.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.200
I would imagine to cash in on the Puzzle Quest fever a little bit,

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.200
although obviously Bejeweled Twist is a very different game.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.200
Even though it says Bejeweled, the whole concept of you actually move the pieces around

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200
kind of changes the whole puzzle element drastically.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.200
Yeah, I told Nellie about this, thinking, hey, Bejeweled.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:57.200
Puzzle Quest is basically Bejeweled anyways, but this is Bejeweled for reals with an RPG.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
She's like, oh, that's kind of cool.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.200
Then I said, oh, yeah, but it's Bejeweled Twist.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.200
She's like, oh, I'm going to play in it.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.200
She hates Bejeweled Twist.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200
Really?

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200
You can't even play Bejeweled Twist online, can you?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.200
I thought you can on Facebook, can you?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200
No, that's Bejeweled Blitz.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.200
That's the one-minute version.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200
Oh, that's right.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.200
I did tell her about what Bejeweled Twist was.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.200
I'm like, well, it's different because you have to twist four things around.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.200
She's like, oh, I'm not doing that.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.200
Well, we'll see.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200
She's been playing Bejeweled Blitz like fucking crazy.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.200
I know she's been beating my scores.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.200
She's been just sitting there playing it all the time.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200
It's addictive.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.200
It's addictive.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:35.200
I'm telling you, right up with I always say don't discount iPhone gaming and all this other stuff,

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.200
don't discount Facebook gaming.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.200
This is the future of casual gaming right there.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:48.200
The casual MMOs are Mafia Wars, Vampire Wars, Sorority Life, all that crap on Facebook.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200
That is what all the non-gamers are playing.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.200
Look at your friends list.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.200
If you have non-gamers at your friends list, look at the amount of Facebook games they're playing.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:04.200
And the moms playing Farm Town and Bejeweled Blitz, like, gamers, look out.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.200
This Facebook games thing is going to be huge.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200
Hopefully there's some good news for us in there too, but I'm just saying.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.200
Even I play Bejeweled Blitz.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
It's fun.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200
It's a nice little time waster.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.200
It's only a minute.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.200
I can totally respect what PopCap is doing.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Actually, they're a pretty cool company all things considered.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.200
Anyhow, moving on.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.200
Yes.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.200
Let's see.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200
Rock Band 2.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.200
I've been waiting for a patch for this for a while now.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.200
I remember they were talking about the Lips mic support and that kind of stuff coming.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.200
Finally here.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.200
Now you can actually use your Lips microphones with Rock Band 2, which is awesome.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.200
I was thinking about getting some extra microphones for Beelz Rock Band.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:56.200
Then again, I still have my old Karaoke Revolution mic.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200
It's funny.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.200
We're actually clearing out some old-ass games that we've been just sitting on.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.200
One of the games that we have is the Naked Brothers Band.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200
They have a Karaoke game.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200
We're selling it for $5.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200
I forgot that was even a musician.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.200
Exactly, but it's got a USB microphone.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:21.200
A lot of those USB microphones, regardless of what system they're on, will work with Rock Band 2.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.200
We used, at my birthday party, the old PlayStation 2 Karaoke Revolution mic.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.200
It worked flawlessly.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.200
I noticed at Fry's, next to the Rock Band 2 games, they sell just regular USB mics in the same section.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.200
Seriously, if you got a microphone from Karaoke Revolution, pretty much anything.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.200
They're all using those stupid Logitech mics.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.200
Just give it a shot.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.200
It probably will work if you're looking for an extra mic.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.200
Beyond all that stuff, they've also added in some new...

01:08:52.200 --> 01:09:03.200
They tweaked the hammer-ons and pull-offs. Apparently, something that they had improved for the Beals Rock Band is now being added into Rock Band 2.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:12.200
Also, audition mode, which will allow people on the Rock Band network to be able to upload the songs that they've created from their PCs to test them out in the game.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:17.200
Before they upload them into Rock Band Network and stuff like that, you can actually check it out.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.200
That's kind of cool.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.200
Also, some other cool stuff.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.200
You'll be able to actually download songs in the background, which is pretty cool.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.200
I hated having to wait for songs to download while I'm sorting through stuff and listening to things.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.200
Now, you'll be able to do that in the Rock Band store.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.200
Also, they're going to have some enhancements for the Ion drum kits.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:46.200
Now, they will have velocity-sensitive drum fills and freestyle mode, which is kind of cool.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Also, in the sort menu, you may now arrange the songs according to star rating that you've achieved in each of them.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.200
Also, unplayed songs will be grouped together accordingly.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.200
So, that's kind of cool.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.200
There's another reason for me to get my Xbox 360 working again so I can patch Rock Band 2 and have fun with that.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:13.200
Victoria was over the other day and wanted to play, but it couldn't happen, sadly.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.200
Speaking of music games, this is an interesting one.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200
I think this is coming out of Tokyo Game Show.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.200
I'm not sure, but this is definitely a very Japanese game.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.200
Taiko no Tatujin, known over here as Taiko Drum Master.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.200
They are going to be making a version for the Wii.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.200
What I think is cute about it is that it's going to come with an inflatable drum peripheral.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.200
The one on the PS2 had an actual little drum, but this one that's on the Wii is going to be an inflatable drum.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.200
Despite all the fact that we give a lot of crap to all these different Wii peripherals coming out,

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.200
I think for the game this is, that's actually kind of a cute idea,

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.200
is to have a little, basically inflated like a beach ball, they're saying, little drum peripheral to come with it.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.200
I think that helps for storage and everything.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.200
Does it do anything? I mean, because I know, I think in the game you just use the remotes, right?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200
Doesn't it still have the sensors on it or what have you?

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200
I think it's just using the Wii remote.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:06.200
No, they say the Wiimote hovers inside of the inflated device and taps get registered through the vibrations on either side.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.200
So it does kind of work with the Wiimote a little bit.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.200
That's kind of a cute idea.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.200
So, you know, there are some good news about peripherals and some things out there that we're not eyeing at it.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.200
It's no right, it's, what is it, no rocking horse chair thing, you know.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
Yeah.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.200
But it kind of sounds kind of cute.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.200
One more story for you guys and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.200
Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so Loki or myself gets to pick, we'll tell you who in a minute.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
Scratch the Ultimate DJ.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.200
Man, haven't heard about that game in a while, but they've announced a few more tracks coming out available now,

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:49.200
including, and of course this is all going to be R&B stuff, Push It, Salt-N-Pepa, Friends, Houdini.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.200
I hope it's the Glee version of Push It.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.200
Have you been watching Glee? Surely the wife is making you watch Glee.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.200
She's been watching Glee, but I think...

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200
You've been resisting.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:06.200
Well, I've been working on the cabinet and other things, so, you know, the first time it was on I was making bacon for the bacon party,

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.200
and then last week I think I was working on a cabinet.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.200
It's not bad. It's cheesy as hell, but a lot of TV should be, you know?

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.200
Yeah.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:24.200
Okay, so Gifted starring NASA featuring Kanye West, Santo Gold, and Like Lee.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:30.200
I'm going to let you finish, but Hip Hop Master was the best hip hop game in the US of all time.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:40.200
Looking Fly by The Mers, Skanky Panky, Kid Koala, Ice Lightning by RJD2,

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.200
They Reminisce Over You by Pete Rock and Seal Smooth,

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.200
and Life in a Cage by The Nux.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.200
And of course that also was added to the previously announced artists and license tracks,

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.200
which I'll read now since there's only four of them.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:05.200
Peter Piper, Rendium C, Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz, Hot in Here by Nelly, and Mastermind by Deltron33.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.200
As much as this isn't like my preferred genre of music, there are some very catchy, dancy party songs in here.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.200
I am curious about this game.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.200
This is yet another one that got pushed back to 2010, though, after the whole lawsuit and mess and studio change and all that, right?

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.200
It's probably a good thing anyways. There's too many damn music games coming out this fall.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.200
Alright, fair enough.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:33.200
Alright, well guys, we are getting towards the end of part A tonight, but not before we cover the classic video game of the week.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:42.200
The classic game of the week is the part of the show where Dark Soccer gets to go into the vault and choose a video game from her archives,

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.200
that she thinks you all should be playing this week.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.200
But guess what? She ain't here.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.200
So that means Loki and myself get to pick.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.200
We usually trade off, and going back to the Wikia, it looked like Loki had the last pick.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.200
He did Super Mario Kart a couple months ago.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.200
So tonight is my pick, and I have chosen a game.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.200
I decided with Dark Soccer doing a lot of Sega, console kind of games lately,

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:09.200
I was actually going to go for a PC game tonight, so I picked a PC game as the classic game of the week.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.200
And the game I have picked as tonight's classic game of the week is...

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.200
Railroad Tycoon.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.200
Now look, I fucking love Railroad Tycoon because it was made by Sid Meier,

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.200
and you know he is a god amongst PC gaming.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.200
He made the Civilization series.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.200
He made a game I actually really like a lot on the PC that I almost picked for tonight,

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.200
but I couldn't find a good YouTube of it anywhere, called Covert Action.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.200
And when I was thinking about it, I was like, you know what?

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.200
Railroad Tycoon, especially the deluxe version, I spent hours upon hours playing this as a kid.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200
So let me tell you a little bit about Railroad Tycoon.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.200
Why, you listen to the music from Railroad Tycoon deluxe there in the background.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.200
There were two different ones. We'll get into that in a minute.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:57.200
But Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, this was basically a game where you would assume the role as the leader of a new company.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.200
You would basically build railroads on a particular map.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.200
You could play as the US Old West, you could play as the Midwest, the Northeast.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.200
You could even do England, Europe, whatever.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.200
You basically manage the business, you manage where the trains are going to go,

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.200
you build industries and basically transport goods from one end to another.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:20.200
It's kind of a strategical game, but it was cool because you kind of built your own little empire

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.200
and it was very kind of single player.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.200
You know, they didn't have a lot of multiplayer in it.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.200
That didn't show up really until Civilization kind of a little later on.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.200
But it was a cool little strategy game that you could kind of play on your own.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.200
And yes, I realize the sound effects are very spotty in the back, but this game came out in 93.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.200
There wasn't a lot on PC back then. This game did not come out on CDs.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.200
Did the train just hit a dog in a car?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200
No, I think it's like cheering and stuff.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.200
Basically you start with one million dollars, half of it is equity, half is loan.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.200
You sell $500,000 bonds at various interest rates.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.200
That's how you continue to make cash in the game.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.200
By the way, the original Railroad Tycoon, and one reason I bring this up is the classic game of the week,

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:03.200
it is actually free because when they went back and released a sequel to the game later on called Railroads,

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.200
they actually made the original Railroad Tycoon free.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.200
And I'm not sure if you can still get it on the website,

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.200
but it was basically free out there on the internet for you to download.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.200
So you can hear some ambient music of building the tracks between the different towns there.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.200
It looks like right now they're playing on a South African map,

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.200
and they're kind of connecting Johannesburg with some other towns there.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.200
Railroad Tycoon, of course, got a reskinning and a redone version called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.200
That was released in 93.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.200
It basically upped the graphics from the 16 color level they were at in the original to more VGA graphics,

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.200
but unfortunately the game was very buggy.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.200
I don't remember it being super buggy,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.200
but they do say that the game ended up getting very buggy in certain parts of the ending.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.200
Sid Meier, by the way, had nothing to do with the Deluxe version even though his name was in the game.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.200
His name was removed from future releases of the game,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.200
Railroad Tycoon 2 and Railroad Tycoon 3.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:59.200
I think what's very notable about Railroad Tycoon 2 is that the game actually came out on the Dreamcast.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.200
It was one of the few console versions of the game to come out.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.200
It kind of took a more isometric perspective to the game,

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.200
but it was still basically the same thing at heart, just a little more involved and so on.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.200
Railroad Tycoon 3 had a full 3D environment.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.200
You could build overpasses, tunnels, totally improved graphics,

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.200
but honestly none of the sequels really kind of, I think, reached the way the original did.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.200
Sid Meier did come back to do a sequel to the game in 2006.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.200
It was Sid Meier's Railroads.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.200
It was basically different scenarios and trains that you could do.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.200
It was a little less focused on industry.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.200
It had a more streamlined interface for doing the track laying,

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.200
but it was more focused on the full 3D graphics and some real-time gameplay.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.200
So that is my classic game of the week.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.200
I know there's not a whole lot else to say about it,

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.200
but I think it's a game you just kind of have to check out.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.200
Yes, Choo Choo.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.200
It was fun to kind of build the different buildings

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:52.200
and watch your station get bigger and bigger and watch the new trains

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.200
because you get to pick the cars that were with it and how much they would transport.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200
It's very much a micromanaging game, but it's a lot of fun

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:01.200
and one of my favorite strategy games of all time, Railroad Tycoon.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.200
The one I spent the most time on was Railroad Tycoon Deluxe,

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.200
but we'll just call the whole Railroad Tycoon series my classic game of the week.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.200
Did you ever play Railroad Tycoon, Loki?

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200
No.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.200
No? Did you play any of the Sid Meier games at all?

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.200
I don't think so.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.200
It is, by the way, kind of ironic that I picked this game as the classic game of the week

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.200
because last week, while we weren't here live,

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.200
I was getting drunk in Southern California,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.200
and I was actually at some... I wasn't at Disneyland at the time.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.200
I was at some mall in Orange, and I don't remember.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.200
I think it might have just been called the Mall of Orange.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.200
Maybe some of you SoCal folks know what this is,

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.200
but I was so drunk that there's this little train that they drive around the complex

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.200
that little kids get to ride it, and it's not on a track or anything.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.200
It just kind of drives around and takes kids on,

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.200
but I was convinced that the train was trying to run over me,

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.200
so I was like, Melody, we've got to run away from the train.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.200
It's coming. It's coming.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.200
And she was laughing her ass off because I was really, really drunk

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.200
at this place called the Alcatraz Brewery,

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.200
which really cracked me up because it was like...

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.200
Remember when the Simpsons went to America Town?

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.200
That's what it felt like because we're from Northern California,

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.200
and we go to San Francisco a lot, I'm sure.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.200
It was kind of funny seeing the big replica of the Golden Gate

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.200
inside the building and just all this stuff,

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.200
all the little tie-ins with NorCal terms, so it was cute.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.200
So there you go. Anyhow, sorry for my tangent.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200
That was your classic game of the week, Railroad Tycoon.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.200
We're going to take a quick break,

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.200
but we will be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.200
We are not done yet. We've got more news coming up in Part B.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.200
Part B tonight we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news,

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.200
including another big game delayed until 2010.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.200
PlayStation Room we're going to talk about after the break,

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.200
and World of Warcraft went down for a couple months.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.200
Thank God it didn't happen here or places probably would have burned down.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:20:01.200
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.200
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening,

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.200
September the 27th of 2009 for the second half of our show.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:14.200
The tape's live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.200
They've got a lot of great programming every night at All Games Radio.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.200
I know they even have some new shows, and I think they're kind of restructuring

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.200
a lot of things over there. I don't know how much I'm allowed to say,

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.200
but I think there's going to be some new shows coming in and so forth into 2010.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
It will be a lot of fun, so check that out.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.200
A good family over there at allgames.com, All Games Radio.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.200
We are here for Part B of our show.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.200
It's myself and Loki here tonight holding down the fort.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.200
DarkSakura was with us earlier, but she had to cut out a little early tonight.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.200
She might be back if we're still taping at 9.30 Pacific,

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.200
but usually we don't go quite that late. We'll see.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.200
We were just going to press forward, though, with our show tonight.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.200
I just wanted to say, though, when you do listen live on All Games Radio,

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200
we play some music during the break.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.200
We can't do that during the podcast because we don't have the permissions to do so.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.200
Even though live radio rules are a little different than downloading,

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.200
we are allowed to play some stuff live.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.200
I just want to say we played the Guild Wars theme.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.200
It was the last song we had coming out of that.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:15.200
That guy Jeremy Soule, I don't know if it's Soule or Soleil,

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.200
he does some awesome orchestral music.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.200
Between that and Oblivion, I really enjoy his stuff.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.200
It really sounds like listening to a movie.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200
I want to play Guild Wars sometimes just to hear the music.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.200
It's pretty awesome.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:32.200
I just want to give him props because I think he did some really great work there.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.200
I think he did the music for Prey, too.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
That was one of the best parts of Prey was the soundtrack.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200
I know a lot of people didn't play that game,

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.200
but all things considered,

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.200
that was a shooting game made for people that really fucking suck at shooters.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.200
It was perfect. It just ended abruptly.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.200
The story kind of just cut off.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.200
I think development was probably cut off of that game

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.200
because that game was going on Duke Nukem Forever time to make.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Let's get back into some gaming news tonight.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.200
We're going to start off with some rapid fire stories. Loki.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.200
Yes. Final Fantasy VIII is out on the PlayStation Network in Japan.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:15.200
So you better believe that it will be out over here probably soon enough.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.200
They did something similar with Final Fantasy VII,

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.200
but you know, of course, with the whole Tokyo Game Show thing going on,

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.200
it makes sense.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.200
Disney. There was that rumor of the Epic Mickey game.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:34.200
Well, Disney is set to make an announcement in London on the 28th of October.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.200
People think it's going to be this announcement.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:45.200
Apparently there was also a teaser in Game Informer saying that this announcement is coming as well.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.200
Could it be something that's on the cover of the next Game Informer?

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.200
We'll have to wait and see.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.200
Something epic will be announced probably.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.200
God of War, the collection that's going to be coming out later this fall,

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.200
is actually going to also include the God of War 3 demo.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.200
That makes perfect sense. You're buying the first two games again.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.200
Let's check out the demo.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.200
Sweep the pot a little bit for the people who already own God of War 1 and 2.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.200
Exactly. I think you definitely owe it to yourself to play these games if you haven't yet.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.200
That would be worth checking out, I think.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:23.200
And finally, something for free.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.200
Yes, if you have LittleBigPlanet, you will be able to soon pick up Viking costumes for your Sackboy.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.200
These will be coming soon.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.200
They've actually got a website that you need to go to to go through this.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.200
It's Family Zone, which is a cross promotion with Sony Pictures.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:50.200
You're going to be able to go to the website.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.200
They actually have a link here.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:59.200
Actually, the PlayStation site. US.PlayStation.com slash Sony Wonder Games.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:06.200
And then you just go there. There's a button to redeem a code and you can get the free Viking costumes.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200
So it's not something you can just go on PlayStation Network and download, unfortunately.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200
No, that's stupid.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.200
Whatever. Cross promotion, I guess.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:20.200
Well, as Loki spoiled earlier in the show, there is a little bit of crossover going on between Ninja Gaiden and Dynasty Warriors.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.200
And that's, of course, because of the Tecmo Koei merger that happened not that long ago.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.200
Ryu Hayabusa is actually going to be an unlockable character in Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.200
But that's not where the love stops.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.200
Apparently, there's going to be unlockable Zhao Yun and Song Shang Xiang costumes in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.200
Yes, I'm sure I completely butchered those names. Deal with it.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.200
So there's going to be a lot of crossover happening there, I'm sure to no one's surprise.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:55.200
Blur was a racing game I was very much looking forward to this year, and I will just have to look forward to it a little longer.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:02.200
It has been delayed to 2010 with a host of quite a few other games that have been delayed to 2010, which is now looking pretty full.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.200
The delay happened because, according to Activision CEO Mike Griffith, they need to, quote,

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:15.200
fully optimize the vision Bazaar set out to create for Blur, including a distinctive and groundbreaking multiplayer mode that will appeal to a broad audience.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.200
I take that to mean multiplayer was fucked and they needed to fix it.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:27.200
I also take that as we're not going to compete with ourselves and decide to push Blur back a little longer since they're the ones releasing Modern Warfare 2,

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:30.200
and it's supposed to be coming out around the same time within a week.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.200
That makes sense.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.200
But, well, you know, if they did it for that reason, then F them.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.200
But if they did it for the reason that they needed to go back and make multiplayer better, that's cool.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.200
Because, you know, I'm sure if it came out and the multiplayer was screwed up,

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.200
bitching upon bitching on the blogs about how borked multiplayer is and we need to patch immediately, etc.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.200
So, you know, if it's truly to fix multiplayer, then fine.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.200
I've never remembered the multiplayer in Project Gotham being too bad, so I can't imagine that that would be really an issue.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.200
But, hey, giving them the extra time, whether it be for, you know, competing with Modern Warfare 2,

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.200
or whether it be actually the multiplayer being a little rough around the edges.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.200
Is it really the same audience, though?

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.200
It doesn't matter.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.200
All the games are moving away from, you know, except for, you know, like Assassin's Creed.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.200
They're like, eh, fuck it, we're going to go against them.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.200
I think there's room for more than one.

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.200
Exactly. I think so, too.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:30.200
But a lot of games are kind of like, you know, there's going to be a lot of people buying, you know, Modern Warfare 2.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.200
Let's move our game a little away from it.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.200
Like Smackdown vs Raw 2010.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.200
Normally a title comes out in the middle of November, now coming out in the middle of October.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:45.200
Which is a little bit of a surprise, but not with Modern Warfare 2 being there.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200
Well, moving on to another story.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.200
You know, there were those screenshots that came out of a Final Fantasy project that Grin Studios was working on.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:59.200
Apparently this game was assumed to be cancelled because Grin Studio went under, but apparently not.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.200
It's coming from some rumblings sources, of course, that are not named.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200
Close to both companies.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.200
Apparently the game is still under development, just not by Grin.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.200
So it'll be interesting to see what becomes of that project.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:18.200
But if you see a very different looking Final Fantasy game announced next year at, I don't know, E3 maybe.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.200
That's probably what this ended up being.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:24.200
One more story I'm sure tons of our listeners are interested in.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:32.200
Cenet Twilight will be coming out on the Wii this autumn and, oddly enough, on the DS in 2010.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.200
I thought that the whole point behind Cenet was that you actually saw clips of the movie in the game.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:42.200
But yes, of course, with the whole New Moon franchise coming out as well, or I mean the movie as well as the old Twilight movie.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.200
Just like they've done for Harry Potter and Friends and all these other things, there's going to be a Cenet game on the Wii.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.200
I could give a shit, but I'm sure there's some Twilight tards out there that'll love it.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.200
And who's cashing in on this?

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.200
Konami.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.200
Are they the ones behind it?

01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200
Go Konami.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.200
Oh boy.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.200
God forbid we get a good music game from them, but Cenet, Twilight.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.200
But we get sparkling vampires.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.200
Hey, they go where the money is.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.200
Not a fan. I'm sorry to be a hater. I have some friends that are into Twilight, but I just don't get it.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.200
But honestly, it's coming out before the second movie, okay?

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.200
And granted, I'm sure people that are playing this game probably read the books.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.200
Death Wishing in our chat room is making his thoughts very strong.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.200
He says, kill the devs, kill them all, fucking skull fuck them.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.200
That might be a little bit harsh. I mean, skull fucking? Come on, that's pretty harsh.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:40.200
I'm just saying, how much trivia can there be for Twilight movies if there's one Twilight movie out already?

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.200
And yes, this game is slated right now I think for...

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.200
I want to say I thought it was October.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200
Probably around the release of New Moon.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.200
It's supposed to be coming out until after it, so either it's going to spoil the...

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.200
Nah, it's really going to spoil the plot of the movie, because there really is no plot to the movie.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.200
Well, and the books have been out. You know, you can go read the book, I'm sure.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200
I don't know, it's just crap.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.200
Wait, hold on. I've decided this story has taken up way too much time on our show.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200
Sorry, sorry.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.200
Although I do want to read this witty comment from chat.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.200
Tigerclaw in chat says, we need a Cenet OLR.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.200
Oh wait, no video, I guess you could call it.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.200
Hear it, OLR.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200
Would anyone actually play that? I don't know.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.200
No.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.200
Some of the listeners know the trivia of the show better than I do.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.200
Like, I've got this best of I've got to do, you know, next week.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.200
You know, that we're going to be taking some parts of the show and then kind of doing some new stuff with it as well.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.200
You know where I'm going to find out where all the good bits are?

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.200
Our Wikipedia. The OLR Wikipedia references what episode number some of the funniest stuff was in.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:43.200
Like, what episode the what-they-play.com snap was in and some of these other things I'm going to kind of pull and put in there.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.200
It's all in there, which is nice.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.200
Anyhow, let's get to some Twitter topics tonight.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.200
I forgot to get the theme music for Twitter topics.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.200
I'm just so broken tonight.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.200
I can't multitask.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.200
Jamie and I here is ruining everything.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.200
Hold on. I'm getting it.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.200
Where is it?

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.200
Ah, forget it.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.200
I'm not going to do theme music tonight. Let's just get to the Twitter topics because I don't want a dead air here.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.200
Ah, let's see. Going to the Twitter topics.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.200
Wow, we got quite a few tonight.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.200
Ray Iannami says, here's a story that people might actually care about.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.200
Mushi Misama Futari for 360 is going to be region-free.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.200
A region-free 360 game.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200
They call it a bullet hell shooter.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.200
He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about a shooting Xbox 360 game.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.200
No screenshots from the gamers.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.200
There's one up here in the upper right-hand corner.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.200
It's going to be region-free.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.200
So this game comes out in Japan, but you would actually be able to import it here in America and play it.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:50.200
That's kind of cool because a lot of the 360 games that come out over there are not region-free.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.200
Especially in Japan, man.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.200
They're just like, fuck you guys. You ain't going to import this shit.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.200
And Ray's in chat right now and says it is an existing arcade game.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.200
We saw a clip of this on an earlier show because I'm looking at the screenshot now.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200
Yeah, it does look familiar.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200
And that's the thing. It sucks too because of my arcade cabinet.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.200
I could play vertical games, but it's such a fucking pain in the ass to do it.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.200
You have to rotate the monitor and all that shit, and I just don't want to do that.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:19.200
TigerClaw305 on Twitter wants us to mention the Florida fugitive was apprehended after attempting to steal DS games.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:26.200
He links us to an article on Joystiq where apparently, and that's with a Q, says apparently this guy was out there trying to steal DS games.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:34.200
It was a loss prevention specialist got to stop this shoplifter.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.200
The fugitive's name was Daniel Larson.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:44.200
He was already wanted for violating probation, and apparently he shoplifted $120 worth of Nintendo DS titles from the local Walmart,

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.200
but a loss prevention officer actually caught him and stopped it.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:54.200
Joystiq, the blog, goes on to joke, don't tell them about my insatiable addiction for Imagine Babies games.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:59.200
I know. You could say I planned on pawning them to buy heroin. Please come on, man. This would ruin me.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.200
You know, I think it's one of those things where I don't think that has anything to do with gaming at all.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.200
Thieves are thieves and will steal whatever to sell.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.200
And why are they still de- I mean, I understand that they're small, but I mean, they're not worth much.

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.200
Isn't that hard to steal from Walmart, too, because aren't they all in the glass case?

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.200
I guess not all of them. If they're on sale, or like the really cheapy ones, those aren't in the glass case, are they?

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.200
I guess because they're smaller, but I mean, I don't know.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.200
Alright, I'm not going to be able to read all the tweets tonight, but let me get to a few others here.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:32.200
Ryan Belknap on Twitter wants to know, what game coming out this fall are you looking forward to buying?

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.200
For me, it would be Dragon Age and Press Your Luck. Games this fall.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.200
DJ Hero and Borderlands.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:46.200
Oh, and of course, I mean, because it's more of a download title, but Grand Theft Auto, The Ballad of Gay Tony.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:51.200
Honestly, most everything I was looking forward to got pushed back to 2010. Blur, White Knight Chronicles.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:57.200
But one game that's still coming out that I am looking forward to a little bit, there was one.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.200
I just had it, and now I just get my memory.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.200
New Super Mario Brothers?

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200
Dang it, no, not really interested in that one.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200
What kind of a game was it?

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.200
I don't remember.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.200
Lego Rock Band?

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.200
Eh, not really. I'll check out the Rock Band Beatles.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200
Anti Hero?

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.200
No, that already came out. I don't know if there is a lot.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.200
The new Tony Hawk game?

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.200
No, I don't care about that.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200
DJ Hero, that's what I want.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200
I just said DJ Hero.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.200
I know you did, but I want that too.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:27.200
Alright, obviously I'm not looking forward to it that much, if I can't even remember what it is two seconds later.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.200
Either that or I'm getting short-term memory loss early.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.200
Let's see, moving on.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200
One other Twitter here from ActDeft.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.200
Here's a Twitter topic you would like, and links us to a story here.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.200
Oh yeah, I heard about this.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.200
I don't think this is in our show role either.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.200
This just came up today.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:50.200
He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about, apparently there's a crash screen in Need for Speed Shift,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.200
that when you go into the PlayStation Store, it crashes.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:59.200
Here's the funny thing, it's on the 360, with the PlayStation Store logo showing up and everything.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:04.200
I don't know what the hell happened or what you do to get this, but apparently this is a really bad bug.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.200
Let's see, when navigating menus today, when connected to Xbox Live, the game suddenly crashed again.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.200
When my rage subsided and I got a better look at the screen, I was pretty shocked at what I saw.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:18.200
Was my Xbox 360 version of Need for Speed Shift really trying to access the PlayStation Store?

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.200
Microsoft's not going to be happy about this at all.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:24.200
So apparently there is a bug in the game where it tries to access the PlayStation Store.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200
Whoops!

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.200
There's a little screenshot and everything.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:33.200
That's coming off Kotaku, but I think it's making the rounds around all the gaming blogs, I'm sure.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.200
So there you go, there are your Twitter topics for tonight.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.200
We always open it up before our live shows.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.200
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.200
We always let you know when the new podcasts are up, because it can be a little spotty sometimes, I apologize.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.200
And whenever fun stuff is going on here at OLR headquarters.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.200
At least it wasn't Need for Speed Nitro on the Wii, because then you can't patch that shit.

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.200
That's true, they'll probably patch us on the 360, but that's still gotta be embarrassing.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.200
Alright, let's get back into some long discussion news, including something that's very interesting.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:12.200
Yes, well if you felt left out on the PSP that you couldn't join home, you soon will be getting your own kind of home-like service in the form of PlayStation Room.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.200
Interesting enough, the logo for PlayStation Room is R Infinity M.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:32.200
You may remember way back in the day when there was a rumor, according to a trademark, that the PlayStation DualShock 3 or 6-axis was going to be, well, Wii called the Poohs, because it was P Infinity S.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:38.200
See, I did not remember this until you said like that, you joked that it was Poohs.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.200
We did joke about this on the show a while ago.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:48.200
So I'm thinking, maybe that wasn't for the controller, maybe it was like PlayStation Infinity or some crap like that, and it was actually this.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.200
Which makes sense, because now the logo kind of looks exactly like it.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:59.200
But anyways, so the PlayStation Room is actually going to be added in with an upcoming PSP firmware.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:13.200
And you'll launch it straight from the cross-media bar, just like home, and it'll allow you to create a 3D avatar and kind of my room spaces, along with a blog, album, and group gatherings, chat support, that kind of stuff.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:29.200
So, it's like home with a big anime flair to it, and really scaled down. So, neat, I guess.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.200
Have they really said what the hell you're going to be able to do with it, or are we only seeing these screenshots of these chibi characters?

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:41.200
Which, by the way, it should be said, even though you're saying it's kind of like home, it doesn't really, I mean, it looks like a very, very, very much spin-off.

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.200
It's not your same characters, it's not that same 3D environment, it's like...

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.200
It looks like home, like, you know, the Disney's, was it, um...

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.200
Looks like some of the chat rooms I would see on Prodigy back in the day.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:37:06.200
Like the Channel D stuff, or, I forget what they call it, on, um, DGamer, that's what it was, on the Disney's DS tiles. It's very similar to Xbox Live. It's not, but it's a similar type of service.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.200
Funny enough, Ray Ayanami in our chat room says, wasn't that like three years ago that that joke happened? He says, wait, I've been listening to this trainwreck for three years now?

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.200
I mean, maybe it was a long, I don't think it was quite three years ago.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.200
It was before the PlayStation 3 came out.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.200
Oh, wow.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.200
Because, remember, we were, like, were they going to call the controller?

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.200
Oh, that's right.

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:31.200
Okay, well, maybe this has been in development that long. Maybe this was originally conceived for the PlayStation 3. Who knows?

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:39.200
Or maybe they were like, hey, you know, that trademark looks kind of cool. Let's just do that with an infinity symbol, because, you know, we're different like that.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:50.200
But what has PlayStation Home really done for PlayStation? Even though I got a plug that we do have a club on PlayStation Home, and there's got to be a good handful of people in it now. I've been getting slow requests for invites.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:59.200
I don't know. Nothing. I can't imagine this would be too popular. I mean, yay, you're going to be able to run around in Avatar and stuff, but...

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:05.200
I did check out this week. I did sign into Home. I don't know. Home's one of those things, like, I'll just kind of poke around in if I'm really bored.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:12.200
I did check out the new SingStar space in Home, and it's a little ridiculous. There's not a lot. It looks, it's not, it's, graphically, it looks pretty cool.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:18.200
It looks like a nightclub, and it's laid out like a nightclub, and, like, graphically, it's kind of cool, but you log in there, there's really not a lot to do.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.200
You do all the different dances on the dance floor, and you get, like, three shirts. That's it.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:29.200
You just, I just quickly go through the character and do all three, all, like, ten dances or whatever, and you get three shirts.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.200
And then you get shirts to pimp out their products. Awesome. Yeah. Exactly. That's it.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.200
Yeah, that's... I gotta say, though, it was nice to look at for a few minutes. I was like, oh, hey, they put a little work into this.

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:44.200
This actually kind of looks like a nightclub, and I like how when you dance, the little spotlight on the floor is different colors, and it's all high def.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:53.200
Looks cool. Okay, done now. Not sure exactly what I gained out of this, except, I guess, maybe knowledge of the SingStar product. I don't know.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:01.200
They have a little video wall that'll circle through different music videos that are in the game, and you can actually pick which video you want to come up next on the wall.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:09.200
But here's the catch. It's a 30-second clip of videos. It's not even, like, the full, like, you can't touch this or baby one more time.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.200
You just need 30 seconds of it, not the whole clip.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.200
That's true. J. Dizzle in chat reminds us, home give us hamsters versus humans dance-offs. How could I forget?

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:25.200
And now there's a whole nightclub you can do it in in the SingStar space, so how could I forget?

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:33.200
Moving on, another news this week about things online. China has had their access to World of Warcraft restored.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:43.200
These servers are now back online. You may have heard a few months ago that the World of Warcraft servers were going dark because the game was transitioning from a company called The Nine to Netease.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:57.200
World of Warcraft was down, by the way, for three and a half months. The transfer is all done now. Chinese MMO players can now get back on to World of Warcraft, which might not be the biggest game in China, but I guess it does definitely have their following over there.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.200
I'm sure that took a big chunk out of their economy since, you know, all the gold farming and everything.

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:19.200
Well, Netease, well no, they'd log into the American servers to do that. It's not mixed like Final Fantasy XI is. China has their own servers, because remember they don't have undead, they have the Forsaken, which is just undead with more skin or whatever.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:37.200
But anyhow, here's the other thing I want to point out. Apparently, the servers are, to give you an idea how many people are playing, the servers are expensive to maintain. They have to pay a million of their Chinese dollars a day, which boils down to about $146,000 a day to keep the servers running.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:51.200
But, you know, China's a pretty big country and the game obviously is doing very well there. But then I was thinking, oh my god, three and a half months this game was down. Can you imagine what would happen if World of Warcraft, and I open this question up to chat as well,

01:40:51.200 --> 01:41:08.200
what would happen if World of Warcraft shut down? Just all of a sudden, out of the blue, World of Warcraft shuts down for three months in America. It would rain cats and dogs. With no rhyme or reason, just blizzard, the server facility just goes kaput, I don't know what happens.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:25.200
You know, nobody gets charged for it or anything, nothing malicious happens, but just World of Warcraft gets revoked for all the 11 million players or whatever for three and a half months. What would happen? The internet would be in a shitstorm. It would be just like, fucking bitch, you know, just complaining like you would not believe.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:39.200
Dark Tetsuya says divorce rates go down. ActDeaf says I already said it, massive tantrums. Oh yes, there would be many a blog. Many an angry blog. People threatening to quit and never return, right?

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.200
Go to Aeon.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:56.200
Ray Ayanami says whatever, I'm gonna keep on playing not MMOs. Rama says if World of Warcraft shuts down for three months, people would return to real life and shit would get done. J Dizzle says mom, bathroom.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:05.200
Deathwishing says remember that episode of Robot Chicken where a virus deletes all the prawn? Could you imagine that? A computer virus that just targets World of Warcraft?

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:26.200
Let me go this way. If there was ever a virus out there conceivable to actually delete all the prawn on the internet at one time, who would do that? First off, who would do that? Second off, you know how fast prawn gets on the internet? It wouldn't matter. The prawn would be back up to the levels it is now in like a day.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:36.200
It would just be like, porn back! Was it gone? Didn't even realize it. All new porn, sweet.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:42.200
I just, do you think there would be, the sad thing is, I think for a lot of people...

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.200
They would cover this on CNN.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:52.200
It would be in the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. It really would. World of Warcraft went down today and...

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.200
What about like Twitter? Like going down for like three months? Or like Facebook?

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.200
Oh fuck Twitter. I'm so over Twitter.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:08.200
Friendster, remember Friendster? Friendster was what we had before Myspace, before Facebook. Apparently it's still popular in Asia, but Friendster is what we used to have.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:22.200
And when that went down, people went somewhere else. But Friendster was not quite as integrated into culture as I think Facebook has become. You know, people's mothers didn't have a Friendster account. Just college kids had it.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:28.200
People's mothers have Facebooks. What would happen if Facebook went down for three months?

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.200
People would go back to Myspace, maybe.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:37.200
I think a lot of people would. Let's see, Baconbit says, if WoW was shut down for three months, the internet speeds would go faster.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.200
Nice. Very true.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:46.200
Deathwishing says kids would run out in the streets going, God dammit, my raid was halfway done. I lost my epics.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:52.200
So a lot of people seem to speculate people would just go somewhere else.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:44:03.200
I think that, you know, as much of fandom as World of Warcraft gets, people are fickle. If it goes away for a while, they'll leave. Then when it comes back, they'll come right back.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:11.200
But, you know, it's just they need to be doing something. And if they're going to be MMO players, they're going to go play another MMO or play something else.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.200
They're not just going to go outside and go, oh my God, there's a world out here. What have I done with my life?

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.200
They're going to go, hey, World of Warcraft is back. Oh shit. Back right into their seat.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:27.200
Tigerclaw in chat says the worst case scenario would be if the internet were shut down for three months, then there would be utter chaos.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:33.200
You know, what's interesting about that, though, is that the entire internet went down for three months. That's almost another whole nother thing.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:39.200
Because you have to remember the internet, wasn't it originally created as like a government thing for government agencies to communicate?

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:48.200
I mean, you have so many businesses out there. I mean, think about the online banking that goes on and, you know, just all of the online things that so many companies that do their business online.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:55.200
Yeah, the internet going down completely would be pretty chaotic. I would be a mess.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.200
Well, there's a lot of stuff also connected with the internet, like banking, ATMs.

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.200
That's pretty big.

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.200
Yeah.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.200
It might all be secure, but imagine if it was suddenly inaccessible. I mean, I guess that's why we still have tellers working at banks.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:14.200
I've had my bank's infrastructure go down for a day. It was a pain in the ass.

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.200
Marissa Congusto in the chat says I couldn't do my job without the internet. There's a lot of people in that situation.

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:28.200
You know, like, you know, I work for a big call center. I think I've mentioned that before. I'm a trainer for a big call center. We actually have reps in other offices that take phone calls from their homes.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:35.200
It's like a work at home program. And I believe they use the internet to do all that. When the internet goes down, those reps can't work.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.200
There's a lot of people that really rely on the internet to do their jobs. It's pretty crazy.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:50.200
So it would be a mess, that's for sure. But there was a day without internet, believe it or not. I don't know if you kids are old enough to remember, but there was a day without internet.

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:55.200
Back in my day, we had dial-up and BBSs. Those are the days. Trade Wars 2002 for life.

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.200
I remember BBSs.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.200
Legend of the Red Dragon, bitches.

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.200
Wasn't that long ago, I don't think.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.200
The pit for the win.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.200
Alright, let's move on.

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:13.200
And you know what? We downloaded porn on 28 modems off of BBSs, because that's the way it was.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:21.200
I remember when porn would be separated into VGA and Super VGA.

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.200
Didn't they call it XGA back then, I think?

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.200
Alright, forget it. Let's move on.

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.200
EGA.

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:37.200
Hooray for CGA porn. That's like those old strip poker games from the Apple IIe. Especially working with arcade monitors and stuff like that.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:42.200
Yeah, arcade monitors, most of them out there, CGA is what they consider them because it's ultra low resolution.

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:48.200
And VGA monitors, 640x480. And that's really good for arcade stuff.

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.200
I digress.

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.200
I had a 300 baud modem on my Commodore 64 that plugged into the cartridge port in the back. It was epic. Epic.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.200
I think the slowest modem I had was a 2400, I think.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:06.200
But yeah, switching that to like 56k, oh my god, we're blazing speeds.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:13.200
Dude, going onto BBSs on a 300 baud modem, it was like watching print be typed on the screen.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.200
It was just insane.

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.200
Just to reminisce for a bit here, I'm sorry.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.200
But there used to be a BBS here in Sacramento, and I think it was called the Open Forum or Open Mind or something like that.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.200
All it was was really a bunch of forums.

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:35.200
And this was back when 2400, I think 14.4 was the speed everybody had at that point. It was 14.4k.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.200
And really all it was was just message forums.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.200
And it was just a cool place to just kind of meet people.

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.200
And actually, some of the greatest discussions I ever read online were on that site.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.200
And it was all local people too.

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.200
Some days I miss the days of BBSs.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.200
CCN, remember that magazine, California Computer News?

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.200
I do! Aren't they still around?

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.200
They used to have, I don't know, but they used to have...

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.200
They used to have the BBS listings in the back!

01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:58.200
Exactly!

01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.200
I do remember that.

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:06.200
And there was one BBS that was on there that you could sign into that BBS and actually get internet access for like an hour a day or something like that.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200
Oh my god.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.200
It was fucking awesome.

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.200
Oh my god.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:12.200
I remember I got banned from a BBS once because I pissed off the Sisop.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.200
That was fun.

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.200
I got tied up in some drama.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.200
I don't even remember.

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.200
Now I'm looking back on it going, this is all retarded.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:22.200
But, you know, I was a dumb kid. What can I say?

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.200
Anyhow.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200
Alright.

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.200
Deathwishing says, LOL dial up porn.

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.200
It would be like, okay, gonna eat dinner, come back.

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.200
Damn, her tits loaded up yet?

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:37.200
No, seriously, it was sad because, you know, back in the day, it used to take an hour to download a mag, okay?

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.200
An hour to download.

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.200
It did.

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200
I remember downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200
Shareware.

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.200
Epic.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.200
Downloading shareware.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.200
Yes.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.200
And, I mean, it would take an hour to download that stuff.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.200
And, yes, if you got a porn file that was like, and this is like an image.

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.200
A GIF image.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.200
Because JPEGs weren't really red.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.200
Weren't out yet.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:57.200
GIFs were out.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.200
GIFs was where it was at.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.200
Yeah.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.200
It took like 45 minutes for that shit to download.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.200
And, you better hope that's a good picture because you don't know what it looks like because it's just a text file.

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:15.200
You're just like, big boobs, sweet.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:22.200
Womanhorse.gif? Wow, what could this be? Oh my god.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.200
The stories I will tell my children.

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:35.200
I remember my friend had to show every kid in the neighborhood when he got the picture of the zebra fucking the woman that he found on some BBS that he got on his 2400 baud modem.

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.200
And all the kids were coming over to look at this still picture on a computer screen.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:47.200
It was like Playboy, but just different. For nerds. Anyhow.

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:57.200
So, Summer of Arcade. You know, Microsoft's kind of big push for some good Xbox Live Arcade games coming out of course in the summer.

01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:03.200
They had a 200% growth over last year's sales.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:11.200
And this is mostly in part to, actually a good selection of games coming out, including Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.200
You know, even Battlefield 1943.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.200
Lots of good stuff.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.200
And even Shadow Complex, their kind of Metroidvania game.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.200
Trials HD.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:34.200
And basically seeing a lot of different growth in different areas, including the free entertainment department, 1 vs. 100, although not really part of the Summer of Arcade stuff.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:41.200
Doing pretty well with over 3 million downloads during a 13 week period.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:49.200
And also 1 vs. 100 being within the top 10 downloads of Xbox Live history.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.200
So that's pretty cool.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.200
And, I don't know. It's not really a surprise that it's doing well.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.200
I mean, they had a good selection of games, so.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.200
Wonder what next year will be like.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:07.200
It's interesting though that the Summer of Arcade kind of helped the sales kind of grow.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.200
Yeah, definitely.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:21.200
So, alright. Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a story about IGN and an old website that we love here at Orange Lawns Radio, WhatTheyPlay.com.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.200
If you've been a long time fan of Orange Lawns Radio, you'll know why this is funny.

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.200
If not, listen to the best of next week, because that clip is going to come back.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:35.200
But IGN, of course, the big, huge website that's kind of like GameSpot or, you know, all those, you know, 1UP or whatever.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.200
They actually purchased WhatTheyPlay.com.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:47.200
WhatTheyPlay.com is a site that is basically, you know, it's kind of catered towards families and kind of the concerned parent about what kids are into in video gaming.

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.200
I don't know why IGN bought this, but that's what they wanted.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:52:00.200
I guess there was a pretty big audience there, and maybe IGN kind of feels that it's a new audience that ad buyers will be interested in buying.

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.200
I don't know. They buy a lot of different websites.

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.200
But I don't see how much it was sold for. That's the part I want to see.

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:11.200
Two dollars.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:17.200
No, apparently, in all dear fun, even though we kind of razzed the website, it wasn't really the website we made fun of in that episode.

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:23.200
It was just the poll and the results of the poll that was like, what do you find most offensive in a game?

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:27.200
And it was like, you know, gay kissing was more offensive than disembodied heads and all this stuff.

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.200
It was just ridiculous.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.200
So we'll talk more about that a little later on.

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:33.200
But interesting, of course, that that kind of comes full circle.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.200
Now IGN has bought it to conduct all the polls they want on that audience.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.200
That happened earlier this week.

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:52.200
You may remember us reporting on a game announced at E3, Joyride, which is basically a game that's kind of debuting the free-to-play model on the Xbox Live service.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:56.200
And Joyride is going to be kind of an Avatar-infused kart racing game.

01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:01.200
And of course, they're going to have a little bit of an MMO twist to it as well.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.200
They're doing some stuff too, I remember, where you can actually...

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:17.200
I guess it would be a little bit similar to, like, Noby Noby Boy and Battlefield 1943, where if you play the game enough that you'll actually, as a whole, unlock new levels, which is kind of cool.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:24.200
And then, of course, if you want to customize your karts and whatnot, you have to pay for that, because that's what free-to-play means.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200
You have to pay for your premiums.

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:30.200
And it will be a free download coming this holiday.

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:43.200
And apparently, the content to buy will be available around that time as well, also including Avatar costumes and new tracks and karts.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:49.200
So, what do you think about this whole new model? Is it kind of the future of Xbox Live Arcade, or what?

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:56.200
Well, it allows you to try out the game, and if you don't want to buy all this extra content, you don't have to, which is kind of cool.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:08.200
And I think that's a lot better than, say, buying a game, or trying a demo that maybe doesn't really give you a good idea of the game, and wasting your money on a game that you end up not liking.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:16.200
And hell, it can't be any worse than Yaris.

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.200
I suppose that's true.

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:26.200
So, as long as it's better than Yaris, I think it'll be okay.

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.200
All right, well, we're going to go ahead and open up ye old mailbag every week.

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:38.200
You guys send your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and we pick some of our favorites and read them right here on the air for you guys.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.200
Unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here right now. She'll be back a little later, hopefully, before we finish up.

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:54.200
So I'm going to open up the mailbag right now, but I was a slacker and didn't go into it before we started this segment, because I was getting text messages on my phone.

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.200
I was answering those.

01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:03.200
We have a lot of emails tonight. I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through all of these, but I'll try and get through as many of them as I can.

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.200
If you didn't get through tonight, I'm sorry. Try again next time.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.200
Let's go to an email from Shook.

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.200
Starts us off tonight.

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.200
Hello, to kick off this email, I'd like to say that I am at peace with my dad.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.200
Oh, yes, this is the emailer that was having problems with his dad. Remember that?

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.200
The dad didn't want him playing Final Fantasy X.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.200
I talked to him about the Final Fantasy X thing, and he seemed willing when he listened to me.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.200
I got him to try the game, and he loves it.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200
No more of that.

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.200
So a round of applause for the douchebag father coming around.

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.200
You did the rational thing.

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.200
You've undouched yourself. Congratulations. You did the right thing.

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:39.200
No more hazing for you.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.200
So no more of that. I agree.

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.200
Now on to my main story.

01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:45.200
The other day I had gym class, and we played football.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:50.200
When a kid in my class saw the football laying there, he ran over and teabagged the ball a couple of times.

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:52.200
Let that sink in.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.200
My gym coach grabs the kid by his neck, says,

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.200
Get the hell inside, and pushes the kid towards the front door.

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.200
It just goes to show how far teabagging has gone in our culture.

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.200
The kid was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, according to the superintendent.

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.200
My opinion? What the hell? This is the shit that gives gaming a bad name.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.200
I close with that.

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.200
P.S. Pardon my French.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:15.200
Forever and always. Not like anyone says to themselves anyway.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.200
Yours truly, Shook.

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.200
I don't know if gaming is to blame for teabagging.

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.200
I mean, I would think maybe, I don't know, like,

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:25.200
gay culture in the 70s might be where teabagging originated.

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.200
I'm not exactly quite sure.

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.200
But, um, obviously the kid...

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.200
I don't know.

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.200
Y'all are teenagers, and hormonal, and all that stuff.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:39.200
So, obviously the kid just doesn't know what's appropriate and what's not.

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.200
So, I don't think it has anything to do with gaming.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.200
So, I like this.

01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:46.200
Marissa in chat says,

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.200
One day I want to hear Rob go,

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.200
We got a lot of emails tonight, sorry guys,

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.200
I'm only going to get through as many as I feel like, so suck it.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.200
Yeah, I guess you could say that too.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.200
Um, this next email comes to us from AZHP.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.200
Hey, OLR crew, I was listening to your last available podcast the other day,

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.200
and remember Rob saying something about a homosexual tambourine game.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.200
I believe the game you're thinking of is

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.200
Minimoni Shikato Tambourine,

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.200
which I actually played when I went to Japan as well.

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:16.200
If you're not familiar with Minimoni, they're a branch of Morning Musume,

01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.200
an extremely popular J-pop girl group with, get this,

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.200
23 girls, at least the last time I checked.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:24.200
Minimoni is a subset of them,

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.200
four girls who are 15 to 16 and look 11 to 12,

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200
and seeing things about telephones, rock, paper, scissors,

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.200
counting to 20 in the bathtub, in general being obnoxiously cute.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.200
Itchy knees, unchy.

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.200
Therefore, you are most definitely correct in saying that the game you saw

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.200
slept with tambourine games of the same gender.

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.200
I don't know, it sounds like that game

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:49.200
sounds like it could go to jail for the things it's doing.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.200
P.S., I recently got a new job,

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.200
by the way, I just want to say before I get into the P.S.,

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.200
I actually don't think it was the same game.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.200
The one I saw, and this is how you could tell,

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.200
it was Samba de Amigo.

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.200
It was the exact same game as Samba de Amigo, basically,

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.200
except with a different character, not the little Samba dude,

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:05.200
and with a tambourine.

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.200
So if that's the game you're talking about, then it's the same game.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:10.200
But I don't remember, like, a Morning Musume,

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:14.200
or even a Japanese pop 23 girl group being involved at all.

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.200
So, anyhow.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.200
Let me read the P.S. here real quick.

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:23.200
I recently got a new job and have been listening to your podcast while at work.

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:26.200
I had to stop, though, because when you guys make terrible and awesome,

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:29.200
extremely inappropriate jokes, I can't help but burst out laughing.

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.200
Not conductive to keeping a low profile in a quiet office environment.

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:35.200
It's just a testament to your chemistry, I guess.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.200
Oh, that's very kind, thank you very much.

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:42.200
He signs it, O.L.R.'s premier gold star recipient, A.Z.H.P.

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.200
That's right, he was a previous gold star.

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:47.200
That was another very worthy email there, so thank you very much.

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:53.200
Let's see, trying to get through some more emails here.

01:58:53.200 --> 01:59:01.200
Let's see, this one comes to us from, they didn't sign it,

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.200
so I'm just going to say Sam is the person that sent this.

01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:07.200
Hello, O.L.R. crew, I'm trying very hard to use the best grammar possible

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:11.200
so the grammar Nazi doesn't permabam me or, like, start yelling or whatever.

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200
Well, you're lucky.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.200
Tonight I'm reading them and I have terrible grammar, too,

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.200
so I'm not going to be too critical tonight.

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.200
But yeah, I'm Blade3.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:19.200
Oh, I'm sorry, that's the name, Blade3.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.200
I haven't emailed you guys since 2007.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.200
Now I'm older and I slapped together a PSP website that has awesome functions

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.200
and I wanted to let you know that I put your feet on there

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:29.200
because everyone deserves to listen to the awesome Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.200
Check it out at rmedia.webhop.net.

01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.200
It will automatically route you if you are on a PSP

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.200
and if you have an iPhone it will route you to the iPhone site

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.200
and if you use a computer it will route you to the main site.

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:43.200
Congrats on many fantastic shows, keep up the fabulous work.

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:47.200
Wow, I just gave that dude free advertising for just kissing our ass in an email.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:50.200
Sorry, I don't update our PSP site at all.

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.200
I'm glad someone's still developing some PSP.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.200
It's too much work and I don't have the time to do it

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:57.200
and I just don't want to.

01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:59.200
It's not that...

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.200
Yeah, it is because I don't want to.

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:03.200
You'd rather play video games?

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:05.200
I'd rather play video games, yeah, and it's just...

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.200
I don't know.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.200
Next email.

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:10.200
Hey guys, JD here, long time listener, first time emailer.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:14.200
Unfortunately I'm a listener from the UK so I can't really tune in live.

02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:16.200
We do have listeners from the UK that tune in live,

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:19.200
but I understand, it's like 2 in the morning over there,

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.200
but those guys are just really hardcore.

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:23.200
Thanks for the email, anyway.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.200
This is concerning something DarkSakra mentioned quite a while ago

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.200
when she heard the theme from Shaft in a Czech restaurant.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.200
Remember this? She talked about this earlier.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.200
Well, today in my college induction day,

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.200
my teacher was warning us about the dangers of leaving our phones on

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.200
and with perfect timing, his phone started ringing

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.200
and his ringtone was none other than the theme from Shaft.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.200
Anywho, I must head off to bed now, so good night, OLR,

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:46.200
and Sky, you need to update the podcast on time.

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.200
Yes, I know, I'm sorry.

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:52.200
Bad host, bad panda, no cookie.

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.200
That email from JD reminding us of an old inside joke.

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.200
If I can find that clip, I'll have to put that in the best of two.

02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.200
I just don't remember what episode that was in.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.200
Just a couple more emails for you guys here and then I'll get to it.

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:11.200
Let's see, I'll get to probably just one more email here from Rob with Two Bees.

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.200
And he sent us quite a few emails this week.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.200
I'm just going to pick a couple of these here.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:20.200
Rob from Two Bees wanted to know if any of us were going to Disneyland from September 23rd to 27th.

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.200
Sadly, I went the week before and I'm going the week after.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.200
I'm very sorry to say it, but we didn't make it to Disneyland the same week you were.

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.200
But I hope you had a ton of fun.

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.200
The good news is all the Halloween events started this weekend.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:37.200
Also, send us a link to this interesting article on gamespolitik.com

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:44.200
about a study linking youth violence depression to peers, not video games.

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:48.200
Apparently, it says here, one, depression is a symptom.

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.200
It is pointing out that many of the youths surveyed have depression problems

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.200
to the point where it seems correlated to youth violence.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.200
I'd say that the issue of depression is something that should be tackled all by itself.

02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.200
Two, peer pressure is also the cause of good behavior.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:06.200
It's also ubiquitous, so anything you try to link with peer pressure will seem correlated as well.

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.200
I find it interesting how game politics will suddenly credit bad science

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.200
just because it agrees with the general viewpoint of the editors and most of the readers.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:17.200
I also like to qualify that these psychological studies are impossible to do scientifically,

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.200
but they still may have value to psychologists.

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.200
It adds a little postscript here that says,

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:27.200
to the study's credit, the name of the report admits to having many variables,

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.200
a multivariate analysis of youth violence and aggression,

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.200
the influence of family, peers, depression, and media violence.

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:38.200
I think we have a tendency when we see something that's kind of on our side

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.200
to rah, rah, rah around it a little bit.

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.200
And yeah, there might be a lot of variables in this study.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.200
And I kind of agree with this whole notion that this is probably something that's way too hard to gauge.

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.200
Way too hard to gauge.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:59.200
I think kids playing video games too much is usually a cause of depression,

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.200
not the other way around.

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:04.200
Or I should say cause from depression, not the other way around.

02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.200
I don't think depression comes from playing too many video games.

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.200
I think kids who are depressed kind of drown their sorrows in video games.

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.200
Because I think what he's saying there about the whole, you know,

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200
a lot of it has to do with peer pressure.

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.200
I think, you know, when kids don't want to go out and face the real world,

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:23.200
they kind of can lose themselves in a video game.

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:26.200
Or a video game where they might be king or queen ponying everybody,

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:31.200
like World of Warcraft or something in a social environment where they can be somebody else.

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:36.200
You know, I think the best cure to that sort of depression is to stop that behavior

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:37.200
and go outside.

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:41.200
You want to have a healthy balance of video gaming, you know, when you're that age.

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.200
But I don't think too much gaming is the cause.

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:46.200
I think too much gaming is a symptom.

02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.200
Yeah.

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.200
If that makes sense.

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.200
Because they're trying to isolate themselves from everybody else and, you know,

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.200
sometimes games make them feel better about themselves,

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.200
especially if they're really skilled at something.

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.200
Nice.

02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.200
By the way, JD is in chat right now and says it is 4.30 in the morning where he's at,

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:04.200
and he is listening after all.

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.200
Well, thank you very much for tuning in and listening.

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:08.200
That's going to do it for the mailbag tonight.

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.200
Thank you guys for the e-mails.

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.200
If you want to send us an e-mail, please do a mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.200
We'll get to some more e-mails next week.

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.200
Now we want to get into the FUs of the week, as we always do around this point of the show,

02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:24.200
and we have a good little inspiration story for you guys tonight.

02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:43.200
To inspire tonight's FUs of the week, I bring you a principal from Germany who was quoted this week.

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:49.200
His name is Bernd Denning and said kind of maybe along this whole line with depression and so forth,

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:55.200
he believes that video games play a major role in a child becoming a homicidal maniac.

02:04:55.200 --> 02:05:01.200
Quote, even if killer games are not the trigger of a killing spree, this guy said yesterday,

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.200
they still take a major part in turning minors into homicidal maniacs.

02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:11.200
Even if there isn't a mono-casually relation between excessive playing of games leading to acts of violence,

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:17.200
it still provides a twisted frame of reference of solutions for their problems and hardships that they learn

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.200
may transfer to the real world under certain circumstances.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.200
Okay, but how is that the game's fault?

02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:29.200
You're kind of admitting that they're going to the games because they have a problem in the first place.

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.200
The game doesn't turn them into a homicidal maniac, right? Am I right?

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:37.200
To his defense, I think it's like this.

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.200
Do you have a crazy person already?

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:48.200
The games mainly give him inspiration to how, I guess, how to become an outlet for violence.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:53.200
Say, for example, kids watching a kung fu movie, they're probably going to try to mimic that crap afterwards

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.200
because that's what kids do.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:59.200
They're really excited about something, they see Ninja Turtles and they want to go play Ninja Turtles.

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:03.200
I can sign off with that, but exactly, but why single out video games then?

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:08.200
When movies do it, TV does it, peers do it, art does it.

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:11.200
It's because he got in a soapbox and wanted to say something controversial

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.200
so people would listen and people did, and then they blogged about it.

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.200
Art can be influential, period.

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:20.200
Anyhow, so we dedicate the FUs of the week to this guy.

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200
Loki.

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:27.200
FU to my headache, and it's from sinuses, I'm guessing, because I got it when I got back here

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.200
and my eyes are burning and my head hurts, so it's got to be a sinus headache.

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.200
Maybe something in this house.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:36.200
Shermie.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:40.200
There's a guy down in the room, he cheated on us tonight.

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:41.200
No pun intended.

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:46.200
Hey, my FU of the week goes to the food poisoning I got from a popular sandwich chain earlier this week.

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.200
I'm not going to name them because I can't prove it, but I got sick.

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.200
Which one?

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.200
They toast their sandwiches, they're very famous for it.

02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:58.200
I got another one from, they don't have foot lungs, but you can get stuff to go.

02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:02.200
Ah, okay, yeah.

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.200
Interesting.

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:08.200
That's why, you know, I can't prove that they gave me the food poisoning, but I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:12.200
And, man, it was hell for three days, but I lost some weight.

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:18.200
Oh, yeah, I had some, it wasn't really, I don't know if it was bad sushi and then bad sandwich.

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:23.200
So, FU to just food poisoning, because it sucks.

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.200
All right, anyhow.

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:30.200
Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.200
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.200
We probably have time for quite a few calls tonight, so we'll try to get through everybody tonight.

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.200
Loki.

02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:40.200
This week we got some new Xbox Live arcade games coming out, and quite a few of them.

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:42.200
Usually we get one or two, but we have three.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:50.200
So, unfortunately, certain things often, you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the Warriors game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox,

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:58.200
but now we get the Warriors Street Ball, which is more of like a, I guess, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:04.200
the arcade game kind of version of the Warriors, so not as cool as unfortunately the Take-Two game,

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:08.200
but it is coming out for $10 or 800 Microsoft Points.

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:14.200
Also coming out, Zombie Apocalypse, which is kind of like a top-down version of Left 4 Dead,

02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:21.200
and that's going to be available for 800 Microsoft Points or $10, and also Ion Assault, which I believe is a tower defense game,

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:32.200
and that's also available for 800 Microsoft Points or $10, and I think I'm right about the Ion Assault thing.

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:38.200
I can't remember. Nope, I'm wrong. It's a space shooter with an interesting twist, they say.

02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:45.200
Basically, you can draw in energy from particles and use them to blast foes.

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:51.200
I've actually seen that in, like, a freeware game made by some Japanese guy. That's pretty cool.

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.200
So, I don't know, this looks neat, kind of a little bit like Geometry Wars.

02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:03.200
Hmm. Isn't it about time for a new Geometry Wars, by the way?

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:08.200
Well, you would think with a new Project Gotham game you'd get something like that,

02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:15.200
since there's not going to really be a Project Gotham game from Bazaar. I don't really know.

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.200
Maybe do it later.

02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.200
Well, some rumors around the internet this week that there is a Street Fighter IV sequel in the works.

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.200
Apparently, the official Japanese Street Fighter IV blog said that there is a statement about a new Street Fighter game coming out pretty soon.

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.200
The announcement is going to come from Natsuki Shihozawa and Yoshinori Ono.

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.200
Apparently, they are going to say something about it. It would seem very early for a Street Fighter V.

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.200
Apparently, there is rumors, though, that there is a Super Street Fighter IV of sorts on the way out.

02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.200
And it already kind of got leaked.

02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:45.200
Oh, did it?

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200
Yes.

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200
I didn't hear the follow-up.

02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:54.200
There was a screenshot, or not really a screenshot, but a, I guess, picture that was available on,

02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:01.200
I'm not sure if it was on Capcom's Twitter or what, but they had a picture from GamePro Germany, I guess.

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:09.200
And it was Yosho, what was it, Yoshinori Ono and some other guy.

02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:11.200
And they were kind of doing like a fireball pose.

02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:13.200
And in the background, what is that?

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:17.200
It looks like Street Fighter IV, but then there is T-Hawk there.

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:25.200
And then also a big giant banner with what appears to look like an S from Super Street Fighter IV.

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.200
Oops.

02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.200
So, yes.

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:35.200
Zip party, probably going to get some either, you know, download content or perhaps a re-release of the game,

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.200
you know, greatest hits type thing or something like that with new characters and whatnot.

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.200
In other words, a way to milk more money from you.

02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.200
Yep.

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.200
Congratulations.

02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.200
So.

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:44.200
All right.

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.200
Well, that is it for the stories that we have tonight.

02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.200
So it's now that time for us to open up the Skype line and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.200
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.200
Loki, why don't you give us some last minute stories before we get to the phones.

02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:05.200
The Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be a little bit cheaper until August, or not August, October 5th.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:14.200
With a cool deal that's going on with Netflix, you will be able to buy an Xbox 360 Elite between September 22nd and October 5th

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:16.200
and go on to Xbox's website.

02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:23.200
There's a link actually, you can check it out, where you can mail in for a, you know, rebate for 50 bucks.

02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:29.200
And that's not a bad deal if you're looking to pick up a console.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.200
All right.

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.200
Let's go to the phones.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:37.200
Who's this?

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:40.200
Who's this?

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.200
Deathwishing.

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:42.200
Hi, there you are.

02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.200
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:56.200
Well, did you guys hear about how, I think I read on Twitter from Inside Gaming that the arcade, the memory cap for Xbox Live arcade games being increased to two gigs?

02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.200
Yeah, I did remember reading your article on that earlier this week.

02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.200
Doesn't that have to do with the whole, what is it, Command & Conquer 3?

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.200
Yeah, the new Command & Conquer.

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:04.200
Yeah, what does...

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.200
Doesn't that kind of like defeat the purpose of games that are not that big and now you can have these two gig games,

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:15.200
basically, I think what they're trying to say is go buy our expensive overpriced hard drives, what I feel like they're telling me.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:22.200
Not really, because when you consider now that the main system that's going to be available out there is the Xbox 360 Elite with 120 gig hard drive,

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.200
I mean, you could fit like 60 games on there.

02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.200
I mean, if you were just going to, well, probably less than 60 games, but pretty close to 60.

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:31.200
Yeah, but what happens to all the people that didn't buy the Elite?

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:38.200
I know there's more people with the standard edition console that had a 20 gig hard drive.

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.200
Microsoft doesn't care about you.

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:47.200
They'll probably come down in price. I mean, they're doing, you know, they're having bundles available, the 60 gig and the 20 gig,

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:50.200
they're going to release a new bundle with that, very similar to that.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.200
That's going to be a little bit cheaper because they're trying to clear out inventory on that,

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:58.200
but I'm sure that it's going to come down in price, especially if it's going to be available with all the Elite consoles now.

02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:01.200
Well, they better hurry up because I'm buying a PS3 soon.

02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:05.200
And they'll probably, you know, and obviously they're going to also have the 250 gigabyte bundle,

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:10.200
maybe they'll see that standalone because that's going to definitely be something for people that own an Elite to upgrade to.

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:14.200
I also want to play devil's advocate here a little bit because probably what Microsoft would tell you is that

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.200
A, not every game is going to be pushing the two gigabyte limit,

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:23.200
and B, that there's hundreds, literally hundreds of games already available that are very small.

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:29.200
Indie games, don't forget those, in addition to, you know, just the past, you know, three, four years of what's been out on the 360.

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:33.200
Oh, and I also picked up ODST.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.200
And what'd you think?

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.200
I love it, but I also know a lot of people that hate it.

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.200
What do you love about it?

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:45.200
I know it's just been half and half. I know it's people love it or people hate it.

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:48.200
Which is strange for a Halo game because usually everybody's, you know, dry humping it.

02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:50.200
What do you love about Halo 3 ODST?

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:57.200
I just love that it's actually a fun campaign, it's an interesting story, and the voice acting is pretty good.

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.200
Yeah, it has like Nathan filling it in right.

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:01.200
And the music in this game is awesome.

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:06.200
And Firefight's pretty fun. I played it for like three hours one day with a couple friends.

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.200
I hate to sound so ignorant, but what is Firefight mode?

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.200
I don't know enough about Halo.

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:14.200
What's that?

02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:16.200
Gears of War horde.

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:17.200
Oh, okay.

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.200
Halo twist with skulls and stuff.

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:20.200
Got it.

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:29.200
And, yeah, it's been taking up my whole time this week, basically.

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.200
What would you say to the haters? What are the haters saying about it?

02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:40.200
Most of the people that hate it are either A, kids that were looking for Master Chief that didn't find them, so they cried.

02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:46.200
And maybe people that aren't fans of the Halo series looking for a different game.

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:52.200
And then there's the people that don't play Halo games, but they bought Halo because you know you have to have it.

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:58.200
And most people, I know a lot of people who did buy Halo for their Xbox because it's like a staple game, like Call of Duty and Gears of War.

02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:04.200
Because, yes, society has grown to the point where you're cool if you buy a video game.

02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.200
Do you think this was just to cash in?

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:12.200
Because on Bobby's show tonight, I kind of said, isn't this kind of like the guitar hero of, you know, the guitar hero Van Halen?

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:18.200
Not exactly, because I felt more like it was more of a tribute to the people that really cared about the series.

02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:26.200
Like, I've read most of the books, and for what I'm seeing now is they're actually starting to care and follow storylines from the book.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:33.200
Because there's a new unit in the game that's from the books, if you've read the books, you already know all about it.

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:38.200
And Halo Reach is a prequel to, and it's basically based off the book Fall of Reach.

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.200
You are one hardcore Halo nerd, but that's cool.

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:49.200
I wouldn't say hardcore, I like the story. I actually like Call of Duty 4 a lot better. I like Call of Duty.

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.200
That's cool. Hey, there's people that read the Warcraft books and some of the books based on other games.

02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:55.200
Man, those people are nerds.

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.200
Yeah, that's right, that's right. You gotta love the video game culture. You gotta love it.

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:03.200
They'll look at just another subgroup and say, you guys are nerds.

02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:05.200
Like the Star Wars guys in the Trekkies.

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:09.200
Exactly. Alright, well Death Wishing, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts?

02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:15.200
I saw the former lead singer of No Doubt, or one of them, at Chain Reaction last night.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.200
Gwen Stefani?

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:18.200
No, Alan.

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.200
Oh, like from the old school days.

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.200
Yeah, he has a band called Starpool.

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.200
Did you, like, get a picture?

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:28.200
Uh, no, but I was too busy skanking, so...

02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.200
Oh, well, good luck with that. Alright.

02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:31.200
See ya.

02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.200
Alright, see ya.

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:39.200
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to go ahead and give us a call, we'll take some more calls.

02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200
Any other last minute stories?

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:48.200
EA has confirmed that they're going to be doing a Beatles Rock Band Sing Star Pack, basically Beatles Rock Band for PS3, with two Sing Star mics.

02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:51.200
Hmm, we have another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.200
Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:56.200
Well, hi, Brad from Pod Culture. We haven't heard from you in a while. How are you doing?

02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:57.200
Uh, peachy keen.

02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:04.200
Tell the kids where you podcast at for any of our new listeners. We'll give you a plug. I know you're good to us, we'll be good to you. Tell the kids about your show.

02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:10.200
Well, there's PodCulture.net, and then the Geek Music Podcast, Geek Spin, over at GeekSpin.com.

02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:15.200
So, I know what I'm going to hear on Geek Spin is geek music, obviously, but what am I going to hear on Pod Culture?

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:21.200
Uh, well, if you can imagine OLR if it wasn't about video games.

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.200
Okay, fair enough.

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.200
Which it isn't live.

02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:28.200
Oh, you talk about Olive Garden 2, okay.

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:31.200
Well, we actually usually do go out to eat before the shows.

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:32.200
Nice, very nice.

02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:37.200
Alright, well, I know you didn't call in today just to plug your shows, but what's on your mind, buddy?

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.200
Oh, Halo 3 ODST.

02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:42.200
Ah, you're another Halo 3 ODST fan, huh?

02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:47.200
I really enjoy it. It's definitely not an F minus minus kind of a game.

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:52.200
Oh, a little dig there at Bobby on the earlier show. Okay, well, what grade would you give it and why?

02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:55.200
I'd give it a good solid B.

02:17:55.200 --> 02:18:03.200
Mainly, you know, it bounces around between the different viewpoints of the characters, which some people I can see would like.

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:08.200
I mean, I like a little bit more of a linear type of story.

02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.200
But I dig it just for the sheer fact of the voice acting it's got in there.

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.200
I mean, it's got three of the guys from Firefly.

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.200
I was going to say, I know you're a huge fan of Firefly and just the whole Whedon universe.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.200
Are you still doing the Dollhouse podcast?

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:26.200
Oh, yeah, we actually did a panel with Felicia Day at DragonCon.

02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.200
Oh, nice, very nice.

02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:33.200
So I know you guys are hardcore into that universe, so just the voice acting alone has got to sell this game to you guys.

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:38.200
Well, I mean, Nathan Pillion's character actually looked like Nathan Pillion.

02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:39.200
Nice.

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.200
I'm modeling really good Alan Tudyk's character.

02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:48.200
There's one scene where he actually flies a Covenant chip.

02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:50.200
So you sound like you're actually into the campaign mode.

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.200
Do you play any of the multiplayer at all, or are you all about the campaign?

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:59.200
Every once in a while, but I usually get my ass handed to me.

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.200
Yeah, that sounds like pretty much my extent with Halo.

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:02.200
I'm not even good at single player.

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.200
That's how terrible I am at first-person shooters.

02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:06.200
But hey, teach their own.

02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:09.200
D5T in chat actually wants to know where the Dollhouse podcast is.

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:12.200
You know, now that season two is on, a lot of folks are coming back into that show.

02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:15.200
It's at thedollhousepodcast.com.

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.200
You are a busy man, Brad.

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:19.200
How do you have time to play video games?

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.200
Well, you know, just don't sleep.

02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:25.200
All right, fair enough. Anything else you've been playing lately, Brad?

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:28.200
Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5.

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:31.200
And what do you think about these games?

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:36.200
It's really, really neat. I like in Guitar Hero 5, it's kind of cheesy,

02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:39.200
but I like the fact you can play as your avatar.

02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.200
That's kind of cool.

02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:46.200
And with the Beatles Rock Band, come on, man, it's the Beatles.

02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:47.200
That's right, it's the Beatles.

02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:50.200
I still have yet to get on this Beatles train.

02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:53.200
I'm going to be late to the arrival, because I know you were making fun of me

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.200
over my 360 earlier, but I'll get on the bandwagon soon enough.

02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.200
I'm fine with everybody else's hype for right now.

02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.200
What do you think is going to be, I hate to make you pick,

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:08.200
but which game do you think is going to trump at Christmas?

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:11.200
I'm going to actually probably say Beatles Rock Band,

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:18.200
because it would appeal to more of folks who normally wouldn't pick up a video game.

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:22.200
Like, I took it over to my mom's to play over for my birthday,

02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:26.200
and we played with my sister and brother-in-law and their kids,

02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:29.200
and everybody loved it.

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:31.200
Interesting, all right.

02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:33.200
Well, any final thoughts for us, Brad?

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.200
No, sir, just keep up doing the great show.

02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.200
Well, thank you, I appreciate it, and you have a good one,

02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:41.200
and good luck with your multitude of shows.

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:42.200
Catch you later, guys.

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.200
See ya.

02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:46.200
He got Felicia Day on a panel?

02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:51.200
Shit, we can't even get B and C designers to come on the show.

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:52.200
No, we've had a couple on the show.

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:57.200
Well, when you're one of Dollhouse's few fans.

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.200
Oh, stop. Rude, rude, rude.

02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:01.200
All right, let's go to another call.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.200
Hi, you're on Orange Blonde's radio, who's this?

02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:06.200
None other than The Legend of Zaku.

02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.200
Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:16.200
Nothing much, just chilling right now, because the weekend that was New York Anime Fest.

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.200
Yet another damn con.

02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:21.200
You guys are spoiled out there on the East Coast with all your cons.

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.200
Did you go to this?

02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:28.200
Well, yeah, not only that, the creator of Gundam was one of the guests of honor,

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:32.200
so I went and managed to go to both of his panels,

02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:37.200
and I had him autograph one of my copies of Zeta Gundam.

02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:38.200
Very cool.

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:39.200
And a picture with him.

02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:43.200
I'll be up on Facebook eventually, but right now I'm just tired.

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:51.200
I've just got to relax tonight, because I've been going through this rat race this whole weekend.

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.200
Hmm.

02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:59.200
Well, yeah, basically I wanted to bring up a good point that I don't know if it was probably already discussed,

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:06.200
but the fact that the creator of Mega Man said recently in Tokyo Game Show

02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:12.200
that pretty much Japan was finished in terms of video games and their industry.

02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:15.200
Isn't he not the first one to say something like that?

02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:20.200
I seem to remember a very similar quote not that long ago from another Japanese developer,

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:23.200
and I think it's just shock and awe quotes.

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:26.200
He's just sad that he didn't come up with Monster Hunter, that's all.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:29.200
I think that's BS that Japanese game development is dead.

02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:36.200
Well, that also brings me up to a discussion to one of the panels I've actually been to in the con this weekend,

02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:41.200
which was basically a debate between Western and Japanese video games,

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:45.200
and they did bring up that particular rant.

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:59.200
From how the debate went, we pretty much settled on the fact that Japan is a clash of cultures.

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.200
You could put it that way.

02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:04.200
In other words, where you have the Japanese with their strong work ethic

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.200
and the fact that they only help themselves, not each other,

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:15.200
whereas Western developers or just Western business companies for that matter,

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:19.200
you have to work within a team.

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.200
Isn't this just a little bit, though?

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:26.200
I wouldn't see it as the apocalypse that all these guys are proclaiming to me.

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:27.200
I know.

02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:31.200
That says he's probably crying wolf a bit too early.

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:33.200
Here it is, Zaku.

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:37.200
American development for many years sucked balls.

02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.200
Where did we get all of our games from?

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:42.200
All of them, Zaku, came from Japan just 20 years ago.

02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:46.200
When American developers would do it, they would almost just fail miserably.

02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:48.200
Remember Secret of Evermore?

02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:50.200
I like that game, and a lot of people hated that game.

02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:51.200
But here's the thing.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:54.200
Just Japanese development has dominated for so long.

02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:56.200
I don't think it's so much that Japanese development is dead.

02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:00.200
Just Japanese development is having to share the spotlight a little bit.

02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:01.200
Yeah, of course.

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:09.200
Right now, they have to contend with the fact that the Western video game market at this point is pretty solid.

02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:16.200
You have the 360, which has the largest install base of any console right now on the planet.

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:21.200
In the U.S., Europe.

02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.200
You'd be surprised.

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:25.200
The fact of the matter is that there are...

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.200
Actually, no, it doesn't have the largest install base because the Wii is still number one around the world.

02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.200
Yeah, that's true.

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.200
Aside from the Wii, in terms of hardcore...

02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:43.200
I consider the Wii more of the casual system, even though it hasn't really appealed that much to hardcore,

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.200
with the exception of Super Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros.

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:50.200
This is another reason why Japan is...

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:52.200
So you're just saying compare to Sony?

02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:54.200
You're saying compare to Sony.

02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:56.200
No, no, no.

02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:01.200
The point that I'm trying to make is that Japan couldn't see the writings on the wall a lot sooner than later.

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:05.200
And now they have the deer in the headlights look all of a sudden,

02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:11.200
even though we and most of the world already knew that they weren't the only game in town anymore.

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:13.200
Yeah, they give you an example here.

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:23.200
The Wii right now worldwide is 53.47 million units, whereas the Xbox 360 is 32.10 million.

02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:28.200
And then, of course, the PlayStation 3, a little bit catching up now, I think.

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:34.200
They're down to 24.55 million.

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:41.200
Right. I mean, it pretty much goes back into what others...

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.200
I guess in a way he's right.

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:47.200
And this is what happened.

02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:54.200
I mean, Microsoft pretty much realized that the only way to create a powerful platform,

02:25:54.200 --> 02:26:02.200
a world-class platform, is that they have to appeal more to developers and essentially throw money at them.

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:12.200
I mean, that's how they managed to roll out more 360s in Japan than the original Xbox.

02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:20.200
So even though it still hasn't beaten the PS3 yet, it's getting close.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:29.200
I mean, for all intents and purposes, you could say that it's razor thin at this point, the margin between the two.

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:31.200
All right. Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up and let you go.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.200
Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:42.200
Worst game of all time, Final Fantasy VII. That wasn't me saying it. That was pretty much a panel that I went to today.

02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:46.200
I think there are millions of people that would disagree with you.

02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:48.200
All right. Take care, Zaku.

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.200
Bye.

02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.200
Everybody knows that the worst game of all time is Driver 3.

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:55.200
I know. Please. Please.

02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:00.200
Anybody that says that Final Fantasy VII is the worst game of all time, I laugh in your face.

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:06.200
Aha! I laugh in your face because I've played plenty of games this year that were worse than Final Fantasy VII.

02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:13.200
Try this. Final Fantasy VII is not necessarily the best game of all time. I think that's what you meant to say.

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:19.200
Just like, you know, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is overrated.

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:26.200
I know. I could think of literally hundreds of games off the top of my head that are worse than Final Fantasy VII that I think we all could agree on.

02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:27.200
Yaris!

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200
Yes, thank you. There's plenty. There's plenty.

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.200
Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:37.200
Hi, Spazinator. What's on your mind tonight?

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.200
I just had two quick questions because I know you're about to wrap up.

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.200
Yeah, what's up?

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:47.200
Yeah, they're kind of interrelated.

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:56.200
And as far as home is concerned, have you heard anything about their announced update?

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:59.200
I think they're calling it 1.3.

02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.200
For what is this?

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:04.200
For PlayStation Home?

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:09.200
I think I saw some stuff online. I didn't think there was anything super major that I read about in it.

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:14.200
I mean, I don't think this is getting the showing of the trophies or any of that that we saw about.

02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.200
I want to say I thought I saw something when I logged in the other day, but I don't think there was anything major, right?

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:22.200
Yeah, I don't think I ever saw a bullet point on there for fun.

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:26.200
So I wasn't really interested in it at all.

02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.200
Now Spazinator, you've checked out the OLR Clubhouse, right?

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:31.200
Yeah.

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.200
Have I done a nice job decorating?

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:45.200
Yeah, in fact, since you touched on it, my second question relates to the Clubhouse.

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:53.200
I noticed that right behind the stage, towards near the ceiling, there looks like there's some kind of TV screen or something like that.

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.200
Yes.

02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:59.200
Does that serve a purpose or is it just decorations?

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.200
You know what? It's there in the house when you purchase it. It's part of the default.

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.200
It's not something I added. It was just there in the house.

02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:10.200
But you can't do anything with it. You can just look at a blank video screen.

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:20.200
My hope is that someday they're going to let us as the club owners put a video in there because I would love to give you an exclusive little OLR behind the scenes video or something.

02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:26.200
I would love to put a five-minute video of us taping the show or something before or after the show in home.

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:30.200
That would be awesome and give people a reason to go to home.

02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:33.200
But I can't do that yet. That's not something they're letting us do.

02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:36.200
Yeah, they're still working out for a reason to buy the PSP Go.

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:44.200
Look, I'm sure that they don't want just anything on those monitors because the video I could put on there could also be me whipping it out.

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:49.200
I don't think they want people to be able to put that. Trust me, I don't want to put that up either.

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:50.200
Nobody wants to see that.

02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:57.200
But what I'm saying is that there's no content control there and also copyright. How do they know I'm not going to put up a movie?

02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:05.200
I could also see them using that screen as some type of, let's say there's a massive Sony event that's going to happen like another E3 press conference or something.

02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:10.200
They could beam that to all of the clubhouses, but I don't know. I don't see them doing that.

02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:16.200
Right now, it is 100% completely useless, Spaznator. I'm sorry to say. It's decoration only.

02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:20.200
It's like an analog TV now. Yes.

02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:36.200
Yeah, I was thinking. I know you guys have a whole bunch of videos on YouTube. Just recently, you put up the video of Jamie's vault along with their printball machine collection.

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:45.200
They would be great for the TV screen and for anyone that buys any of the content through the video section of the store.

02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.200
I would imagine it's very…

02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:54.200
Spaznator, the minute that Sony lets us put those YouTubes on that TV in the clubhouse, I am so there.

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:59.200
Also, I would love them to just open up the clubhouse to everybody. Why be a member of the club?

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:04.200
I would love to make my club public so that way lots of people can explore the clubhouse, see the video, and go,

02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:09.200
Oh, these guys look kind of crazy. Maybe I'll listen to the show. I think it would be great promotion, but sadly…

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:18.200
And I understand. It's a big deal for Sony to hit the switch because if they allow people to post their own videos, there's huge copyright things they're going to have to deal with.

02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:27.200
So I can understand why I don't get what I want, but believe me, the day they figure it all out, even if they have to review each piece of submitted content,

02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:31.200
we don't have anything copyright in ours, so we would submit it and hopefully it will be on there.

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:43.200
Well, thanks for taking my call, and I want to go. Like I said, you're probably here to wrap up the show.

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:49.200
Yeah, pretty soon here. All right. Well, thank you, Spaz. Take care, and we'll talk to you later week, all right?

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:52.200
Sure. Sounds good. Later. Take care.

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:57.200
I don't see why we can't take a couple more calls. It's not even nine o'clock yet. We're good.

02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:02.200
I'd like one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. The username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. Do you have any other stories you want to get to?

02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:15.200
Yes, sure. Let's see. Frank West coming to Tatsunoko versus Capcom. Well, we already kind of knew that, but they have pictures now, and it looks like he has all sorts of crazy moves.

02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:19.200
Oh, hello. This is DS Master 26.

02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:22.200
Yes, I just picked up the phone, obviously. Hi, what's on your mind?

02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:34.200
Not much. Just been playing a few new games, and lo and behold, if you were reading the chat at all, my girlfriend, who was here a while ago, she ain't here now.

02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:43.200
We were playing Rock Band. She accidentally unplugged my 360 in the middle of achievement for Guitar Hero 2, which was watching the whole credits roll.

02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:56.200
That bitch! I'm just kidding. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Girls 101. Don't laugh at me. Threaten to kick my ass.

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:13.200
Basically, then I replugged it in. It's my friend's 360, mind you, and he let me borrow it for the weekend, thank God, because I've been wanting to try a 360 for a while for one, not one of those demo kiosks.

02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:29.200
And so, then it Red Ringed on me. And then I'm like, oh, crap. So, I have Rock Band for the Wii, and I'm like, okay, I'll put this under the TellTrix thing for the 25 minutes or whenever, and we'll play Rock Band on the Wii.

02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:43.200
But lo and behold, it has an update, and in the middle of that, Power Outage for a second, it bricked my Wii, and now I have the Blue Light of Death. Not kidding.

02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:50.200
The Blue Light Special Death. Hold on. Did you get to grab your girlfriend's boobies tonight?

02:33:50.200 --> 02:34:03.200
No, but... Well, you have had a really bad day, then. I mean, I would think that at least to some type of concession for your bad day, she should be like, okay, I'll let you grab a boob. You know?

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:29.200
No, but we did actually kind of started crying on the point where Kairi disappears on Kingdom Hearts three and a half days. And, spoiler alert, sorry, but basically, oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, I saw an Xbox 360 console with a pay-to-play method at the arcades.

02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:49.200
Where it's like, okay, four tokens, four minutes, eight tokens, eight minutes, so and so forth, and I saw one, it was a modded Xbox, I swear to God, with a Japanese, weak copy of BeatMania 17 2DX.

02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:57.200
Yeah, I've seen arcades put StepMania machines in and try to make money off of it, so you know, I was part of that.

02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:09.200
And of all things, it was jerry-rigged into an actual BeatMania cabinet with the controller and everything, which I thought was kind of cool, but it was right next door to an actual BeatMania machine.

02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:25.200
And not only do they have that, but they also have it with DDR Universe and one with a hard pad, they have the Rock Band game there to play, and they even got some PlayStation 3's jerry-rigged up that way, too, with the token play stuff.

02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:27.200
Where's this place at? What's it called?

02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:33.200
Family Fun Center. It's in Omaha. FamilyFunCenter.net. Check it.

02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:37.200
Alright, well thanks for ratting them out. The developers that listen to this show will be glad to know.

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:42.200
And when that place closes down, rest in peace knowing it's all your fault.

02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:54.200
Honestly, they're not doing anything wrong. I mean, I don't think you, I'm sure that there's a fine print or something, but they do sell those actual kits that you can do pay-for-play stuff on the PS3 and all that stuff.

02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.200
It hooks up via JAMA and that kind of stuff. In fact, I was actually looking into getting some JAMA connectors for my Wii and stuff.

02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:05.200
That way I can do Tatsunoko vs Capcom on my arcade cabinet or, you know, stuff for my 360 or whatnot.

02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:12.200
I mean, because it's all available out there. It's just pay-for-play stuff. It's annoying, I guess, because consoles aren't meant for that.

02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:24.200
See, and I actually, I had three tokens left after the first BeatMania session, and actually it was four minutes in. I was in the middle of the hardest song, V, and I was near to tripling it.

02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:32.200
I was at the last second of it, and then pop up and did this ten second countdown for me to put in four extra tokens. I'm like, screw this, because I only have three left.

02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:34.200
And I popped it in the actual BeatMania machine.

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:43.200
You know what, that's what you get for playing V. Because seriously, that song is just overdone. Let it sit. That's what you get for playing V.

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:50.200
Alright, all joking aside, I know I've been rousing you tonight, but you let me. Thank you for calling in, and quick final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go.

02:36:50.200 --> 02:37:05.200
Definitely keep the good shows rocking, and actually, I'm the one who sent that one D.S. Silver's Mire code name. I like RPGs and music titles. Give me a few quick recommendations on XPLA and normal titles.

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:10.200
Oh, on my Xbox? I haven't signed into my Xbox in like a week. Or, I mean, a month.

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.200
No, on just Xbox 360 itself, what would you recommend?

02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:17.200
Oh, what would I recommend on Xbox 360? You said you're into RPGs?

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.200
Yeah, RPGs, music, and racing.

02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:32.200
Lost Odyssey, definitely Lost Odyssey. Blur is going to be a great racing game when it comes out. As far as what's out right now, maybe, it depends what kind of racing you like.

02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:35.200
Need for Speed Shift just came out, except it has a little game-breaking bug in it, but hey.

02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.200
And then as far as, what was the other one? You said RPGs?

02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:40.200
Burnout, Paradise.

02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:42.200
No, RPGs, driving, and?

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.200
Music.

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:44.200
Music.

02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:56.200
Oh, dude. Rock Band or Guitar Hero? Honestly, they're as good as everybody says they are. They're a little beaten into the ground, but if you don't have one yet, go get Rock Band 2, one of the Guitar Heroes, go get them.

02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:08.200
I'm waiting for Scratch. Because that's the only thing close to BeatMania with DLC we're ever going to get here, because I figured out now they're never going to release BeatMania ever again here in the States, which sucks.

02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:10.200
Welcome to what I told you years ago.

02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:18.200
They might do a BeatMania on PS3, and then that way it'll be region-free, so you will be able to get a BeatMania here.

02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.200
Alright, I gotta let you go, DS Master, but take care, buddy.

02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.200
Alright, keep the shows rocking, and peace out.

02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:30.200
Peace out! Alright. I give him a hard time.

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:32.200
Why does my head hurt more?

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.200
Alright, does your headache get worse? He's a loud caller.

02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:40.200
Fortunately, I can't normalize the audio on Skype. I'm sorry, guys. Alright, we are going to close the Skype line, though.

02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:48.200
We took like six calls tonight. That's a lot of calls, but we had some extra time tonight without DarkSakura here, and just not saying her, but just the fact that there's two hosts instead of three.

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:57.200
The show always seems to move a little faster because there's less people wanting to interject their opinions, so we get your opinions a little more, I'm sure, you guys. I appreciate it.

02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:02.200
AJ Mixx in chat says, Konami hates America too much to release good BeatMania here.

02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.200
No, instead we get Walk It Out and Twilight.

02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.200
Yippie skippy. Doesn't that pop in music game on the Wii look horrendous, but granted, isn't Japan getting that too? That's not just us.

02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:15.200
They already got it. We're getting it soon.

02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:20.200
And we get the crappy DDR.

02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:23.200
Which, by the way, remember how it was just Dance Dance Revolution at one time?

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.200
Yes.

02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:32.200
They were playing out in the three different games. Now they're going to do X2, Hottest Party 3, and then whatever the fuck. They're going to call it PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:39.200
Because the new, new one on the 360 and PS3 looked pretty sweet. It looked pretty epic, actually. I'm curious on this.

02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:42.200
But the thing is, though, they're going to be identical games. I mean, pretty much.

02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:43.200
That's fine.

02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.200
They're just changing the names so that people don't realize it.

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:56.200
Well, don't we see the same game get ported to two different systems all the frickin' time? I'm okay with that. If they're combining resources to make one really fucking good game across both consoles, I'm okay with that. Especially if it's not.

02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:58.200
We'll see. We'll see. Jury's out.

02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:06.200
All right. We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show tonight. We're done with Skypline tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through, but consider sending us an email. We'd love to hear from you.

02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:14.200
We're going to wrap up and get everybody's final thought tonight. Unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here right now. Maybe she'll come in during Afterbirth. I don't know. For live only folks.

02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:21.200
But I'm sure she would say goodnight and reject fault icons or something like that. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.200
I want my headache to go away. Now.

02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:29.200
My final thought is I am looking at Loki's bag from McDonald's and my mouth is watering because I'm hungry.

02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:30.200
There's fries in there.

02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:31.200
Is there? They're cold by now.

02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.200
Well, I threw them. Yeah.

02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:34.200
They weren't good to begin with.

02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:37.200
I'll stop by on the way home. There's a pretty good McDonald's by my house.

02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:45.200
All right. That's it. We're done. We're out of here. We will not be here next week, but we will have a best of so stay tuned to all games radio.

02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:48.200
We'll have a best of on the network next week and with some new content.

02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:52.200
So I don't want you to think it's simply old rehashed stuff.

02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:56.200
We're going to give some new stuff for our faithful listeners to we will be back in two weeks live.

02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:02.200
I apologize for all the time off recently. It's totally my fault, but I'm in it for the rest of the year.

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:04.200
You know, it just so happens that October is a crazy month.

02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:10.200
What can I say? Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you in two weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
