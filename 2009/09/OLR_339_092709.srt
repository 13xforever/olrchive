00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:25,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, September 27th, 2009, a controversial rumor hints at big Sega and Sony plans, PlayStation Home spinoff is PSP down, and is the sequel to one of this year's biggest hits already in the works?

2
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:43,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that video game program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:47,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So pull up a chair and join us for the next three hours as we talk about video games.

5
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:52,295
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be myself, Rob Roberts, and as always, your lovely co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,657
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, my friend?

7
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I am contemplative.

8
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Contemplative?

9
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's a very good word for how I am right now.

10
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Things you want to talk about on air or private things?

11
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:08,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a Dr. Phil therapy session here, an Oprah moment, if you will?

12
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Live on our video game program?

13
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:18,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I am going to only be here for about an hour, and then I'm going to a temple tonight.

14
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:19,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:19,900
[SPEAKER_08]: For...

16
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, services.

17
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:23,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have fun.

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, sorry that you won't be here for the whole show, but certainly understanding.

19
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,446
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have other commitments, you have other commitments.

20
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Try not to ruin my house.

21
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:30,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try.

22
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this isn't the first time we've taped a show at Studio DarkSakura without DarkSakura.

23
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be a little creepy.

24
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: But you will be here for a little while to, uh, give your colorful insight, as always.

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

26
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:41,111
Yes.

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki!

28
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:44,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are we gonna do?

29
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't have Sims 3 on my laptop right now.

30
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:53,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, what we'll do, we'll have DarkSakura bring it up on her computer and just put the microphone kind of like at a distance from the speaker.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I turn off the sound during the show.

32
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:56,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be like she's here.

33
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

34
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll hear the simlish every once in a while.

35
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be her input.

36
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:04,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds about right.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you think about Tokyo Game Show this year, DarkSakura?

38
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:10,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought about it.

39
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:11,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, you know what?

40
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:11,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what.

41
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:12,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a friend that went.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,821
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my friends from Berkeley, she lives in Japan now, and she went to Tokyo Game Show and posted lots of pictures of the cosplay and the win.

43
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was kind of a mixed bag this year.

44
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:31,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who of course tapes before us at All Games Radio, where we always tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

45
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug, plug, plug.

46
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:50,556
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 Pacific, gotta plug All Games because they let us steal their bandwidth every week but of course there's a bunch of great shows on All Games and the one before us is Bobby Blackwolf and he was kind of talking his piece and we were doing a little phone call at the end of his show as we always do and he had mentioned that some of the things he had heard on Tokyo Game Show this year, not so hot

47
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it depends on what you go there for.

48
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think she was just going there just to see and to look around, so I think she had a good time.

49
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:07,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the impression he didn't say who it was for whatever reason, which is fine, but I got the impression maybe because it was an industry person, so I didn't want to say who it was.

50
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably maybe from the industry perspective, it's eh.

51
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cool thing about Tokyo Game Show is that it is open to the public.

52
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something E3 is not.

53
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:17,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,770
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

56
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:19,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

57
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:41,079
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

58
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:13,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat with us during the program.

59
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back after a week off last week.

60
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:21,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we're a little spotty in our schedule right now.

61
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be out next week as well, but I have some good news.

62
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to have a best of show airing next week With some new content We're going to get together next week and tape some new content So we won't be live next week sadly But you will get to hear some of our best bits Going back a little ways too So some of our new fans in the past year or two And this will actually go to the podcast feed as well So you'll be able to hear it It'll air live first of course as it always does And then go to the podcast feed a little later So if you want to be the first to hear it Just stay tuned after Bobby next week like you always are Sadly we won't be here live But um

63
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after that, that should be it for the rest of the year.

64
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be here every show up through Christmas.

65
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:01,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Christmas is on to Sunday this year or New Year's and all that, so I think we'll be fine.

66
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:02,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyhow.

67
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:26,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says the OLR dinner table, yay I want to welcome all of our new chatters as well I'm not sure who exactly all in chat is new tonight But I do want to say welcome if you are new to the program And of course welcome to our veteran folks as well Especially those of you that have been with us for a long time Like Dark Tetsuya, I think he's been here every week since episode one You gotta love that

68
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

69
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:43,240
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, um, not very eventful, I should say.

70
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I really didn't play much of anything this week, Rob.

71
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for, um, like a game of pinball.

72
00:05:51,143 --> 00:06:00,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, because I haven't paid for my World of Warcraft account because of financial issues here at home, which hopefully I'll be able to rectify next week.

73
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, no, I take that back.

74
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:03,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I played some Sims.

75
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did for about 20 minutes.

76
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:12,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, as far as the pinball thing goes, one game that I played a little bit of this week, not a lot, but was Zen Pinball on PlayStation 3.

77
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Bobby was giving you some crap about that a while ago, saying, you gotta check it out, you gotta check it out.

78
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:22,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm gonna jump on board and say, you gotta check it out, because it is a pretty good pinball collection and some fun tables in there.

79
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I was finally getting into one of them.

80
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called V12.

81
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:31,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a racing table, and it's one of those things where there's like a field on top and then a play field underneath the glass.

82
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way they do it on the PlayStation 3 is kind of neat.

83
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

84
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:35,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth checking out.

85
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:00,842
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

86
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:22,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play a lot of games, mainly I played Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned This time though...

87
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they went and broke our modded games, which had us depressed for a while, we didn't really know what the hell we were going to do with the game now.

88
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So to kill our time until the new expansion comes out, we've been playing ranked games actually, and it's quite fun because we kick the crap out of everybody that plays with us.

89
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally I don't talk crap during my games, but if there's someone else that's playing outside of our group, I talk shit the entire time.

90
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:07,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

91
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

92
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So you now go, now ever since they banned your private games because you were doing the hack thing or whatever, you now go out on the public and play public matches.

93
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

94
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,247
[SPEAKER_03]: We play ranked games all the time.

95
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:19,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny.

96
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So will you now take challenges from all our listeners?

97
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, ranked games, it's just kind of a matter of chance getting into the same game.

98
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, right now, there's so few people playing ranked games.

99
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:40,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, at lunch, sometimes, because we have five consoles that all happen to be gold accounts, I can literally put all five consoles in a game and just take sniper shots at heads and stuff to kind of boost my stats a bit.

100
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:41,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But cheater, cheater.

101
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,914
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I only do it for the costumes and crap.

102
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Because really, there's no point in getting up the leaderboard.

103
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you get ranked 10 or whatever, you get 20 points.

104
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fucking whoop.

105
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

106
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to say real quick before we get too far away from the topic, but Pinball FX is the name of the pinball game on Xbox 360.

107
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:18,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you HitStun who said it first, and BlackWolf points out it's the same company that makes both games.

108
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why some of the tables hop across both of those games.

109
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:27,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And VidPower wants to point out, if you're listening live on this Sunday night, Pinball FX is on sale for the rest of today.

110
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are looking for... And I do have that game on 360.

111
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't played it in a long time.

112
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:32,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a Bork 360.

113
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm finally taking care of that this week.

114
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

115
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:40,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a decent pinball game as well.

116
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty much the same thing that's on the PlayStation 3.

117
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would totally urge you to check it out.

118
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:45,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Loki.

119
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:47,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but yeah, we're not really just cheating and stuff.

120
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:53,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just doing it to kind of... Because the other thing, too, that happens a lot of times is it will roll back our stats.

121
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, I was ranked 4 the other day.

122
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, like, the next day I was back $25,000 and back to rank 3 again.

123
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:00,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So there...

124
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:15,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaderboards kind of fucked up anyways, and instead of just wasting another 20 days to get the same amount of money, we're just going in there and doing headshot kills and stuff like that.

125
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:20,893
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, actually when we get into the games with everybody else, I definitely hold my own, so that's no problem.

126
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:30,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, on top of that, really it's not game playing, but I've been working on my arcade cabinet that I got, and it's actually pretty much done.

127
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:31,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's

128
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:38,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished sanding the whole thing and then re-spraying it with black spray paint.

129
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I got replacement buttons, replacement joysticks.

130
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:48,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually converted the panel that I had because it was a two-player panel with three buttons each.

131
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I drilled three more holes in there for the other six buttons.

132
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:52,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's

133
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,260
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:13,257
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,713
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

137
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:32,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it.

138
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:35,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You should come over and play with me.

139
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:39,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Once my life stops being so crazy and I'm going on all these trips and stuff, I will.

140
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm just going to get the damn thing at some point, too.

141
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,430
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll rock out.

142
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,310
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more weeks and DJ Hero will be out.

143
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocket Beals will be like, whatever.

144
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:47,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

145
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:52,512
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, between that and I've been getting back into WoW lately and you all know how that goes.

146
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not it.

147
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did play some new games this week.

148
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait.

149
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to interrupt you real quick.

150
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

151
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the new video for Final Fantasy XIV?

152
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:00,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

153
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that awesome?

154
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

155
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:04,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait.

156
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be a whole new crack right there.

157
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the greatest thing.

158
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,740
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't go back.

159
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,501
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks amazing.

160
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:12,281
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

161
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:14,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

162
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about some new games I played this week.

163
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, I played some portable games.

164
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:22,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I played on the PSP Phantasy Star Portable I decided to pick up because I was traveling this week.

165
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:47,275
[SPEAKER_02]: and you guys know I like to play portable games the most when I'm traveling as I'm sure a lot of you do so I picked up Phantasy Star Portable which is kind of a port of Phantasy Star Universe to the PSP which is weird because Phantasy Star Universe is an online game but Phantasy Star Portable doesn't really have that it has an ad hoc mode so you can play with local people but you can't really go online and play the universe is like online as in like Phantasy Star Online was online whereas you can play it offline though

166
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:53,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, Phantasy Star Universe has both a single player campaign and an online mode.

167
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Online was pretty much only online.

168
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the only place you could play it.

169
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I always played Phantasy Star Online offline.

170
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you had to have a hack disc or something to do that, I think.

171
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:01,567
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

172
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just make your own private rooms or something, right?

173
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:04,688
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you just play it offline.

174
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:05,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you do that?

175
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:06,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could do that.

176
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:07,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.

177
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so long, I can't even remember.

178
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:12,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't want to do dialogue because that was, you know, crap.

179
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:13,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of slow.

180
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:13,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

181
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy Star Portable is kind of a port of a single player campaign.

182
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:19,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the same campaign.

183
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:20,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make that clear.

184
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a much different story going on to the PSP.

185
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:25,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's weird because they made some weird decisions with it.

186
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,601
[SPEAKER_02]: A, they added voice acting, which is kind of not that great.

187
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:35,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing that they changed when they ported Fantasy Star Universe to the PSP is that they made...

188
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Station, Homebase, etc.

189
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:59,006
[SPEAKER_02]: because it says, well, if a person's name is green, they have new information for you.

190
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,648
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to just kind of like sit there and highlight different icons on a 2D map.

191
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:08,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're browsing the mall map at the mall saying, oh, I want to go to Hot Topic, I want to go to Sears, I want to go to, you know.

192
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't like that design choice.

193
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's my negative for the game.

194
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The positive for the game is that they did a pretty good job porting it over to the PSP graphically.

195
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:20,478
[SPEAKER_02]: The game still looks...

196
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: All together.

198
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And thusly, Phantasy Star Portable.

199
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:49,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm going to get some shit for this, but this is the reason why I couldn't continue to play the game online.

200
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too damn repetitive.

201
00:15:51,851 --> 00:16:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the variety that an online game such as WoW, Final Fantasy, even some of these other MMOs we've talked about in the...

202
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:04,984
[SPEAKER_02]: History of Our Gaming.

203
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:12,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I love the idea of an action-based MMO, but honestly, I feel so constrained as to what you really can do.

204
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,688
[SPEAKER_02]: You do these same sword moves over and over.

205
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, you can pick different weapons.

206
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I realize there's skill-ups, but you don't really mix and match things.

207
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of strategy as to what you mix and match, like how you chain things in Final Fantasy based around the elements, or how you...

208
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:31,315
[SPEAKER_02]: P.V.P.

209
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:57,076
[SPEAKER_02]: is very intensive in World of Warcraft and even some of the boss strategies go way beyond hack and slash I think that's part of the reason why Phantasy Star Universe just didn't end up being that fun I think a lot of people I know that played this game just played it for a little while and was like, eh, bored and I think that's why it kind of got old quick Phantasy Star Online I think was a little different because I think at the time we really didn't have anything like it I think of a game, honestly, and I know I'm going to get crap for saying this but I don't care

210
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as I love Phantasy Star Online I've played both online and universe pretty extensively as much as I do love and respect Phantasy Star Online I think if that game came out now it would tank

211
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:13,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But, granted, it's unfair to say, well, this game came out 10 years ago, let's hold it to today's standards.

212
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It was important for what it did 10 years ago, and it's always going to hold a place in gaming history.

213
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think the problem is, Phantasy Star Universe didn't evolve on that as much as it should have.

214
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:23,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's its biggest weakness.

215
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:29,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they should have a Gauntlet Legends online, like a version of Gauntlet Legends where...

216
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:37,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You can basically throw as many players as you want together and the game scales itself based on that.

217
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be pretty awesome.

218
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Link in our chatroom, chat.orangelongeradio.com, says part two for the Phantasy Star Portable is coming out next year.

219
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is one story that didn't make our show roll tonight, but that came out of Tokyo Game Show this week.

220
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:51,763
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making a Phantasy Star Portable 2, and that looks pretty cool that they're doing.

221
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:55,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say that's cool is because it's going to have online multiplayer.

222
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But even then, what are they going to do to make the game not so repetitive?

223
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:00,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my biggest question.

224
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:04,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardcore fans of Phantasy Star Universe are going to enjoy Phantasy Star Portable 2.

225
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:06,635
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

226
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:35,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking Personal Trainer Walking

227
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:59,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I haven't reached my 3,000 step goal for the day yet.

228
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you hit your 3,000 step goal for the day, it turns green.

229
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:05,294
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is no game in personal trainer walking.

230
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: All it does is that you communicate.

231
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,678
[SPEAKER_02]: The pedometer has an infrared device and so does the cartridge, which I thought was very interesting.

232
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:16,260
[SPEAKER_02]: You hold the device to the cartridge and you press a little button and it communicates like a graph.

233
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:17,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how you walk today.

234
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:21,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where the hours were that you did the most walking.

235
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were an animal, you would be a night owl or you would be a morning deer or whatever it is.

236
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:26,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Owls don't walk.

237
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:27,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

238
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's kind of smart, though.

239
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:30,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it says like that.

240
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,832
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tracking your activity in general.

241
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:33,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

242
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:36,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, and I can't stress this enough.

243
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There is really no game to this.

244
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:39,857
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tool.

245
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,820
[SPEAKER_02]: They did add some frilly little things.

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use your Miis.

247
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:48,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the first DS game where you can actually take your Mii from your Wii and put it on the DS.

248
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your me from your we on your d-s

249
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:13,831
[SPEAKER_02]: or you compete because the game actually comes with two pedometers so you can compete with somebody in your own house.

250
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:20,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The game will kind of pitch you against each other and see who's generating more power for the house.

251
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:34,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the only online mode that this thing has is that you communicate with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection and it will send your steps and it will say, this is how many steps the world has walked cumulatively.

252
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

253
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in this mode called Walk the World, and you can see how long it took for everybody to walk from the world to the moon.

254
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And that took about three months.

255
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:48,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, everybody that's playing Personal Training is trying to walk to Mars, and they're about a third of the way to Mars from the moon.

256
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:49,364
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

257
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:51,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's a little silly.

258
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's a fun kind of silly.

259
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little noby-noby void.

260
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just thinking that.

261
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:57,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

262
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:00,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, is that unfortunately...

263
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:05,406
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more that could have been done here.

264
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: What about me getting to compete with my friends?

265
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't think the challenges are particularly that challenging.

266
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:23,367
[SPEAKER_02]: 3,000 steps in a day, either the device is very generous in what it's measuring, but in looking at the graphs, I can kind of remember, oh yeah, this is my lunch, this is when I was walking down to get coffee for the day.

267
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny that you can remember those things, but I didn't find 3,000 steps particularly challenging.

268
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of do that in a normal day.

269
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because I'm a teacher and I pace the room as I teach.

270
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, can you increase it?

271
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,110
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

272
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,011
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I haven't seen that happen yet.

273
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set your own goals for yourself, but the game always challenges you to get to 3,000.

274
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:40,474
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I normally wouldn't get up and walk, except I get up and walk all the time.

276
00:21:58,423 --> 00:21:58,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

277
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to encourage people to have a normal amount of activity.

278
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what the game is ultimately trying to do.

279
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:10,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the other thing I want to point out is that the game also, you know, it gives you these little mini goals.

280
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, your mini goal for today, watch the number of calories you consume.

281
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:17,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Or go for the longest walk you possibly can today.

282
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It does give you little mini goals, but the game doesn't really reward you or punish you if you don't meet them.

283
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You track them on a calendar, that's it.

284
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:35,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I find this game to be an enhancement to an already... If you think this kind of information is worth it to you, like you want to be able to track your walking patterns, you want a little bit of incentive, go for it.

285
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there could have been a lot more that could have been done with this game.

286
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's worth $50.

287
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:50,594
[SPEAKER_03]: What they should have done, and what I'm guessing they probably didn't do because this is Nintendo and they take the easy way out, is they should have integrated this game where you can track that data for Wii Fit+.

288
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:57,882
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably didn't do that because then that would mean effort and they're not going to put that effort in.

289
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I think a better comparison would be EA Active.

290
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:06,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think EA Active probably does the best job that I've seen so far out of all the games that have really given you a plan and having you stick to it.

291
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So proceed with caution with personal trainer walking.

292
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,725
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are interested in this, I don't think you absolutely need it.

293
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:17,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what you need, not this game, is Walk It Out from Konami.

294
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:21,347
[SPEAKER_03]: A game where you're not only walking, you're fake walking...

295
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:22,973
[SPEAKER_03]: In a game.

296
00:23:23,594 --> 00:23:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Listening to music.

297
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're basically marching in place.

298
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,822
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds idiotic.

299
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a walking game.

300
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:33,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rhythm music game that's walking.

301
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,073
[SPEAKER_03]: You walk to a rhythm basically.

302
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:35,801
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

303
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to leave your DS on to track it?

304
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:22,086
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the little pedometer must have a pretty powerful battery in there because it just works.

305
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:26,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You just communicate with your DS once a day, you know, and then you don't have to leave your DS on at all.

306
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,449
[SPEAKER_02]: The little pedometer is very tiny.

307
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the size, a little larger than a silver dollar, honestly.

308
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:33,512
[SPEAKER_02]: No, maybe not.

309
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a quarter of the size of the iPhone is about how big it is.

310
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just leave it in your pocket and that does all the tracking for you.

311
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:40,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

312
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:41,396
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

313
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:42,617
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

314
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:01,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I do also want to say this.

315
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:02,496
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bit of

316
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:49,268
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not an easy thing to have to say or do especially when you consider it's charity however there is a conflict has arisen with my day job it is one I have to do and I'm sure and as you can all understand work comes first even before some of these other things so unfortunately we will have to back out of the Extra Life event and not participate but we will make a nice donation on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio to one of the groups participating there may yet be something to be mentioned later we might do something in the future that we'll do

317
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:59,195
[SPEAKER_02]: so but as as far as us doing our show for 24 hours and all that we're not going to be able to do that because unfortunately I'm just not going to be available I have work commitments and

318
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so that's a really sucky thing but you know best of luck to those guys I think it's for a great cause we'll certainly be donating and you know again good luck I hope we can do our own charity thing in the winter also I believe Bobby Blackwell's Friday Night Gaming is doing something in the next couple weeks I think they're doing it like two weeks after and I apologize if I'm misstating anything but I think he mentioned something about that so lots of fun charity events coming up all for good causes so keep your eyes out for that

319
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

320
00:26:46,472 --> 00:27:03,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, for our UK release dates, we have on the 29th, Jam Sessions 2 for DS, and Left 4 Dead Crash Course, and Tales of Monkey Island, Lair of the Leviathan, and on the 30th, Fate Unlimited Codes, it says.

321

[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on the first Fallout 3, Operation Anchorage, Fallout 3 The Pit, and Gran Turismo for PSP, there's...

322
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:26,252
[SPEAKER_08]: and Beater Raider on PSP and Dead Space Extraction, FIFA 10, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and Risen for PC.

323
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:31,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to quickly say Bobby in chat clarified his charity event is October 30th.

324
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:33,135
[SPEAKER_02]: That's him and his Friday Night Gaming project.

325
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So, keep an eye out for that.

326
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Beater Raider, that's the Timbaland game, right?

327
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:37,277
[SPEAKER_02]: On PSP?

328
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:37,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

329
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:38,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Beater Raider.

330
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,578
[SPEAKER_08]: That just sounds vile.

331
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:41,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It does a little bit.

332
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like beat it off a raider.

333
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to go there.

334
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:46,319

[SPEAKER_03]: She's on her way out.

369
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually the Trinity thing.

370
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually one of those games.

371
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:15,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cross game where they have the characters from everything.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jay Dizzle, who was first to say it in chat.

[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we'll see you when you get back.

379

[SPEAKER_02]: Should be.

397
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

398
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:46,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's just Loki and I just holding down the fort over the next few hours.

[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys in chat as well.

400
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:53,484
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki's gonna steal Jamie's chair so he has a better place to sit.

401
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:56,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That chair is way uncomfortable and too small and I'm getting a headache from sitting on it.

402
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we'll have to figure out something in the future.

403
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's much better.

404
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

405
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have a folding chair in my car, of all places.

406
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:06,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care, this chair is much better.

407
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

408
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is her throne after all.

409
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?

410
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:16,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in case you weren't aware, there was a wee price drop today.

411
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It dropped down to $1.99.

412
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:24,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those really well-kept secrets, I guess.

413
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like numerous ads leaked out and leaks everywhere.

414
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:36,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so maybe it wasn't so secret, but it is official now, and that's kind of cool.

415
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:43,026
[SPEAKER_03]: To kind of go along with that, though, in Europe, you don't get a price drop, sorry.

416
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:50,150
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you do get a new bundle, and they're going to be including both Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort in that bundle.

417
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess a little more bang for your buck, which is kind of cool.

418
00:35:55,473 --> 00:36:04,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny is that on last week's show, I predicted that that would be a bundle, so I was kind of half right, because I kind of meant that it would be a bundle here, but it ends up that it's going to be a bundle over there.

419
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's...

420
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:34,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, we may see something like that come over here if they're really hurting for sales but I don't think that right now they're going to bring it over here I don't know if you did see though Wii Sports Resort though is going to be getting a different bundle over here actually in a few months where they're going to be including two Wii Motion Pluses with it instead of just one so you get a little bit of a savings there as well hoping to drive some more sales for that I guess

421
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to read this lousy statement in chat first before we discuss this story.

422
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:43,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed that Suma in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, Headache for sitting in a chair.

423
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:45,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess we know where Loki's brain was located.

424
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:55,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tension headache from my neck because it's bad posture in that chair and I have to sit forward and there's, I mean, literally the back of the chair comes up to like,

425
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:57,849
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

426
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:23,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now the problem is that they've... I mean, there's already plenty of systems out there, so they're going to be the number one system.

427
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:25,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this will help.

428
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:27,107
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii's going to be popular anyways.

429
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:32,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Software-wise, though, there's nothing really other than the new Super Mario Bros.

430
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:35,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii that's that amazing.

431
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:37,033
[SPEAKER_02]: A AAA title.

432
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:40,235
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no real, like, must-have titles coming out this fall.

433
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:46,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's going to be good titles coming out, but nothing like, oh my god, it's a new Zelda game, or oh my god, you know, it's, you know...

434
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,641
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

435
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:08,654
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

436
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:15,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii just seems like, eh, let's throw a game where there's four players and stuff like that and kind of run with it.

437
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:19,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I remember correctly, isn't that the one that plays the game for yourself or plays the game for you?

438
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:23,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it has that whole little controversial pause and skip ahead mode.

439
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:26,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just going to say, old school is new school, remember?

440
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:30,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not so hung up on the graphics and all that stuff.

441
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:31,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool with the way they're doing the game.

442
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see a Mario game like that.

443
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:35,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with the game being that way.

444
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the effort put into it.

445
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that they went and improved the graphics or anything.

446
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying, I guess the example would be Mario 1 to Mario 2 in Japan.

447
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:49,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

448
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:55,207
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some new levels in there, but they didn't go and add anything really new as far as the game and stuff.

449
00:38:55,487 --> 00:39:00,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas Mario 3 was completely new, Mario World was completely new.

450
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know, this doesn't really seem... It's like half-assed releases is what it is.

451
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny, though?

452
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:09,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this game's still going to be huge.

453
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:10,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

454
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody fucking loves Mario Bros.

455
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,493
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say everybody, I don't mean just gamers.

456
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:21,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows Super Mario Bros., the old school Nintendo game.

457
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:21,983
[SPEAKER_03]: People are retarded.

458
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:23,844
[SPEAKER_03]: They will buy anything that has Mario in it.

459
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Mario Tennis sells well.

460
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:27,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking tennis game.

461
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:31,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's got Mario, so I must buy it.

462
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:35,570
[SPEAKER_03]: If they came out with like... And you know what they're going to fucking do.

463
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,311
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how they're going to sell that crappy Vitality Sensor.

464
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:42,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be Mario, like Dr. Mario's Vitality Sensor or some shit like that.

465
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Mario Visits Trauma Center?

466
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:44,394
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

467
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:45,655
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Vitality Sensor.

468
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:45,775
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

469
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,312
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have like a... If Dr. Mario was a puzzle game, that doesn't get your vitality.

470
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:49,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

471
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:51,534
[SPEAKER_03]: The character Dr. Mario will be in there.

472
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:51,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

473
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:51,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

474
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,677
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because people are like, oh my god, Mario must buy it.

475
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

476
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:04,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It... Well, it's, you know, effort for trying, but it's going to be hard with not that many big releases coming out.

477
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:08,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the 360 and PlayStation 3 have a lot of releases coming out that are going to be really big titles.

478
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:09,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, then again...

479
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:13,928
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that buy the Wii aren't necessarily looking for the big titles.

480
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,269
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to buy Mario games.

481
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:20,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I just want to go on record and say I think this new Super Mario Bros.

482
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,995
[SPEAKER_02]: game is, for that audience, the game.

483
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

484
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:26,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're giving it enough credit.

485
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:27,858
[SPEAKER_02]: From a gamer perspective, I get what you're saying.

486
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:33,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But from an accessibility perspective and selling to the soccer moms of America, I totally get what they're doing here.

487
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:35,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the game will sell pretty well.

488
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,008
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were Mario Galaxy 2 right now, it'd be a little bit different.

489
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird that that's not out already.

490
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:48,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have teased that game that it is coming out, but it's surprising it's not coming out this holiday season.

491
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:51,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're first-party games now, it's only like one or two a month.

492
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Or not even a month.

493
00:40:53,573 --> 00:41:00,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, let's throw some really obscure DS games out there that suck and end up being like something else.

494
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:02,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay, Professor Layton's pretty awesome.

495
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:03,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that did well.

496
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:10,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Fossil Fighters, though, is exactly the same as this other game that was put out called Fossil League DTS, I think.

497
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And

498
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out from Sega a while ago.

499
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's literally almost exactly the same game.

500
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:19,056
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

501
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of tanked.

502
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:51,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Wii Sports Resort, it's doing well, but I don't think as well as someone would figure for a Wii Sports sequel.

503
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think that that thing would be flying off the shelves, like selling millions of copies.

504
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a gradual sell throughout Christmas.

505
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:01,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's going to be under a lot of Christmas trees this season.

506
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Fit Plus?

507
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

508
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop re-releasing the same damn games.

509
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Do something absolutely new.

510
00:42:10,263 --> 00:42:11,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Something groundbreaking.

511
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:20,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think all these games, the new Super Mario Bros., the Wii Sports Resort, the Wii Fit+, these games are going to show up under many Christmas trees this holiday season.

512
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games are still going to sell very well.

513
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:26,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get, believe me, as a hardcore gamer, I get what you're saying.

514
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,475
[SPEAKER_02]: They cashed out.

515
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:28,176
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they did.

516
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:29,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They cashed out.

517
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:29,857
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold out.

518
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:30,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold out.

519
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:31,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

520
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:34,340
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making, they're shitting money at this point.

521
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you blame them?

522
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:36,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you blame them?

523
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Hockey

524
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

525
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

526
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:16,952
[SPEAKER_03]: and it did okay.

527
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, not... Well, what else to sell to soccer moms but a soccer game?

528
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Mario Football.

529
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, or something like that.

530
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe that'd sell better.

531
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:28,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But, it's just...

532
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: and then again, it doesn't matter because it has Mario in it.

533
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:42,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, when I'm selling this to my customers, if I said, hey look, it's Mario Dodgeball or something, or not even Dodgeball, let me think of a crappier sport.

534
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:43,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Curling, okay?

535
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be like, oh Mario, I'm buying that.

536
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:47,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be something completely crappy.

537
00:44:50,681 --> 00:44:51,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

538
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:54,503
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Mario...

539
00:44:55,874 --> 00:45:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Water Polo or Mario... Hey, we might have some Water Polo players that kind of resent that remark you're making.

540
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:06,319
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need is like a Mario snowboarding game.

541
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:09,120
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty sweet.

542
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,421
[SPEAKER_03]: How about another Mario Paint?

543
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,161
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to see.

544
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:12,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

545
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:18,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And where the fuck is that damn Bob Ross game that they promised us from a long-ass time ago?

546
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:19,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell is that shit?

547
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:20,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it get canceled?

548
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we have a story on that a while back that got canceled?

549
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:23,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a painting game.

550
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

551
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:24,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.

552
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:25,743
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

553
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:29,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do know that they do have a Mario snowboarding game.

554
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:31,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mario and Sonic, but whatever.

555
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

556
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:39,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about something besides Mario, but we will stay on the topic of price drops, and we'll talk about Microsoft.

557
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:47,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, we already know that the Xbox 360 recently got a price drop, but there, of course, is a mole out there that helps out the website Ars Technica.

558
00:45:47,800 --> 00:46:14,623
[SPEAKER_02]: and apparently they had reported earlier this week that there was going to be some other types of price drops going on and apparently there's going to be a holiday bundle that includes Pure and Lego Batman with an Xbox 360 Elite kind of like a little bundle coming out over there which apparently Joystick has their own mole, that's Joystick with a Q that got a picture of what it looks like although it looks like it might be like an Australian box because of the ratings on the cover there the other ones are U.S.

559
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

560
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:21,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Once pictures surface, you kind of know that's going to happen.

561
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was photoshopped either.

562
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty legit.

563
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, supposedly getting a price drop over at Microsoft's World, the 802.11n adapter.

564
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:36,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that is the new one because it's N. That's coming out for $100.

565
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,495
[SPEAKER_02]: The G is getting the price drop to $79.99.

566
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Still way too damn expensive.

567
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:45,978
[SPEAKER_02]: for a feature that you should consider that the PlayStation 3 has built into it.

568
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And seriously, you could go buy a wireless switch or whatever way cheaper than that, and it would work perfectly.

569
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a non-Xbox 360 router.

570
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:06,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a wireless gaming router that's supposed to work with all my systems that I just basically run a Cat5 from my box to this gaming router and it works fine.

571
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It works perfect.

572
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:18,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I had my PlayStation 2 online once in a while for the DDR games that were online and Amplitude and stuff, I would just switch out the Cat5 from the Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and it worked fine.

573
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked great.

574
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:23,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the original Xbox I would use that with too.

575
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So it worked great for all those systems.

576
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:27,098
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

577
00:47:47,294 --> 00:47:48,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Some comments in chat.

578
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:54,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says there's going to be a bundle that includes the wireless adapter, a media controller, 1,000 Microsoft points, and three months of life.

579
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and it looks like a big box of popcorn.

580
00:47:58,197 --> 00:47:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: How cute.

581
00:47:59,537 --> 00:48:02,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess is that targeted at the Netflix audience?

582
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:03,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

583
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

584
00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

585
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:12,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelantradio.com as we tape on this lovely Sunday evening at allgames.com.

586
00:48:12,815 --> 00:48:17,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's not too big of a surprise, I mean, because the Japanese love their Final Fantasy.

587
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course... I love my Final Fantasy.

588
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:21,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with Japan there.

589
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, too.

590
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, announced at Tokyo Game Show to go along with the...

591
00:48:27,243 --> 00:48:30,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna be, you know, epic release of Final Fantasy XIII.

592
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the Final Fantasy XIII PlayStation 3.

593
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but it gets better.

594
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:39,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also got a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

595
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

596
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the FCC doesn't lie.

597
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:42,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but wait a second.

598
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:45,259
[SPEAKER_03]: The FCC is only in the U.S.

599
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's coming out over here later on.

600
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:49,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is... Oh, interesting.

601
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is coming out in Japan.

602
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:52,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got...

603
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:55,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I wish I'd waited for the PlayStation 3 then.

604
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:59,027
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to release a Final Fantasy XIII one here, that sounds awesome.

605
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And it dropped in price.

606
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:04,808
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, does yours have backwards compatibility?

607
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:07,729
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have like the crappiest PlayStation 3 possible.

608
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:11,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fat and it doesn't have backwards compatibility.

609
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought it six months before the price dropped.

610
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just praying mine doesn't die.

611
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've got full backwards compatibility.

612
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:17,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use it.

613
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:19,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Never.

614
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, backwards compatibility might be coming back, but that's in the future.

615
00:49:24,113 --> 00:49:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that story later.

616
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:27,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big thing.

617
00:49:27,393 --> 00:49:28,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of price.

618
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:36,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this new system is going to be coming out for 41,600 yen.

619
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's got... It basically looks like a white, possibly silver system with a pink silk screen on it.

620
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:47,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

621
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

622
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:13,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And to go along with that, though, there's going to be some more bundles coming out.

623
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:17,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, not in the U.S., because God forbid we actually announce something over here.

624
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be having a 250 gigabyte system for quite a few different games, including the new Ratchet & Clank, Kraken Time.

625
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:29,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Also...

626
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:35,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Assassin's Creed 2, FIFA 10, Need for Speed Shift, and Uncharted 2.

627
00:50:36,573 --> 00:50:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all kind of leaked out of a Norwegian GameStop database.

628
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:44,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

629
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:44,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

630
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you better believe if the Norwegian... If they're getting it over there, we're probably going to get it over here.

631
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:53,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not that many bundles.

632
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:56,067
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be really freaking crazy, but...

633
00:50:58,692 --> 00:50:59,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll get something.

634
00:50:59,692 --> 00:51:01,814
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to announce something in time for Christmas.

635
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:05,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to cash in on that, I guess.

636
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

637
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:11,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if you see Xbox 360 getting one, you know that PlayStation 3 is going to have one as well.

638
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:13,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily.

639
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:14,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they do one every year.

640
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:17,285
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done it for the last three years with the Xbox 360.

641
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:24,651
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, they're actually... Because the arcade, I think, last year had one game bundled with it, and then the other ones had two.

642
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:25,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the Kung Fu Panda...

643
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:30,148
[SPEAKER_03]: and Lego Indiana Jones.

644
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: These games we had a million extra copies of sitting over here.

645
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:35,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the Lego one sold pretty good, huh?

646
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,613
[SPEAKER_02]: But that Kung Fu Panda couldn't have been a huge...

647
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually supposed to be pretty good.

648
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:39,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

649
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:40,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

650
00:51:40,228 --> 00:51:41,749
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fair enough.

651
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shut up.

652
00:51:42,289 --> 00:51:44,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like my kid's first action game.

653
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:44,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

654
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:53,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is now going to take us to the next story, which is probably, in my opinion, I think kind of the biggest news story this week, even though it is a huge fat rumor, right?

655
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a fat rumor.

656
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:56,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely true.

657
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:00,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why it's absolutely true is it's coming from Sega's FTP site.

658
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:02,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It just got leaked out there, and they're like, oh, shit.

659
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:03,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Pulled it back.

660
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:05,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's absolutely true.

661
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:08,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their minutes from a meeting that they had.

662
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:16,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's a few things in there that don't really make any sense, but for a while, though, they did have a link straight to that file on their FTP site.

663
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you able to grab it when it was up there?

664
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't able to grab it.

665
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't able to get it either.

666
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:24,814
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have it basically transposed on here, so it's everything.

667
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:28,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's what it did entail, though.

668
00:52:28,459 --> 00:52:29,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of new... Wait, back up.

669
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was from a meeting between Sega and Sony, apparently, that occurred.

670
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:35,543
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like the minutes... August 6th.

671
00:52:35,643 --> 00:52:36,804
[SPEAKER_03]: ...we're sitting up in the FTP.

672
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess August 5th was when the meeting was, and then August 6th they kind of, you know...

673
00:52:43,408 --> 00:52:44,449
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

674
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:08,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the motion controller.

675
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:10,134
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking a little bit about that.

676
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:12,936
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff that was pretty much at Tokyo Game Show.

677
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Mentioning it's coming out in the spring, which I think they've already mentioned anyways.

678
00:53:16,299 --> 00:53:25,406
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, seeing that they can differentiate with a different PlayStation SKU or something like that with it.

679
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:28,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about Alpha Protocol, Planet 51.

680
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:30,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see here.

681
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get through the good stuff.

682
00:53:32,051 --> 00:53:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Do-do-do-do-do.

683
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:36,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.

684
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,300
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 emulator for PlayStation 3.

685
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Confidential!

686
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:40,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't leak this out.

687
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:45,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they want to sell all PlayStation 2 titles on the PlayStation Network.

688
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:47,087
[SPEAKER_03]: See how that works.

689
00:53:47,588 --> 00:53:56,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bother giving you a free update that includes the emulator for your system when we can sell you every single game all over again for a price?

690
00:53:57,296 --> 00:54:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's weird, they're gonna, I mean, you know, we kind of saw this coming.

691
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:07,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't it weird, though, that they're gonna have some PlayStation 3s out there that can just do it, and some that can't?

692
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:21,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that, I mean, if they were sporting like that, I would hope that they would actually update it like they did with the PlayStation... Well, actually, I think the original PlayStation 3s had the PlayStation 1 emulation already built into it, so...

693
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:23,006
[SPEAKER_03]: They still do.

694
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine will still play PS1 games.

695
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:27,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they'll still play it because the software emulation is built in there.

696
00:54:27,227 --> 00:54:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is something they could add with a patch if it's running through software where you could be able to play the PlayStation 2 games straight from your drive.

697
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:36,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not because they're assholes.

698
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't know.

699
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're assuming.

700
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You are making an assumption here.

701
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:42,149
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know this for sure.

702
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:43,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And the memo's not even out.

703
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're kind of making an assumption based on just how long we've been following the gaming industry and what we just kind of expect is going to happen.

704
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:55,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's going to find a way to cash in on this, and that's why.

705
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:59,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't anticipate them being generous with that.

706
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember a theory I had a while ago that the PSP Go – because I was like, why the hell – I mean, honestly, we're trying to find reasons to buy a PSP Go, and we can't think of anything –

707
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:15,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, PSP 3000, I can think of plenty of reasons to get that.

708
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,412
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP Go, can't really think of one, unless you need a smaller system.

709
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:20,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would be one.

710
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:24,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But I theorized a while ago, what if the PS2 games you can only play on the PSP Go?

711
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:29,597
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thought is, no, there's no real change in the hardware on the PSP Go, so what have you.

712
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make a little more sense to me and it's a little weird that they are going to lose one big perk about the PS1 games paying for them on the PlayStation Network because that is one thing you can't do.

713
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:44,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have the PS1 disc, you can't just beam it to your PSP.

714
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:47,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only do that with the downloaded ones.

715
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:53,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing I could see them adding the backwards compatibility because really the PlayStation 2 is at the end of its life cycle.

716
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:59,091
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of game series already have cut their PlayStation 2 versions.

717
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:00,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slowly dying out.

718
00:56:00,892 --> 00:56:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably be gone by the end of next year.

719
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:05,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

720
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:07,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just interesting.

721
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:10,839
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and then other things that's interesting.

722
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:16,044
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about the possibility of import games coming out over here, which is kind of neat.

723
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be neat to see some of those over there.

724
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:23,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that also with the PlayStation 2 emulation,

725
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:40,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're saying, now this doesn't make any sense because it's all abbreviated, but it says, for company marketing money show, PlayStation 3 controller on TV ads, similar to EA Sports Spot, since you don't even know what the hell that means.

726
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP titles, massive franchises, I don't know.

727
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:51,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to the good stuff.

728
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:51,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh,

729
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, all this is pretty boring.

730
00:56:56,772 --> 00:56:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the Dreamcast stuff?

731
00:56:58,113 --> 00:56:59,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was in there.

732
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the Dreamcast games are going to be coming to the PlayStation 3, right?

733
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that something that was in there?

734
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:06,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I better read the abbreviated stuff here.

735
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, they're talking about the Dreamcast stuff coming in.

736
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:21,207
[SPEAKER_03]: The possibilities of Japanese import games and possibility of Dreamcast titles on the PlayStation Network.

737
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,490
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Box 360 X-Box 360

738
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy a game for $100.

739
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:49,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how many Sonic games it has on there.

740
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, I don't think the DC Dreamcast emulator is as big of a deal as some might make it out to be.

741
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:58,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there already are ways out there that you can get the Dreamcast games emulated.

742
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:01,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Like GameTap has some of the Dreamcast games available on it.

743
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the PS3 is supposed to basically be a computer, right?

744
00:58:04,774 --> 00:58:06,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Xbox 360 is to an extent too.

745
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not surprising that they're able to emulate Dreamcast on it.

746
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are giving them the option to be exclusive on the PlayStation 3.

747
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:17,819
[SPEAKER_03]: It says if we give them a long period of exclusivity, they will give us more marketing support.

748
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:24,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says if we provide a list of Dreamcast titles, Sony will let us know which ones they're interested in having exclusively.

749
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So there may be some that you see exclusive because they're going to go where the money is.

750
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes perfect sense.

751
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:34,085
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a patch that lets me on PS3 read my Dreamcast discs?

752
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be amazing?

753
00:58:36,574 --> 00:58:39,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, too bad the Dreamcast discs are a proprietary technology.

754
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:41,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's not going to happen, but a man can dream.

755
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that proprietary.

756
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:45,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, shit, I can read them on my computer.

757
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:53,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there something special to them, though, where you had to compress some Dreamcast games to fit on a CD because they actually held somewhere between a CD and a DVD?

758
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like GD-ROM or something, right?

759
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the whole thing they were saying.

760
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:00,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm thinking Saturn, my mistake.

761
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
00:59:23,403 --> 00:59:24,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, interesting.

763
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:25,105
[SPEAKER_02]: All that's true.

764
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it is still, you have to consider, is in negotiation.

765
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,473
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean all of this is happening tomorrow or at the end of the year.

766
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this, you know, you were talking about talks between two companies, and this whole leak might also change things dramatically.

767
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, heads are rolling over this shit right now about the fact that this got out on the internet, whoever uploaded it.

768
00:59:48,736 --> 00:59:49,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was an accident.

769
00:59:49,856 --> 00:59:50,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be huge.

770
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:53,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And could actually damage the relationship between the two companies.

771
00:59:53,879 --> 01:00:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think ultimately, you know... Sony just can't keep a secret.

772
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, neither can Microsoft.

773
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:03,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know.

774
01:00:03,827 --> 01:00:04,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

775
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know...

776
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:09,382
[SPEAKER_03]: A big nugget like that, you know, with backwards compatibility.

777
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:12,066
[SPEAKER_02]: They really got screwed at E3 this year.

778
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:17,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how Jack Trenton came out there and he was like, Hey, there's one thing you didn't spoil, Final Fantasy XIV, huh?

779
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:19,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't see that one coming, did you?

780
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else we got screwed on, but at least we got to wow you once.

781
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:25,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

782
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:29,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, speaking of Sony, it is official.

783
01:00:29,403 --> 01:00:39,027
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no UMD conversion program for the PSP Go, meaning if you wanted to convert your UMD discs, they were talking about this whole, you know, you could do a kiosk and all this stuff.

784
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:40,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, not happening.

785
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It all boils down to, and actually, the way it's phrased kind of makes sense.

786
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read the quote here.

787
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: We were evaluating a UMD conversion program due to legal and technical reasons.

788
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:51,033
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be offering the program at this time.

789
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:55,394
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesperson in an interview with Kotaku.

790
01:00:56,995 --> 01:01:04,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But not surprising, the reasons that kind of when you further get into it have to do with the game distribution licensing and probably the agreements with the developers.

791
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:06,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually makes sense.

792
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does and it doesn't.

793
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,321
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

794
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:25,817
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

795
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:41,825
[SPEAKER_02]: by March 31st, 2010.

796
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:47,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you have to connect your old PSP model to the PlayStation Network.

797
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:50,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like they know you have both, basically.

798
01:01:50,548 --> 01:01:51,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just for buying the machine.

799
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:53,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to connect your old one.

800
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You will get three free UMD... I'm sorry, UMD-less games.

801
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are from a list.

802
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get any old games.

803
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pick from a list that includes Killzone Liberation, Wipeout Pure, Patapon, some of the BuzzBrain and BuzzMaster games, and so forth.

804
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of an incentive than we're getting here, at least.

805
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:19,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, even with the three free games, I'm kind of sitting here going, So let me get this straight.

806
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Your system is more expensive.

807
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:26,272
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way for me to transfer my old games that I bought to this new system.

808
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:29,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The system doesn't do anything differently.

809
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't play my UMD games on it.

810
01:02:36,513 --> 01:02:39,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's chic, and it's new technology, and it fits in your pocket.

811
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:40,534
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

812
01:03:06,055 --> 01:03:06,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's it.

813
01:03:06,836 --> 01:03:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to die a slow death.

814
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the system is going to bomb terribly.

815
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that as a fanboy.

816
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that as a I can imagine people going into their local GameStop or GameCrazy just knowing the type of people that usually work there at the front desk making decent recommendations.

817
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:24,455
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a lot of these people that say, you know what?

818
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:25,495
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

819
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,720
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it comes in.

820
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,601
[SPEAKER_03]: A credit card.

821
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:48,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a credit card or these points cards in order to get it.

822
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:49,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And the parents are going to say, fuck that.

823
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:56,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in GameStop or GameCrazy's best interest to sell the ones that require the discs anyway, right?

824
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:58,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, I mean, come on.

825
01:03:58,946 --> 01:04:05,528
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, and I hope this doesn't happen over here because really it's just like, you did what?

826
01:04:06,529 --> 01:04:08,970
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, they're dropping the price to the $3,000.

827
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:11,137
[SPEAKER_03]: What?!

828
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:13,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you stupid?!

829
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:16,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the system's more expensive.

830
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:20,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's... Well, no, that's great, because the PSP 3000 is the system you should be getting.

831
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:21,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

832
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would recommend you get it.

833
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:34,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but it's like you're not gonna sell more PSP Go's if... It's like they're putting it out there to get people to go, well, you know, hey, I want a PlayStation Portable, but I'm not buying this Go, I'm gonna buy the 3000.

834
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha, we tricked you, you bought a PlayStation Portable.

835
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:38,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

836
01:04:40,724 --> 01:05:03,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see any GameStop employee recommending the PSP Go when they can say you can get $3,000 and you can get a game or two for the same price which would look better under the stocking I think the system with a couple games I'm very curious to see how the sales figures look this system comes out this week right?

837
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:06,475
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

838
01:05:26,804 --> 01:05:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Quest was basically Bejeweled anyways.

839
01:05:27,905 --> 01:05:28,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

840
01:05:54,346 --> 01:05:56,167
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

841
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

842
01:06:21,487 --> 01:06:24,593
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been playing Bejeweled Blitz like fucking crazy.

843
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, she's been beating my scores.

844
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:28,700
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been just sitting there playing it all the time.

845
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's addictive.

846
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's addictive.

847
01:06:29,802 --> 01:06:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.

848
01:06:31,104 --> 01:06:31,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Here...

849
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't Discount Facebook Gaming

850
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at your friends list.

851
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:57,303
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have non-gamers at your friends list, look at the amount of Facebook games they're playing.

852
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And the moms playing Farm Town and Bejeweled Blitz.

853
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:04,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamers, look out.

854
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,471
[SPEAKER_02]: This Facebook games thing is going to be huge.

855
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:09,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully there's some good news for us in there too, but I'm just saying.

856
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:11,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I play Bejeweled Blitz.

857
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:12,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

858
01:07:13,376 --> 01:07:14,597
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice little time waster.

859
01:07:14,637 --> 01:07:15,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a minute.

860
01:07:17,185 --> 01:07:19,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I can totally respect what PopCap is doing.

861
01:07:19,147 --> 01:07:22,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they're a pretty cool company, all things considered.

862
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

863
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:25,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

864
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:28,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

865
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:29,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see.

866
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:32,135
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

867
01:07:56,175 --> 01:08:02,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny, we're actually clearing out some old-ass games that we've been just sitting on.

868
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:08,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the games that we have is the Jonas Brothers, or not the Jonas Brothers, it's the Naked Brothers Band.

869
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:12,482
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a karaoke game, but we're selling it for like five bucks.

870
01:08:13,242 --> 01:08:14,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot that was even a musician.

871
01:08:14,443 --> 01:08:21,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but it's got a USB microphone, and a lot of those USB microphones, regardless of what system they're on, will work with Rock Band 2.

872
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:24,227
[SPEAKER_03]: We used, at my birthday party...

873
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:28,930
[SPEAKER_03]: The old PlayStation 2 Karaoke Revolution mic worked flawlessly.

874
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:36,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed at Fry's, next to the Rock Band 2 games, they sell just regular USB mics in the same section.

875
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, if you got a microphone from Karaoke Revolution, pretty much anything.

876
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:43,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're all using those stupid Logitech mics.

877
01:08:44,102 --> 01:08:44,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give it a shot.

878
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably will work.

879
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:47,965
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for an extra mic.

880
01:08:48,765 --> 01:08:56,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so beyond all that stuff, they've also added in some new... They tweaked the hammer-ons and pull-offs.

881
01:08:57,031 --> 01:09:02,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently something that they had improved for the Beals Rock Band is now being added into Rock Band 2.

882
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:12,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Audition Mode, which will allow people on the Rock Band Network to be able to upload the songs that they've created from their PCs to test them out in the game.

883
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:15,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So before they upload them into Rock Band Network and stuff like that,

884
01:09:16,363 --> 01:09:17,364
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

885
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:57,848
[SPEAKER_03]: and also I guess in the sort menu you may now arrange the songs according to star rating that you've achieved in each of them and also unplayed songs will be grouped together accordingly.

886
01:09:58,949 --> 01:09:59,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

887
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:03,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Taiko no Tatoujin

888
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:24,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Tycho Drummaster Tycho Drummaster

889
01:10:51,991 --> 01:10:52,371
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

890
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

891
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:33,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Scratch, The Ultimate DJ.

892
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:48,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, haven't heard about that game in a while, but they've announced a few more tracks coming out available now, including, and of course this is all going to be R&B stuff, Push It, Salt-N-Pepa, Friends, Houdini.

893
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:51,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's the Glee version of Push It.

894
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:53,844
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

895
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:23,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Gifted, starring NASA, featuring Kanye West, Santo Gold, and Like Lee.

896
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:29,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let you finish, but Hip Hop Master was the best hip hop game in the US of all time.

897
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:39,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking Fly, by The Mers, Skanky Panky, Kid Koala, Iced Lightning, by RJD2,

898
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:45,290
[SPEAKER_03]: They Reminisce Over You by Pete Rock and Seal Smooth.

899
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:49,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And Life in a Cage by The Knucks.

900
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:50,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course that...

901
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:57,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Also is added to the previously announced artists and licensed tracks, which I'll read now since there's only four of them.

902
01:12:57,937 --> 01:13:00,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Piper, Run DMC, Feel Good Inc.

903
01:13:00,478 --> 01:13:04,459
[SPEAKER_03]: by The Gorillas, Hot In Here by Nelly, and Mastermind by Deltron 3030.

904
01:13:06,099 --> 01:13:11,901
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as this isn't my preferred genre of music, there are some very catchy, dancey party songs in here.

905
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:13,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I am curious about this game.

906
01:13:14,362 --> 01:13:20,404
[SPEAKER_02]: This is yet another one that got pushed back to 2010, though, after the whole lawsuit and mess and studio change and all that, right?

907
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:20,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

908
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:22,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a good thing anyways.

909
01:13:22,145 --> 01:13:24,287
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many damn music games coming out this fall.

910
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:26,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

911
01:13:27,309 --> 01:13:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well guys, we are getting towards the end of Part A tonight, but not before we cover the classic video game of the week.

912
01:13:36,437 --> 01:13:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

913
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:00,483
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

914
01:14:18,942 --> 01:14:22,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love Railroad Tycoon because it was made by Sid Meier.

915
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:25,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know he is a god amongst PC gaming.

916
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:27,369
[SPEAKER_02]: He made the Civilization series.

917
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:35,095
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a game I actually really like a lot on the PC that I almost picked for tonight, but I couldn't find a good YouTube of it anywhere called Covert Action.

918
01:14:35,496 --> 01:14:37,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was thinking about it, I was like, you know what?

919
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Railroad Tycoon, especially the deluxe version, I spent hours upon hours playing this as a kid.

920
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:43,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me tell you a little bit about Railroad Tycoon.

921
01:14:43,642 --> 01:14:43,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

922
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:45,395
[SPEAKER_02]: SID MEIER'S RAILROAD TYCOON

923
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:32,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You could even do England, Europe, whatever You basically manage the business, you manage where the trains are going to go You build industries and basically transport goods from one end to another It's kind of a strategical game But it was cool because you kind of built your own little empire And it was very kind of single player They didn't have a lot of multiplayer in it That didn't show up really until Civilization, kind of a little later on But it was a cool little strategy game that you could kind of play on your own

924
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,922
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

925
01:15:53,396 --> 01:16:22,462
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way the original Railroad Tycoon and one reason I bring this up is the classic game of the week it is actually free because when they went back and released a sequel to the game later on called Railroads they actually made the original Railroad Tycoon free and I'm not sure if you can still get it on the website but it was basically free out there on the internet for you to download so you can hear some ambient music of building the tracks between the different towns there it looks like right now they're playing on a South African map and they're kind of connecting Johannesburg with some other towns there um

926
01:16:23,422 --> 01:16:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Railroad Tycoon, of course, got a reskinning and a redone version called Railroad Tycoon Deluxe.

927
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:28,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That was released in 93.

928
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:37,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically upped the graphics from the, like, 16 color level they were at in the original to more VGA graphics, but unfortunately the game was very buggy.

929
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:43,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember it being super buggy, but they do say that the game ended up getting very buggy in certain parts of the ending.

930
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:44,838
[SPEAKER_02]: SIDMAYER SIDMAYER

931
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:11,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Railroad Tycoon 3 had a full 3D environment.

932
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:19,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You could build overpasses, tunnels, totally improved graphics, but honestly, none of the sequels really kind of, I think, reached the way the original did.

933
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Sid Meier did come back to do a sequel to the game in 2006.

934
01:17:22,901 --> 01:17:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sid Meier's Railroads.

935
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:27,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically different scenarios and trains that you could do.

936
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:30,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little less focused on industry.

937
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:37,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a more streamlined interface for doing the track laying, but it was more focused on the full 3D graphics and some real-time gameplay.

938
01:17:37,808 --> 01:18:04,793
[SPEAKER_02]: so that is my classic game of the week I know there's not a whole lot else to say about it but I think it's a game you just kind of have to check out it is very yes choo-choo it was fun to kind of build the different buildings and watch your station get bigger and bigger and watch the new trains because you get to pick the cars that were with it and how much they would transport it's very much a micromanaging game but it's a lot of fun and one of my favorite strategy games of all time Railroad Tycoon the one I spent the most time on was Railroad Tycoon Deluxe

939
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:08,839
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just call the whole Railroad Tycoon series my classic game of the week.

940
01:18:08,899 --> 01:18:10,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Railroad Tycoon, Loki?

941
01:18:11,584 --> 01:18:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

942
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

943
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play any of the Sid Meier games at all?

944
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:17,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

945
01:18:39,512 --> 01:18:43,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this little train that they drive around the complex that little kids get to ride it.

946
01:18:43,555 --> 01:18:44,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not on a track or anything.

947
01:18:44,716 --> 01:18:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of drives around and takes kids on.

948
01:18:46,698 --> 01:18:48,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was convinced that the train was trying to run over me.

949
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, Melody, we've got to run away from the train.

950
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:52,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming.

951
01:18:53,123 --> 01:18:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming.

952
01:18:53,703 --> 01:19:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was laughing her ass off because I was really, really drunk at this place called the Alcatraz Brewery, which really cracked me up because it was like –

953
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what it felt like because you know we're from Northern California we go to San Francisco a lot I'm sure it was kind of funny seeing like the big replica of the Golden Gate inside the building and just all this stuff all the little tie-ins with NorCal terms so it's cute so there you go anyhow sorry for my tangent that was your classic game of the week Railroad Tycoon

954
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:31,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, but we will be back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

955
01:19:31,584 --> 01:19:32,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not done yet.

956
01:19:32,764 --> 01:19:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more news coming up in Part B. Part B tonight, we're going to talk about some rapid-fire news, including another big game delayed until 2010, PlayStation Room we're going to talk about after the break, and World of Warcraft went down for a couple months.

957
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it didn't happen here, or places probably would have burned down.

958
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:55,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

959
01:20:01,773 --> 01:20:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, September the 27th of 2009 for the second half of our show.

960
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:14,387
[SPEAKER_02]: The tape's live every Sunday night on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

961
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a lot of great programming every night at All Games Radio.

962
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:20,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they even have some new shows and I think they're...

963
01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:21,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

964
01:20:49,395 --> 01:20:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

965
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:17,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that guy, Jeremy Soul, I don't know if it's Soul or Soleil, he does some awesome orchestral music.

966
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:21,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, just between that and Oblivion, I really enjoy his stuff.

967
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It really sounds like kind of listening to a movie.

968
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:26,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, I want to play Guild Wars sometimes just to hear the music.

969
01:21:26,655 --> 01:21:27,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty awesome.

970
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:32,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to give him props, because I think he did some really great work there.

971
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he did the music for Prey, too.

972
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the best parts of Prey, was the soundtrack.

973
01:21:36,799 --> 01:21:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people didn't play that game, but it was actually... All things considered, that was a shooting game made for people that really fucking suck at shooters, and so it was perfect.

974
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It just ended abruptly.

975
01:21:47,823 --> 01:21:49,203
[SPEAKER_02]: The story kind of just cut off.

976
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:56,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I think development was probably cut off of that game, because that game was going on Duke Nukem Forever time...

977
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:01,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VIII is out on the PlayStation Network in Japan

978
01:22:25,356 --> 01:22:28,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney, there was that rumor of the Epic Mickey game.

979
01:22:28,717 --> 01:22:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Disney is set to make an announcement in London on the 28th of October.

980
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:39,201
[SPEAKER_03]: People think it's going to be this announcement.

981
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:44,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, apparently there was also a teaser in Game Informer saying that this announcement is coming as well.

982
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:48,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So, could it be something that's on the cover of the next Game Informer?

983
01:22:49,212 --> 01:22:49,632
[SPEAKER_03]: God of War 3 Demo

984
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:06,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the demos.

985
01:23:06,634 --> 01:23:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweeten the pot a little bit for the people who already own God of War 1 and 2.

986
01:23:11,298 --> 01:23:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

987
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:15,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you definitely owe it to yourself to play these games if you haven't yet.

988
01:23:17,683 --> 01:23:18,884
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be worth checking out, I think.

989
01:23:19,985 --> 01:23:22,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, something for free.

990
01:23:22,928 --> 01:23:28,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, if you have LittleBigPlanet, you will be able to soon pick up Viking costumes for your Sackboy.

991
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:31,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And these will be coming soon.

992
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:37,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've actually got a website that you need to go to to go through this.

993
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:42,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Family Zone, which is, I guess, a cross promotion with Sony Pictures.

994
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:46,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be able to, I guess...

995
01:23:49,114 --> 01:23:51,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to their website, and they actually have a link here.

996
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:53,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's the PlayStation site.

997
01:23:54,198 --> 01:24:00,662
[SPEAKER_03]: US.PlayStation.com slash SonyWonderGames And then you just go there.

998
01:24:00,943 --> 01:24:06,006
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a button to redeem a code, and you can get the free Viking costumes.

999
01:24:06,827 --> 01:24:09,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something you can just go on PlayStation Network and download, unfortunately.

1000
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:10,169
[SPEAKER_02]: No, apparently not.

1001
01:24:10,209 --> 01:24:10,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's stupid.

1002
01:24:12,411 --> 01:24:12,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1003
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross-promotion, I guess.

1004
01:24:14,645 --> 01:24:20,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as Loki spoiled earlier in the show, there is a little bit of crossover going on between Ninja Gaiden and Dynasty Warriors.

1005
01:24:20,867 --> 01:24:25,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, of course, because of the Tecmo-Koei merger that happened not that long ago.

1006
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:31,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu Hayabusa is actually going to be an unlockable character in Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.

1007
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:33,670
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not where the love stops.

1008
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:40,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there's going to be unlockable Zhao Yun and Sung Shang Xiang costumes in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

1009
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm sure I completely butchered those names.

1010
01:24:42,353 --> 01:24:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal with it.

1011
01:24:43,273 --> 01:24:43,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1012
01:24:44,516 --> 01:24:47,774
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a lot of crossover happening there, I'm sure, to no one's surprise.

1013
01:24:49,443 --> 01:25:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Blur was a racing game I was very much looking forward to this year and I will just have to look forward to it a little longer it has been delayed to 2010 with a host of quite a few other games that have been delayed to 2010 which is now looking pretty full the delay happened because according to Activision CEO Mike Griffith they need to quote fully optimize the vision Bazaar set out to create for Blur including a distinctive and groundbreaking multiplayer mode that will appeal to a broad audience I take that to mean multiplayer was fucked and they needed to fix it

1014
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I also take that as we're not going to compete with ourselves and decide to push Blur back a little longer since they're the ones releasing Modern Warfare 2 and it's supposed to be coming out around the same time, within a week.

1015
01:25:30,768 --> 01:25:31,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

1016
01:25:31,988 --> 01:25:32,569
[SPEAKER_02]: If they've

1017
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it for that reason, then F them.

1018
01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:41,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they did it for the reason that they needed to go back and make multiplayer better, that's cool.

1019
01:25:41,312 --> 01:25:50,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I'm sure if it came out and the multiplayer was screwed up, bitching upon bitching on the blogs about how borked multiplayer is and we need to patch immediately, etc.

1020
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:53,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if it's truly to fix multiplayer, then fine.

1021
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:59,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never remembered the multiplayer in Project Gotham being too bad, so I can't imagine that that would be really an issue.

1022
01:25:59,419 --> 01:26:03,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But, hey, give them the extra time, whether it be for, you know...

1023
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's room for more than one

1024
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:30,395
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of games are kind of like, you know, there's going to be a lot of people buying Modern Warfare 2.

1025
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:32,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move our game a little away from it.

1026
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Smackdown vs. Raw 2010.

1027
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:37,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally a title comes out in the middle of November.

1028
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's coming out in the middle of October.

1029
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:41,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a little bit of a surprise.

1030
01:26:41,222 --> 01:26:44,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But not with Modern Warfare 2 being there.

1031
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:46,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Grynn Studios

1032
01:27:16,054 --> 01:27:16,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1033
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's cashing in on this?

1034
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:38,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami

1035
01:27:57,324 --> 01:27:58,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they the ones behind it?

1036
01:27:58,385 --> 01:27:58,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, Konami.

1037
01:27:59,427 --> 01:28:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

1038
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:00,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1039
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: God forbid we get a good music game from them, but seeing it, Twilight.

1040
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:06,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But we get sparkling vampires.

1041
01:28:07,297 --> 01:28:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they go where the money is.

1042
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a fan.

1043
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to be a hater.

1044
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:13,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some friends that are into Twilight, but I just don't get it.

1045
01:28:13,885 --> 01:28:16,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, honestly, it's coming out before the second movie, okay?

1046
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:20,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, I'm sure people that are playing this game probably read the books.

1047
01:28:21,271 --> 01:28:24,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathwishing in our chatroom is making his thoughts very strong.

1048
01:28:25,074 --> 01:28:28,076
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, kill the devs, kill them all, fucking skull fuck them.

1049
01:28:28,877 --> 01:28:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a little bit harsh.

1050
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, skull fucking?

1051
01:28:30,898 --> 01:28:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, that's pretty harsh.

1052
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying...

1053
01:28:34,474 --> 01:28:39,998
[SPEAKER_03]: How much trivia can there be for Twilight movies if there's one Twilight movie out already?

1054
01:28:40,378 --> 01:28:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, this game is slated right now I think for... I want to say I thought it was October.

1055
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:48,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably around the release of New Moon.

1056
01:28:48,444 --> 01:28:51,887
[SPEAKER_03]: But New Moon's not supposed to be coming out until after it, so either it's going to spoil the...

1057
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:56,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's really going to spoil the plot of the movie because there really is no plot to the movie.

1058
01:28:56,571 --> 01:28:57,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the books have been out.

1059
01:28:57,771 --> 01:28:59,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can go read the book, I'm sure.

1060
01:28:59,531 --> 01:28:59,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1061
01:28:59,911 --> 01:29:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crap.

1062
01:29:01,512 --> 01:29:01,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on.

1063
01:29:02,132 --> 01:29:04,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I've decided this story has taken up way too much time on our show.

1064
01:29:04,652 --> 01:29:05,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1065
01:29:05,453 --> 01:29:05,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1066
01:29:06,653 --> 01:29:08,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do want to read this witty comment from chat.

1067
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,394
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, We need a seen it OLR.

1068
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:11,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

1069
01:29:12,074 --> 01:29:12,574
[SPEAKER_02]: No video.

1070
01:29:12,654 --> 01:29:14,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could call it hear it OLR.

1071
01:29:15,094 --> 01:29:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anyone actually play that?

1072
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:16,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1073
01:29:17,275 --> 01:29:17,335
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1074
01:29:18,673 --> 01:29:22,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the listeners know the trivia of the show better than I do.

1075
01:29:22,255 --> 01:29:30,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this best of I've got to do next week that we're going to be taking some parts of the show and then kind of doing some new stuff with it as well.

1076
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,261
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where I'm going to find out where all the good bits are?

1077
01:29:33,861 --> 01:29:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Wikipedia.

1078
01:29:34,862 --> 01:29:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: The OLR Wikipedia references what episode number some of the funniest stuff was in.

1079
01:29:38,824 --> 01:29:46,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what episode the whattheyplay.com snap was in and some of these other things I'm going to kind of pull and put in there is all in there, which is nice.

1080
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get to some Twitter topics tonight.

1081
01:29:50,172 --> 01:29:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to get the theme music for Twitter topics.

1082
01:29:53,576 --> 01:29:55,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so broken tonight.

1083
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:57,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't multitask.

1084
01:29:57,581 --> 01:29:59,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie and I here is ruining everything.

1085
01:30:01,506 --> 01:30:01,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1086
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting it.

1087
01:30:04,089 --> 01:30:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?

1088
01:30:06,084 --> 01:30:06,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, forget it.

1089
01:30:07,205 --> 01:30:08,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do theme music tonight.

1090
01:30:08,407 --> 01:30:11,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get to the Twitter topics because I don't want a dead air here.

1091
01:30:12,792 --> 01:30:13,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1092
01:30:13,353 --> 01:30:14,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the Twitter topics.

1093
01:30:16,256 --> 01:30:17,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, we got quite a few tonight.

1094
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:23,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray Ayanami says, here's a story that people might actually care about.

1095
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:27,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushi Misama Futari for 360 is going to be region-free.

1096
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:29,372
[SPEAKER_02]: A region-free 360 game.

1097
01:30:30,153 --> 01:30:31,953
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it a bullet hell shooter.

1098
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about a shooting Xbox 360 game.

1099
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: No screenshots from the gamers.

1100
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,175
[SPEAKER_02]: This one up here in the upper right-hand corner.

1101
01:30:39,515 --> 01:30:40,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like one there.

1102
01:30:41,116 --> 01:30:46,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be region-free, so this game comes out in Japan, but you would actually be able to import it here in America and play it.

1103
01:30:46,277 --> 01:30:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1104
01:30:46,697 --> 01:30:52,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool because a lot of the 360 games that come out over there are not region-free, especially in Japan, man.

1105
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, fuck you guys, you ain't gonna import this shit.

1106
01:30:55,405 --> 01:30:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And Raisin Chat right now says it is an existing arcade game.

1107
01:30:58,007 --> 01:31:01,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, we saw a clip of this on an earlier show, because I'm looking at the screenshot now.

1108
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does look familiar.

1109
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:08,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing that sucks, too, because my arcade cabinet, I could play vertical games, but it's such a fucking pain in the ass to do it.

1110
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:12,379
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to rotate the monitor and all that shit, and I just don't want to do that.

1111
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:19,418
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw305 on Twitter wants us to mention the Florida Fugitive was apprehended after attempting to steal DS games.

1112
01:31:19,538 --> 01:31:26,881
[SPEAKER_02]: He links us to an article on Joystick where apparently this guy was out there trying to steal DS games.

1113
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:29,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a loss prevention specialist.

1114
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:58,843
[SPEAKER_02]: got to stop this shoplifter the fugitive's name was Daniel Larson he was already wanted for violating probation and apparently he shoplifted $120 worth of Nintendo DS titles from the local Walmart but a loss prevention officer actually caught him and stopped it joystick the blog goes on to joke don't tell them about my insatiable addiction for Imagine Babies games I know you could say I planned on pawning them to buy heroin please come on then man this would ruin me

1115
01:31:59,838 --> 01:32:00,318
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:26,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be able to read all the tweets tonight, but let me get to a few others here.

1117
01:32:26,685 --> 01:32:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan Belknap on Twitter wants to know, what game coming out this fall are you looking forward to buying?

1118
01:32:32,912 --> 01:32:35,456
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it would be Dragon Age and Press Your Luck.

1119
01:32:36,036 --> 01:32:36,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Games this fall.

1120
01:32:36,897 --> 01:32:39,000
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Hero and Borderlands.

1121
01:32:40,302 --> 01:32:41,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and of course...

1122
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:46,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because it's more of a download title, but Grand Theft Auto, The Ballad of Gay Tony.

1123
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:59,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, most everything I was looking forward to got pushed back to 2010, Blur, White Knight Chronicles, but one game that's still coming out that I am looking forward to a little bit, there was one, I just had it, and now I just get my memory.

1124
01:33:00,444 --> 01:33:01,525
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.?

1125
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang it, no, I'm not really interested in that one.

1126
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:04,166
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of a game was it?

1127
01:33:04,426 --> 01:33:05,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1128
01:33:06,188 --> 01:33:06,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego Rock Band?

1129
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,862
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Hero DJ Hero DJ Hero

1130
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:23,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft.com

1131
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:42,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I heard about this.

1132
01:33:42,596 --> 01:33:43,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is in our show role either.

1133
01:33:43,997 --> 01:33:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: This just came up today.

1134
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:53,823
[SPEAKER_02]: He links us to an article on Kotaku that talks about apparently there's a crash screen in Need for Speed Shift that when you go into the PlayStation Store, it crashes.

1135
01:33:53,903 --> 01:33:54,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the funny thing.

1136
01:33:54,744 --> 01:33:55,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the 360.

1137
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:59,145
[SPEAKER_02]: with the PlayStation Store logo showing up and everything.

1138
01:33:59,526 --> 01:34:04,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell happened or what you do to get this, but apparently this is a really bad bug.

1139
01:34:04,486 --> 01:34:04,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1140
01:34:05,147 --> 01:34:08,847
[SPEAKER_02]: When navigating menus today, when connected to Xbox Live, the game suddenly crashed again.

1141
01:34:09,147 --> 01:34:12,608
[SPEAKER_02]: When my rage subsided and I got a better look at the screen, I was pretty shocked at what I saw.

1142
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:17,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Was my Xbox 360 version of Need for Speed Shift really trying to access the PlayStation Store?

1143
01:34:18,269 --> 01:34:19,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft's not going to be happy about this at all.

1144
01:34:20,349 --> 01:34:24,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently there is a bug in the game where it tries to access the PlayStation Store.

1145
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:24,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops!

1146
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,950
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1147
01:34:51,923 --> 01:34:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: 360 can be fixed PlayStation Room

1148
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:16,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting enough, the logo for PlayStation Room is R-Infinity-M.

1149
01:35:17,533 --> 01:35:28,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember way back in the day when there was a rumor, according to a trademark, that the PlayStation DualShock 3 or 6-axis was going to be, well...

1150
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:32,471
[SPEAKER_03]: We called the poos because it was P-Infinity-S.

1151
01:35:32,872 --> 01:35:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I did not remember this until you said like that.

1152
01:35:36,894 --> 01:35:38,495
[SPEAKER_02]: You joked that it was poos.

1153
01:35:38,696 --> 01:35:40,557
[SPEAKER_02]: We did joke about this on the show a while ago.

1154
01:35:40,977 --> 01:35:43,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking maybe that wasn't for the controller.

1155
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was like PlayStation Infinity or some crap like that and it was actually this.

1156
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,201
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1157
01:36:16,294 --> 01:36:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like home with a big anime flair to it and really scaled down.

1158
01:36:26,859 --> 01:36:28,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat, I guess.

1159
01:36:29,926 --> 01:36:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they really said what the hell you're going to be able to do with it, or are we only seeing these screenshots of these kind of chibi characters?

1160
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:41,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, it should be said, even though you're saying it's kind of like Home, it doesn't really, I mean, it looks like a very, very, very much spin-off.

1161
01:36:41,855 --> 01:36:44,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your same characters, it's not that same 3D environment.

1162
01:36:45,038 --> 01:36:52,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Home, like, you know, the Disney's, was it, um... Looks like some of the chat rooms I would see on Prodigy back in the day.

1163
01:36:52,684 --> 01:36:57,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Channel D stuff, or, I forget what they call it, on, um...

1164
01:36:58,248 --> 01:37:01,789
[SPEAKER_03]: D-Gamer, that's what it was, on the Disney's DS titles.

1165
01:37:02,009 --> 01:37:03,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to Xbox Live.

1166
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, but it's a similar type of service.

1167
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:10,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, wasn't that like three years ago that that joke happened?

1168
01:37:11,272 --> 01:37:13,493
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, wait, I've been listening to this train wreck for three years now?

1169
01:37:13,853 --> 01:37:16,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe it was, I don't think it was quite three years ago.

1170
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:17,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before the PlayStation 3 came out.

1171
01:37:18,075 --> 01:37:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

1172
01:37:19,115 --> 01:37:21,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, remember, we were, like, were they going to call the controller?

1173
01:37:23,014 --> 01:37:23,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The Poohs The Poohs

1174
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:43,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But what has PlayStation Home really done for PlayStation?

1175
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:48,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I got a plug that we do have a club on PlayStation Home, and there's got to be a good handful of people in it now.

1176
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting slow requests for invites.

1177
01:37:51,122 --> 01:37:51,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1178
01:37:52,143 --> 01:37:52,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

1179
01:37:53,444 --> 01:37:54,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine this would be too popular.

1180
01:37:54,946 --> 01:37:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yay, you can be able to run around in Avatar and stuff, but...

1181
01:37:59,818 --> 01:38:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I did check out this week.

1182
01:38:00,838 --> 01:38:01,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I did sign into home.

1183
01:38:01,819 --> 01:38:02,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1184
01:38:02,259 --> 01:38:04,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Home's one of those things I'll just kind of poke around in if I'm really bored.

1185
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:09,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I did check out the new SingStar space in home and it's a little ridiculous.

1186
01:38:10,942 --> 01:38:12,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphically, it looks pretty cool.

1187
01:38:12,503 --> 01:38:15,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a nightclub and it's laid out like a nightclub.

1188
01:38:15,664 --> 01:38:18,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphically, it's kind of cool, but you log in there, there's really not a lot to do.

1189
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You do all the different dances on the dance floor and you get three shirts.

1190
01:38:22,847 --> 01:38:23,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1191
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:28,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I just quickly go through the character and do all ten dances or whatever.

1192
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:30,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get shirts to pimp out their products.

1193
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:30,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1194
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:31,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1195
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:33,131
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1196
01:38:34,631 --> 01:38:37,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say though, it was nice to look at for a few minutes.

1197
01:38:37,072 --> 01:38:39,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh hey, they put a little work into this.

1198
01:38:39,073 --> 01:38:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually kind of looks like a nightclub and I like how when you dance, the little spotlight on the floor is different colors and it's all high def.

1199
01:38:44,535 --> 01:38:45,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks cool.

1200
01:38:45,075 --> 01:38:46,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, done now.

1201
01:38:48,069 --> 01:38:52,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure exactly what I gained out of this, except I guess maybe knowledge of the SingStar product.

1202
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:53,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1203
01:38:53,912 --> 01:39:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a little video wall that'll circle through different music videos that are in the game, and you can actually pick which video you want to come up next on the wall.

1204
01:39:01,756 --> 01:39:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the catch.

1205
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 30-second clip of videos.

1206
01:39:04,678 --> 01:39:08,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even like the full, like, you can't touch this, or baby one more time.

1207
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:11,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Just these 30 seconds of it, not the whole clip.

1208
01:39:13,868 --> 01:39:14,229
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1209
01:39:14,269 --> 01:39:17,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Dizzle in chat reminds us, Home gave us hamsters versus humans dance-offs.

1210
01:39:17,996 --> 01:39:18,597
[SPEAKER_02]: How could I forget?

1211
01:39:18,878 --> 01:39:21,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's a whole nightclub you can do it in, in the SingStar space.

1212
01:39:22,185 --> 01:39:23,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how could I forget?

1213
01:39:25,816 --> 01:39:27,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1214
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: The transfer is all done now.

1215
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:56,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese MMO players can now get back on to World of Warcraft, which might not be the biggest game in China, but I guess it does definitely have their following over there.

1216
01:39:57,218 --> 01:40:02,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that took a big chunk out of their economy since all the gold farming and everything.

1217
01:40:02,782 --> 01:40:06,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, NetEase, by the way... Well, no, they'd log into the American servers to do that.

1218
01:40:06,725 --> 01:40:08,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not mixed like Final Fantasy XI is.

1219
01:40:08,886 --> 01:40:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: China has their own servers.

1220
01:40:10,528 --> 01:40:12,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, they don't have Undead.

1221
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:19,134
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Forsaken, which is just the unskinned Undead with more skin or whatever.

1222
01:40:19,694 --> 01:40:21,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow, here's the other thing I want to point out.

1223
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the servers are... To give you an idea how many people are playing, the servers are expensive to maintain.

1224
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,121
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to pay a million...

1225
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:37,359
[SPEAKER_02]: of their Chinese dollars a day, which boils down to about $146,000 a day to keep the servers running.

1226
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:42,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, China's a pretty big country, and the game obviously is doing very well there.

1227
01:40:42,841 --> 01:40:46,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was thinking, oh my god, three and a half months this game was down.

1228
01:40:46,782 --> 01:40:54,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine, what would happen if World of Warcraft, and I opened this question up to chat as well, what would happen if World of Warcraft shut down?

1229
01:40:54,345 --> 01:40:54,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

1230
01:40:55,265 --> 01:41:00,007
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, out of the blue, World of Warcraft shuts down for three months in America.

1231
01:41:00,148 --> 01:41:01,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It would rain cats and dogs.

1232
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:07,151
[SPEAKER_02]: With no rhyme or reason, just Blizzard, the server facility just goes kaput.

1233
01:41:07,471 --> 01:41:08,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happens.

1234
01:41:09,012 --> 01:41:10,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gets charged for it or anything.

1235
01:41:10,493 --> 01:41:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing malicious happens, but just World of Warcraft gets revoked for all the 11 million players or whatever for three and a half months.

1236
01:41:16,396 --> 01:41:17,356
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen?

1237
01:41:17,396 --> 01:41:19,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The internet would be in a shitstorm.

1238
01:41:19,177 --> 01:41:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be just like, fucking bitch!

1239
01:41:21,798 --> 01:41:24,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Just complaining like you would not believe.

1240
01:41:26,616 --> 01:41:28,638
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, divorce rates go down.

1241
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, I already said it, massive tantrums.

1242
01:41:32,901 --> 01:41:34,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, there will be many a blog.

1243
01:41:34,462 --> 01:41:35,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Many an angry blog.

1244
01:41:37,164 --> 01:41:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: People threatening to quit and never return.

1245
01:41:39,646 --> 01:41:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Aeon.

1246
01:41:41,227 --> 01:41:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Aeon, possibly.

1247
01:41:44,029 --> 01:41:48,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray Ayanami says, whatever, I'm going to keep on playing not MMOs.

1248
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:53,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Rama says, if World of Warcraft shuts down for three months, people would return to real life and shit would get done.

1249
01:41:54,977 --> 01:41:56,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Dizzle says, Mom, bathroom.

1250
01:41:57,882 --> 01:42:01,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathwishing says, remember that episode of Robot Chicken where a virus deletes all the prawn?

1251
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine that?

1252
01:42:03,412 --> 01:42:05,736
[SPEAKER_02]: A computer virus that just targets World of Warcraft?

1253
01:42:06,477 --> 01:42:07,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

1254
01:42:07,748 --> 01:42:15,294
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was ever a virus out there, conceivable, to actually delete all the porn on the internet at one time, who would do that?

1255
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just mean.

1256
01:42:18,217 --> 01:42:21,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Second off, you know how fast porn gets on the internet?

1257
01:42:21,499 --> 01:42:22,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't matter.

1258
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: The porn would be back up to the levels it is now in like a day.

1259
01:42:27,824 --> 01:42:29,346
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be like, porn back!

1260
01:42:29,366 --> 01:42:32,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, was it gone?

1261
01:42:32,648 --> 01:42:33,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't even realize it.

1262
01:42:33,569 --> 01:42:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all new porn, sweet.

1263
01:42:37,204 --> 01:42:44,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there would be... The sad thing is, I think for a lot of people... They would cover this on...

1264
01:42:44,884 --> 01:42:45,425
[SPEAKER_02]: CNN.

1265
01:42:45,605 --> 01:42:47,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be in the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.

1266
01:42:48,387 --> 01:42:49,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It really would.

1267
01:42:49,728 --> 01:42:51,690
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft went down today.

1268
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:54,673
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Twitter going down for three months?

1269
01:42:54,853 --> 01:42:55,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Facebook going down for three months?

1270
01:42:55,994 --> 01:42:56,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Twitter.

1271
01:42:56,454 --> 01:42:59,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so over Twitter.

1272
01:42:59,897 --> 01:43:01,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Friendster?

1273
01:43:01,539 --> 01:43:04,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Friendster was what we had before MySpace, before Facebook.

1274
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:05,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's still popular in Asia.

1275
01:43:06,903 --> 01:43:08,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Friendster is what we used to have.

1276
01:43:09,306 --> 01:43:11,728
[SPEAKER_02]: When that went down, people went somewhere else.

1277
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:17,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But Friendster was not quite as integrated into culture as I think Facebook has become.

1278
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:20,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people's mothers didn't have a Friendster account.

1279
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, college kids had it.

1280
01:43:23,432 --> 01:43:24,872
[SPEAKER_02]: People's mothers have Facebooks.

1281
01:43:24,912 --> 01:43:28,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what would happen if Facebook went down for three months?

1282
01:43:29,473 --> 01:43:31,073
[SPEAKER_03]: People would go back to MySpace, maybe.

1283
01:43:31,814 --> 01:43:32,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people would.

1284
01:43:33,654 --> 01:43:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, BaconBits says, if WoW was shut down for three months, the internet speeds would go faster.

1285
01:43:39,727 --> 01:43:39,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1286
01:43:40,307 --> 01:43:40,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.

1287
01:43:41,127 --> 01:43:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathwishing says kids would run out in the streets going, God damn it, my raid was halfway done.

1288
01:43:44,909 --> 01:43:46,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my epics.

1289
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:52,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people seem to speculate people would just go somewhere else.

1290
01:43:53,071 --> 01:43:59,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, as much of, you know, fandom as World of Warcraft gets, people are fickle.

1291
01:43:59,793 --> 01:44:02,174
[SPEAKER_03]: If it goes away for a while, they'll leave.

1292
01:44:02,514 --> 01:44:03,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when it comes back, they'll come right back.

1293
01:44:04,275 --> 01:44:05,155
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's just...

1294
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:07,427
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to be doing something.

1295
01:44:07,527 --> 01:44:11,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're going to be MMO players, they're going to go play another MMO or play something else.

1296
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,732
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not just going to go outside and go, Oh my God, there's a world out here.

1297
01:44:15,032 --> 01:44:16,173
[SPEAKER_03]: What have I done with my life?

1298
01:44:17,959 --> 01:44:18,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, World Warcraft's back!

1299
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:19,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit!

1300
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so many businesses out there.

1301
01:44:42,181 --> 01:44:46,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about the online banking that goes on and just all of the online things.

1302
01:44:46,982 --> 01:44:48,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So many companies that do their business online.

1303
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:52,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the internet going down completely would be pretty chaotic.

1304
01:44:53,844 --> 01:44:55,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a mess.

1305
01:44:55,704 --> 01:45:00,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a lot of stuff also connected with the internet like banking, ATMs.

1306
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:01,766
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty big.

1307
01:45:02,086 --> 01:45:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1308
01:45:03,228 --> 01:45:06,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I might all be secure, but imagine if it was suddenly unaccessible.

1309
01:45:06,476 --> 01:45:08,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that's why we still have tellers working at banks.

1310
01:45:08,941 --> 01:45:11,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had my bank's infrastructure go down for a day.

1311
01:45:11,828 --> 01:45:12,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pain in the ass.

1312
01:45:15,049 --> 01:45:17,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Marissa Congusto in the chat says, I couldn't do my job without the internet.

1313
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people in that situation.

1314
01:45:19,852 --> 01:45:21,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for a big call center.

1315
01:45:21,753 --> 01:45:22,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've mentioned that before.

1316
01:45:22,613 --> 01:45:23,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a trainer for a big call center.

1317
01:45:23,694 --> 01:45:27,976
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have reps in other offices that take phone calls from their homes.

1318
01:45:28,076 --> 01:45:29,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a work at home program.

1319
01:45:30,318 --> 01:45:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe they use the internet to do all that.

1320
01:45:32,779 --> 01:45:35,320
[SPEAKER_02]: When the internet goes down, those reps can't work.

1321
01:45:35,561 --> 01:45:38,862
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that really rely on the internet to do their jobs.

1322
01:45:39,022 --> 01:45:39,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy.

1323
01:45:41,573 --> 01:45:43,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it'll be a mess, that's for sure.

1324
01:45:43,855 --> 01:45:45,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a day without internet, believe it or not.

1325
01:45:46,336 --> 01:45:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you kids are old enough to remember, but there was a day without internet.

1326
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in my day, we had dial-up and BBSs.

1327
01:45:53,441 --> 01:45:54,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the day.

1328
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:55,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Trade Wars 2002 for life.

1329
01:45:55,983 --> 01:45:57,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember BBSs.

1330
01:45:58,085 --> 01:45:59,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of the Red Dragon, bitches.

1331
01:46:00,026 --> 01:46:01,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that long ago, I don't think.

1332
01:46:02,748 --> 01:46:03,829
[SPEAKER_03]: The pit for the win.

1333
01:46:05,131 --> 01:46:06,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

1334
01:46:06,292 --> 01:46:06,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1335
01:46:07,432 --> 01:46:13,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We downloaded porn on 28 modems off of BBSs, because that's the way it was.

1336
01:46:13,435 --> 01:46:21,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when porn would be separated into VGA and Super VGA.

1337
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they call it XGA back then, I think?

1338
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, forget it.

1339
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1340
01:46:25,601 --> 01:46:27,742
[SPEAKER_03]: EGA.

1341
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:30,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, hooray for CGA porn.

1342
01:46:31,325 --> 01:46:34,126
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like those old strip poker games on the Apple IIe.

1343
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:41,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially working with arcade monitors and stuff like that, yeah, arcade monitors, most of them out there, CGA is what they consider them because it's ultra-low resolution.

1344
01:46:42,488 --> 01:46:47,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And VGA monitors, 640x480, and that's really good for arcade stuff.

1345
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I digress.

1346
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:54,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a 300 baud modem on my Commodore 64 that plugged into the cartridge port in the back.

1347
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:55,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It was epic.

1348
01:46:56,172 --> 01:46:56,432
Epic.

1349
01:46:56,712 --> 01:46:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the slowest modem I had was a 2400, I think.

1350
01:47:00,854 --> 01:47:06,360
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, switching that to like 56k, oh my god, we're blazing speeds!

1351
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:12,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, going onto BBSs on a 300 baud modem, it was like watching print be typed on the screen.

1352
01:47:13,347 --> 01:47:14,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was just insane.

1353
01:47:15,349 --> 01:47:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: But dude, I...

1354
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:18,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to reminisce for a bit here, I'm sorry.

1355
01:47:19,492 --> 01:47:21,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But there used to be a BBS here in Sacramento.

1356
01:47:21,834 --> 01:47:28,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was called like the Open Forum or Open Mind or something like that, which was this – all it was was really a bunch of forums.

1357
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:34,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was back when like 2400 – I think 14.4 was like the speed everybody had at that point.

1358
01:47:34,322 --> 01:47:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 14.4K.

1359
01:47:35,683 --> 01:47:37,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And really all it was was just message forums.

1360
01:47:38,184 --> 01:47:40,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like a cool place to just kind of meet people.

1361
01:47:40,846 --> 01:47:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually – some of the greatest discussions I ever read online were on that site.

1362
01:47:44,909 --> 01:47:46,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all local people too.

1363
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:47,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1364
01:47:47,331 --> 01:47:48,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Some days I miss the days of BBS.

1365
01:47:48,932 --> 01:47:49,253
[SPEAKER_03]: CCN.

1366
01:47:49,293 --> 01:47:50,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that magazine?

1367
01:47:50,093 --> 01:47:51,074
[SPEAKER_03]: California Computer News?

1368
01:47:51,134 --> 01:47:51,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I do!

1369
01:47:51,955 --> 01:47:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they still around?

1370
01:47:52,976 --> 01:47:56,620
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to have, I don't know, but they used to have... They have the BBS listings in the back.

1371
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:57,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1372
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:58,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember that.

1373
01:47:58,442 --> 01:48:05,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one BBS that was on there that you could sign into that BBS and actually get internet access for like an hour a day or something like that.

1374
01:48:05,809 --> 01:48:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1375
01:48:06,209 --> 01:48:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fucking awesome.

1376
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:07,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1377
01:48:08,531 --> 01:48:11,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I got banned from a BBS once because I pissed off the sysop.

1378
01:48:12,315 --> 01:48:12,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

1379
01:48:12,876 --> 01:48:14,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I got tied up in some drama.

1380
01:48:14,517 --> 01:48:15,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.

1381
01:48:15,318 --> 01:48:17,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, now I'm looking back on it going, this is all retarded.

1382
01:48:18,201 --> 01:48:19,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I was a dumb kid.

1383
01:48:19,982 --> 01:48:20,383
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

1384
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:22,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1385
01:48:23,361 --> 01:48:23,741
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1386
01:48:23,981 --> 01:48:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathwishing says, LOL, dial-up porn.

1387
01:48:26,523 --> 01:48:28,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like, okay, gonna eat dinner, come back.

1388
01:48:28,964 --> 01:48:30,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, her tits loaded up yet?

1389
01:48:30,986 --> 01:48:37,010
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, it was sad because, you know, back in the day, it used to take an hour to download a make, okay?

1390
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It did.

1391
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:40,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo.

1392
01:48:41,913 --> 01:48:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1393
01:49:03,482 --> 01:49:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: and you better hope that's a good picture because you don't know what it looks like because it's just a text file.

1394
01:49:07,847 --> 01:49:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just like, big boobs, sweet.

1395
01:49:15,196 --> 01:49:16,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Womanhorse.gif?

1396
01:49:16,838 --> 01:49:17,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what could this be?

1397
01:49:17,779 --> 01:49:18,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

1398
01:49:22,827 --> 01:49:24,007
[SPEAKER_02]: The stories I will tell my children

1399
01:49:49,494 --> 01:49:57,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Summer of Arcade, you know, Microsoft's kind of big push for some good Xbox Live Arcade games coming out, of course, in the summer.

1400
01:49:58,337 --> 01:50:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a 200% growth over last year's sales, and this is mostly in part to, actually, a good selection of games coming out, including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, you know, even Battlefield 1943.

1401
01:50:16,104 --> 01:50:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: lots of good stuff you know and even you know Shadow Complex their kind of Metroidvania game Trials HD and

1402
01:50:26,055 --> 01:50:26,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1403
01:50:53,064 --> 01:50:54,266
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1404
01:51:10,512 --> 01:51:21,359
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a story about IGN and an old website that we love here at Orange Lounge Radio, whattheyplay.com.

1405
01:51:21,379 --> 01:51:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been a longtime fan of Orange Lounge Radio, you'll know why this is funny.

1406
01:51:24,982 --> 01:51:27,543
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, listen to the best of next week because that clip's going to come back.

1407
01:51:27,884 --> 01:51:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But IGN, of course, the big, huge website that's kind of like game...

1408
01:51:33,087 --> 01:51:35,208
[SPEAKER_02]: All those, you know, one up or whatever.

1409
01:51:35,668 --> 01:51:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually purchased WhatTheyPlay.com.

1410
01:51:38,529 --> 01:51:47,213
[SPEAKER_02]: WhatTheyPlay.com is a site that is basically, you know, it's kind of catered towards families and kind of the concerned parent about what kids are into in video gaming.

1411
01:51:47,553 --> 01:51:51,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why IGN bought this, but that's what they wanted.

1412
01:51:51,294 --> 01:51:59,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there was a pretty big audience there and maybe IGN kind of feels that it's a new audience that can, that ad buyers will be interested in buying.

1413
01:51:59,698 --> 01:52:01,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1414
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:02,579
[SPEAKER_02]: They buy a lot of different websites.

1415
01:52:12,148 --> 01:52:13,989
[SPEAKER_02]: IGN has bought it to conduct all the polls they want on that audience.

1416
01:52:38,211 --> 01:52:39,212
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened earlier this week.

1417
01:52:40,152 --> 01:52:52,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember us reporting on a game announced at E3, Joyride, which is basically a game that's kind of debuting the free-to-play model on the Xbox Live Service.

1418
01:52:53,021 --> 01:52:57,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Joyride is going to be kind of an avatar-infused kart racing game.

1419
01:52:57,104 --> 01:53:01,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they're going to have a little bit of an MMO twist to it as well.

1420
01:53:01,667 --> 01:53:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing some stuff, too.

1421
01:53:02,787 --> 01:53:07,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember where you can actually... I guess it would be a little bit similar to Noby Noby Boy.

1422
01:53:08,972 --> 01:53:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: and Battlefield 1943 where if you play the game enough that you'll actually as a whole unlock new levels which is kind of cool and then of course if you want to customize your carts and what not you have to pay for that because that's what free to play means you have to pay for your premiums

1423
01:53:26,669 --> 01:53:40,679
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will be a free download coming this holiday and apparently the content to buy will be available around that time as well also including avatar costumes and new tracks and cars

1424
01:53:43,624 --> 01:53:46,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you think about this whole new model?

1425
01:53:46,105 --> 01:53:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it kind of the future of Xbox Live Arcade, or what?

1426
01:53:49,486 --> 01:53:55,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it allows you to try out the game, and if you don't want to buy all this extra content, you don't have to, which is kind of cool.

1427
01:53:56,429 --> 01:54:06,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a lot better than, say, buying a game, or trying a demo that maybe doesn't really give you a good idea of the game, and wasting your money on a game that you end up not liking.

1428
01:54:08,153 --> 01:54:08,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1429
01:54:09,033 --> 01:54:10,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And hell, it can't be any worse...

1430
01:54:16,243 --> 01:54:17,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose that's true.

1431
01:54:19,046 --> 01:54:23,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, as long as it's better than Yaris, I think it'll be okay.

1432
01:54:38,604 --> 01:54:40,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here right now.

1433
01:54:40,765 --> 01:54:43,166
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll be back a little later, hopefully, before we finish up.

1434
01:54:44,507 --> 01:54:53,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to open up the mailbag right now, but I was a slacker and didn't go into it before we started this segment because I was getting text messages on my phone.

1435
01:54:54,912 --> 01:54:55,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I was answering those.

1436
01:54:58,153 --> 01:54:59,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of emails tonight.

1437
01:54:59,334 --> 01:55:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm going to be able to get through all of these, but I'll try and get through as many of them as I can.

1438
01:55:03,736 --> 01:55:05,536
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through tonight, I'm sorry.

1439
01:55:05,616 --> 01:55:06,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again next time.

1440
01:55:07,912 --> 01:55:09,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to an email from Shook.

1441
01:55:10,673 --> 01:55:11,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Starts us off tonight.

1442
01:55:11,794 --> 01:55:15,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, to kick off this email I'd like to say that I'm at peace with my dad.

1443
01:55:15,215 --> 01:55:18,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, this is the emailer that was having problems with his dad, remember that?

1444
01:55:18,456 --> 01:55:20,817
[SPEAKER_02]: The dad didn't want him playing Final Fantasy X, remember that?

1445
01:55:21,417 --> 01:55:24,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to him about the Final Fantasy X thing and he seemed willing when he listened to me.

1446
01:55:25,479 --> 01:55:27,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I got him to try the game and he loves it!

1447
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So no more of that.

1448
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So a round of applause for the douchebag father.

1449
01:55:31,121 --> 01:55:32,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, yay!

1450
01:55:32,882 --> 01:55:33,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The rational thing.

1451
01:55:33,922 --> 01:55:35,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You've unduced yourself.

1452
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:36,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

1453
01:55:36,083 --> 01:55:36,943
[SPEAKER_02]: You did the right thing.

1454
01:55:37,083 --> 01:55:38,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No more hazing for you.

1455
01:55:38,543 --> 01:55:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1456
01:55:39,284 --> 01:55:39,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So no more of that.

1457
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:40,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1458
01:55:41,204 --> 01:55:42,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to my main story.

1459
01:55:42,325 --> 01:55:44,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day I had gym class and we played football.

1460
01:55:45,066 --> 01:55:49,527
[SPEAKER_02]: When a kid in my class saw the football laying there, he ran over and teabagged the ball a couple of times.

1461
01:55:51,024 --> 01:55:51,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that sink in.

1462
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:58,648
[SPEAKER_02]: My gym coach grabs the kid by his neck, says, get the hell inside, and pushes the kid towards the front door.

1463
01:55:59,149 --> 01:56:02,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes to show how far teabagging has gone in our culture.

1464
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The kid was suspended for lewd sexual behavior, according to the superintendent.

1465
01:56:06,513 --> 01:56:07,693
[SPEAKER_02]: My opinion, what the hell?

1466
01:56:07,753 --> 01:56:09,554
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the shit that gives gaming a bad name.

1467
01:56:09,715 --> 01:56:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I close with that.

1468
01:56:10,995 --> 01:56:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S., pardon my French, forever and always, not like anyone censors themselves anyway, yours truly, Shook.

1469
01:56:18,447 --> 01:56:19,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it has anything to do with gaming.

1470
01:56:19,727 --> 01:56:19,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1471
01:56:46,427 --> 01:56:51,562
[SPEAKER_02]: One day I want to hear Rob go, we got a lot of emails tonight, sorry guys, I'm only going to get through as many as I feel like, so suck it.

1472
01:56:52,574 --> 01:56:53,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess you could say that too.

1473
01:56:55,695 --> 01:56:58,415
[SPEAKER_02]: This next email comes to us from AZHP.

1474
01:56:59,316 --> 01:57:00,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew.

1475
01:57:00,276 --> 01:57:05,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to your last available podcast the other day and remember Rob saying something about a homosexual tambourine game.

1476
01:57:05,777 --> 01:57:13,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the game you're thinking of is Minimoni Shakato Tambourine, which I actually played when I went to Japan as well.

1477
01:57:13,539 --> 01:57:16,500
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with Minimoni, they're a branch of Morning Musume.

1478
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:22,544
[SPEAKER_02]: An extremely popular J-pop girl group with, get this, 23 girls, at least the last time I checked.

1479
01:57:23,085 --> 01:57:33,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimoni is a subset of them, four girls who are 15 to 16 and look 11 to 12 and sing things about telephones, rock, paper, scissors, counting to 20 in the bathtub, and in general being obnoxiously cute.

1480
01:57:36,975 --> 01:57:43,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, you are most definitely correct in saying that the game you saw slept with tambourine games of the same gender.

1481
01:57:44,628 --> 01:57:49,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it sounds like that game sounds like it could go to jail for the things it's doing.

1482
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1483
01:57:50,652 --> 01:57:51,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently got a new job.

1484
01:57:51,733 --> 01:57:55,315
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I just want to say before I get into the P.S., I actually don't think it was the same game.

1485
01:57:55,435 --> 01:57:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I saw, and this is how you could tell, it was Samba de Amigo.

1486
01:57:58,818 --> 01:58:04,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the exact same game as Samba de Amigo, basically, except with a different character, not the little Samba dude, and with a tambourine.

1487
01:58:04,922 --> 01:58:07,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the game you're talking about, then it's the same game.

1488
01:58:07,804 --> 01:58:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't remember a Morning Musume or even a Japanese pop 23 girl group being involved at all.

1489
01:58:14,849 --> 01:58:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyhow.

1490
01:58:18,956 --> 01:58:20,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read the PS here real quick.

1491
01:58:20,297 --> 01:58:23,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently got a new job and have been listening to your podcast while at work.

1492
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:29,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to stop, though, because when you guys make terrible and awesome, extremely inappropriate jokes, I can't help but burst out laughing.

1493
01:58:29,763 --> 01:58:32,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Not conductive to keeping a low profile in a quiet office environment.

1494
01:58:33,166 --> 01:58:35,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a testament to your chemistry, I guess.

1495
01:58:35,547 --> 01:58:36,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's very kind.

1496
01:58:36,388 --> 01:58:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1497
01:58:37,869 --> 01:58:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: He signs it.

1498
01:58:38,509 --> 01:58:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR's premier gold star recipient, AZHP.

1499
01:58:42,492 --> 01:58:42,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1500
01:58:42,872 --> 01:58:43,933
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a previous gold star.

1501
01:58:43,953 --> 01:58:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another very worthy email there, so thank you very much.

1502
01:58:49,005 --> 01:58:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1503
01:58:50,326 --> 01:58:52,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get through some more emails here.

1504
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:57,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1505
01:58:58,071 --> 01:59:04,134
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes to us from... They didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say Sam is the person that sent this.

1506
01:59:04,575 --> 01:59:05,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, OLR crew.

1507
01:59:05,775 --> 01:59:11,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying very hard to use the best grammar possible so the grammar Nazi doesn't permabam me or start yelling or whatever.

1508
01:59:11,539 --> 01:59:12,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're lucky.

1509
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight I'm reading them and I have terrible grammar too, so I'm not going to be too critical tonight.

1510
01:59:16,642 --> 01:59:17,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm Blade3.

1511
01:59:17,823 --> 01:59:18,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's the name.

1512
01:59:18,924 --> 01:59:19,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Blade3.

1513
01:59:19,424 --> 01:59:20,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't emailed you guys since 2007.

1514
01:59:21,085 --> 01:59:29,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm older and I slapped together a PSP website that has awesome functions and I wanted to let you know that I put your feed on there because everyone deserves to listen to the awesome Orange Lounge Radio.

1515
01:59:29,951 --> 01:59:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out at rmedia.webhop.net.

1516
01:59:33,193 --> 01:59:37,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It will automatically route you if you are on a PSP and if you have an iPhone, it will route you to the iPhone site.

1517
01:59:37,916 --> 01:59:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use a computer, it will route you to the main site.

1518
01:59:40,177 --> 01:59:42,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats on many fantastic shows.

1519
01:59:42,199 --> 01:59:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the fabulous work.

1520
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:45,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I just gave that dude free advertising.

1521
01:59:46,209 --> 01:59:47,611
[SPEAKER_02]: for just kissing our ass in an email

1522
02:00:02,833 --> 02:00:05,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather play video games, yeah, and it's just, I don't know.

1523
02:00:06,194 --> 02:00:10,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email, hey guys, JD here, long-time listener, first-time emailer.

1524
02:00:10,474 --> 02:00:13,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'm a listener from the UK, so I can't really tune in live.

1525
02:00:14,195 --> 02:00:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have listeners from the UK that tune in live, but I understand, it's like two in the morning over there, so those guys are just really hardcore.

1526
02:00:21,596 --> 02:00:22,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the email, anyway.

1527
02:00:23,017 --> 02:00:28,558
[SPEAKER_02]: This is concerning something DarkSakura mentioned quite a while ago when she heard the theme from Shaft in a Czech restaurant.

1528
02:00:28,578 --> 02:00:28,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember this?

1529
02:00:29,018 --> 02:00:29,858
[SPEAKER_02]: She talked about this earlier.

1530
02:00:30,458 --> 02:00:40,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, today in my college induction day, my teacher was warning us about the dangers of leaving our phones on, and with perfect timing, his phone started ringing, and his ringtone was none other than the theme from Shaft.

1531
02:00:41,467 --> 02:00:45,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, I must head off to bed now, so goodnight, OLR, and Sky, you need to update the podcast on time.

1532
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:46,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know.

1533
02:00:46,611 --> 02:00:46,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1534
02:00:48,452 --> 02:00:48,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad host.

1535
02:00:48,993 --> 02:00:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad panda.

1536
02:00:49,953 --> 02:00:50,314
[SPEAKER_02]: No cookie.

1537
02:00:52,120 --> 02:01:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: that email from JD reminding us of an old inside joke if I can find that clip off to put that in the best of too I just don't remember what episode that was in just a couple more emails for you guys here and then I'll get to it let's see I'll get to probably just one more email here from Rob with 2B's

1538
02:01:11,787 --> 02:01:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: and he sent us quite a few emails this week.

1539
02:01:13,348 --> 02:01:14,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to pick a couple of these here.

1540
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:20,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob from 2B's wanted to know if any of us were going to Disneyland from September 23rd to 27th.

1541
02:01:20,853 --> 02:01:23,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I went the week before and I'm going the week after.

1542
02:01:24,595 --> 02:01:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very sorry to say it, but we didn't make it to Disneyland the same week you were.

1543
02:01:28,678 --> 02:01:29,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope you had a ton of fun.

1544
02:01:29,898 --> 02:01:32,960
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is all the Halloween events started this weekend.

1545
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:33,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Also...

1546
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:43,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us a link to this interesting article on GamesPolitik.com about a study linking youth violence depression to peers, not video games.

1547
02:01:45,282 --> 02:01:48,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it says here, one, depression is a symptom.

1548
02:01:48,863 --> 02:01:54,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pointing out that many of the youths surveyed have depression problems to the point where it seems correlated to youth violence.

1549
02:01:54,785 --> 02:01:57,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that the issue of depression is something that should be tackled all by itself.

1550
02:01:58,185 --> 02:02:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, peer pressure is also the cause of good behavior.

1551
02:02:01,266 --> 02:02:02,327
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1552
02:02:22,102 --> 02:02:35,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a tendency when we see something that's kind of on our side to rah rah rah around it a little bit and yeah there might be a lot of variables in this study and I kind of agree with this whole notion that this is probably something that's way too hard to gauge way too hard to gauge I think

1553
02:02:53,266 --> 02:02:54,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1554
02:03:09,878 --> 02:03:10,939
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1555
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:37,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best cure to that sort of depression is to stop that behavior and go outside.

1556
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:40,782
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a healthy balance of video gaming when you're that age.

1557
02:03:41,382 --> 02:03:44,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think too much gaming is the cause.

1558
02:03:45,023 --> 02:03:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too much gaming is a symptom, if that makes sense.

1559
02:03:48,304 --> 02:03:51,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're trying to isolate themselves from everybody else.

1560
02:03:52,965 --> 02:03:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes games make them feel better about themselves, especially if they're really skilled at something.

1561
02:03:57,645 --> 02:03:57,845
Nice.

1562
02:03:58,686 --> 02:04:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, JD is in chat right now and says it is 4.30 in the morning where he's at and he is listening after all.

1563
02:04:04,852 --> 02:04:06,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much for tuning in and listening.

1564
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for the mailbag tonight.

1565
02:04:08,335 --> 02:04:09,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for the emails.

1566
02:04:09,556 --> 02:04:12,779
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send us an email, please do a mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1567
02:04:12,799 --> 02:04:14,881
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to some more emails next week.

1568
02:04:15,721 --> 02:04:24,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want to get into the FUs of the week as we always do around this point of the show and we have a good little inspiration story for you guys tonight.

1569
02:04:36,974 --> 02:04:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: To inspire tonight's FUs of the week, I bring you a principal from Germany who was quoted this week.

1570
02:04:43,218 --> 02:04:54,646
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Bernd Denning and said, kind of maybe along this whole line with depression and so forth, he believes that video games play a major role in a child becoming a homicidal maniac.

1571
02:04:55,146 --> 02:05:05,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, even if killer games are not the trigger of a killing spree, this guy said yesterday, they still take a major part in turning minors into homicidal maniacs.

1572
02:05:06,093 --> 02:05:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if there isn't a mono-casually relation between excessive playing of games leading to acts of violence, it still provides a twisted frame of reference of solutions for their problems and hardships that they learn and may transfer to the real world under certain circumstances.

1573
02:05:20,941 --> 02:05:23,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but how is that the game's fault?

1574
02:05:24,102 --> 02:05:28,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of admitting that they're going to the games because they have a problem in the first place.

1575
02:05:28,865 --> 02:05:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: The game doesn't turn them into a homicidal maniac.

1576
02:05:32,427 --> 02:05:32,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1577
02:05:34,376 --> 02:05:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: To his defense, I think it's like this.

1578
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:43,946
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a crazy person already, the games mainly give him inspiration to how, I guess,

1579
02:05:45,424 --> 02:05:46,465
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1580
02:06:07,186 --> 02:06:07,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Art does it.

1581
02:06:08,106 --> 02:06:13,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because he got in a soapbox and wanted to say something controversial so people would listen and people did and then they blogged about it.

1582
02:06:13,948 --> 02:06:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Art can be influential.

1583
02:06:15,789 --> 02:06:16,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

1584
02:06:16,909 --> 02:06:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so we dedicate the FUs of the week to this guy.

1585
02:06:20,090 --> 02:06:20,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1586
02:06:21,251 --> 02:06:31,194
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to my headache and it's from sinuses I'm guessing because I got it when I got back here and my eyes are burning and my head hurts so it's got to be a sinus headache.

1587
02:06:31,994 --> 02:06:32,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someone in this house.

1588
02:06:33,514 --> 02:06:33,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Shermie.

1589
02:06:35,819 --> 02:06:36,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie's not in the room.

1590
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:40,163
[SPEAKER_02]: She has to get out of here tonight.

1591
02:06:40,243 --> 02:06:40,804
[SPEAKER_02]: No pun intended.

1592
02:06:41,104 --> 02:06:45,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, my FU of the week goes to the food poisoning I got from a popular sandwich chain earlier this week.

1593
02:06:45,969 --> 02:06:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to name them because I can't prove it.

1594
02:06:48,311 --> 02:06:48,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

1595
02:06:49,672 --> 02:06:50,974
[SPEAKER_02]: They toast their sandwiches.

1596
02:06:51,014 --> 02:06:52,055
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very famous for it.

1597
02:06:52,175 --> 02:06:58,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I got another one from... They don't have footlongs, but you can get stuff to go.

1598
02:06:58,661 --> 02:06:59,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay, yeah.

1599
02:07:02,125 --> 02:07:02,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1600
02:07:02,966 --> 02:07:08,031
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I, you know, I can't prove that they gave me the food poisoning, but I'm pretty sure that's where I got it.

1601
02:07:08,492 --> 02:07:11,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And, man, it was hell for three days, but I lost some weight.

1602
02:07:12,776 --> 02:07:17,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it wasn't really, I don't know if it's bad sushi and then bad sandwich.

1603
02:07:19,003 --> 02:07:22,326
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to just food poisoning, because it sucks.

1604
02:07:23,905 --> 02:07:24,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

1605
02:07:25,326 --> 02:07:31,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1606
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:35,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably have time for quite a few calls tonight, so we'll try to get through everybody tonight.

1607
02:07:35,573 --> 02:07:35,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1608
02:07:35,994 --> 02:07:39,696
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, we've got some new Xbox Live Arcade games coming out, and quite a few of them.

1609
02:07:40,037 --> 02:07:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually we get one or two, but we have three.

1610
02:07:42,198 --> 02:07:52,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, starting things off, and you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the Warriors game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox, but now we get the Warriors Streetball, which is...

1611
02:07:53,823 --> 02:07:54,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Zombiapocalypse

1612
02:08:10,973 --> 02:08:26,112
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of like a top down version of Left 4 Dead and that's going to be available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 and also Ion Assault which I believe is a tower defense game and that's also available for 800 Microsoft points or $10 and um

1613
02:08:30,114 --> 02:08:31,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm right about the ion assault thing.

1614
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

1615
02:08:33,836 --> 02:08:34,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, I'm wrong.

1616
02:08:34,896 --> 02:08:38,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a space shooter with an interesting twist, they say.

1617
02:08:38,658 --> 02:08:44,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you can draw in energy from particles and use them to blast foes.

1618
02:08:45,121 --> 02:08:49,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen that in a freeware game made by some Japanese guy.

1619
02:08:50,063 --> 02:08:50,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1620
02:08:51,384 --> 02:08:52,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1621
02:08:52,424 --> 02:08:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks neat.

1622
02:08:55,106 --> 02:08:56,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a little bit like Geometry Wars.

1623
02:08:57,667 --> 02:08:57,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1624
02:09:00,185 --> 02:09:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it about time for a new Geometry Wars, by the way?

1625
02:09:03,046 --> 02:09:14,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you would think with a new Project Gotham game you'd get something like that, but since there's not going to really be a Project Gotham game from Bazaar, I don't really know.

1626
02:09:15,470 --> 02:09:16,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me do it later.

1627
02:09:17,706 --> 02:09:18,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And it already kind of got leaked.

1628
02:09:18,987 --> 02:09:19,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did it?

1629
02:09:45,469 --> 02:09:46,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear the follow-up.

1630
02:10:05,794 --> 02:10:11,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yosho, what was it, Yoshinoro Ono, and some other guy, and they were kind of doing like a fireball pose.

1631
02:10:12,578 --> 02:10:13,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the background, what is that?

1632
02:10:14,119 --> 02:10:24,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Street Fighter 4, but then there's T-Hawk there, and then also a big giant banner with what appears to look like an S from Super Street Fighter 4.

1633
02:10:25,005 --> 02:10:25,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops!

1634
02:10:27,392 --> 02:10:38,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, you're probably going to get some either download content or perhaps a re-release of the game, you know, greatest hits type thing or something like that with new characters.

1635
02:10:38,285 --> 02:10:40,908
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, a way to milk more money from you.

1636
02:10:41,028 --> 02:10:41,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1637
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:42,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

1638
02:10:44,592 --> 02:10:44,932
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1639
02:10:44,992 --> 02:10:46,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is it for the stories that we have tonight.

1640
02:10:47,053 --> 02:10:51,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's now that time for us to open up the Skype line and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1641
02:10:52,196 --> 02:10:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1642
02:10:54,358 --> 02:10:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't you give us some last-minute stories before we get to the phones?

1643
02:10:57,239 --> 02:11:03,043
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 Elite is actually going to be a little bit cheaper until October 5th.

1644
02:11:05,604 --> 02:11:16,432
[SPEAKER_03]: With a cool deal that's going on with Netflix, you will be able to buy an Xbox 360 Elite between September 22nd and October 5th and go on to Xbox's website.

1645
02:11:16,452 --> 02:11:17,332
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a link, actually.

1646
02:11:17,352 --> 02:11:22,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check it out where you can mail in for a rebate for $50.

1647
02:11:23,917 --> 02:11:27,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a bad deal if you're looking to pick up a console.

1648
02:11:29,741 --> 02:11:30,041
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1649
02:11:32,202 --> 02:11:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones.

1650
02:11:33,003 --> 02:11:34,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1651
02:11:34,064 --> 02:11:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1652
02:11:37,475 --> 02:11:38,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.

1653
02:11:38,436 --> 02:11:38,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1654
02:11:39,937 --> 02:11:40,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Deathwishing.

1655
02:11:40,637 --> 02:11:41,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, there you are.

1656
02:11:41,358 --> 02:11:42,018
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1657
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:49,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you guys hear about how I think I read on Twitter from Inside Gaming that...

1658
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:55,331
[SPEAKER_01]: The memory cap for Xbox Live arcade games is being increased to 2 gigs.

1659
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:58,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did remember reading an article on that earlier this week.

1660
02:11:58,173 --> 02:12:01,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that have to do with the whole, what is it, Command & Conquer 3?

1661
02:12:01,375 --> 02:12:03,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the new Command & Conquer.

1662
02:12:03,816 --> 02:12:09,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that kind of like defeat the purpose of games that are not that big and now you can have these 2 gig games which basically...

1663
02:12:10,019 --> 02:12:15,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what they're trying to say is go buy our expensive overpriced hard drives, is what I feel like they're telling me.

1664
02:12:15,161 --> 02:12:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, because when you consider now that the main system that's going to be available out there is the Xbox 360 Elite with a 120GB hard drive, I mean, you could fit like 60 games on there.

1665
02:12:25,624 --> 02:12:27,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, probably less than 60 games, but pretty close to 60.

1666
02:12:28,185 --> 02:12:31,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but what happens to all the people that didn't buy the Elite?

1667
02:12:31,966 --> 02:12:37,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's more people with the standard edition console that had a 20GB hard drive.

1668
02:12:38,308 --> 02:12:39,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft doesn't care about you.

1669
02:12:58,935 --> 02:12:59,616
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1670
02:13:19,854 --> 02:13:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hundreds, literally hundreds of games already available that are very small.

1671
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:29,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Indie games, don't forget those, in addition to just the past three, four years of what's been out on the 360.

1672
02:13:31,185 --> 02:13:33,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I also picked up ODST.

1673
02:13:34,549 --> 02:13:35,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did you think?

1674
02:13:36,731 --> 02:13:39,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it, but I also know a lot of people that hate it.

1675
02:13:40,809 --> 02:13:41,971
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you love about it?

1676
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:43,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice it's been half and half.

1677
02:13:43,332 --> 02:13:45,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice people love it or people hate it.

1678
02:13:45,314 --> 02:13:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is strange for a Halo game because usually everybody's dry humping it.

1679
02:13:48,959 --> 02:13:51,081
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you love about Halo 3 ODST?

1680
02:13:51,241 --> 02:13:53,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love that it's actually a fun campaign.

1681
02:13:53,884 --> 02:13:55,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting story.

1682
02:13:56,086 --> 02:13:57,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The voice acting is pretty good.

1683
02:13:57,528 --> 02:13:59,550
[SPEAKER_01]: The music in this game is awesome.

1684
02:14:01,592 --> 02:14:03,733
[SPEAKER_01]: and Firefight's pretty fun.

1685
02:14:03,793 --> 02:14:06,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it for like three hours one day with a couple friends.

1686
02:14:06,795 --> 02:14:09,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to sound so ignorant, but what is Firefight mode?

1687
02:14:10,237 --> 02:14:12,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Firefight is... I don't know enough about Halo.

1688
02:14:13,479 --> 02:14:13,819
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

1689
02:14:14,359 --> 02:14:15,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War Horde.

1690
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

1691
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:18,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo twist with skulls and stuff.

1692
02:14:19,682 --> 02:14:20,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

1693
02:14:21,243 --> 02:14:27,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's been taking up my whole time this week, basically.

1694
02:14:30,219 --> 02:14:31,520
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say to the haters?

1695
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:34,342
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the haters saying about it?

1696
02:14:34,562 --> 02:14:58,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people that hate it are either A, kids that were looking for Master Chief and didn't find them so they cried and maybe people that aren't fans of the Halo series looking for a different game and then there's the people that don't play Halo games but they bought Halo because you know you have to have it and most people, I know a lot of people who did buy Halo for their Xbox because it's like a staple game like Call of Duty and Gears of War

1697
02:14:59,585 --> 02:15:02,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read most of the books.

1698
02:15:21,943 --> 02:15:23,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo Reach is a prequel to Fall of Reach.

1699
02:15:40,839 --> 02:15:42,600
[SPEAKER_02]: You are one hardcore Halo nerd.

1700
02:15:43,761 --> 02:15:44,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say hardcore.

1701
02:15:44,741 --> 02:15:46,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the story.

1702
02:15:46,082 --> 02:15:48,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like Call of Duty 4 a lot better.

1703
02:15:48,683 --> 02:15:49,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Call of Duty.

1704
02:15:49,804 --> 02:15:50,264
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

1705
02:15:50,284 --> 02:15:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's people that read the Warcraft books and some of the books based on other games.

1706
02:15:53,926 --> 02:15:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, those people are nerds.

1707
02:15:55,127 --> 02:15:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.

1708
02:15:57,228 --> 02:15:58,869
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta love the video game culture.

1709
02:15:59,289 --> 02:15:59,930
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta love it.

1710
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:02,951
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll look at just another subgroup and say, you guys are nerds.

1711
02:16:03,092 --> 02:16:04,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Star Wars guys and the Trekkies.

1712
02:16:04,993 --> 02:16:05,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1713
02:16:05,833 --> 02:16:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Deathwishing, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts?

1714
02:16:10,659 --> 02:16:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the former lead singer of No Doubt or one of them at Chain Reaction last night.

1715
02:16:16,062 --> 02:16:16,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Gwen Stefani?

1716
02:16:17,242 --> 02:16:17,723
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Alan.

1717
02:16:18,583 --> 02:16:20,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like from the old school days.

1718
02:16:20,184 --> 02:16:21,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he has a band called Starpool.

1719
02:16:22,945 --> 02:16:23,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get a picture?

1720
02:16:25,606 --> 02:16:27,687
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I was too busy skanking.

1721
02:16:28,527 --> 02:16:29,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, good luck with that.

1722
02:16:31,188 --> 02:16:31,389
[SPEAKER_01]: See ya.

1723
02:16:34,274 --> 02:16:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you'd like to go ahead and give us a call We'll take some more calls Any other last minute stories?

1724
02:16:42,063 --> 02:16:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: EA has confirmed that they're going to be doing a Beatles Rock Band SingStar Pack Basically Beatles Rock Band for PS3 With two SingStar mics We have another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Who's this?

1725
02:16:51,991 --> 02:16:53,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Brad from PodCulture.

1726
02:17:21,863 --> 02:17:22,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fair enough.

1727
02:17:22,605 --> 02:17:24,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Which it isn't.

1728
02:17:24,829 --> 02:17:27,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you talk about Olive Garden 2, okay.

1729
02:17:28,938 --> 02:17:31,179
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually usually do go out to eat before the shows.

1730
02:17:31,319 --> 02:17:32,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, very nice.

1731
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:36,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, I know you didn't call in today just to plug your shows, but what's on your mind, buddy?

1732
02:17:37,482 --> 02:17:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Halo 3 ODST.

1733
02:17:39,543 --> 02:17:41,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, you're another Halo 3 ODST fan, huh?

1734
02:17:42,364 --> 02:17:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoy it.

1735
02:17:43,904 --> 02:17:47,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not an F minus minus kind of a game.

1736
02:17:47,886 --> 02:17:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a little dig there at Bobby on the earlier show.

1737
02:17:49,967 --> 02:17:52,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, what grade would you give it and why?

1738
02:17:52,948 --> 02:17:57,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd give it a good solid B. Mainly, you know, it

1739
02:17:58,291 --> 02:18:03,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Bounces around between the different viewpoints of the characters which some people I can see would like.

1740
02:18:03,766 --> 02:18:05,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, I like a little bit more of a linear type of story.

1741
02:18:08,499 --> 02:18:12,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys are hardcore into that universe so just the voice acting alone has got to sell this game to you guys.

1742
02:18:33,188 --> 02:18:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, Nathan Fillion's character actually looked like Nathan Fillion.

1743
02:18:38,349 --> 02:18:38,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1744
02:18:38,749 --> 02:18:40,810
[SPEAKER_07]: They did some of the modeling really good.

1745
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:47,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan Tudyk's character, there's one scene where he actually flies a Covenant ship.

1746
02:18:48,032 --> 02:18:50,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So you sound like you're actually into the campaign mode.

1747
02:18:50,212 --> 02:18:53,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you play any of the multiplayer at all, or are you all about the campaign?

1748
02:18:54,773 --> 02:18:57,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Every once in a while, but I usually get my ass handed to me.

1749
02:18:58,737 --> 02:18:59,657
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a busy man, Brad.

1750
02:18:59,678 --> 02:19:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have time to play video games?

1751
02:19:00,918 --> 02:19:02,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, you just don't sleep.

1752
02:19:23,109 --> 02:19:23,709
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fair enough.

1753
02:19:23,909 --> 02:19:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you've been playing lately, Brad?

1754
02:19:26,191 --> 02:19:28,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero 5.

1755
02:19:28,852 --> 02:19:30,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you think of both these games?

1756
02:19:31,833 --> 02:19:33,254
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really neat.

1757
02:19:33,294 --> 02:19:38,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I like in Guitar Hero 5, it's kind of cheesy, but I like the fact you can play as your avatar.

1758
02:19:40,157 --> 02:19:40,798
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

1759
02:19:42,783 --> 02:19:46,324
[SPEAKER_07]: and with the Beatles rock band, come on man, it's the Beatles.

1760
02:19:46,765 --> 02:19:47,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, it's the Beatles.

1761
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:50,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have yet to get on this Beatles train.

1762
02:19:50,186 --> 02:19:56,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be late to the arrival because I know you were making fun of me over my 360 earlier, but I'll get on the bandwagon soon enough.

1763
02:19:57,749 --> 02:19:59,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with everybody else's hype for right now.

1764
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:06,552
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is going to be, I hate to make you pick, but which game do you think is going to trump at Christmas?

1765
02:20:08,495 --> 02:20:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to actually probably say Beatles Rock Band because you have more of the, it would appeal to more of folks who normally wouldn't pick up a video game.

1766
02:20:18,679 --> 02:20:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I took it over to my mom's to play with my, over for my birthday and we played with my sister and brother-in-law and their kids and everybody loved it.

1767
02:20:29,462 --> 02:20:29,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1768
02:20:30,382 --> 02:20:30,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1769
02:20:31,422 --> 02:20:32,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, any final thoughts for us, Brad?

1770
02:20:33,928 --> 02:20:34,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir.

1771
02:20:34,349 --> 02:20:35,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep up doing the great show.

1772
02:20:36,093 --> 02:20:36,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

1773
02:20:36,634 --> 02:20:37,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

1774
02:20:37,436 --> 02:20:38,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a good one.

1775
02:20:38,138 --> 02:20:40,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And good luck with your multitude of shows.

1776
02:20:41,872 --> 02:20:42,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch you later guys

1777
02:21:09,331 --> 02:21:14,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just chilling right now because the weekend was New York Anime Fest.

1778
02:21:16,316 --> 02:21:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another damn con.

1779
02:21:17,957 --> 02:21:21,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are spoiled out there on the East Coast with all your cons.

1780
02:21:21,079 --> 02:21:21,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you go to this?

1781
02:21:22,039 --> 02:21:24,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, not only that.

1782
02:21:24,421 --> 02:21:36,649
[SPEAKER_00]: The creator of Gundam was one of the guests of honor, so I managed to go to both of his panels and I had him autograph one of my copies of Zeta Gundam.

1783
02:21:38,339 --> 02:21:39,100
[SPEAKER_00]: and a picture with him.

1784
02:21:40,081 --> 02:21:43,443
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be up on Facebook eventually, but right now I'm just tired.

1785
02:21:43,483 --> 02:21:50,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta relax tonight because I've been going through this rat race this whole weekend.

1786
02:21:53,911 --> 02:22:03,057
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, basically I wanted to bring up a good point that I don't know if it was probably already discussed, but the fact that the creator of Mega Man

1787
02:22:04,884 --> 02:22:06,165
[SPEAKER_00]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1788
02:22:35,085 --> 02:22:40,395
[SPEAKER_00]: The Con this weekend, which was basically a debate between Western and Japanese video games.

1789
02:22:41,075 --> 02:22:44,738
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did bring up that particular rant.

1790
02:22:45,939 --> 02:22:58,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And from how the debate went, we pretty much settled on the fact that Japan is a clash of cultures.

1791
02:22:59,289 --> 02:23:00,410
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it that way.

1792
02:23:00,470 --> 02:23:07,396
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, where you have the Japanese with their strong work ethic and the fact that they only help themselves, not each other.

1793
02:23:08,373 --> 02:23:15,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Western developers, or just Western business companies for that matter, you have to work within a team.

1794
02:23:20,193 --> 02:23:25,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't this just a little bit, though, I wouldn't see it as the apocalypse that all these guys are proclaiming.

1795
02:23:25,795 --> 02:23:27,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.

1796
02:23:27,756 --> 02:23:30,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And that says he's probably crying wolf a bit too early.

1797
02:23:31,277 --> 02:23:36,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think, here it is, Zaku, American development for many years sucked balls.

1798
02:23:37,279 --> 02:23:39,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did we get all of our games from?

1799
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:42,341
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them, Zaku, came from Japan just like 20 years ago.

1800
02:23:42,701 --> 02:23:46,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when American developers would do it, they would almost like just fail miserably.

1801
02:23:46,502 --> 02:23:48,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Like remember Secret of Evermore?

1802
02:23:48,846 --> 02:23:50,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that game, but a lot of people hated that game.

1803
02:23:50,887 --> 02:23:54,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, just Japanese development has dominated for so long.

1804
02:23:54,228 --> 02:23:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's so much that Japanese development is dead, it's just Japanese development is having to share the spotlight a little bit.

1805
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:01,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.

1806
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:09,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, they have to contend with the fact that the Western video game market at this point is pretty solid.

1807
02:24:09,934 --> 02:24:15,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have the 360, which has the largest install base of any console right now on the planet.

1808
02:24:16,756 --> 02:24:19,640
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, the Wii is still number one.

1809
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,964
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, Europe, I mean, you'd be surprised.

1810
02:24:23,865 --> 02:24:29,251
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact of the matter is that there is... And actually, no, it doesn't have the largest install base because the Wii is still number one around the world.

1811
02:24:29,271 --> 02:24:29,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.

1812
02:24:30,232 --> 02:24:35,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, alright, aside from the Wii, but I mean, in terms of hardcore, I mean, I consider the Wii more of a...

1813
02:24:36,918 --> 02:24:47,443
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more of the casual system, even though it hasn't really appealed that much to hardcore, with the exception of Super Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros.

1814
02:24:48,244 --> 02:24:51,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another reason why... So you're just saying compared to Sony?

1815
02:24:51,866 --> 02:24:52,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying compared to Sony?

1816
02:24:54,327 --> 02:24:54,967
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

1817
02:24:55,547 --> 02:24:58,469
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that Japan...

1818
02:24:58,985 --> 02:25:01,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't see the writings on the wall a lot sooner than later.

1819
02:25:01,766 --> 02:25:05,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just, they have the deer in the headlights look all of a sudden.

1820
02:25:06,307 --> 02:25:11,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Wii and most of the world already knew that they weren't the only game in town anymore.

1821
02:25:12,029 --> 02:25:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, to give you an example here, the Wii right now worldwide is 53.47 million units, whereas the Xbox 360 is 32.10 million.

1822
02:25:17,931 --> 02:25:19,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, the PlayStation 3...

1823
02:25:26,544 --> 02:25:28,606
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit catching up now, I think.

1824
02:25:28,906 --> 02:25:31,668
[SPEAKER_03]: They're down to 24.55 million.

1825
02:25:32,209 --> 02:25:43,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I mean, it pretty much goes back into what others... I guess in a way he's right.

1826
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:47,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happened.

1827
02:25:47,702 --> 02:25:50,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Microsoft pretty much realized that

1828
02:25:51,311 --> 02:26:01,956
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to create a powerful platform, a world-class platform, is that they have to listen, appeal more to developers, and essentially throw money at them.

1829
02:26:03,357 --> 02:26:12,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they managed to roll out more 360s in Japan than the original Xbox.

1830
02:26:12,705 --> 02:26:20,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it still hasn't beaten the PS3 yet, it's getting close.

1831
02:26:20,251 --> 02:26:28,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for all intents and purposes, you could say that it's razor thin at this point, the margin between the two.

1832
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:31,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up and let you go.

1833
02:26:31,639 --> 02:26:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other quick thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1834
02:26:35,005 --> 02:26:41,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, worst game of all time, Final Fantasy VII, and that wasn't me saying it, that was pretty much a panel that I went to today.

1835
02:26:43,131 --> 02:26:45,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are millions of people that would disagree with you.

1836
02:26:46,774 --> 02:26:48,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, take care, Saku.

1837
02:26:49,135 --> 02:26:49,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1838
02:26:50,236 --> 02:26:52,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows that the worst game of all time is Draft 3.

1839
02:26:53,078 --> 02:26:53,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, please.

1840
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:54,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

1841
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:59,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that says that Final Fantasy VII is the worst game of all time, I laugh in your face.

1842
02:27:00,424 --> 02:27:00,804
Ah-ha!

1843
02:27:01,169 --> 02:27:02,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what you meant to say.

1844
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:02,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like...

1845
02:27:14,865 --> 02:27:18,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is overrated.

1846
02:27:19,226 --> 02:27:19,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1847
02:27:19,586 --> 02:27:26,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I could think of literally hundreds of games off the top of my head that are worse than Final Fantasy VII that I think we all could agree on.

1848
02:27:26,707 --> 02:27:27,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

1849
02:27:28,287 --> 02:27:28,828
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty.

1850
02:27:29,028 --> 02:27:30,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1851
02:27:30,808 --> 02:27:31,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1852
02:27:32,608 --> 02:27:34,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1853
02:27:34,369 --> 02:27:34,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Spazinator.

1854
02:27:34,989 --> 02:27:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind tonight?

1855
02:27:37,389 --> 02:27:40,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had two quick questions because I know you're about to wrap up.

1856
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's up?

1857
02:27:43,177 --> 02:27:46,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're kind of interrelated.

1858
02:27:47,481 --> 02:27:56,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as home is concerned, have you heard anything about their announced update?

1859
02:27:56,249 --> 02:27:57,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're calling it 1.3.

1860
02:27:59,312 --> 02:28:00,333
[SPEAKER_02]: For what is this?

1861
02:28:02,035 --> 02:28:03,376
[SPEAKER_05]: For PlayStation Home.

1862
02:28:04,903 --> 02:28:06,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw some stuff online.

1863
02:28:06,824 --> 02:28:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think there was anything super major that I read about in it.

1864
02:28:09,985 --> 02:28:14,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think this is getting the showing of the trophies or any of that that we saw about.

1865
02:28:14,266 --> 02:28:18,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say I thought I saw something when I logged in the other day, but I don't think there was anything major, right?

1866
02:28:18,728 --> 02:28:21,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think I ever saw a bullet point on there for fun.

1867
02:28:22,009 --> 02:28:22,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

1868
02:28:22,729 --> 02:28:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't really interested in it at all.

1869
02:28:26,530 --> 02:28:29,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Spazinator, you've checked out the OLR Clubhouse, right?

1870
02:28:30,771 --> 02:28:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1871
02:28:31,291 --> 02:28:32,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Have I done a nice job decorating it?

1872
02:28:34,624 --> 02:28:36,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1873
02:28:36,105 --> 02:28:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in fact, since you touched on it, I did have a question.

1874
02:28:41,808 --> 02:28:45,190
[SPEAKER_05]: My second question relates to the clubhouse.

1875
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that, you know, right behind the stage, you know, near the ceiling, there looks like there's some kind of TV screen or something like that.

1876
02:28:53,774 --> 02:28:54,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1877
02:28:54,715 --> 02:28:58,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that, like, serve a purpose, or is it, like, just, like...

1878
02:28:59,178 --> 02:28:59,679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1879
02:29:14,833 --> 02:29:20,636
[SPEAKER_02]: because I would love to give you an exclusive little OLR behind the scenes video or something.

1880
02:29:20,716 --> 02:29:26,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to put a five minute video of us taping the show or something before or after the show in home.

1881
02:29:26,859 --> 02:29:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome and give people a reason to go to home.

1882
02:29:30,702 --> 02:29:32,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't do that yet.

1883
02:29:32,302 --> 02:29:33,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something they're letting us do.

1884
02:29:33,483 --> 02:29:36,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're still working out for a reason to buy the PSP Go.

1885
02:29:37,385 --> 02:29:38,086
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1886
02:29:57,364 --> 02:29:57,924
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1887
02:30:20,871 --> 02:30:47,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I was thinking, I know you guys have a whole bunch of videos on YouTube, you know, like just recently you put up the video of Jamie's, you know, vault, and along with their pinball machine collection, that would be great for the TV screen, and for anyone that buys any of the content through the video sector in the store, you know, I would imagine in the 30s,

1888
02:30:47,791 --> 02:30:54,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator, I would, the minute that Sony lets us put those YouTubes on that TV in the clubhouse, I am so there.

1889
02:30:54,336 --> 02:30:56,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I would love them to just open up the clubhouse to everybody.

1890
02:30:57,459 --> 02:30:58,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Why be a member of the club?

1891
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:05,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to make my club public so that way lots of people can explore the clubhouse, see the video and go, oh, these guys look kind of crazy.

1892
02:31:05,705 --> 02:31:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll listen to the show.

1893
02:31:06,806 --> 02:31:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be great promotion, but sadly, you know, and I understand, you know, it's a big deal for Sony to hit the switch because if they allow people to post their own videos and

1894
02:31:15,513 --> 02:31:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: there's huge copyright things they're going to have to deal with so I can understand why I don't get what I want but believe me the day they figure it all out even if they have to review each piece of submitted content we don't have anything copyright in ours so we would submit it and hopefully it'll be on there well thanks for taking my call and I'll want to go like I said you're probably going to wrap up the show pretty soon here

1895
02:31:44,690 --> 02:31:45,750
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, thank you, Spaz.

1896
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:48,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, and we'll talk to you later week, all right?

1897
02:31:50,092 --> 02:31:50,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sounds good.

1898
02:31:50,972 --> 02:31:51,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1899
02:31:51,232 --> 02:31:51,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

1900
02:31:53,633 --> 02:31:55,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why we can't take a couple more calls.

1901
02:31:55,373 --> 02:31:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even 9 o'clock yet.

1902
02:31:56,473 --> 02:31:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

1903
02:31:56,853 --> 02:31:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do, like, one more call.

1904
02:31:57,814 --> 02:31:58,414
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1905
02:31:58,434 --> 02:32:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the name on Skype as Orange Launch Radio.

1906
02:32:01,055 --> 02:32:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other stories you want to get to?

1907
02:32:02,695 --> 02:32:04,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you want to.

1908
02:32:04,656 --> 02:32:05,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1909
02:32:06,872 --> 02:32:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank West, coming to Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1910
02:32:10,855 --> 02:32:12,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we already kind of knew that, but they have pictures now.

1911
02:32:13,077 --> 02:32:15,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like he has all sorts of crazy moves.

1912
02:32:15,459 --> 02:32:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hello!

1913
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,921
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DSMaster26.

1914
02:32:19,102 --> 02:32:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just picked up the phone, obviously.

1915
02:32:20,683 --> 02:32:21,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, what's on your mind?

1916
02:32:23,033 --> 02:32:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That bitch!

1917
02:32:45,850 --> 02:32:47,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1918
02:32:47,732 --> 02:32:49,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1919
02:32:50,194 --> 02:32:52,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Girls 101, don't laugh at me.

1920
02:32:52,756 --> 02:32:53,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Threaten to kick my ass.

1921
02:32:56,419 --> 02:33:01,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, then I replugged it in.

1922
02:33:02,043 --> 02:33:03,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my friend's 360, mind you.

1923
02:33:04,825 --> 02:33:07,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can borrow it for the weekend, thank God.

1924
02:33:07,667 --> 02:33:10,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been wanting to try a 360 for a while, full one.

1925
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:12,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Not one of those demo kiosks.

1926
02:33:13,497 --> 02:33:41,552
[SPEAKER_04]: and so then it red ringed on me and then I'm like oh crap so I have Rockman for the Wii and I'm like okay I'll put this under the tell trick thing for the 25 minutes or whatever and we'll play Rockman on the Wii well lo and behold it has an update and in the middle of that power outage for a second it bricked my Wii and now I have the blue light of death not kidding

1927
02:33:43,763 --> 02:33:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: BlueLateSpecialDeath Hold on.

1928
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:48,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get to grab your girlfriend's boobies tonight?

1929
02:33:50,586 --> 02:33:53,728
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but... Well, you have had a really bad day then.

1930
02:33:53,768 --> 02:34:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would think that at least to some type of concession for your bad day, she should be like, okay, I'll let you grab a boob.

1931
02:34:02,192 --> 02:34:02,632
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1932
02:34:03,793 --> 02:34:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: We did actually kind of started crying on the point where Kairi disappears on Kingdom Hearts.

1933
02:34:14,324 --> 02:34:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: 358 and a half days and spoiler alert sorry but um basically oh yeah and I forgot to mention I saw an Xbox 360 console with a pay-to-play method at the arcades where it's like okay four tick

1934
02:34:33,388 --> 02:34:37,651
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 Tokens, 4 Minutes, 8 Tokens, 8 Minutes, so on and so forth.

1935
02:34:38,512 --> 02:34:48,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw one, it was a modded Xbox, I swear to God, it was a Japanese weak copy of Beatmania 17 2DX.

1936
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:56,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen arcades put Stepmania machines in and try to make money off of it, so you know, I was part of that.

1937
02:34:57,867 --> 02:35:03,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And of all things, it was jerry-rigged into an actual Beatmania cabinet with the controller and everything.

1938
02:35:04,511 --> 02:35:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I thought was kind of cool, but it was right next door to an actual Beatmania machine.

1939
02:35:10,673 --> 02:35:16,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only do they have that, but they also have it with DDR Universe in there, one with the hardpad.

1940
02:35:17,439 --> 02:35:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the Rock Band game there to play.

1941
02:35:21,022 --> 02:35:25,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And they even got some PlayStation 3s jerry-rigged up that way, too, with the token play stuff.

1942
02:35:26,067 --> 02:35:27,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's this place at?

1943
02:35:27,148 --> 02:35:27,668
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it called?

1944
02:35:28,509 --> 02:35:30,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Family Fun Center.

1945
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:30,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in Omaha.

1946
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: FamilyFunCenter.net.

1947
02:35:33,113 --> 02:35:33,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it.

1948
02:35:33,754 --> 02:35:33,974
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1949
02:35:33,994 --> 02:35:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for ratting them out.

1950
02:35:35,015 --> 02:35:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: The developers that listen to this show will be glad to know.

1951
02:35:38,037 --> 02:35:42,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that place closes down, rest in peace knowing it's all your fault.

1952
02:35:42,500 --> 02:35:44,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, they're not doing anything wrong.

1953
02:35:44,321 --> 02:35:54,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think he... I'm sure that there's some fine print or something, but they do sell those actual kits that you can do pay-per-play stuff on the PS3 and all that stuff.

1954
02:35:54,407 --> 02:35:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It hooks up via JAMMA and that kind of stuff.

1955
02:35:56,348 --> 02:35:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I was actually looking into getting some JAMMA connectors for my Wii and stuff.

1956
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:03,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That way I can do Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on my arcade cabinet or, you know...

1957
02:36:04,253 --> 02:36:05,676
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff for my 360 or whatnot.

1958
02:36:05,757 --> 02:36:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because it's all available out there.

1959
02:36:07,039 --> 02:36:08,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just pay-for-play stuff.

1960
02:36:09,184 --> 02:36:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's annoying, I guess, because consoles aren't meant for that.

1961
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:15,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1962
02:36:15,662 --> 02:36:19,225
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get for playing V. Because seriously, that song is just overdone.

1963
02:36:19,245 --> 02:36:19,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1964
02:36:41,783 --> 02:36:42,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it sit.

1965
02:36:42,404 --> 02:36:43,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you get for playing me.

1966
02:36:43,584 --> 02:36:43,824
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1967
02:36:44,664 --> 02:36:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: All joking aside, I know I've been rousing you tonight, but you let me.

1968
02:36:47,786 --> 02:36:48,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for calling in.

1969
02:36:48,626 --> 02:36:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we let you go?

1970
02:36:50,487 --> 02:36:53,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely keep the good shows rocking.

1971
02:36:53,568 --> 02:36:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I'm the one who sent that one.

1972
02:36:56,589 --> 02:36:56,909
[SPEAKER_04]: D.S.

1973
02:36:56,929 --> 02:36:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Silver's my code name.

1974
02:36:59,150 --> 02:37:00,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I like RPGs and music titles.

1975
02:37:00,850 --> 02:37:05,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a few quick recommendations on XPLA and normal titles.

1976
02:37:06,408 --> 02:37:07,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, on my Xbox?

1977
02:37:07,849 --> 02:37:09,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't signed into my Xbox in like a week.

1978
02:37:09,611 --> 02:37:10,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I mean, a month.

1979
02:37:11,532 --> 02:37:13,954
[SPEAKER_04]: On just Xbox 360 itself, what would you recommend?

1980
02:37:14,494 --> 02:37:16,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what would I recommend on Xbox 360?

1981
02:37:16,536 --> 02:37:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you're into RPGs?

1982
02:37:19,339 --> 02:37:22,200
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs, Music, and Racing RPGs, Driving, and

1983
02:37:42,728 --> 02:37:43,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Music.

1984
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:43,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Music.

1985
02:37:43,469 --> 02:37:43,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Music.

1986
02:37:56,798 --> 02:38:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for Scratch, because that's the only thing close to Beatmania with DLC we're ever going to get here, because I figured out now they're never going to release Beatmania ever again here in the States, which sucks.

1987
02:38:08,766 --> 02:38:10,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to what I told you years ago.

1988
02:38:10,287 --> 02:38:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably do a Beatmania on PS3, and that way it'll be region-free, so you will be able to get a Beatmania here.

1989
02:38:18,253 --> 02:38:18,473
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1990
02:38:18,653 --> 02:38:20,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to let you go, DS Master, but take care, buddy.

1991
02:38:20,455 --> 02:38:20,775
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1992
02:38:21,175 --> 02:38:22,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the shows rocking, and peace out.

1993
02:38:23,116 --> 02:38:23,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.

1994
02:38:24,537 --> 02:38:24,838
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1995
02:38:28,865 --> 02:38:29,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I give him a hard time.

1996
02:38:30,607 --> 02:38:31,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does my head hurt more?

1997
02:38:31,869 --> 02:38:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it makes your headache get worse.

1998
02:38:33,331 --> 02:38:34,653
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a loud caller.

1999
02:38:35,976 --> 02:38:37,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said we could walk it out in twilight.

2000
02:39:06,172 --> 02:39:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yippee skipy.

2001
02:39:06,933 --> 02:39:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that poppin' music game on the Wii look horrendous?

2002
02:39:09,075 --> 02:39:10,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But granted, isn't Japan getting that too?

2003
02:39:10,756 --> 02:39:11,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just us.

2004
02:39:11,277 --> 02:39:11,958
[SPEAKER_02]: They already got it.

2005
02:39:12,218 --> 02:39:13,019
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting it soon.

2006
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get the crappy DDR.

2007
02:39:19,977 --> 02:39:23,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, remember how it was just Dance Dance Revolution at one time?

2008
02:39:23,299 --> 02:39:23,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2009
02:39:23,639 --> 02:39:25,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're breaking it out into three different games.

2010
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:29,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're going to do X2, Hottest Party 3, and then whatever the fuck.

2011
02:39:29,583 --> 02:39:31,924
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to call it PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

2012
02:39:32,584 --> 02:39:36,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the new, new one on the 360 and PS3 looked pretty sweet.

2013
02:39:36,166 --> 02:39:37,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty epic, actually.

2014
02:39:37,927 --> 02:39:38,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious on this.

2015
02:39:38,688 --> 02:39:40,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, though, they're going to be identical games.

2016
02:39:40,909 --> 02:39:41,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, pretty much.

2017
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

2018
02:39:42,510 --> 02:39:45,011
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just changing the names so that people don't realize it.

2019
02:39:45,312 --> 02:39:45,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

2020
02:39:46,485 --> 02:39:49,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we see the same game get ported to two different systems all the frickin' time?

2021
02:39:49,769 --> 02:39:50,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with that.

2022
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:54,755
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're combining resources to make one really fucking good game across both consoles, I'm okay with that.

2023
02:39:55,095 --> 02:39:56,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's not.

2024
02:39:56,797 --> 02:39:57,137
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2025
02:39:57,338 --> 02:39:57,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2026
02:39:57,738 --> 02:39:58,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Jury's out.

2027
02:39:58,479 --> 02:40:01,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show tonight.

2028
02:40:01,663 --> 02:40:02,824
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done with Skypline tonight.

2029
02:40:02,864 --> 02:40:05,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to those who didn't get through, but consider sending us an email.

2030
02:40:05,347 --> 02:40:06,028
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to hear from you.

2031
02:40:07,049 --> 02:40:08,991
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap up and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2032
02:40:09,711 --> 02:40:11,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here right now.

2033
02:40:11,513 --> 02:40:12,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe she'll come in during Afterbirth.

2034
02:40:12,874 --> 02:40:13,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2035
02:40:13,555 --> 02:40:14,496
[SPEAKER_02]: For live only folks.

2036
02:40:15,597 --> 02:40:19,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure she would say goodnight and reject fault icons or something like that.

2037
02:40:20,282 --> 02:40:21,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2038
02:40:21,823 --> 02:40:22,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my headache to go away.

2039
02:40:23,264 --> 02:40:23,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

2040
02:40:25,261 --> 02:40:29,462
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I am looking at Loki's bag from McDonald's and my mouth is watering because I'm hungry.

2041
02:40:29,483 --> 02:40:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fries in there.

2042
02:40:30,983 --> 02:40:32,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cold by now.

2043
02:40:32,503 --> 02:40:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't good to begin with.

2044
02:40:35,224 --> 02:40:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stop by on the way home.

2045
02:40:36,485 --> 02:40:37,705
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pretty good McDonald's by my house.

2046
02:40:37,985 --> 02:40:38,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it.

2047
02:40:38,765 --> 02:40:39,066
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

2048
02:40:39,106 --> 02:40:39,626
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of here.

2049
02:40:40,166 --> 02:40:43,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be here next week, but we will have a best of.

2050
02:40:43,307 --> 02:40:45,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned to All Games Radio.

2051
02:40:45,608 --> 02:40:48,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a best of on the network next week and with some new content.

2052
02:40:49,149 --> 02:40:52,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want you to think it's simply old rehashed stuff.

2053
02:40:52,890 --> 02:40:55,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give some new stuff for our faithful listeners too.

2054
02:40:55,593 --> 02:40:56,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back in two weeks live.

2055
02:40:57,295 --> 02:40:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for all the time off recently.

2056
02:40:59,217 --> 02:41:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally my fault, but I'm in it for the rest of the year.

2057
02:41:02,841 --> 02:41:04,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It just so happens that October is a crazy month.

2058
02:41:04,703 --> 02:41:05,264
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

2059
02:41:06,145 --> 02:41:06,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night, everybody.

2060
02:41:06,866 --> 02:41:08,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you in two weeks.

2061
02:41:08,973 --> 02:41:09,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio

2062
02:41:38,881 --> 02:41:39,705
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week!
