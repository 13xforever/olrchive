14039	15943	Tonight, February 1st, 2009.
16665	18670	Could Wii Photo Printing come to the US?
19031	23781	Gears of War PC breaks down and multiplayer comes to the next Bioshock game.
32264	32644	DarkSakura.com
57168	57669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
73544	76846	So yeah, she's been updating her Twitter.
76886	79848	If you follow DarkSakura on Twitter, she's been updating her Twitter pretty regularly.
79888	81589	It's basically the equivalent of help me.
82170	82970	Please send help.
83490	84451	I miss Wi-Fi.
84931	85332	Help me.
85912	89674	So joining us tonight, we have a different female perspective.
89815	92516	Say hello to the one and only Rice Princess.
93097	93617	Hello.
93797	94678	How are you doing, Rice Princess?
95238	95999	Oh, I'm all right.
96079	96719	How about you?
96939	97379	Not bad.
97439	97840	Not bad.
97940	101262	Are you caring about the Super Bowl that's going on right now as we're doing the show?
101790	103592	Resident Evil 5 Resident Evil 5
113942	116364	I've played all of the games.
116964	118725	Even 4 and 1?
119105	119405	All of them?
119845	120226	Yeah.
120306	124408	And if I were like a billionaire, I'd recreate the mansion.
124688	125348	How about the movies?
125369	126209	Are you a big fan of the movies?
126549	127910	I actually do like the movies too.
128090	128350	Yeah.
128730	129211	They're awesome.
129371	133453	I heard some rumor, I don't think it made the show roll tonight, some rumor there's a fourth one that's going to be made pretty soon.
134193	137015	Do you think it should keep going or do you think they need to pull the plug now?
137815	140257	It depends on where they take the story.
140978	147943	I don't know, because this last one that they came out with was an original story, and it was just, I don't know, it was alright.
148604	151066	If they go back to the game story stuff, that would be cool.
152127	154629	We'll also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
155189	156170	Lou, how you doing, Loki?
156630	158512	Fine, I'm trying to find the Transformers 2 trailer.
158972	164374	And apparently the link that we had in our chatroom, it's not working, or at least it works, but it's not playing.
164794	169396	I see the real reason why people watch the Super Bowl, the commercials and the movie trailers.
169416	179279	You know, if the smart people would realize that you can actually watch commercials before they come out on the Super Bowl, or at least for most of the trailers, well, not trailers, but commercials.
179579	181520	They actually have a website that had some.
181600	182540	I was watching them earlier.
182940	183361	They suck.
183761	187142	Well, some of them suck, but most of them were not good.
188171	188652	Regeneration
203526	207929	I do want to give a special shout out to the chatters tonight because they are here during the Super Bowl.
208129	212853	And so, you know, they're either football haters or they are very loyal listeners of Orange Lawn Radio.
212873	216535	We only have probably about, you know, there was no Bobby tonight to lead into our show.
216835	218076	He took the night off for the Super Bowl.
218156	222719	And we probably only have, between everything that's been going on, probably about a third of the usual listeners we have.
222799	226402	So I want to really thank those folks that were loyal and staying tuned tonight.
226822	232906	I also want to thank, joining us tonight in studio, say hello to Silent Nathan is here again.
235787	236987	No, seriously, how are you, Nathan?
237027	237627	How are you doing?
238207	238727	I'm fine.
238847	239907	I have a motorcycle.
240127	241288	You have a motorcycle?
241688	242928	What game do you have a motorcycle in?
242948	244068	Because I know you don't have one for real.
244588	246749	Because I would have wanted to ride in the sidecar.
247849	248809	World of Warcraft.
249249	249769	Nerd.
249949	250430	No, I'm just kidding.
252370	257191	Describe to the listeners what having a motorcycle means in World of Warcraft, and how exactly does it fit into the lore?
257972	266145	It goes vroom, vroom, vroom, and then you can make it jump, and it's lore-wise...
269093	269734	Who cares?
269754	270294	It's a motorcycle.
270315	270575	Who cares?
270595	271236	It's a motorcycle.
288516	292838	I'm Horde, so I usually have to kill the princesses and destroy the castles.
293698	298460	But yeah, it's at least 12,000 gold just for Vendormat.
298480	299521	So it's a lot of money.
299861	301562	Well, congratulations on your motorcycle.
302242	306044	One day I will come back to WoW and I will ride in your motorcycle in the sidecar.
306504	306964	It'll be fun.
307064	309485	You have to come back within a month, otherwise you can't.
311448	315570	But if I stay away for three months, then somebody can use the Scroll of Resurrection on me.
316211	318032	And that's the whole plan, actually.
318472	326476	You should actually cancel your account, start a whole new account, and we can be the leveling buddies and we'll get awesome mounts.
327037	327437	There you go.
329517	336541	Alright, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks in a segment we always like to start off the show with called, How was your gaming week?
336841	337821	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
337861	338582	How was your gaming week?
339442	342664	It was still not that eventful, but more eventful than last week.
343664	350348	More Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, still playing stuff, which is, you know, it's fun.
350388	354390	I'm looking forward to the new expansion they have coming out in the future.
354730	357452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
380954	382916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
407236	408477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
433678	436521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
455399	458780	So which, of course, that person posted that everywhere on the internet.
459160	466303	So now there is literally an official no DVD patch for the game.
467403	472485	So they've made it pretty easy to pirate the game, I guess.
472625	479087	Well, technically you're not supposed to be able to pirate it because you still have to authenticate it and the serial number and everything like that to play online.
480068	483549	But trust me, you don't really have to because it's
484048	484608	Thanks for watching!
503235	503595	XBOX 360
533098	534839	I would have to do a system restore to get a game to work.
552597	552917	Any game.
553017	555219	Even Crysis I had less trouble running.
555599	558822	And goddamn Crysis is a bitch to work.
559442	563585	And sadly enough, Crysis actually runs better than Grand Theft Auto 4.
563806	565087	So that's telling you something.
565167	571211	And trust me, Grand Theft Auto 4 is not... Crysis is definitely not pushing the graphics that Crysis was.
571331	573653	I think AcidicVampire in chat sums it up very well.
573713	575375	It's a love-hate relationship for Loki.
575855	577056	It is a love-hate relationship.
577436	578057	You love to hate it.
580018	580899	Anything else for your gaming week?
582080	582220	Um...
583931	587174	I have to ask for our spinoff show Orange Lounge Foodio.
587214	589557	You're pretty excited about the food you brought to the show tonight.
589597	592421	Can you tell our listeners about this fine new cuisine of yours?
593488	597769	It's not fine cuisine, but they have these new things at Burger King called Burger Shots.
598350	605752	And they're basically... Like when you first said the name, I was like, what popped in my head were the dessert shots from Applebee's and stuff.
605792	608013	I'm like, ew, that does not sound appetizing at all.
608073	609433	Putting a hamburger in a glass.
609753	613094	Yeah, putting hamburger and ketchup and mustard in a shot glass.
613355	614655	That's disgusting.
614675	614735	Ew.
614975	616856	No, they're sliders.
616896	619458	They're little mini hamburgers, basically.
619478	620078	You can buy them.
620659	622780	They have a two-pack and a six-pack.
622820	623961	Why would you want a two-pack?
624561	625602	You don't want to get fat?
625742	626122	I don't know.
627543	629284	But they're okay.
629504	630405	They're all right.
630765	635608	This is the second time I've had them, and it's just kind of okay now.
635668	637249	It's not as good as their normal burgers.
637410	640732	You don't have the smoky, flame-broiled taste to it.
640772	641892	But they're okay.
641912	642493	They're kind of neat.
643137	643597	DarkSakura.com
661989	663310	Tell us about your gaming week.
663370	664911	Back to gaming, Rice Princess.
665171	671074	Well, I'm going to play the demo of Resident Evil 5, and that's going to be my gaming week.
671734	672915	Because that's all you're going to play.
673695	677437	I might turn around and suddenly Rice Princess is gone, and so is my Xbox 360.
678938	682960	Or your PS3, because I wouldn't... I don't think they have the demo on PlayStation 3, actually.
682980	683300	Wait, what?
683621	685602	I thought it was on your PS3.
685762	686982	No, it's on my Xbox 360.
687022	687082	Aww.
688652	689292	I used to be like that.
709791	710592	I'm still like that.
710632	712194	And then there were a lot more games that came out.
713415	714296	And it was a lot cheaper.
714696	715837	I'm still going to play it.
716118	718660	I'm just going to put on gloves or something.
718680	720161	Just pretend it's something else.
720382	723284	I don't know why you have this rampant hate for Xbox, but whatever.
723705	726688	I'm like, Xbox hate is so like five years ago.
726928	728349	I mean, we're all kind of over it now.
728389	729931	It's just extreme dislike.
730031	730331	DarkSakura.com
752128	752348	All right.
753389	753669	Let's see.
753729	754370	My gaming week.
754470	756892	Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week.
756912	760375	Kind of a lot of the old stuff, you know, Fable 2 and same stuff I've been playing.
760815	768782	Next week, though, thanks to a very, very, very kind listener, I've got a code for Left 4 Dead now, so I'm going to be playing that on PC this week.
768802	769502	I'm very excited.
770883	798404	and to follow up a question that came up last week there is an Orange Lounge Radio Steam community out there and I was able to find it very easy by going into Steam and just searching for Orange Lounge in groups so I joined it so there's about like 30 some odd people in the Orange Lounge Radio Steam group so if you are a Left 4 Dead player you're listening to this show I encourage you to join our Steam group because I'll probably be playing Left 4 Dead and I want to play with listeners but you have to promise to be nice to me because I suck at first person shooters so even
798444	798924	Thanks for watching!
816909	817329	You never know.
817510	817850	Yeah.
837188	866159	Pirate server that you can play on for free and I'm okay with talking about it on the show because Sega kind of turns a blind eye to the whole thing because they turned their servers off a while ago so they just kind of let this thing run so it's interesting it's kind of tough to play because I can't do a lot of the quests because they're all in the Japanese text still but it's Phantasy Star Online and it's free so I can't complain I don't think I'll play it forever but ah memories wow how long ago did that come out?
866778	869243	Let's see, if the Dreamcast is about 10 years old, right?
869283	870406	Dreamcast came out in 1999, right?
872138	875420	I would say the first Phantasy Star Online is probably about 9 years old.
876080	876740	Holy crap.
876760	877781	I know, it's an old game.
878201	878621	I know.
878701	884024	But still, there's not a lot of action-based MMOs like that.
884764	886925	I can't even really call Phantasy Star Online an MMO, though.
887105	887945	I mean, it is and it isn't.
887985	892147	It's not an MMO like, wow, you go off, everything's like Instance.
893068	894869	It's more Guild Wars, I guess, than anything.
895229	896409	But it's not even like that.
896489	897730	It is pretty cool, though.
898090	898531	Yeah, I know.
898771	900753	It's really stood the test of time.
900893	904397	Even though a lot of people hate on Universe, I don't mind Universe.
904437	910863	I think I have Phantasy Star Online for my Dreamcast because I remember I always would play it offline.
910903	918071	I would never play it online because I had dial-up at the time, so it didn't really make.
918626	919867	That'd be kind of hard, yeah.
920007	923889	Well, I mean, they did have a dial-up modem in Dreamcast.
924869	931853	Well, apparently this server will let you connect the Dreamcast one, the PlayStation, wasn't there a PlayStation one?
931873	934514	I don't know, the GameCube one I know was on there, and the PC one.
934834	938036	You can connect all those together on this one server.
938716	939596	This is Blueburst, right?
940837	945319	You can use either the Blueburst client or the Dreamcast client, and it's episode one, two, and four.
945519	946400	You can play them all together.
947000	948121	So, which I thought was kind of cool.
948161	954064	Just not the Xbox one, because the Xbox one was through Xbox Live, and so there's no way you can play that anymore.
954864	960347	Because Sega shut down the server, and you can't really hack Xbox Live servers without a lot of problems.
960808	965410	Well, you can, but... Again, it's not something I think I'm going to play a long time.
965610	967531	It's just, you know, nostalgia is pretty cool.
968192	971634	Because, you know, honestly, the cave level gets so boring after a while.
972114	973114	It totally does.
973535	974895	Have you even played PSO?
975036	975236	No.
975476	975656	I see.
977543	978583	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1005792	1006975	Aw, poor Loki.
1007175	1008758	Well, everyone else had PlayStation.
1008798	1013266	You know, the only reason I had Dreamcast is because I wanted to accuse our all-nighter event.
1013626	1015409	I'm like, oh, okay.
1015429	1015690	Wow.
1017501	1018962	Hey, Dreamcast are still awesome.
1019282	1022985	I mean, because of the fact that you can boot, like, there's a lot of homebrew stuff for Dreamcast.
1023105	1030790	You know, I was actually, I'm looking to find a, because I'm not going to try to buy it.
1031330	1032211	Screw that shit.
1032911	1037054	I'm trying to find a copy of Super Runabout for the Dreamcast.
1037094	1041817	Because for some reason, like, I thought of this one game that I played before.
1041877	1044319	It's called Felony 1179 that was on the PlayStation 1.
1047602	1048805	and it's a pretty fun game.
1048846	1049427	It's kind of like...
1051530	1055511	Not really like Burnout, but it's a racing game where you're supposed to crash into a lot of stuff.
1055871	1057652	Like, cause a lot of property damage.
1058432	1062173	And as you'd play through the game, you'd unlock more cars, kind of like Burnout.
1062833	1067855	Like, ridiculous stuff, like, you know, meter-made cars, buses, and just all sorts of crazy stuff.
1068395	1073977	But Super Runabout was kind of the same game, same type of thing, and it was just really stupid fun.
1074477	1078578	That's a game they should really, you know, make a new one of, because you'd be left on Burnout with...
1079198	1079899	Collateral Damage.
1081843	1083907	I need to find that so I can play that again.
1084281	1086362	Quite a bit of Dreamcast love coming from our chat room.
1086382	1090583	We have Leo Shen saying, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my Dreamcast all the time.
1090603	1092063	I love that game so much.
1092083	1092923	Did you own a Dreamcast?
1093243	1096064	We did own a Dreamcast, yeah.
1096144	1102926	TGM-GS6, there's no easy way to pronounce that, says, I need to revive my Dreamcast so I can play Border Down.
1103446	1106867	They keep releasing these homebrew things every year for Dreamcast.
1107347	1110487	I was just thinking today, actually, while I was playing PSO, because it got me thinking about the Dreamcast.
1110507	1112268	The Dreamcast isn't even 10 years old yet.
1112288	1112528	Hmm.
1113268	1115729	It's not that old of a system, all things considered.
1115809	1119411	Still pretty interesting, all the things you can do on it.
1120351	1125594	Let me ask Silent Nathan real quick how his gaming week was, and then we'll move into tonight's news.
1125854	1126994	Silent Nathan, how was your gaming week?
1128535	1131516	It takes a long time to make enough gold to buy a motorcycle.
1133637	1134898	So wow wow and more wow?
1135638	1137959	See, enough said from Silent Nathan.
1138500	1138800	Alright.
1139987	1140388	Justin.tv.com.
1157784	1158664	So I want to say thank you.
1159304	1165788	The problem with it though, when we tried to hook it up, we were able to get video but no audio because the video and audio was separate on it.
1165888	1170050	So we thought it would be kind of lame to just have the video thing on Justin.TV.
1170431	1177194	So I have a cord coming that's going to fix our problems, but it's just not going to get here until this week sometime because it's coming from New Jersey.
1177594	1182557	So I'm really, really, really, really hoping we will be back up on Justin.TV next week.
1183078	1185299	And yeah, very excited about that.
1186039	1191347	Um, and then when you come over looking all pretty in the future, Rice Princess, it won't be for nothing, as you did a couple weeks ago.
1191367	1192328	Yay!
1192348	1192829	There you go.
1194251	1200019	Um, also, of course, there's no DarkSakura tonight, but she will be back next week on the program, and, uh,
1200845	1202988	No shows off or anything coming up for us.
1203068	1208095	We're just cranking right through up until our 7th anniversary this June, if you can believe it.
1210518	1212401	Possibly some conventions in our future.
1212541	1214544	I am toying with the idea of going to ASEN.
1214564	1217368	Do you know it's very cheap to fly out to Chicago right now on Southwest?
1217628	1218609	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1238971	1239472	I want to go.
1239492	1241233	I want to do the panel and the whole nine yards.
1241273	1242254	I think I'd have a lot of fun.
1242915	1244316	I'm sure DarkSakura wants to go.
1244416	1246218	Loki's wife probably won't let him go.
1246238	1247079	Well, I don't want to go either.
1248680	1250322	But who knows?
1251403	1251823	We will see.
1251863	1252383	I'm going to try.
1252403	1252864	I'm going to try.
1252884	1256647	Trust me, if I'm going to go to one show this year, it's going to be E3.
1257849	1258609	Yeah, E3.
1258669	1261132	You know E3 registration opened up this week, actually.
1261572	1263454	So we got to talk offline about that.
1264261	1265041	Thanks for watching!
1281388	1282329	Before the end of this year.
1284131	1286733	We were saying we're going to go originally to Seattle.
1288595	1290437	It's not really much that we really want to do in Seattle.
1290457	1291097	Go to Prosser.
1291138	1293500	That's where the party's at this weekend.
1293560	1298545	We were going to go to possibly LA to go to Disneyland, that kind of stuff.
1298605	1301968	It would be around her birthday, and her birthday is the 4th of June.
1302669	1304050	That's like the week before.
1304350	1305551	No, that is the week of E3.
1306272	1310716	E3 is like June 2nd through 4th, I'm not even kidding you.
1311537	1312918	Ah, fuck that.
1314259	1315821	Hold on, let me look.
1316141	1318003	I thought it was like the 13th or something.
1318023	1321285	Just be like, happybirthdaybabe, you get entrance into E3.
1321306	1322807	Look at all these video games I got you.
1322907	1326830	I got you a goodie bag from E3, yeah, June 2nd through 4th.
1327071	1327431	Ah, you ass!
1329969	1331831	Well, there's no way I'm going to E3 now.
1331911	1334812	We'll just be like, but babe, you can get a bunch of swag.
1334833	1337414	Yeah, that's not going to fly.
1337434	1339996	You can walk around a bunch of smelly nerds.
1340116	1341757	Yeah, that will not fly.
1343118	1346340	You should at least try to get down for one day, get back in time for her birthday or something.
1347298	1348139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1362589	1363009	I know.
1363069	1365230	Hey, you can pull some strings now.
1365291	1366331	You have connections, dude.
1366611	1367292	Oh, yeah, right.
1367552	1368192	No, seriously.
1368272	1371334	Like, back when we went in 2005, we were still kind of fledgling.
1371434	1372254	That's true.
1372274	1376316	But we also had friends that worked at a certain game company.
1376356	1376957	Different places.
1377017	1383620	I don't know if I should say, because I don't know if the game company knows that they inadvertently let us in E3, but we got those tickets.
1383640	1384181	Who cares?
1385081	1389343	We could bring our old badges from 2005 and be like, look, we went in 2005.
1389583	1393065	No, they specifically have made it like you have to reapply even if you went before.
1393145	1393445	I don't know.
1393525	1393765	Anyway.
1394105	1394405	Damn it.
1394526	1396186	We'll worry about that in the upcoming weeks.
1396206	1396887	We got time.
1397027	1397467	We got time.
1397487	1398367	We have at least till May.
1398808	1399048	All right.
1399128	1402229	Anyhow, we got to get into the gaming news tonight.
1402409	1404390	Loki, get us into some gaming news.
1404610	1410113	Yes, it's not that exciting, but we may be getting a new channel soon.
1410513	1411093	Apparently...
1413254	1414755	There is a trademark.
1415775	1417476	Well, this is, I think, coming to Europe first.
1417496	1430499	There was a trademark on the European Trademark Database that suggests that Nintendo is looking to bring its Digicam print channel to Europe and potentially elsewhere as the photo print service channel.
1431080	1438082	And basically what the Digicam print channel is in Japan is it's a service offered through Fujifilm.
1439063	1444583	That of course allows you to print photos that you save to an SD card and you can upload them.
1445538	1446438	Off Your Photo Channel
1470768	1473429	Yeah, I think it's kind of useless, but, you know, whatever.
1474109	1476590	New service is, you know, new.
1477790	1478470	That it is.
1479610	1480051	I guess.
1480131	1483351	Is that something, you know, you're a Nintendo fangirl, Rice Princess.
1483411	1484592	Is this something you'd want to use?
1484892	1485192	No.
1485472	1486052	No, no?
1486332	1488413	I have a printer at home.
1488573	1491694	But if I didn't, I might consider it.
1492514	1492934	All right.
1495215	1501693	Some other things coming to the future in Nintendo's world is the Wii Fit Body Check channel.
1501874	1502175	What?
1503208	1529840	The Wii Fit Body Check Channel It's going to be something that's launching on the Wii in April I guess what this game does, it uses your BMI data That's your body mass index that you get from Wii Fit And you get the step data from personal trainers walking pedometer This is in Japan, by the way, because I don't think we have that game here yet And you get some personalized guidance from health experts Walk more, fatty!
1531140	1531901	Stay healthy!
1533516	1534217	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1554471	1554831	Who knows?
1555212	1559094	I think Active Health might be the DS game.
1560215	1566240	Instead of Personal Trainer Walking, it's Active Health or some sort of... I don't know.
1566580	1571564	I could see it tying in with Wii Fit and stuff and maybe them doing an update to Wii Fit.
1572421	1573721	You know, incorporate data from that.
1594096	1594436	I guess.
1595897	1601339	What extra kind of tips are you going to get from these health professionals who don't even see you?
1603240	1605281	These games do nothing about your diet, do they?
1606441	1609603	If you really want to lose weight, it has to be an eating and exercise thing, right?
1610725	1612426	Everything I've ever heard said that.
1612727	1614328	You just have to eat less calories.
1614348	1617109	That's where personal trainer cooking comes into play.
1617470	1618510	Personal trainer cooking, mama?
1619011	1620231	No, personal trainer cooking.
1620411	1623654	And then they'll give you recipe ideas and stuff like that.
1624114	1630378	And then somehow your being fat will be attributed to your not being good at math.
1630458	1632939	And that's where personal training math will come into play.
1633360	1634721	No!
1634861	1636822	I knew that was the reason why I was fat.
1638283	1642065	Acidic Vampire in chat says, So, Nintendo is releasing this, but not Mother 3.
1643646	1644106	Jerks.
1644826	1645747	Just kidding, I live in Nintendo.
1645767	1647268	Well, is Mother 3 going to get you in shape?
1647368	1648148	No, I don't think so.
1649689	1650590	Think of the greater good.
1651010	1651830	Think of the children.
1651871	1654452	Would soccer moms be interested in Mother 3?
1654792	1655413	I don't think so.
1656493	1656953	Probably not.
1656993	1658434	But a personalized health coach?
1658614	1661396	That's what every soccer mom prays for before they go to bed.
1661816	1662216	Yeah.
1662256	1662857	So, we'll see.
1664212	1666173	Well, there's some pretty cool news.
1666493	1671896	This week they announced that there's going to be a sequel to Boom Blox coming out, Boom Blox Bash Party.
1672356	1675398	It's going to have some additional levels and some other fun stuff.
1675778	1680381	But what's also kind of neat is they announced... That sounds really close to Boom Blox Bachelor Party.
1681241	1682142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1701893	1720654	and there will not be any additional security measures as far as friends codes go but then again this is an EA game so you know maybe they're going to have that stupid way to sign up for like EA servers or something like that but still that's not friends codes and
1722652	1728057	It's interesting it's taken this long for somebody to finally defy the friend code system.
1728077	1734242	I think a lot of us thought it was impossible that if you wanted to do the online Nintendo thing, you had to do friend codes.
1734282	1740648	I think what makes this story notable is not necessarily who or what game is doing it, but the whole fact that it can be done.
1741127	1747612	Yes, and the other thing that's interesting, you might remember that there was that rumor before that there was going to be a major game that would not use friend codes.
1748212	1748673	Here it is.
1749373	1751054	Boom Blox is a major game?
1751775	1752575	It actually is.
1752796	1754257	It is a pretty major game.
1754357	1758460	It sold really well, the first one, and it's been a pretty fun puzzle game.
1758940	1761881	I'm telling you, though, the puzzle games need some tits in them.
1763421	1764302	Like Gal's Panic.
1764342	1765202	No, no, no, no, no.
1765462	1766802	I know I've gotten into this on the show before.
1766822	1767963	Now, Gal's Panic I fully approve of.
1768163	1768383	Me too.
1768403	1770403	But not all puzzle games need tits in it.
1770503	1773924	If you will remember, Bubble Bath Babes, not a good puzzle game.
1774925	1775605	Nobody bought it.
1775625	1776685	But it was a start.
1777185	1778886	You know, Rome wasn't built in a day.
1780562	1788987	They tried, and I don't know why that was never further explored, but why did Miss Nude World have to stop at 96?
1790008	1790628	I know.
1791528	1795571	And remember in Leisure Suit Larry they came out with one a couple years back?
1795751	1797812	I thought that did pretty well, didn't it?
1798072	1798212	No.
1798332	1799533	How did Leisure Suit Larry do?
1799553	1799593	No.
1800006	1803928	I don't know, but I thought that was like a cult franchise or something.
1803968	1804188	Really?
1804388	1804588	Yeah.
1804929	1820036	It's on hold right now because Sierra, which is part of Vivendi Universal, well, Vivendi Universal got bought up by Activision, and all their properties are kind of being sold off and redirected.
1820176	1822017	So it's still in the works.
1822077	1825439	I mean, it's supposed to be... Well, right now, I think we had it dated for...
1826750	1834314	April, but I don't think it's going to come out in April, but probably this year, and it's Leisure Suit Larry's box office bust.
1835795	1836275	Okay.
1836715	1843179	Because, see, this is the little, you know, Larry, and he has to help his uncle, Larry, who's the original Leisure Suit Larry, and...
1844466	1847067	and they're in Hollywood and oh, it's funny.
1847828	1850208	And there's like cartoony women with big boobs.
1851309	1853550	That'll have sex with him eventually.
1854690	1855290	They get drunk.
1855310	1858492	I was trying to find an audio clip of that song from Miss World New 96.
1858772	1860612	I know we used to have it years ago on this show.
1860652	1862413	Yeah, we've played it before.
1862633	1863533	I know, it's been years.
1864934	1867295	It fits the mood so well too for a puzzle game.
1867355	1870836	Anyhow, here's a puzzle game that's going to be coming to WiiWare.
1870936	1872857	It's Bubble Bobble on WiiWare.
1873157	1873897	I love Bubble Bobble.
1901828	1905271	The NES game pissed me off, especially when you had that special, was it level 99?
1905451	1909194	They had to do something special to get to the levels beyond that?
1909555	1910415	Well, here's the interesting thing.
1910435	1913358	It's going to be 400 stages in this new WiiWare version.
1913378	1913978	What the hell?
1914679	1921224	It's going to have a full recreation of the original Bubble Bobble, some higher difficulty levels if you are so inclined.
1921844	1922865	Here's the other cool thing, though.
1922885	1929851	Apparently the new WiiWare won four-player local co-op, because you might remember the original was only two, and a brand new enemy.
1931107	1933790	Just one, but a brand new enemy.
1934451	1937735	Apparently there's going to be download content for this game as well.
1937976	1939878	200 points a pop for the download content.
1940239	1942141	No word though how much the game itself is going to cost.
1942181	1943002	I imagine probably like $800.
1943643	1944604	$4 million!
1945986	1949710	But yeah, the download content will be 50 additional stages of high difficulty.
1950703	1952524	and a unique boss character in each one.
1953384	1955064	I think that they should go all out with this.
1955144	1964887	Release an external peripheral that you can attach to the Wii via USB and it would be a bubble blowing machine so that as you're playing the game it would blow bubbles at you.
1965768	1968068	I've seen those in Home on PlayStation 3.
1968189	1970289	Have you seen those?
1970429	1974791	Randomly in the mall on Home there's bubble blowing machines for no particular reason.
1975011	1978672	Every time you blow a bubble in the game there should blow another bubble out
1979372	1979753	at you.
1979973	1980934	I mean, that would be kind of funny.
1980954	1981615	That would be pretty awesome.
1981635	1983496	That would be very immersive if you did that.
1983516	1987541	That's like a whole 4D type of gaming I don't think has been explored yet.
1987721	1987861	Totally.
1987901	1990043	Like Bubble Bobble featuring real bubbles.
1990303	1992726	It's like Smell-O-Vision, but better.
1994047	1994488	I'd say.
1995409	1996810	You need to patent that idea, Loki.
1997571	1997991	Quick.
1998031	1998512	That's all right.
2000164	2005146	I don't think that I'm really going to get my feelings hurt if someone actually releases a bubble blowing machine.
2005307	2008348	Of course then, the bubble blowing machine, it breaks after 30 bubbles.
2008668	2009728	That's the downside to it.
2009888	2010829	That's ridiculous.
2010849	2011589	It's very limited.
2012489	2017712	Well, Nintendo revealed their launch schedule for the second quarter.
2017732	2018752	I have to read this comment.
2018792	2022834	I know I've been reading this guy a lot tonight, but the stuff he's been saying is funny.
2023434	2025815	Acidic Vampire says, Bubbles are fabulous.
2026235	2028116	Makes me feel like Amy Adams in Enchanted.
2029284	2030205	or Glenda the Good Witch.
2031326	2031786	Never mind.
2032466	2033367	Yeah, I get it.
2034068	2035609	Alright, read the damn next story.
2035829	2045216	Well anyways, not really, I mean, I guess the second quarter, but everything that they've announced so far for 2009, not a big surprise.
2045256	2047297	Japan, they've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.
2049018	2050379	They have a sequel to...
2053206	2057968	Well, what they call over there Famicom Wars, which is Advance Wars over here.
2058008	2061509	DS2 is coming out sometime in 2009.
2062449	2064470	There's going to be a Tomodachi Collection.
2064490	2065431	It's coming out in 2009.
2065851	2068812	New Picross game is coming out in March.
2069272	2073814	Mario & Luigi RPG 3, which is scheduled to come out over there.
2073834	2075454	Oh, finally an interesting sounding game.
2075474	2076095	February 11th.
2078467	2088780	and then on the Wii of course they've got their new play control games Mario Power Tennis coming out actually it's already come out over there that was January 15th
2091161	2099668	This week, there's another code, R, which is Trace Memory, is what they called it over here on the DS, but that's on the Wii now.
2101430	2105053	New Play Control, Metroid Prime, also Pikmin 2.
2105793	2110637	Metroid Prime's coming out in a couple weeks there, and Pikmin 2 in March.
2111578	2114200	Wii Sports Resort sometime in the spring.
2114320	2116002	Of course, that's going to be over here as well.
2118092	2120494	Sin and Punishment 2, of course, sometime this year.
2121074	2126637	Endless Ocean 2, Hoshino Kirby, Lion Attack Heroes.
2127238	2127958	That's a weird name.
2128559	2133141	Chibi-Robo, they're going to do a new play control for that in Metroid Prime 2 as well.
2134522	2136183	And then they have some really weird names.
2136303	2140046	Oh, Cosmic Walker, I guess that's a space version of Endless Ocean.
2140386	2141927	You're kind of space walking.
2142547	2148089	and then Dynamic Xan, Spurn Smashers and Punch Out.
2149070	2150330	So that's interesting.
2152251	2156313	Oh, that's the one game that had a lot of people excited previously was Punch Out.
2156453	2157793	Sometime it's going to be coming out.
2159334	2164296	And then, of course, in the U.S., some of the stuff's already been announced.
2164756	2167937	Fire Emblem, Shadow Dragon, that's going to be coming out in a couple weeks.
2168358	2169598	Pokemon Platinum in March.
2170178	2171479	Personal Trainer Walking.
2172099	2172859	Remember on the DS?
2173000	2177462	That might go in with a whole rumor there that that's actually going to come out over here, that update.
2178202	2180264	Coming out sometime in 2009.
2180604	2182044	Rhythm Heaven coming out sometime in 2009.
2183505	2185126	Actually, early April for that one.
2186067	2189509	Mario & Luigi RPG 3 coming out at some point.
2189589	2192190	I'm going to guess probably May for that.
2192350	2195092	How long does it freaking take to localize a game?
2195172	2196893	Rhythm Heaven's not coming out until April?
2196953	2198994	They were teasing that one at PAX last year.
2199894	2202615	April 5th, whatever.
2203335	2207797	And then the DSi sometime spring or summer of 2009.
2208637	2211038	So that April rumor might actually come true.
2211618	2217080	And then on the Wii, we've got Mario Power Tennis coming out in March as well as Pikmin.
2217400	2219361	Those are both coming out actually I think the same day.
2219881	2222402	Wii Sports Resort sometime in the first half of the year.
2222602	2224303	Punch-Out also in the first half of the year.
2224383	2227444	So probably Wii Sports.
2227464	2227744	I'm going to
2229574	2232255	Walk With Me, Do You Know Your Walking Routine?
2252952	2254773	Which comes with two activity meters.
2254793	2257054	At least it wasn't Twin Peaks Firewalk with me.
2257114	2258595	Do you know your firewalking routine?
2259976	2262177	They're getting Mario & Luigi RPG as well.
2262577	2266920	Pokemon Platinum sometime in the first half of the year.
2266940	2267480	Who killed Laura Palmer?
2267500	2269241	You better moonwalk to find out.
2269581	2272223	Kirby Superstar Ultra is also coming out over there.
2272343	2275324	And then DSi Hardware sometime spring or summer.
2275805	2279166	And then of course they're getting almost the same stuff as far as the...
2280487	2283650	Play Control Games, Pikmin coming out February.
2284211	2286494	That's surprising that they get Pikmin way before us.
2287515	2289797	Mario Power Tennis is coming out in March.
2290197	2291939	Fire, walk with me.
2293641	2294182	Stop it.
2295478	2300562	Punch Out the First Half of the Year, New Play Control Pikmin Sorry, I just don't give a shit about Nintendo right about now.
2300903	2311431	Wii Sports Resort is coming out in 2009, right in the first half, and Sin and Punishment 2, another code R, so they're getting another code, and Endless Ocean 2 also coming out over here.
2311792	2315375	I'm guessing anything that will probably have some more stuff that's unannounced.
2315555	2318077	Obviously they haven't announced what they're going to be talking about yet.
2318958	2323682	E3 and just a thought, probably not going to be interesting.
2328740	2344673	I don't know, I guess there's a couple Unless they announce Excite Truck 2 in which case I will give them I will apologize for everything I've said but unless there's an Excite Truck 2 that's really the only stipulation Excite Truck 2 or they can get the hell out
2347148	2347809	DarkSakura.com
2363424	2363644	Nintendo DS!
2363664	2363924	Nintendo DS!
2389364	2393528	and defacing property at Nintendo World in New York City.
2394008	2394509	That's right.
2394609	2405219	That's how they decided to get back at Nintendo for not sending Bob a development kit is that he got some of his friends together who, for some strange reason, look like a bunch of foreign tourists that were probably recruited.
2405239	2406120	Did you see the picture of Bob?
2406920	2407441	When they showed him?
2407461	2408061	In the very beginning.
2408081	2409002	In the beginning of the video.
2409082	2409663	Yeah, I saw him.
2410123	2411243	Isn't he look like a tool?
2411283	2417285	He just, he does just kind of, he does, yeah, he just, he looks like an asshole.
2417605	2419405	I mean, honestly.
2419646	2420146	I don't know.
2420566	2426267	But, um, you just, yeah, you see these girls are going into the Nintendo World store and everybody's filming things going on here.
2426287	2427608	I don't know why they didn't call security.
2427928	2431949	But they tape posters to the side of the store that say Bob's Game.
2432529	2436970	And they end up, I don't know, handing out flyers to all these people, just interrupting this
2437170	2438251	Being generally rude.
2438271	2441674	They slip in business cards into a bunch of the different games.
2442134	2446358	They put mock boxes up onto the shelves.
2446778	2448940	And they just basically generally harass people.
2448980	2450342	And just act like assholes.
2450802	2451082	Really.
2451142	2453825	If Jamie was here, she'd be having a field day right now, honestly.
2453885	2454826	Oh, my God.
2454886	2456187	I can't even imagine.
2456227	2458088	Let me add that, okay?
2458449	2462833	For one, Bob's Game, great that you made a game all by yourself.
2462913	2463813	Congratulations.
2463853	2464314	You know what?
2464834	2476489	Lots of people have done that, and they have taken their game online, whatever, and we don't really hear too much about it, but the fact is, just because you made a game by yourself does not mean it needs to be played.
2476509	2478932	Look at that, he just dumped a bunch of business cards on the floor.
2479573	2480514	What an ass.
2482675	2486397	I gotta know what the chatroom thinks about this.
2486457	2489038	And then let me say the other thing.
2489158	2492560	His game does not look good, and trust me, he doesn't seem that creative.
2492940	2493921	Bob's game?
2494601	2494961	Really?
2495142	2496162	Is that what you're gonna call it?
2496402	2497263	Bob's game?
2497743	2498163	I'm sorry.
2498603	2503266	I know there is a game actually coming out by Graffiti Entertainment.
2503286	2504306	They're the ones publishing it.
2504706	2506287	It is a game called Black Sigil.
2507328	2511230	I forget what it was originally called, but it was a homebrew DS...
2512110	2512831	Game Boy Advance
2540928	2546213	I think, you know, his game could probably get published by the same company if he really tried, but he's an asshole.
2546694	2550217	And honestly, you know, at first I felt bad for him because he couldn't get development kit.
2550417	2551298	I don't give a shit now.
2551338	2554822	I think he's an asshole and I fucking, his game looks like shit.
2555142	2561228	It looks like something made with like the old RPG maker and it really does not look good at all.
2561328	2564391	I would not buy this game, especially after all this shit he's been pulling.
2564691	2582729	SSJ100 Matt in our chat says fucking douchebag even if his game came to the DS I wouldn't buy it GS68 says for fuck's sake look at Pixel or Nigero or whatever they don't get paid for their shit and they don't care and says this should be an OLR stupid award of the year and Acidic Vampire says he's being a whiny little bitch
2583373	2584134	He pretty much is.
2584174	2586015	What is he hoping to accomplish by doing all this?
2586035	2586335	For real!
2586516	2591179	I mean, do you think anybody at Nintendo, like executives, is actually going to hear about this?
2591199	2591300	Oh my!
2591320	2592460	You're doing all of this stuff!
2592541	2594802	We should publish, or, you know, put your game out.
2594822	2595383	Oh, I know!
2595423	2597845	It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.
2597925	2600167	He's probably going to release it as a ROM or something.
2600767	2602788	And still no one's going to download it.
2602808	2604749	He put the video on the internet.
2604769	2606390	Do you know how stupid that is?
2606770	2615154	Because now there's video out there of you essentially vandalizing the property and making the scene here at the Nintendo World Store or whatever.
2615774	2617815	You don't think they might come after you?
2618916	2624538	I want you, Miyamoto, to come out with the Master Sword and just chop them in half.
2625479	2626259	That'd be awesome.
2627027	2629509	I'm sorry, this guy does not need any more of our time.
2629529	2631830	And to be honest, I don't give a shit if your game ever gets published.
2632570	2637353	And really, release it in the homebrew community or something like that, because you know what?
2638033	2639494	I don't think anyone's going to give a shit.
2639554	2640955	The game doesn't look that great.
2641075	2645277	Okay, it has all this gameplay and stuff in it, but it doesn't look that good.
2645857	2646658	It really doesn't.
2646838	2648759	There's no reason that this should be published.
2648979	2653040	GameGuru in chat says, Bob's been blackballed from the video game industry.
2653100	2653680	And you know what?
2654100	2659742	I think the blogs need to stop giving this guy any attention at all.
2659842	2660762	We should too.
2662402	2662682	Go ahead.
2663022	2665823	He's a dickface and he's a crappy game developer.
2666143	2666923	The end of the story.
2667183	2667883	Let's move on.
2668224	2673145	I just want to say though, I want to put a request out there to the OL Army.
2673225	2678086	If you see this guy getting any more coverage on blogs out there or whatever, please...
2679065	2684126	Leave a comment, email the blog, and ask them to please stop giving this guy attention.
2684366	2685046	It starts here.
2685366	2685766	No more.
2685886	2688147	Bob Chat is banned from Orange Lounge Radio.
2688447	2690427	I don't ever want to hear about this stupid idiot again.
2690487	2694768	And I hope to hell his thing gets him in trouble and whatever.
2695288	2697949	And if you see him on the street, you should kick him in the junk.
2700649	2701950	I think so.
2702610	2708051	So the OLR banishment of Bob begins here and now with our favorite segment.
2723226	2725368	Loki would you like to start us off with the FUs of the week tonight?
2738464	2738865	DarkSakura.com
2757805	2783090	so what you're one person that you made a game oh my god you're the first person on earth to make a game before there's a lot of people that make games by themselves you know and they put it out on the atari and shit like that that's how the whole fucking game industry worked it's how it became um just because you're one dude that makes the game doesn't mean like the nintendo has to give you a dev kit because you think you're awesome that you did what one person you know
2783897	2784457	DarkSakura.com
2805576	2806776	Rice Princess, your FUs.
2833305	2846983	Fuck you to Lieutenant Felix Gata I don't know who the fuck you think you are but you just pissed off a whole lot of people and I hope you fucking die and that's it I feel so sorry for that actor
2847699	2849160	No, I'm sure he's a great actor.
2849240	2851061	He did a lot of voice work for Ranma.
2851081	2853242	You know there's people that don't know how to tell the difference though.
2853282	2854062	Yeah, I know.
2854222	2855423	I'm not like crazy.
2855543	2857664	I just don't like him as a character.
2858204	2860726	But I hope he fucking gets airlocked or some shit.
2860746	2864267	That must be like the first gay guy you've like really just wanted to beat up.
2864287	2865328	Yeah, I do.
2865488	2866088	Oh my god.
2866429	2867769	I would never be his hag.
2867789	2871851	I'd be like, go fuck yourself out of an airlock.
2871971	2872271	I don't know.
2872732	2874172	But yeah, I'm mad at him.
2874232	2874613	All right.
2876025	2878327	Does Silent Nathan have any FUs of the week, or is he sleeping?
2879328	2881850	No, he's shaking his head no, a simple no.
2882731	2883011	Alright.
2885374	2885814	That's it.
2886435	2890238	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, you don't see Aaron from Snake360 pulling that crap.
2890258	2890758	That's true.
2891690	2894171	I mean, there's so many great ways for folks together.
2894331	2895231	He's nice.
2895411	2896151	I'm serious, though.
2896171	2899072	That guy is not the only guy that's programmed a game by himself.
2899552	2908095	Hell, there's been people that have made, I think, a whole anime movie by themselves, and you don't hear them bitching and stuff, and their movie gets made and looks fucking awesome.
2909015	2915921	And I do want to clarify for the chat room because they were asking, even though Bob is banned from OLR, you can still say Bobby Blackwolf.
2915981	2916601	That's okay.
2917842	2919764	You can say it as part of a bigger word.
2919784	2920164	It's fine.
2920184	2921966	Just Bob as far as Bob's game.
2922886	2926309	There might be a CEO or something of some company named Bob, but that's all right.
2926409	2929772	And if Bobby Blackwolf makes a game, you can call it Bobby's game.
2929972	2930432	That's right.
2930453	2933075	You can shorten it to Bob's game, but that doesn't really work.
2933755	2933976	Oh my god!
2933996	2934617	LittleBigPlanet!
2948243	2948883	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2972797	2977638	It's a rope backwards!
2978098	2984179	For those that don't know what the Snuggie is, we have to talk about this for a minute because this is important.
2984679	2985639	The hell with video games.
2985719	2987740	I want one of these for when I play video games.
2988060	2990420	Buy a rope and turn it backwards!
2990680	2991160	Done!
2991400	2995621	The Snuggie is a blanket, but it has sleeves on it.
2996061	2999201	Because you know how sometimes your arms are just like they're under the blanket.
2999221	3001402	And you can't pull them out and do things.
3001422	3002522	No, because then your arms get
3002642	3003543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3025836	3026356	DarkSakura.com
3041008	3041649	And guess what?
3041709	3044531	It's not a fucking Snuggie that probably costs a lot of money.
3045091	3047533	And they ripped off the Snuggie off of some other guy.
3047553	3048774	The Slinket.
3049034	3050135	The Slinket, yeah.
3050636	3052057	Well, then I'll buy a Slinket.
3052097	3053478	I don't give a shit what the name is.
3053498	3054959	I just want a blanket with sleeves.
3054999	3056020	I think it's a brilliant idea.
3056080	3058462	Did you see the What the Fuck Blanket, the parody?
3058522	3059382	Yes, I saw that.
3059422	3061944	You posted it on your live show or whatever.
3062104	3063846	Yeah, that's like the best thing ever.
3064482	3068423	And while we're at it, CashForGold.com is a complete rip-off.
3069124	3073965	If anyone can't figure that out, I mean, yeah, you send us your gold first.
3074105	3075826	Then we'll tell you how much it's worth.
3075926	3078427	Yeah, we'll wait for you and everything.
3078447	3079187	We'll give you a top...
3079807	3080347	Thanks!
3080388	3081769	We'll give you a top dollar for it.
3081849	3085111	Oh, and by the way, if you want your gold back, it's already melted down, so too bad.
3085131	3087132	Tired of using regular blankets like this asshole?
3087353	3089314	Do they somehow destroy your heating bills?
3089654	3091836	Do you struggle when trying to figure out how to put them on?
3092176	3095398	Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?
3095959	3098841	Well, morons, now there's hope with the new What The F*** Blanket.
3099001	3101303	The blanket that'll ruin your sex life.
3101983	3102764	That's on YouTube.
3103684	3104365	She looks like a monk.
3106803	3117226	I think I actually posted a reply on Rice Princess' live journal with a picture of one of the happy, happy cultists because it just reminded me because they talk about how it looks like a cult robe or whatever.
3117986	3124907	Somebody actually replied, my parents bought one for everyone in the household.
3125888	3127468	That shit is on the ground in the corner.
3129215	3130316	Where it belongs.
3130676	3131697	I like that idea.
3131797	3132277	Give it to me.
3132297	3133278	Don't let it sit in the corner.
3133338	3133518	I know.
3133558	3134879	I was like, you should give it to Rob.
3134939	3136160	He'd use it, I guess.
3136881	3137241	All right.
3137641	3140663	Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.
3140903	3146287	Sorry for the... The only thing that I don't like about the robe, though, is it conducts a lot of static electricity.
3146528	3148589	Like, a lot of static electricity.
3150250	3151071	And it's not funny.
3152082	3153183	and what about the ShamWow?
3153203	3154363	That guy's annoying too.
3154783	3157004	But that's an actual product that's good.
3157385	3158485	Well, I've never used it.
3158565	3158985	I don't know.
3159005	3160986	Whatever happened to Silit Bang?
3161266	3162947	Silit Bang or the Magic Bullet.
3162967	3164308	It's like Orange Glow or something.
3164328	3165368	Alright, enough, enough.
3165588	3166609	Games, video games.
3166809	3167609	Games, games, games.
3168090	3170311	Anyways, Gears of War PC.
3171371	3177055	Apparently if you have it, it's not working right now because there was a little problem.
3177115	3181878	Apparently there is a Verisign code that has expired.
3183159	3187542	And because it expired, the game will not work past the date January 28th.
3187843	3193126	So if you want to play it, you have to set your date back to before the 28th and then it will work just fine.
3194187	3198130	Epic is aware of the situation and is working on a way to fix it.
3199502	3200822	So soon it'll be fixed.
3200882	3202863	But right now it's a minor inconvenience.
3204143	3205163	Super.
3205183	3207983	That's a pretty fucking big inconvenience, actually.
3208023	3211264	What if you just got this game in the bargain bin at a store or something?
3211664	3214885	Then you would go online, read about it, and set your date back to before the 20th.
3214905	3216465	What if I'm not smart enough to do that?
3217045	3218285	Well, then, too bad.
3218385	3223226	Then you go back and take it back to Walmart and go, this game no work, and then they'll give you your money back.
3223286	3224426	Can you give me a Snuggie instead?
3225006	3228227	That's right, I'm going to go take back my copies of Gears of War PC and get a Snuggie.
3230216	3231317	Gears of War Snuggie
3248069	3256352	But with sleeves, Loki, you're missing the point It needs sleeves I have an idea Why don't you get pajamas?
3257893	3265516	Or a jacket Or a robe Pajamas make me feel old Or like some socks What are you saying about pajamas, okay?
3265916	3268777	I have a pair of flannel pajamas that are fucking comfortable, okay?
3269137	3270878	And they're warm And they're warm
3271610	3279732	Alright, look, Gears of War didn't just make the mistake of not making a Snuggie out of their collection or flubbing the PC version of the game.
3280273	3288315	Apparently, also, the Gears of War 2 Gold Lancer went up on Xbox Live for everybody earlier this week.
3288355	3292136	This was something you were only supposed to get if you actually got the collector's edition of Gears of War 2.
3292836	3294797	And when I say Gold Lancer, I don't mean a car.
3295357	3296297	It's the type of gun.
3296337	3297878	It's the type of gun that you use in the game.
3297898	3298058	Boom!
3299578	3303720	Although that would be pretty awesome if you suddenly could use cars to run over the monsters.
3304941	3306462	And here's the other interesting thing about it.
3306502	3317207	According to a representative for Xbox Live, everybody who actually got the Gold Lancer during the period that it was available, they're going to have the item removed from the game in an upcoming fix.
3317487	3317987	Right.
3318028	3323550	Just like they said the Fable 2 exclusive code or whatever for people to have the collector's edition.
3323850	3326712	We're going to find out who doesn't have the collector's edition.
3326752	3328293	We're going to take it away from you.
3328993	3329794	Yeah, that never happened.
3330855	3337780	Apparently, also, the way they fixed this temporarily, they put the Gold Lancer... I mean, they weren't able to remove the Gold Lancer from Xbox Live Marketplace.
3338100	3345226	Apparently, it was still there late last week, but it was being charged a price of 99,999 Microsoft points.
3345266	3346287	They do that.
3346447	3350270	It was like that before, because they actually have that available, and then there's also some map
3350790	3351771	Thanks for watching!
3377274	3380875	You'll be able to download it onto your system or something like that.
3380935	3382035	Something that would be exclusive.
3382375	3386276	They did this originally with... There was also the Banjo-Kazooie thing.
3386816	3389457	The Xbox Live Arcade game that was available only for a limited time.
3389817	3394678	However, they caught that too and they also put it like $9.99 as the amount for it.
3394718	3399159	You have to wonder if anybody spends the $150,000 or whatever it would take to get it anyway.
3399459	3405140	Well, there are people that buy stupid iPhone programs that cost thousands of dollars just to have a stupid gem on there.
3405780	3406080	Wow.
3407455	3409657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3426306	3427246	I don't know, objects in there.
3427266	3432448	They have a little slime object that's kind of angry-looking and a cross that looks angry.
3432769	3433949	It's a whole lot of angry stuff.
3434009	3438411	Actually, it's like in Super Mario Bros., how everything has a smiley face on it.
3438651	3442012	Everything has an angry face in this game, so that's interesting.
3442472	3445454	Some other games, of course, that are going to be coming as well.
3446214	3448955	The Crystal Defenders, which of course was originally a mobile game.
3449735	3450476	Some other stuff...
3452602	3453323	Thanks for watching!
3473746	3478250	Yeah, I wonder if they're still making money on that, you know what I mean?
3478290	3479110	Nah, I doubt it.
3479671	3483354	I mean, it's kind of free money at this point if they do have anybody playing it.
3483394	3489599	I mean, I'm sure it takes like one server to run the whole thing, but, you know, they could release that as like a $10 Xbox Live arcade game.
3489619	3492742	They wouldn't even have to charge a monthly fee, and they'd still make a pretty penny off it.
3492902	3495704	They had a game, and I can't remember what the hell it was called.
3495784	3500868	It was, and I'm not even sure if it actually came out, but it was for, I think, the PlayStation 2.
3501589	3502450	Might have been the PlayStation 1.
3503946	3532323	and it was on a demo disc that was I think it was a Playstation 1 now if I remember correctly it was on a demo disc with like I want to say maybe it would have been Final Fantasy 7 there might have been some other stuff on there as well and it was a street racing RPG but I don't remember what it was called though but I remember it had racing in it and it was from Square Enix but that would be another cool game to bring out
3534022	3534402	Who knows?
3534622	3534982	Who knows?
3535883	3540184	And I'm sure there'll be some type of Final Fantasy milking at some point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
3540204	3543805	Well, they do have Crystal Defenders, which is a Final Fantasy game, so... Alright, I guess there is that.
3544626	3553209	Hey, if you are downloading a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for popular role-playing games, perhaps you've checked out some of the content for Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
3553849	3559233	And Bethesda actually put out a list this week of what some of the top downloaded Oblivion content is.
3559813	3566698	And funny enough, the top downloaded content is Wizards Tower is the number one most downloaded content that they have.
3567639	3570261	Knights of the Nine is all the way down to number seven.
3570341	3571722	Shivering Isles, number eight.
3572202	3575265	But what's interesting, I mean, because those are pretty expensive if I remember right.
3575505	3579828	But what's interesting, remember all the shit that Bethesda used to get for the horse armor?
3580448	3582210	Remember the horse armor download they put?
3582850	3584892	Apparently that content's all it was.
3585493	3590297	Whereas all this other content I'm mentioning is new levels, new areas to explore, new quests and stuff.
3591418	3593900	Horse armor was just armor for your horse.
3594401	3595622	And it was just a visual thing only.
3595662	3596503	It did nothing special.
3597063	3600026	And they actually charged a lot of money for this.
3600506	3602628	At the time, it was an insane amount.
3602668	3603008	I don't remember.
3603049	3603929	How much was horse armor?
3604029	3605731	It was like five bucks, I think.
3605891	3607271	for stupid armor for your horse.
3607832	3610613	Well, the thing is, that checks in at number nine.
3611753	3614914	And they claim they still sell some horse armor every day.
3616114	3616594	Wow.
3616755	3618135	Still, even after all this time.
3618815	3621996	Fighter Stronghold is the dead last entry.
3622336	3623537	You want to hear something off the top ten list?
3623557	3628018	You can get Elder Scrolls Oblivion, the Game of the Year edition with the expansion on it.
3629078	3629439	20 bucks.
3630219	3630579	Not bad.
3631618	3632739	I'm thinking about buying it again.
3633199	3633959	For PlayStation 3?
3634720	3635140	Fuck that.
3636180	3638742	I didn't catch which system it was on.
3639362	3640443	Game of the Year edition is on both.
3641523	3642044	Both of them are $20 now.
3643188	3644708	Fighter Stronghold is dead last.
3644968	3650050	Apparently, though, that could be because this thing only ranks the bot download and pay for it.
3650090	3651830	And Fighter Stronghold was free for a little while.
3651870	3652530	That's why I have it.
3653110	3656471	So probably a lot of people grabbed it when it was free and they never needed to get it again.
3656671	3663913	I have an Xbox Magazine disc that actually has two of those on there that were paid download content for free.
3664918	3665439	If you want them.
3665679	3667441	I don't know if you still play Oblivion, but you know.
3667841	3669784	There's just so much to do in Oblivion.
3669844	3672206	I mean, God, even without the expansions, I felt like they can't.
3672226	3677953	I mean, literally, you can just walk around the world and just walk into random ass dungeons and explore them.
3677993	3679935	I mean, there was just so much in that game.
3680396	3680876	It's crazy.
3680896	3681837	I can't wait for the next one.
3682618	3684780	Thank you for watching!
3699933	3707436	Well, Raiden Fighter Aces, I believe, came out in Japan, and it's rumored to be coming out over here as well.
3707576	3712658	Raiden Fighter Aces actually is a collection of three different Raiden Fighter games.
3712818	3719200	They have Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighters Jet, all on one disc.
3720041	3725443	Well, the rumors are that Zoo Games is actually publishing the game in the U.S.
3726083	3726443	for $29.99.
3728783	3730744	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3755259	3757821	No, these are coming out in the US.
3758081	3758722	And what platform?
3759262	3760063	Xbox 360.
3760183	3760603	There you go.
3761544	3765707	And yeah, Raiden 4 will be coming out at the end of March.
3766247	3766507	Nice.
3767788	3770050	I'm sure there will be a lot of people that are very interested in that.
3770530	3774173	Also some folks interested in everything Banjo-Kazooie related.
3774233	3775434	There's Banjo-Tooie.
3775954	3780938	Banjo-Tooie is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade apparently a little later this year.
3781398	3785462	Probably about 1,200 Microsoft points, although that hasn't been confirmed yet.
3786403	3787924	But it is confirmed.
3788205	3788985	It is coming out.
3789446	3792709	It's slightly upped graphics and upped frame rate as well.
3793289	3796032	And Stop and Swap is coming over.
3796352	3804299	Apparently this is something from the Nintendo 64 days where if you got some items in Banjo-Kazooie, they will show up in Banjo-Tooie as well.
3804420	3804540	So,
3805040	3809742	Not too big of a surprise since I'm assuming the first one did pretty well for them and the game was already done.
3809762	3814925	They just have to do some upgrades and sell it all over again for $15 and people will buy it.
3815085	3817086	Where there's horse armor, there's Banjo-Tooie.
3820848	3830013	Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but you know, there's a lot of people who love the Banjo series and I'm sure excited to play it all over again with the updated graphics and widescreen and all that stuff, so good for them.
3830370	3836013	Yeah, well, if you're not waiting for Banjo-Tooie, there are some other things coming out this week.
3837053	3839654	That might be something you want to pick up.
3839854	3842015	I don't know, not a whole lot this week, unfortunately.
3844056	3845817	Starting things off, let's see.
3846597	3851900	We have, for the Wii, Rygar Battle of Argus.
3853441	3853701	Yay.
3853721	3853781	Yay.
3854386	3867169	I don't know, it's a port of the Playstation 2 game and then they've added like some Colosseum levels or something like that so yay, a port of something that came out like what five years ago?
3867449	3881712	yeah, it was a while ago so that'll be coming out and then this week I know there's some miscellaneous DS games like some Imagine crap um
3883290	3887112	Imagine crapping.
3887252	3891494	It's really pathetic, the lineup this week, I swear.
3892695	3895016	Could that be because we have Street Fighter 4 coming out the week after?
3895376	3896036	Or is that two weeks?
3896176	3896856	It's two weeks.
3897697	3898077	Two weeks.
3898337	3900158	Actually, the week after would be Fear 2.
3901959	3903520	Oh, there's people definitely excited about that.
3903540	3904140	That's for sure.
3904860	3907021	Street Fighter 2 is next week in Japan.
3907601	3908542	But I'll get to that in a minute.
3910596	3912057	Are you done with the US dates?
3914559	3916801	This list I'm looking at is not very accurate.
3916881	3918262	It actually doesn't even have next week.
3918802	3920063	It just skips over next week.
3920083	3921484	That's how pathetic next week is.
3923045	3931491	I'm trying to think if there's... I think Tenchu Z... Tenchu 4 on the Wii is coming out, I believe, as well.
3932291	3933652	I can't remember if that got delayed or not.
3956442	3959664	Actually, Capcom typically releases stuff in the first quarter.
3961004	3965046	Actually, this year they're releasing stuff first quarter and second quarter, which is good.
3965406	3969547	But they are pretty smart to do so because there's not much competition this time of year.
3969788	3971948	Although this year there's pretty good stuff coming out.
3972509	3974189	But yeah, not too much.
3974429	3975690	This next week is really dead.
3975830	3983153	So we'll wait for the week after that where we actually get into the meat of things and it'll start picking up from there all the way through March.
3984440	3985941	Alright, let's talk about Japanese release dates.
3985981	3988762	Luckily it looks a little better over there for the Japanese release dates.
3988962	3992363	On the Xbox 360, Burnout Paradise, the ultimate box set, makes its way.
3992463	3995405	And I'm assuming that's just all the special download stuff we got here.
3996225	4002668	It's the Burnout plus the ultimate party thing that they've got that's going to be a download next week.
4002708	4004228	Basically all the extra crap.
4004248	4007690	You can get that in Japan this week on February the 5th for the Xbox 360.
4007830	4010411	Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles comes out on the 5th.
4011271	4015135	If you head over to the PlayStation, it's racing fun on the Xbox 360 this week.
4015175	4019759	By the way, Street Fighter 4 is next week, but I'll remind you about that next week.
4020199	4025343	On the PlayStation 3, Burnout Paradise, The Ultimate Box, also there, as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles.
4025363	4031629	You also get Shaun White Snowboarding, and Demon's Souls is a game that's coming out from Sony on the PlayStation 3.
4033190	4034231	What are you laughing at over there?
4034742	4037063	and Demon's Souls.
4037343	4039285	It's apparently a pretty big release.
4039345	4040965	It's an RPG coming out.
4041546	4044868	Demon's Souls!
4045008	4045508	Shut up.
4047472	4049774	For that, I'm not going to tell you anything more about Demon's Souls.
4049914	4052017	It will forever be a mystery.
4052357	4054879	It's an RPG made by Sony.
4055600	4061987	On the Nintendo Wii, another code are Kyoku no Tobira is coming out from Nintendo.
4062167	4064169	D-Terminal and AV Cable.
4064329	4064829	That's right.
4064889	4067752	If you need a new AV Cable, you can get that this week.
4068173	4069254	D-Terminal is pretty cool.
4072216	4078601	Well, the D-terminal is cool because, I mean, you know, if you want to hook it up to a PC monitor, that's the only way you can do it, really.
4079182	4082825	I got to say, though, this Another Code R game actually sounds kind of cool.
4083205	4084386	Is this just Lost in Blue?
4084826	4085847	No, this is Trace Memory.
4086167	4087108	Oh, it's Trace Memory.
4087328	4089270	Oh, okay, because I got confused when I looked at the thing.
4089910	4091412	This game actually sounds kind of cool.
4092012	4094894	You know what's weird is I thought that game has been out for a while.
4094914	4095715	No, it's just coming out again.
4095735	4098818	Because I've seen it floating around for a while, but, you know, I could be wrong.
4099578	4100639	I'm even thinking of the DS version.
4100919	4101440	I think you are.
4101540	4101980	I think you are.
4102600	4105122	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, nothing.
4105222	4108165	There's one game getting a price reduction, Momotaro Densetsu 16.
4108705	4110606	That's it, and nothing else is new.
4111407	4112608	Nintendo DS is a little different.
4112628	4123876	There is some new stuff coming out, but it's mostly like covers and pouches and things like that, but there is a game called Destiny Links coming out from Bandai Namco, and it's an RPG, of course, and...
4125307	4129580	You get your character and you sail forth to Amazia, the island of happiness.
4129740	4131947	Well, that sounds like a destiny I want.
4135331	4136071	DJ Max Fever DJ Max Fever
4160220	4161401	Hey, let's go to Europe real quick.
4161441	4164062	Since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll go ahead and read the Europe dates for you.
4164623	4167384	Actually, Japan and the U.S.
4167424	4170425	were kind of slow, but Europe has a big week ahead.
4170505	4175488	For February 6th, they're getting Burnout Paradise on the PC, Castlevania Order of Ecclesia on the DS,
4175728	4179130	Chrono Trigger finally hits on the DS for those folks in Europe.
4179611	4180651	Gauntlet on the DS.
4180791	4182373	Lost in Blue 3 on the DS.
4182993	4184974	New Play Control Pikmin comes out on the Wii.
4185735	4188116	Raven Squad hits the Xbox 360 and PC.
4188497	4191759	Rise of the Argonauts hits PS3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4192339	4193940	Shellshock 2...
4195021	4195802	Fucking tongue twister.
4195822	4199605	Shellshock 2 Blood Trails comes out on 360, PS3, and PC.
4200846	4202107	And Walk With Me.
4202187	4204088	Do you know your walking routine on the DS?
4204349	4206110	Do you know that you're walking right now?
4206570	4210874	Isn't it funny that even when we get the crap games, so do Europe.
4210894	4214477	But when we get a great game like Chrono Trigger, they have to wait like three months for it.
4214517	4215217	You poor guys.
4215237	4216058	We got Pikmin.
4217299	4223124	See, they're going to get the port of Pikmin now, and we're going to get the new Zelda months before they will.
4224232	4225313	That's fair.
4225974	4228196	Go Nintendo.
4228236	4229177	Boy oh boy.
4229778	4234403	You know what else is equally awesome as delays and stuff like that?
4235183	4240329	Rock Band receiving some brand new tracks from Nickelodeon's
4242148	4245492	HighSchoolMusical-esque movie Spectacular.
4247214	4251278	Yes, there's two songs from the film, Break My Heart and Don't Tell Me.
4251619	4259228	They'll be both available for the equivalent of $1 on your Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Network.
4261579	4275014	And of course, if you happen to wait until March 31st for the DVD release of Spectacular, there will also be a redemption code for a free download of the two songs via the Rock Band Music Store.
4275234	4277317	And if you're curious what this sounds like...
4293349	4295011	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4311135	4312236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4326255	4327136	Thanks for watching!
4353179	4355720	Dark Tetsuya pours bleach on his speakers.
4356300	4358220	Leo Shen, my ears are bleeding now, damn it.
4358800	4359380	All right, fine.
4359420	4363121	I guess there's not a lot of people that are going to be downloading the spectacular songs.
4363821	4364962	But it's spectacular.
4364982	4366082	But it's spectacular.
4367022	4371523	Also spectacular is a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
4371543	4374663	We like to pay a little respect to the classic games.
4375023	4378144	And it's a little segment we do here on the show called the classic game of the week.
4381297	4381899	DarkSakura.com
4387253	4400315	I decided to pick one for us, but you know, I kind of picked one collectively for all of us to kind of match, you know, there is a certain something going on right now in the world, you know, there's that big game, I guess they throw a ball around and all this stuff.
4400375	4412178	No, no, of course, we are taping the same day as the Super Bowl, and when you talk football and you talk video games, there really is one classic video game you have to recognize, and that is this week's classic game of the week.
4412398	4413198	Blades of Steel.
4413338	4413458	No.
4414537	4417139	Tecmo Bowl is this week's classic game of the week.
4423543	4427106	That's right, the wonderful 8-bit sounds of Tecmo Bowl on the NES.
4428167	4430769	I chose purposefully not to do Tecmo Super Bowl tonight.
4430809	4434691	I did Tecmo Bowl, the old school one, because this is a little more of a classic.
4434972	4438554	I played this game a hell of a lot growing up.
4438634	4438794	I know...
4440035	4443817	We like to think that Rob plays like no sports games and hates them all, but there are a few.
4444397	4447839	Few and far between that will come along once in a while to get my attention, and Tecmo Bowl was one of them.
4448459	4450100	So let's learn a little bit about Tecmo Bowl.
4450160	4453642	Tecmo Bowl was actually based off an arcade game, an arcade version of Tecmo Bowl.
4454342	4465207	I should be noted, that's not what we're citing as the classic game of the week, because I've played the arcade version in a compilation that was on the Xbox, Tecmo Classic Arcade, and it stinks compared to the one on the NES.
4465247	4467848	It doesn't seem to move as quickly, I just don't care for it.
4468509	4468969	So, um...
4470131	4472593	Tecmo Ball on the NES is our classic game of the week.
4472753	4473773	You've probably seen this before.
4473813	4476395	It was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 12, 2007.
4477616	4482879	But the original came out in 1989 after the original arcade version was released in 1987.
4484460	4489263	The arcade version had this big two-monitor setup so that four people could play.
4489583	4492585	But the NES version was way scaled down because it was only two players.
4493226	4497428	You could do three modes, one player, two player, or just a coach mode where you would pick all the plays.
4498789	4505150	The playbook only has four offensive plays, or if you're on defense, you kind of try to pick the play that you think the offense is going to pick.
4505810	4508331	And you did it with this combination of the controller and the buttons.
4509531	4511191	Tecmo Bowl isn't a perfect game, though.
4511211	4515312	It was a little better than 10-yard fight, which was one of the only other football games that was out at the time.
4516252	4520473	Apparently, almost any pass that you throw to a covered receiver is going to end up in interception.
4521313	4527354	If you use the New York Giants and you use Lawrence Taylor, apparently you can pretty much block almost all kicks.
4528254	4551124	and apparently San Francisco has a play that is usually unstoppable against almost any defense and I used to win every time with San Francisco and I think that's probably why by the way you wouldn't actually be playing as the New York Giants though in the game because they didn't have the licensing from the NFL to actually use the names of the teams so when you selected teams you were just Indianapolis or San Francisco or New York
4551744	4552325	Thank you for watching!
4567694	4576300	I don't know enough about football to understand the whole thing behind that, but you do get the players, and they are all in the game, and, you know, it was the old 8-bit NES days.
4576320	4577641	They didn't really look any different.
4577701	4579042	It's just that you had the different names.
4579402	4590530	However, if you downloaded this on the Virtual Console version, you didn't get the names because the licensing had expired, so they actually removed all the names from the version that came out for Virtual Console, which kind of stinks.
4591490	4613820	by the way, there was also a version on mobile phones that was released in 2004 and apparently they are bringing this series back Tecmo Bowl Kickoff I don't know if this came out yet, but that was supposed to be coming out on the DS I don't know if that ever did actually come out or is still on its way out I can't remember if it came out in November or not it was originally going to come out in November
4615976	4616456	You know what?
4616596	4619857	It just isn't the old school 8-bit version.
4620817	4629439	And I know there's a lot of people very partial to Tecmo Super Bowl, but I have to take a minute to just recognize the greatness of the classic NES version.
4629459	4630659	You're actually nodding your head, Rice Princess.
4630699	4631599	Yes, it did come out.
4631899	4632499	Oh, it did come out?
4632579	4633120	When did it come out?
4633840	4635700	Not too long ago, but it's available for $20.
4635800	4637921	Apparently it just price dropped.
4638281	4640041	Rice Princess, were you a fan of Tecmo Bowl?
4640421	4640521	No.
4640881	4641001	No?
4641141	4641481	Okay.
4642101	4643482	Were there any sports games that you played?
4644762	4644882	Um...
4648487	4657429	I like this about Tecmo Bo2 is that it had like little cinematics when you got a touchdown it was like high five in super slow motion because we don't really have movies and this halftime show
4658507	4659748	Whoa, a halftime show.
4659768	4660829	I know, a cinematic halftime show.
4660849	4661329	It was pretty awesome.
4661349	4663151	It was like Ninja Gaiden, but with football.
4663191	4663931	I love Ninja Gaiden.
4664332	4675380	See, I was nodding my head because I'm concurring with your point about paying homage to the older, original versions and stuff like that.
4675440	4683446	Personally, if I were to pick an NFL game that was going to be my pick for something like this today, NFL Blitz.
4683966	4684287	I knew it.
4685928	4686628	Alright, fair enough.
4686648	4687328	Nobody likes that game.
4687348	4688048	Maybe next year.
4688088	4689189	Maybe during next Super Bowl.
4689249	4689629	We'll see.
4690249	4690989	But that's it for now.
4691009	4694370	It's your classic game of the week, Tecmo Bowl, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4694910	4703932	And with that, it's going to bring Part A of our show to a close tonight, but don't go anywhere, because we're going to be just right back in a few seconds with Part B. If you're listening on the podcast, it only takes a few seconds.
4703952	4712253	You hear that little do-do-do-do, and then it's right back into Part B. But if you're listening live, this is the point where we take a little bit longer of a break to, you know, get a drink of water, use the restroom.
4712553	4713614	Toilet bowl.
4713814	4713874	Or...
4716154	4717295	Not the Toilet Super Bowl.
4717835	4725679	And this will actually be, it's very special this week, our break, because this will be try to restrain Rice Princess from my Xbox 360 for 10 minutes during the break.
4726459	4728100	So we'll see how that works.
4728440	4731702	We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4739079	4743361	Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 1st of 2009.
4744242	4747764	You know, there's a big football game going on today, but we're here doing a show anyway.
4748104	4748864	It's over, actually.
4748904	4749645	The Steelers won.
4749805	4751046	Apparently, it was really exciting.
4751146	4755768	I guess there was like a big run to a touchdown or things like that.
4756008	4757289	You can totally tell I don't know dick about football.
4757309	4759030	You know that thing that happens when you play football?
4759270	4760811	DarkSakura is not here tonight.
4781656	4782257	Thanks for watching!
4798857	4799818	or at least attempts to do.
4800418	4803100	And Silent Nathan is also here, but he wouldn't know because he doesn't say much.
4803280	4806602	But he is here wearing his Horde hat, showing his pride for the Horde.
4806622	4807963	And I'm wearing my Alliance sweater.
4808163	4809523	Oh, do you two like fight for real?
4809644	4811565	Yeah, I punch him in the face all the time.
4811585	4811765	Awesome.
4812185	4818389	Oh, too bad we don't have a webcam, but we will have it next week because there's a cord coming from New Jersey, I found out.
4818509	4818589	Woo!
4819474	4819894	Woohoo.
4820395	4822537	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
4822637	4824818	Loki's here to deliver the news as always.
4824858	4825379	What's up, Loki?
4826159	4826600	Not much.
4827060	4830903	There will be some new download content coming out for the new Prince of Persia game.
4831864	4834386	This takes place after the end of the game.
4834426	4836428	It's going to be the epilogue download content.
4837148	4846296	And it will kind of further develop the relationship between the two main characters and also have them going after a new enemy, the Shapeshifter.
4846476	4847416	Are they going to do it yet?
4848413	4849354	I don't think so.
4850655	4857100	Apparently the Shapeshifter is an enemy that takes the form of the two of Ahriman's most fearsome lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter.
4858041	4870992	It's as though their physical form is familiar to our heroes, and the player will require particular strategies to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the epilogue.
4871192	4874856	Well, I get to have more conversations with the chick that always saves me from falling to my death?
4875536	4876017	Possibly.
4876317	4876617	Awesome.
4877458	4890652	And, of course, you know, they're going to have the sprinting offensive and Elika is going to get the new energized power which will allow her to temporarily restore a piece of destroyed environment.
4891516	4891777	Huh.
4892458	4893119	That'd be interesting.
4895062	4897867	Will the game still help me every step of the way by telling me what buttons to push?
4898228	4898569	Maybe.
4899029	4899310	Awesome.
4899650	4901834	The download content will be available though on February 26th.
4903280	4904461	Alright, check that out.
4904501	4905701	How much do they have priced for that?
4905881	4906702	No price yet.
4908842	4911063	Somewhere between $5 and $10, I'm guessing.
4911284	4917906	Well, something that does have a price, a pretty high price, 8,190 yen they are going to charge for this.
4917926	4923389	That's $90 American dollars they are charging for The Last Remnant on PC.
4923929	4925610	And this is according to Famitsu Magazine.
4925630	4927571	There is a PC port of The Last Remnant.
4927591	4928031	This was a
4928451	4956709	A roleplaying game that was put out on the Xbox 360 They hit kind of mixed reviews Some of our listeners have been saying pretty favorable things about this I haven't checked this game out myself yet But if you don't own an Xbox 360 and you want to check this out on PC You might be in luck because it is coming in Japan on April 9th But it is going to have that pretty high price tag And then when you count importing fees on top of that or what have you Although of course I'm sure if you wanted to go to darker places on the internet You could probably get it for free But I don't know, it's going to be all in Japanese, so who knows Anyway
4958058	4962179	Apparently, though, it's going to actually give you some extra stuff in the PC version.
4962199	4964260	You can speed up battle animations now.
4965380	4967421	It will have more leader class characters.
4967901	4972403	You can preview equipment in the menu, and you can actually switch between Japanese and English.
4972483	4976264	So maybe you won't need to patch much more than the menus to get this.
4976344	4978345	And Ranma is in chat and says it's a great game.
4978365	4979705	He says, Last Remnant, great game.
4980326	4982566	Comment coming from our chat room, chat.orangemonstrady.com.
4982586	4984587	If you're just joining us post-Super Bowl, you should come join us.
4984707	4988750	As long as it's easier to install and have run than Grand Theft Auto 4.
4990131	4992212	By the way, one other quick thing I want to say about this game.
4992292	4996235	This is the game that Square Enix took the Unreal Engine for.
4996255	5001159	You might remember a few years back, there was a big news story that Square Enix had purchased the Unreal Engine for something.
5001199	5001899	This is that game.
5002259	5004301	So you can see it in motion on the PC.
5005742	5006522	In The Last Remnant.
5006803	5009044	And apparently it was un-really disappointing.
5009264	5009945	Yeah.
5012010	5014773	That's a mixed bag of opinions.
5016034	5022740	Well, something that might be a little bit better, hopefully, are some sequels to some well-known Capcom franchises.
5023902	5031369	There was some talk about a brand new Dead Rising game and a Lost Planet game, and that they may possibly be...
5033010	5034351	Thank you for watching!
5048430	5055375	Not a big surprise since Capcom, Dead Rising did very well for them and they're making a Lost Planet movie for God's sake.
5056957	5062501	Not a big surprise that we'll see some new games and the fact that they'll be multi-platform is not a shock either.
5063922	5064182	Cool.
5065123	5066044	Hopefully those are soon.
5066204	5067045	Hopefully we'll see those at E3.
5068881	5075684	It's interesting to think about what kinds of stuff we're really going to see come out of E3 this year because it's been fairly quiet, all things considered.
5075704	5083567	I'm thinking this year's E3 is going to be pretty big, especially the whole return to E3's roots, even though they say not really, but that whole thing.
5084468	5084868	We'll see.
5085848	5092731	Also, but Capcom's all about the multi-porting too, so I'm sure if these things are coming out, they're going to be everywhere on every platform, right?
5093852	5094192	There you go.
5095814	5100356	Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams is going to finally add something that was missing from the first Bioshock.
5100376	5103137	What was missing from the first Bioshock for being a first-person shooter?
5118584	5119244	Multiplayer!
5119805	5120225	That's right.
5120605	5124027	Apparently this is all according to some recent job listings that were discovered.
5124047	5127468	The Bioshock team is looking for some multiplayer gameplay experts.
5128029	5135752	They're looking for some people who know how to extend and enhance the Unreal Engine 3 with proprietary networking technology to address gameplay performance and so on.
5137573	5146963	as somebody who can deliver a robust, scalable, and responsive multiplayer gameplay code and backend services for the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 platforms.
5147283	5153990	So unless there's some top secret unannounced project going on here, you can almost count on the fact that Bioshock 2 is going to have
5154370	5177937	multiplayer in it which is something the first one was pretty lacking although honestly I mean it didn't need it Bioshock was a hell of a first-person shooter game um you know that even people that don't play a lot of first-person shooters like me can get into because it was almost like Silent Hill-ish in how scary it was at least for me kind of the psychological element of the game so it's gonna be interesting to see what a multiplayer does to all that
5179306	5185430	Then that gets me thinking, since I invoked Silent Hill in that last story, why did we never get a multiplayer Silent Hill?
5185450	5186751	Wouldn't that be kind of interesting?
5187231	5188372	Well, because they tried.
5188732	5189993	I don't think it would work out.
5190513	5195216	I guess it wouldn't, because Silent Hill, a lot of times, is somebody's personal interpretation.
5195256	5195896	You know what I mean?
5195916	5199659	It's usually a very personalized story, so I don't think anything like that would really work.
5199739	5200859	But it's fun to think about.
5201540	5202000	Not really.
5202280	5202500	Shut up.
5205112	5210776	Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be getting some brand new download packs in February.
5211796	5217199	The first pack is going to be the Acoustic Track Pack, which is available for 440 Microsoft Points.
5219824	5222005	Included with that will be the Songholic.
5222225	5223566	That makes me angry.
5225947	5242716	And the Acoustic Track Pack, which will be available for 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49, will include three different songs, including Drive by Incubus, New Slang by The Shins, and Wonderwall, the Oasis cover by Ryan Adams.
5244217	5247899	Those are each also available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.
5248159	5248680	Wait a minute.
5249614	5270957	Ryan Adams covered Wonderwall like wow that's gonna be bad I'm sorry I saw Ryan Adams once in concert and he was kind of a douche so I mean he's a douchey guy covering a douchey song from a douchey band I mean this is just like oh it's gonna be terrible
5272779	5275841	Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack
5293709	5297031	Bob Seger Track Pack, Her Strut, and Get Out of Denver
5310671	5311552	Orange Lounge Radio
5333905	5335786	PC Game Purchases are in fact digital.
5363587	5365189	GameStop for PC Games
5378777	5386160	Apparently, according to the survey, 93% of PC gamers bought at least one game digitally in the past 12 months.
5386580	5388280	71% bought four games digitally.
5388660	5390101	Very interesting.
5390121	5394322	But then I think about some of those games like PopCap and those types of games.
5394842	5399524	Because I bring this up because obviously they're huge, casual PC games.
5400084	5405226	And a lot of people go to the site, download the trial game, and then you can put your credit card number in online and get the full version.
5405626	5407307	That's a digital distribution right there.
5408127	5411569	I don't think that necessarily means half of all games are bought off Steam.
5411609	5412909	I don't think that's necessarily what it means.
5412949	5424694	I think it goes a little deeper than that, especially when you filter in these classic games from a site like Yahoo Games or whatever, where you can click now and put in your credit card number to get the full version of Diner Dash 5.
5425234	5432457	That's kind of not surprising in a way, but interesting.
5432977	5434138	Yes, very interesting.
5434935	5435776	Know what else is interesting?
5435796	5438138	I'm sure that means the shelf space is going to continue to shrink.
5438198	5439118	What else is interesting, Loki?
5440940	5447365	People finding different things about LittleBigPlanet, including some upcoming patch details.
5447405	5450687	Apparently this was leaked out from a photo that was on...
5451898	5454280	Media Monocles Flickr page.
5454900	5463646	And if you look very closely, you'll notice that there's a whiteboard with a bunch of different information about download content and updates.
5464086	5480337	And the next one that's on the list there, which I can't quite see the code name for, but it will include new tutorials and online creation mode, where you'll be able to work with other players and create your own levels online.
5480978	5481278	Awesome.
5482582	5488927	apparently there's also going to be a new arcade pack at some point I don't know what exactly that is arcade pack?
5489568	5509985	that could be all kinds of cool but something else I'm trying to see code name what are your thoughts on LittleBigPlanet, RicePrincess you haven't talked a lot about it on the show but I know you love Wii, you hate 360 so PS3's got to be a nice neutral ground what do you think about LittleBigPlanet?
5510645	5511586	I don't know, I've never played it
5511943	5512183	Really?
5512543	5512803	Really.
5512904	5513544	I have it.
5513644	5514644	It's actually a lot of fun.
5514885	5516285	It was my favorite game that came out last year.
5516605	5516946	Really?
5517046	5517706	Yeah, I love it.
5517726	5519267	I don't have a PS3.
5519707	5522168	You gotta see how cheesy some of the user levels are.
5522208	5524109	I think that's how you will like it.
5524169	5528732	Go on there and play the Warcraft-inspired Onyxia's Lair level.
5528972	5529132	Okay.
5529372	5530713	No word to the time frame?
5558471	5559212	Um, no.
5560252	5565656	But then again, this is, you know, based off information that's coming off of a picture of a whiteboard.
5565696	5576862	I mean... Well, still, you know, if the studio themselves put up the picture, I would actually say that is a pretty respectable source.
5577003	5580785	Because I don't think they're going to think to quick erase the whiteboard, we're spilling all our secrets.
5581425	5581866	You know what I mean?
5583266	5585268	You're spilling your secrets onto the whiteboard.
5585288	5585788	Ha ha!
5586812	5588052	Sorry, I'm laughing at chat.
5588272	5589513	AcidicVampire in chat.
5590993	5592533	You're getting read a lot tonight, buddy.
5592553	5593633	He's saying a lot of funny things.
5594054	5596414	It says, Sky, play the Parker Posey level.
5596514	5598434	It's not popular, but it's great.
5598654	5599035	What?
5599175	5600835	There's a Parker Posey level?
5601055	5603335	Oh my god, I want to play it so bad.
5603676	5605256	I think I'm going to do that right after the show.
5605396	5607096	No, because I'm going to play Resident Evil 5.
5607136	5609417	I'm going to push you if you don't let me.
5609717	5610097	I have to...
5611712	5613993	Do I get to unlock stickers of Parker Posey?
5614393	5615674	If so, I'm so sold.
5616554	5617935	Like Party Girl and everything?
5619876	5620396	Amazing.
5623537	5625798	Silent Nathan is now suddenly interested in LittleBigPlanet?
5626319	5628139	Maybe I'll go play it right now.
5628240	5628980	Right now.
5630380	5630881	Alright.
5634204	5640247	Hey, speaking of games that I want to play right now, I can't play this right now, but apparently it's going to be in development.
5640747	5643889	Tron, a new game, a new Tron game.
5643949	5646951	You know, they showed that trailer for Tron 2 or TR2N.
5648434	5650034	What they showed at Comic-Con.
5650354	5653975	Apparently there is a game coming out for this whole thing as well.
5654415	5656176	This is according to Variety.
5656276	5665178	Even though there were some issues with the Disney video game company, Variety Magazine is reporting that apparently Disney is shipping to game developers a concept for TR2N or Tron 2.
5666518	5669118	Of course, no idea what it's going to be like or anything.
5669619	5670939	But of course this makes me think, okay...
5671897	5675260	There was a Tron 2.0, and it wasn't very well received.
5676101	5678923	But the original Tron game was awesome.
5680164	5680705	Never played it.
5681145	5681886	It's pretty awesome.
5681906	5686249	They have it on Xbox Live, and it was one of those games that was better in the 80s.
5686770	5689993	And when you play it now, you're kind of like, oh, this game is better left in my imagination.
5690013	5692074	But it still was pretty cool, especially for an 80s game.
5693476	5697239	What do you think about reinventing franchises?
5697799	5698580	Such as Tron?
5699341	5699541	Sure.
5701553	5703034	I'm okay with it, I guess.
5703154	5703555	I don't know.
5704495	5708238	I think especially a series like Tron needed a sequel a long time ago.
5708298	5709299	It seems a little late.
5709579	5713342	But then when you look at a series like The Goonies, or there is no series there, right?
5713442	5714523	They don't need to make a Goonies 2.
5714984	5716745	Like, if they made a Goonies 2, you know it's going to be stupid.
5716765	5717305	But it was Goonies.
5717365	5718086	Or The Karate Kid?
5718106	5718326	No, just no.
5718386	5721409	Are you talking about the movie or the game?
5722029	5722790	Oh, the movie.
5723350	5724271	The game was amazing.
5724651	5726112	That's another classic game of the week.
5726132	5727413	I love that game so much.
5727433	5728393	That game was amazing.
5728474	5729014	Heck yes.
5729174	5729714	Oh my god.
5730015	5731696	I thought you did that as a classic game already.
5732256	5733977	I don't know if DarkSakura has ever done it.
5733997	5736199	I'd have to check the wiki, but I don't think it's ever been a classic game.
5737219	5741681	I'd have to check the wiki on our own show.
5741741	5747103	Look, we've done the Classic Game of the Week for at least a year now, so I don't know every single game we've highlighted.
5747223	5747823	There's a lot.
5748203	5751344	Thankfully, we have a wiki and the fans update the wiki because they're awesome.
5752505	5754825	Did Silent Nathan run in the house really to go play PlayStation 3?
5754865	5757026	Probably that jerkwad.
5757606	5759527	Hey, Nathan, you're cool.
5760687	5761888	And not a jerkwad at all.
5761928	5764829	Anyhow, so yeah, Neutron game in development.
5766087	5767248	Probably to come out with a movie.
5768229	5774814	If they can find somebody to take the financial hit for all the development, I guess, in this economy.
5775154	5776795	Disney does have their own studio.
5777956	5778957	Yeah, but it's been hurting.
5780358	5781739	Yeah, because they put out Turok.
5781799	5782679	I mean, come on.
5783500	5787123	I could have told you that Turok's going to suck before they even put Turok out.
5787943	5788604	Seriously, really?
5788624	5789805	You're going to put Turok out?
5790225	5790545	Really?
5790665	5792447	This is something you think is a great idea?
5792867	5794528	The economy is going downhill.
5794588	5795469	What game should we make?
5795809	5796650	Turok!
5796670	5798372	That's a great idea!
5798452	5801776	Amaze Satsuma in chat wonders if Sky wants a Showgirls 2.
5802637	5804239	You know there was supposed to be a Showgirls 2.
5804980	5809805	Because at the end of Showgirls 1 it alludes to the fact that Nomi Malone is going to Hollywood.
5810326	5812608	And Showgirls 2 was supposed to be a parody on Hollywood.
5812848	5814310	Like the first one was a parody on Vegas.
5814610	5815692	But then the movie came out.
5817179	5819080	and they decided to can a sequel.
5819440	5820100	Never mind.
5820780	5823201	I would be in full support of a Showgirls 2, but not now.
5823221	5825062	I mean, Elizabeth Berkley's not going to do it.
5825102	5825662	What's the point?
5826302	5832825	The point is that we have all these wonderful porn studios that can develop a movie now.
5832845	5842809	I mean, they're doing more theatrical movies and hell, they have all the knockoffs, like all the TV show ones, like Not the Bradys, Not the Monsters, Not Bewitched.
5843369	5846410	I don't know what the other ones are, but
5847270	5851614	I mean... Not My Three Sons?
5852395	5853336	I'm not sure about that one.
5853356	5855058	How come porn studios don't get into gaming?
5855278	5857680	You know, you see all these legitimate movie studios getting into games.
5857700	5863085	There's porn actresses that are in the gaming, but, you know, not... I don't know.
5864707	5866629	There's a lot of people that love World of Warcraft...
5867963	5869964	I don't know why, but there are.
5889308	5889648	I don't know.
5889668	5890529	Plus, think about it.
5890589	5895493	If you're a stripper, you're working nights, you're probably home during the day with a kid.
5895953	5900317	I'm kind of reminded, I don't know if you've ever seen The Guild, but I'm kind of reminded of Carla from The Guild.
5901978	5902879	Well, she's a nerd.
5902899	5908443	Who, by the way, is by far my favorite character on that program.
5909104	5912026	But the stripper that's local that plays WoW, she's a nerd.
5912226	5915049	She's an Asian girl, and her stage name's Katana.
5915069	5915429	Yeah.
5915956	5917037	Yeah, that's the one.
5917798	5918839	Yeah, that's totally the one.
5918979	5919620	Freaking dork.
5920200	5920621	Wait a minute.
5920941	5924185	Do we just have a six degrees of stripper here in the studio?
5924205	5924525	What?
5924565	5927468	Like we just found out that Loki and Rice Princess know the same stripper?
5927748	5928769	Do you know that stripper?
5929370	5932793	I don't know her, but I've seen her boobies.
5933074	5937458	Well, I know her that well, but... I know her in the biblical sense.
5938139	5939220	No, you know...
5941658	5942218	Thanks for watching!
5961627	5962988	about games and shit.
5963008	5965451	You know, you mentioned that you do a game podcast.
5965491	5966832	It's like, oh my god, I play games too!
5966852	5968393	That's so funny.
5968433	5970976	Like, how does that even come up in conversation?
5971276	5972317	So what do you do?
5972417	5973938	And you're like, well, actually, I have a game podcast.
5973958	5974619	Well, here's the thing.
5974759	5981886	It's because, you know, to get into how strip clubs operate, they have to wait until the new song begins.
5981906	5985689	Because when you're paying for a lap dance, it's for X number of songs.
5985729	5986970	And they're not just going to start...
5987851	5991033	If it's in the middle of a song, you have to sit there and wait for the new song.
5991273	5993674	During that time, it's you, so what do you do?
5994734	5995435	How's it going?
5995755	5996395	That kind of stuff.
5997096	5998576	That's where the games come up.
5998857	6000837	That's all I do is games.
6000877	6005220	The time I got a lap dance, because I went to the strip club once, and my friends, you were there, Irene, right?
6005840	6009322	My friends made me say which stripper I thought was the hottest.
6010042	6014804	Naturally, I said the one that looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because there was a stripper there that looked just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
6015305	6015565	And she...
6016445	6017266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6037783	6038884	Honey, it's nothing against you.
6038944	6039625	I'm just gay.
6040085	6042187	And she says, oh, I can kind of tell.
6042287	6044229	And then she's just sitting there and she's talking to me.
6044249	6046250	And she's like, oh, my roommate's gay and I love him.
6046290	6046691	He's the best.
6046871	6048852	And so she's talking to me for like a whole nother song.
6049173	6053757	But it was really awkward because she had no clothes on except a thong.
6053817	6055678	And it was kind of strange.
6055798	6058641	I was just kind of like, just put a T-shirt on or something.
6058921	6061183	And acidic vampire says, Rob loves the boobies.
6061423	6062844	Yes, especially when he's drunk.
6063244	6063645	Yeah.
6065441	6067562	Rob might be gay, but he loves titties.
6067582	6068762	All gay guys like boobies.
6068982	6069842	I don't know what it is.
6069883	6071403	I guess everybody really likes boobies.
6071743	6072663	Who doesn't like boobies?
6072783	6073624	Women like boobies.
6073724	6074524	Yeah, women do.
6075584	6076565	Like me.
6076825	6079786	But, yeah, you were going to say something, Nathan?
6080646	6085308	I just want to point out, though, some props in chat for the strip club with the wife.
6085728	6089949	Because some folks in chat are like, Game Guru says, wait, wait, wait, you go to the strip club with your wife?
6091150	6091910	She loves going.
6092924	6099972	And GameGuru says, your wife is the coolest.
6100172	6107941	We seriously thought we were going to do this, but we were so fucking tired from the wedding day.
6108322	6111185	We were seriously going to go in our wedding garb.
6111545	6134049	to the strip club we were almost going to do it but we were so exhausted like during the wedding we were like dude yeah we should totally go afterwards just dressed up in the tux and everything because that would be hilarious but we were just like so beat at the end of the day it's like fuck that we're not going anywhere nice go sleep yeah boobs are awesome
6135829	6136210	Let's see.
6136350	6138011	Ranma says, Sky, you're a hypocrite.
6138031	6140933	You have a problem with a woman in a bra and panties at a strip bar.
6141554	6141914	Hold up.
6142114	6143435	She had no bra on, okay?
6143475	6143815	Yeah.
6143855	6144456	Just panties.
6144696	6145316	Full titties.
6145396	6146697	I wouldn't even call it like panties.
6147098	6150520	When you say panties, I think of like granny panties, you know?
6150820	6153663	Or like regular panties, not a thong.
6153703	6154823	Yeah, she had like a thong on.
6154843	6155464	Not a G-string.
6155484	6159927	But she'll happy go to a Rocky Horror Picture Show convention full of women in bra and panties.
6159967	6160508	Well, that's different.
6160528	6161568	Well, that's not why you're going there.
6161588	6162109	That's theater.
6162189	6162729	That's art.
6163190	6163610	It's art.
6163650	6164130	It's art.
6165872	6169295	That's funny that you're laughing at that.
6169375	6176022	But anyways, yes, there are a lot of people in all occupations that play World of Warcraft, even strippers.
6176102	6180286	It's not like, oh, I strip, therefore I cannot play games at all.
6180446	6182848	But yeah, porn stars, strippers...
6183885	6184326	DarkSakura.com
6199864	6204187	Marissa is in chat again saying, they make all sorts of terrible porn games.
6204227	6206809	Remember how I said earlier, why don't porn studios make games?
6207149	6210552	They make all sorts of terrible porn games, but they're usually multiplayer online.
6210632	6214154	I learned this by working in the porn capital of the world, Chatsworth, California.
6214534	6215995	Okay, two comments to that.
6216236	6223861	A, I should have figured that out because on porn websites, so I've heard, you see a lot of times ads for those multiplayer sex things.
6223881	6224641	So you've heard.
6224682	6226243	Yeah, I just heard through Loki.
6226323	6226763	Through your eyes.
6227023	6228884	That's what you see on those sites.
6229025	6230045	And I guess you're right.
6230365	6232827	I just don't think of them because they're not really out there and about.
6233187	6236830	And B, I did not realize Chatsworth, California was the capital of the porn industry.
6236850	6237831	But it doesn't surprise me.
6238111	6243194	But if you've ever been to Chatsworth, California, it's, you know.
6243374	6244655	Is it better than Buttonwillow?
6245115	6246256	It's better than Buttonwillow.
6246576	6250659	I would say Fresno is probably better than Chatsworth.
6250839	6251320	Yeah.
6251960	6254861	And I like how we're only laughing because everybody else doesn't live in California.
6254881	6256102	No offense to the people there.
6257422	6257582	Wow.
6258883	6259763	Wink wink hint hint.
6260343	6261764	My grandma's from there.
6262084	6265345	Her movie comes out next month.
6266579	6266759	Ew.
6267420	6267740	Ew.
6267880	6268261	Gilf.
6271004	6274589	And then Marissa also says, Rob can have some of my boob to play with.
6274669	6275250	Stress toys.
6275330	6276271	I have too much anyway.
6276612	6278735	Marissa has some nice big boobies.
6278835	6282920	I would definitely help relieve some stress.
6284122	6289383	Your own stress all day with her boobs.
6289663	6291463	Can we move on back into video games?
6291784	6298845	I don't know how we got on the whole topic of strippers from Tron.
6298865	6300745	That was the last story we just did was Tron.
6300765	6301626	I just want to point out.
6302166	6309047	And then suddenly it's about strippers playing World of Warcraft and boobies in Chatsworth, California being the porn capital of the world.
6310163	6314704	I definitely would pay good money to see a stripper that's glowing in the Tron outfit.
6316884	6317164	Absolutely.
6317405	6321505	Hey, there's that guy on the internet, the Tron guy, who wears that outfit.
6321645	6325106	No, no, no, not him, but imagine if a woman wore that outfit.
6325126	6325546	Is he hot?
6325586	6328707	I just don't want to see a woman the size of the Tron guy wearing that outfit.
6330227	6330487	Alright.
6330607	6332488	I can't process this much data.
6334328	6337469	Dark Knight in chat says, thank God Jamie's not here for this one.
6338189	6338549	You know...
6340880	6342822	It probably would have derailed even if she was here.
6342862	6346464	Because it's not the fact that Jamie's not here, it's the fact that Rice Princess is here.
6346544	6346845	Hey.
6348266	6349927	I didn't bring up... Wait, yes I did.
6350507	6351288	Yes you did!
6351528	6352429	La la la, let's move on.
6352529	6356652	Remember, you and Loki have this whole six degrees of strippers thing going on here.
6356772	6361835	Or we just both live in the same town and both go to the same strip club.
6361916	6364077	Why am I not being invited to said strip club?
6364097	6365138	I haven't gone in like three years.
6365158	6367279	I haven't gone in like a year or two.
6367299	6367820	We need to...
6368260	6368820	Fix this.
6369081	6370441	It's been a long time.
6370501	6375764	It's just because you go to the strip club and afterwards you're like, that cost me a lot of money for very little time.
6376125	6377325	Why the fuck did I do that?
6377385	6379226	And then you forget about it after a while.
6379286	6381167	So you have Guilty Gear news, right, Loki?
6381648	6384689	Yeah, speaking of guilt for spending all that money at strip clubs.
6386934	6389876	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus
6417625	6418947	And then I almost vomited.
6436368	6437389	Oh, so Guilty Gear, yeah.
6437829	6438209	Sounds good.
6438669	6439370	So it'll be coming out.
6439850	6441170	Too bad it's not the new Guilty Gear.
6441571	6444832	Or, wait, that wasn't, it was something blue.
6444932	6446113	I forget what they called it.
6446233	6448754	The new game, it's not Guilty Gear, but it's done by the same people.
6449174	6453677	It's all, like, HD, or not cel-shaded, but, like, hand-drawn animation stuff.
6454437	6454917	No idea.
6458059	6458319	I don't know.
6459480	6461501	All right, well, let's move on to the mailbag.
6461561	6467704	It's the part of the show every week that you guys can send us an email, and we'll read it here on the show and respond to whatever's in it or make fun of it.
6468244	6468924	One of the two will happen.
6470605	6474307	We invite your emails to be sent in to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6474327	6478809	Although we didn't have a whole lot this week, that's probably because our podcast feed was behind a little bit.
6478829	6480610	But by the way, it is getting caught up.
6480670	6482411	A new show just went out today, so go look for it.
6482871	6485572	We do have at least one email to read, and it's from Australia.
6485632	6487473	This is from Mike in Australia.
6488803	6491104	Mike in Australia says, Hello to all in studio.
6491204	6493085	Rob, Loki, Silent Nathan, and Rice Princess.
6493145	6494066	Oh, he must be listening right now.
6494086	6494566	Wow.
6494586	6495787	Because he knew exactly who was on the show.
6495807	6496247	Well, hello.
6496947	6503671	I've had the opportunity to listen live two weeks in a row, which is a treat considering during your halftime Puppy Bowl music break, it's coming up to 2 p.m.
6504211	6505552	So generally, I'm at work.
6506252	6509353	Firstly, I want to ask your thoughts about some good platform games on the DS.
6509673	6513573	I don't have an Xbox 360 or PS3, so I'm stuck with the DS Lite, which is good enough at the moment.
6514074	6518975	I've acquired Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, but haven't really gotten into yet, played the first level or so.
6519455	6523936	I'm slowly playing through Yoshi Island DS, so if you can suggest anything similar, that would be good.
6524416	6527816	Before I finish, I just want to say great show as always, and really enjoy listening to your shows.
6528196	6530397	Take care, and hope to listen live again soon.
6530737	6530997	Mike.
6531497	6531817	P.S.
6532157	6535938	This email is not sponsored by anyone, but for you guys to learn a new Australian term,
6536358	6539239	Budgie... Bud... Budgie Smugglers.
6540140	6541980	I guess the email's brought to us by Budgie Smugglers.
6542500	6543881	Explanation from Urban Dictionary.
6544221	6547482	Australian slang term for men's tight-fitting Speedo-style swimwear.
6547542	6552204	The lump in the front apparently resembles a budgie when it is stuffed down the front of someone's shorts.
6552224	6552884	What's a budgie?
6553364	6554465	That's what I want to know.
6555125	6556286	Is that like a Snuggie?
6558894	6559755	Oh, I bet it is.
6559935	6561936	That's like the Australian version of a grape.
6562416	6562716	All right.
6562996	6564737	Look, look, back to the question at hand.
6564777	6567179	How about some DS platform games?
6567459	6569600	You know, I haven't played a whole lot on DS as of late.
6569700	6573562	I just, I have this thing against playing games on DS for some reason.
6573602	6577645	I like playing games on the TV, but to help our poor guy out, what are some games?
6577905	6581207	See, even when I'm playing the DS, I'm playing a lot of RPGs, like Final Fantasy IV or Mario.
6581587	6583108	You want to just know good DS games?
6583368	6585368	No, well, platformers specifically.
6585408	6588509	Things like Castlevania, Yoshi Island.
6588529	6590410	What are some other good platformer games?
6590470	6591350	New Super Mario Bros.
6591410	6592710	is definitely one of the classics.
6592730	6594130	If you don't have that yet, you've got to get that.
6594370	6595971	I'm going to look to chat, too, for some hints.
6596211	6597211	Chat, what are some good ones?
6597771	6598811	New games that have come out.
6599052	6605513	Of course, there's a new Kirby game, Kirby Super Star Ultra, which is port.
6606353	6608934	And then there's... Was it...
6610234	6612697	The Chase, Phoenix meets Felicity.
6613698	6617241	That's supposed to be kind of like Kirby's Canada's Curse.
6618022	6620585	And then other platformer games.
6620645	6624028	I'm sure there's a lot of crappy games that have come out that have been like platformers.
6624288	6625830	Wasn't N out on the DS?
6625850	6627091	Didn't they release a version of N?
6627111	6628232	Yeah, that's kind of a neat little game.
6628552	6629293	That's coming out.
6630054	6630895	Or that's already out.
6631375	6631696	And then...
6634916	6637057	GameGuru in chat suggests Sonic Rush.
6637177	6638498	It's better than the console Sonics.
6639498	6643780	You would definitely also have to pick up the Chrono Trigger for the DS.
6643840	6647683	It's not a platform game, but it's way better than any of the games you've already mentioned.
6648423	6650164	Also, a budgie is a bird.
6650684	6651525	Like a parakeet.
6652225	6652745	Oh, thank you.
6653886	6654566	Seriously?
6655887	6658128	I feel like I learn new things on this show every day.
6658228	6658989	The more you know.
6659009	6659389	There you have it.
6662267	6663187	Yay.
6663307	6666288	And some other folks in the chat room do agree with Sonic Rush, so there you go.
6666328	6668748	If you don't own that one yet, you should probably check out Sonic Rush.
6669849	6672189	Hitstun, though, suggests Tony Hawk's American Skateland.
6672229	6673870	It's kind of a platform game, sort of.
6674650	6674870	Yep.
6675170	6675310	Yep.
6676710	6678371	So there's some suggestions from us to you.
6678451	6681151	If you have an email you want to send us, mailbag at orangelongerator.com.
6681171	6685252	I'd like to hear more international slang terms, like budgie smugglers.
6685312	6687993	That was definitely educational.
6689073	6689433	There you go.
6691814	6692735	What'd you say, Nathan?
6693215	6697397	Next time you put on a Speedo, look down and it will resemble a parakeet in your pants.
6697417	6700278	I don't think there's going to be a next time I'm going to put on a Speedo.
6700298	6701939	All natural.
6705420	6709602	If I go swimming, I wear swimming trunks.
6709822	6717166	In this country, it's not appropriate usually to wear Speedos to the beach unless you are really good looking, and I'm not really good looking, sadly.
6717266	6717966	So there you go.
6718817	6720018	People do it anyway.
6720278	6720838	That's true.
6721278	6724139	Tron guy wears that whole thing in public, so whatever.
6724820	6726060	He does.
6727621	6728281	Let's go on.
6728521	6730162	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6730882	6733103	We'll get to the Skype line soon also, by the way, guys.
6733163	6734444	Skype line opening up a little later.
6734926	6741171	Well, here's a game if you're a fan of the Jump Superstars games that they have on the DS.
6741831	6744713	There's a new Konami PSP Brawler coming out.
6746574	6751358	And no word on... Let's see here what the title is on it.
6751478	6756381	But it's got... Oh, Sunday X Magazine is the...
6758694	6760556	and all the other characters.
6776866	6778607	Project Arms, Inuyasha, Jump Ultimate Stars,
6797662	6801804	was okay, it was a neat fighting game on the DS it was kind of like Smash Bros.
6801844	6822413	a little bit but the way that you use they had a bottom portion of your screen that you can align different manga panels and you would get different abilities and assist characters and stuff like that based on what you had in there and you had to fit them in so it's almost like the sticker system on Smash Bros.
6822453	6825634	Brawl it's kind of neat I see
6826633	6827173	Thanks for watching!
6848619	6848899	All right.
6849340	6851281	More PSP the merrier, I suppose.
6870111	6873936	20 players in this game 10 on 10 robot battles
6887233	6887833	That's crazy.
6887853	6889154	That's awesome.
6889275	6889475	I know.
6889535	6889955	I want to play it.
6889975	6892477	It sounds awesome, but I don't think you'll ever see one on these shores.
6892537	6893958	Just arcades aren't popular enough over here.
6894058	6895920	Maybe a Dave & Buster's would be like your biggest bet.
6895940	6901824	Well, you may not have to have 20 cabinets, but I mean, it still could be, you know, cool.
6902765	6904906	It might be cool, but I don't know if you're going to see it.
6905006	6905447	That's all.
6905787	6907048	It's probably going to be expensive.
6907608	6910631	I don't think there's enough arcade stuff to justify it, sadly.
6911611	6913453	So, you know, we'll see.
6913553	6913873	We'll see.
6913913	6914914	But anyway, it is in development.
6915492	6917394	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6928188	6928868	Block Peepo
6955203	6961149	But it's very unique looking and it's got a lot of the block things that are going to be in this bin.
6961209	6965513	And I just have a feeling, you put that in an arcade, kids are going to be stealing that shit left and right.
6967115	6967735	But it's neat.
6970918	6972580	Why can't kids just be more responsible?
6973421	6974222	That's a good one.
6974522	6975403	Yeah, Leo Shen agrees.
6975463	6977685	Those blocks would get stolen so fast if it was in the US.
6978005	6979467	They'd have to be all put on those cords.
6981269	6982231	That would be a mess.
6982411	6985937	You're like, crap, I can't put these blocks in there because of all these cords.
6985977	6988380	I got stuck and tangled in these cords.
6988581	6989342	That's the game.
6989402	6989803	Help!
6992031	6992711	Amplitude DS Amplitude DS
7021351	7023113	There we go, there's a little clip of it.
7041391	7047576	It's definitely a scaled down, I know, all I can hear is the audio, but I'll tell you, it looks like a very scaled down version of Amplitude.
7048076	7051899	Because you don't really have the hypnotic backgrounds that a game like Amplitude had.
7052219	7056203	It looks like you only have three tracks, but still, it's a start.
7056943	7057504	It's something.
7058364	7059305	It's bound to get sued.
7061206	7066711	Especially if that rumor from a few weeks back that Harmonix might be making a comeback with this stuff is true.
7068097	7069217	There it is, Supersonic Wii.
7069297	7070438	Well, you can download it now.
7070478	7071518	It's available out there.
7071598	7077520	So, I mean, if you want to check it out and you've got a homebrew-enabled Wii system, you know, definitely check this out.
7077560	7080902	And, of course, if you have a homebrew-enabled DS, you can check out Amplitude DS.
7082702	7089145	Of course, homebrewing any of those systems might violate your warranty, so be careful and don't say OLR told you to do it.
7089205	7090365	Warranty's warranty.
7091165	7092106	You don't need that crap.
7093606	7094046	Seriously.
7095727	7095807	Um...
7097281	7098422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7116454	7117795	More like this game, I think.
7117915	7119696	It's basically a combat racing game.
7119936	7121377	And it'll have 18 different levels.
7121818	7126701	It'll feature 7 different cars, all with giant guns and weapons on them.
7127362	7128923	Like any other car should have.
7129763	7134166	And this is a brand new game from a company called Team Six Studios.
7135367	7136908	And this is their first Wii game.
7138389	7138749	I don't know.
7138990	7139710	Looks okay.
7140050	7141972	But hey, we need a good combat racing game.
7141992	7143773	And since they're not making another full auto game...
7145523	7146103	DT Racer DT Carnage
7170759	7177121	Some other games that got really cheap lately were the Need for Speed games because apparently they did not sell very well, the recent games they released.
7177161	7180762	So EA decided if it worked for Batman, it's going to work for us.
7180802	7182562	They're going to reboot the franchise.
7183042	7190184	So they're hitting the old reset button on the Need for Speed franchise, and they're going to release three new Need for Speed games in the year 2009.
7191425	7195806	What's interesting, though, is that the whole kind of concept behind it, one for the core gamers...
7196426	7199248	One for the casual gamers, one for the online gamers.
7199768	7201869	I think it's an interesting approach to take with the games.
7202350	7208333	Need for Speed Shift is the game that's coming out on PlayStation 3, 360, PC, and PSP, and that's the core game.
7209414	7210434	That's like Project Gotham.
7211055	7212255	Coming out in the fall as well.
7212436	7219019	Need for Speed Nitro, that's coming out on the DS and the Wii, which you can probably guess is going to be the casual game.
7219260	7221361	I think that's more like the original Need for Speed games.
7221753	7224917	It also is supposed to have giant head racers and car vaulting.
7225157	7225517	Lame!
7225958	7226979	Wait, car vaulting?
7227760	7232445	God, I hope this is not another fucking... Wait, wait, wait, that might just be like a vault to actually put your car in.
7232985	7234066	No, that's car vaulting.
7235288	7236549	Oh, stupid!
7237009	7237590	No!
7238351	7238691	Why?
7238711	7239452	Wouldn't you like that?
7241041	7254912	Well, I do like that, but, you know, the fact that Car Vaulting reminds me of the stupid Cruisin' game that they had come out, and that Cruisin' game was a rip-off, or actually a port of the, was it Not Need for Speed, the Fast and the Furious arcade game.
7255492	7259015	The crappy Cruisin' USA-based one.
7260214	7260614	I don't know.
7276201	7277943	TigerClaw says you mean Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift Arcade.
7277963	7278984	I've seen that at Walmart.
7279064	7280165	Yeah, it's awful.
7280185	7280885	That's where it belongs, too.
7280945	7282447	Yeah, that's what Cruisin' came out of.
7282467	7283608	That's actually what Cruisin' was.
7300223	7302407	Also, a third game in the Need for Speed series.
7303448	7306834	If the other two don't sound interesting to you, Need for Speed World Online.
7306874	7310379	It's supposed to be a free online title.
7310460	7313785	It's coming out in Asia first over the summer and then we'll get it in Christmas time.
7314264	7321008	I'm assuming you probably have to pay for car upgrades or something, probably based off the Asian model for MMOs where it's free, but then you have to pay for the good stuff.
7322109	7323890	It's free, but your cars have no wheels.
7323950	7324890	Pay extra for the wheels.
7325991	7328232	It's like, go!
7328432	7328953	Oh, crap.
7329053	7329393	Can't go.
7329893	7358812	by the way the games are all being developed by different studios even though Black Box apparently kind of got you know kind of well pink slipped a lot of them did Black Box is still working on Need for Speed World Online at least who's left with EA Singapore Need for Speed Nitro the casual one is by EA Montreal it's Arcade Racer is what they're calling it Need for Speed Shift coming by Slightly Mad they're the guys that made GT Legends and Blimey apparently is on it too GTR 2 Blimey
7359272	7359813	Blimey!
7361694	7362135	There you go.
7363095	7364156	Lots of Need for Speed in 2009.
7364196	7366939	Yeah, if you're a Need for Speed fan, that is exciting news.
7367279	7371563	DarkTetsuya in chat, I believe, is a Need for Speed fan and says there's supposed to be a fourth one.
7372223	7375306	Yeah, there's a fourth secret one, but I don't know.
7375346	7376487	Hopefully that's the good one.
7376647	7377528	Need for Secret.
7378889	7382011	Burnout Paradise Burnout Paradise Burnout Paradise
7406083	7416607	But it's a Burnout Paradise Police Cars, and they've got the actual link for it, but it says coming soon on the actual in-game store.
7417507	7426370	And they do have some screenshots, I guess, I don't know if it's preview pics or something like that, of the PCPD cars.
7426710	7430452	So maybe new game modes, some sort of chasing stuff.
7431525	7435558	I don't know, Burnout Paradise is getting fucking awesome and now you can get the game for like 20 bucks.
7436823	7440045	All the free download content and all the paid download content that's coming out.
7440065	7449931	Much love to those folks for just continuing to support a game that might have gotten bashed as mediocre when it came out, but they're still just expanding and expanding on it and making it pretty awesome.
7450572	7451712	So, good for you guys.
7454234	7454614	We'll see.
7454694	7457516	Any time frame on when that could come out?
7457656	7461118	No word, but a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, like there's the Burnout Paradise...
7462986	7463687	The New Cars.
7463787	7465408	I think that's coming out this week.
7466248	7467008	Probably later on.
7467429	7468329	Maybe this month.
7468489	7469210	Possibly next.
7470450	7471471	Probably relatively soon.
7472852	7473112	Alright.
7474145	7474726	DarkSakura.com
7494807	7498410	One more story tonight, and it involves a company we talk about a lot on this show, PopCap.
7499171	7502474	PopCap is finally bringing some of their games to the PlayStation Network.
7502494	7503695	It actually happened this week.
7503775	7513585	Bejeweled 2 finally showed up on the PlayStation Network, and there also are plans to release Zuma, Heavy Weapon, Feeding Frenzy, and Peggle.
7514862	7516103	I know, Peggle's pretty awesome.
7516343	7521387	Peggle hasn't even showed up on Xbox Live yet, so I'm curious if it'll beat it to the punch on PlayStation 3.
7521687	7522448	I kind of doubt it.
7522828	7524389	They'll probably be released simultaneously.
7524950	7526110	But there you go.
7527672	7528812	$9.99 if you want to check out Bejeweled 2.
7529053	7531875	That's one penny less than what you'll pay on Xbox Live.
7533792	7535053	I go where the bargain ends.
7562876	7565239	Alright, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now.
7565259	7568122	1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the U.S.
7568162	7568622	and Canada.
7568823	7569964	Or you can call us on Skype.
7569984	7572386	Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
7573087	7577933	While we wait for some calls to come in, because we do have a little bit of a delay between when I say, hey, call in, and...
7579076	7583198	When people actually hear me say that on the radio, Loki, do we have any last-minute stories tonight?
7583578	7598965	Yeah, speaking of football, apparently there's that whole deal where the retired NFL players were not getting any money from the new NFL games, and their likenesses were being used without any sort of compensation.
7599405	7606289	Well, they have now finished that whole lawsuit, and they are going to be getting paid out on it.
7607409	7607969	That's pretty cool.
7608049	7613230	In the tune of $28.1 million by the NFL.
7613410	7614990	Only, let's go to the sky flying.
7615130	7616251	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7616271	7616691	Who's this?
7617891	7619271	Hi, this is Spazinator.
7619551	7621012	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
7623732	7624832	Well, two things.
7625452	7632394	First off, I just want to double check and make sure I heard you correctly in part A. Did you see that he had...
7635653	7641965	The collector's edition of Gears of War 2, you're going to lose your Golden Lancer.
7642432	7649374	No, only if you were one of the people that downloaded it while I guess it accidentally went up on the marketplace for free and so a bunch of people downloaded it.
7649694	7653636	They want to restrict it so that only the people with the collector's edition actually have it.
7653676	7655216	So I don't know how they're going to figure that out.
7655276	7656056	They're not going to.
7656137	7657017	It's not going to happen.
7657057	7658377	You don't think they'll actually be able to figure it out?
7658397	7659398	No, they're not going to figure it out.
7659438	7661138	Loki's convinced they're not going to be able to figure it out.
7661178	7666700	But if you legitimately have the gold gun from the collector's edition, you're not who they're trying to remove it from.
7668686	7676848	I'm kind of glad about that because if I were one of the people that had bought the collector's edition, I'd just hate to lose my fee, you know?
7676968	7677468	Wait, hold on.
7677568	7679208	I'm not much of a Gears player.
7679348	7682789	What is so special about the gold gun, or is it just that it's pretty?
7682809	7683689	It's just a gold gun.
7686329	7688610	It's just bragging rights more than anything.
7689490	7692030	Something to say, hey, I got the special edition.
7692110	7696911	It's kind of like the Iron Rich application for the iPhones.
7697313	7699654	I don't know, I kind of thought maybe it fired gold bullets or something.
7699714	7700754	Alright, what was your second question?
7702815	7707177	Well, it's not so much a question, it's more like a stupid statement.
7708237	7710618	Well, we make a lot of those on this show, so go right ahead.
7712119	7721523	Yeah, I was just thinking, with all the talk about strippers in movies during Part A, I doubt it'll ever happen, but someone should make a
7722621	7732227	Game for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 where you go up to a strip club and have boobies splash in your face.
7732267	7736570	Kind of like, I don't know, like Showgirls type of game.
7736710	7738051	That would be called This is Vegas.
7738611	7740232	Coming out for Midway later this year.
7741093	7741513	Awesome.
7741833	7744014	What about that Playboy game that they had?
7744054	7744955	The Playboy Mansion?
7745235	7746876	Yeah, that was actually supposed to be pretty good.
7747016	7747577	It was popular.
7747597	7747857	You know...
7748377	7760447	The problem is, a lot of these games, while you might see some boobs here and there, you're never going to see anything pretty much more hardcore than that on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 because of the whole standards thing.
7760907	7766852	Where if your game gets rated adults only, your game can't come out on any of the consoles.
7766872	7771916	The consoles basically forbid it because there's too many people out there who don't understand...
7772476	7777017	There's a developer who makes for the publisher who puts that on the system.
7777397	7786179	People think, oh, Nintendo Wii has got this disgusting vagina-eating game that's out on the system.
7786399	7787460	When is that getting released?
7787840	7790120	It's not, because it's rated adults only.
7791320	7793141	It's not like it used to be back in the day.
7793501	7795281	You get it on the Homebrew channel?
7795321	7797962	That Nintendo seal of quality.
7797982	7798162	Maybe.
7799283	7803949	Remember how those other companies would put out their own games without going through Nintendo.
7803969	7805031	It was kind of like a whole bootleg thing.
7805051	7806112	They can't really do that now.
7807013	7810077	Sadly, I don't think you're ever going to see real hardcore games get released.
7811960	7813582	You would wish one of them would just let up.
7814451	7814931	DarkSakura.com
7836058	7846463	Now, I don't know, porn on the internet's great, but I can see a lot of potential for the new Wiimote technology in a porno game.
7847123	7847804	Exactly.
7848004	7857068	Especially if the vagina-eating game was either pigs-in-a-trough type eating or knife-and-fork.
7857108	7859730	Frisbee has a great name in chat for the game, Muff Chomp.
7861230	7861751	Wow.
7862211	7862431	Yeah.
7863183	7882331	You know, since you kind of touched on it earlier for a second, you know, now this is just me, you know, speaking out by yes here, but what I'm thinking is that, you know, console owners should be afraid of AO games, you know.
7882531	7889314	I mean, you know, if you mean, like, there should be no problems with it, you know, it's kind of like, you know,
7889881	7892764	The best analogy I can give you is with M-rated games.
7893164	7896727	There's two out there that are complete opposites.
7896787	7901712	There's the Grand Theft Auto series and the BMX XXX.
7901852	7906737	Obviously, the Grand Theft Auto games are really great.
7907317	7913022	There are a few naysayers out there, whereas BMX XXX.
7916091	7917733	I gotta get BMX XXX again.
7917773	7918554	I love that game.
7918674	7921397	Actually, I think my sister has it because I had it for the GameCube.
7921418	7923400	That game is awesome.
7924161	7927144	Loki really has the best family ever, doesn't he?
7927525	7929026	No, she has my GameCube.
7929067	7930588	The sister plays BMX XXX.
7931209	7932430	It was a funny game!
7932530	7942695	It's seriously, it's Tony, it's not Tony Hawk, it's like Matt Hoffman's Probium X, but with like nudity and stuff, and just a ridiculous plotline, but it's basically like the old school Tony Hawk game.
7942735	7950599	You know what though, Spazinator makes kind of a good point though, is that you know, we have, especially we have this whole duel thing in this country which stinks, this whole double standard where
7951579	7955861	You could chop people in half and chop their heads off and have a completely violent game.
7956002	7957262	It's R or it's M-rated.
7957562	7963945	But heaven forbid you show a cooter or a penis and it's going to be an NC-17 or AO-related thing.
7964286	7972870	But he makes a good point that a lot of the sex games that we've had that have come out, like the guy game, BMX XXX, they've all been kind of crap.
7973190	7976452	What we need is a good artistic...
7977772	7980874	and Pussy Eating came to come out.
7980894	7985717	And we just needed to have, you know, a little bit of art.
7985737	7988138	It'll be like Master Pussy Theater.
7988278	7990100	Master Pussy Theater, exactly.
7992481	8005909	And if you want to really take it over the edge there, you know, throw all that stuff in there and then just, you know, have like a side mission where you blow up a certain ex-fluoridian lawyer.
8007428	8007868	You're welcome.
8007888	8007968	Bye.
8035021	8039085	AcidicVampire wants to remind us there's boobies in God of War in a sex minigame.
8039105	8040046	There is.
8041207	8042508	Hi, you're on Boobie Lounge Radio.
8042548	8042969	Who's this?
8044190	8045371	Oh, Boobie Lounge Radio.
8045411	8046252	How exciting.
8046412	8047053	Whoa.
8047073	8047933	Hi, guys.
8047953	8048354	It's Jason.
8048574	8049054	Hi, Jason.
8049094	8049395	How are you?
8049435	8049955	What's on your mind?
8051096	8055040	Well, now that you mention it, I don't know that I want to explain on air what's on my mind.
8056485	8060549	What did you call in to discuss tonight with the Orange Launch Radio host on this family program?
8060589	8067516	As long as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly are alive and spewing their shit, your dreams will never come true, I'm sorry to say.
8067916	8069678	No, that's not why I called in, but it was very funny.
8069698	8073462	It was a very funny anecdote to add in to everything that just happened.
8075124	8076825	I'm hoping somebody can answer me this because...
8077952	8081334	Obviously, I heard this just recently, and it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
8082294	8085716	Why does Gears of War need SSL, and why does it stop the game from working?
8085896	8088177	The whole Gears of War broken, blah blah blah.
8089797	8091698	Does anybody know the technical reason behind that?
8091918	8093699	It's because the certificate expired.
8094740	8097481	What is the certificate actually used for?
8098161	8098621	Nothing.
8100882	8103023	And it blocks the game in its entirety?
8103504	8103944	Yeah, sure.
8105330	8105790	I don't know.
8106531	8111194	I don't play Gears of War on PC and it's such an easy fix to set my date back.
8112315	8117198	Is it some type of thing to prevent cheating or the connection to multiplayer mode is secure?
8117218	8120000	Maybe to authenticate that it's a legit copy of the game?
8120020	8121241	It's got to be something like that.
8121261	8123862	Authenticating the legitimacy of the game or something like that.
8123922	8124483	I don't know.
8124543	8130647	I don't think it has a direct impact on the game itself, Jason, or I think the 360 ones would have stopped working too.
8130707	8135030	I think it has specifically to do with some type of authentication thing on the PC.
8135771	8136893	Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
8136913	8138977	Some kind of a phone home connection, something or other.
8139077	8142824	And that's just, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
8142884	8147974	I mean, we've heard of some really stupid DRM, but for crying out loud, people.
8150265	8151005	It's laughable.
8151145	8155529	You put the situation where you have to have a patch.
8155629	8157350	One of two things has to happen.
8157370	8165496	You either have to buy a ridiculously expensive certificate for, I don't know, 10 years, and then you piss off all the nostalgia players.
8166136	8171140	Or you have to issue a patch every single year with a new certificate.
8171420	8176707	Well, I think this is going to be a tough lesson learned because this is a pretty big fuck up to have your game completely stop working.
8176727	8177207	It's a bad setup.
8177248	8179190	They need to get rid of that entirely.
8179871	8182454	That is a bad mechanism.
8182634	8184937	Okay, enough computer geekery.
8185999	8187601	You guys mentioned that and I just kind of...
8187941	8191905	They've been having trouble with this sort of thing way back from Monkey Island.
8191945	8193726	They have yet to get this right.
8194447	8203575	If you remember way back on the really old DOS games, you used to buy a game and it'd come with a little booklet and at certain times you'd have to refer to page 193, line B.
8207277	8234763	or you'd have some awful little card you have to match up with the moon on the solstice of winter just to prove that you did in fact buy the game and if you lose it you're fucked some of those things weren't so bad and with the internet I've had a lot of things be subtly replaced anyways Space Quest the Space Quest series came with a brochure of sorts to explain about the game and it had
8235203	8243150	In the case of Space Quest V, which was one of my favorite ones, it had like a star chart with constellation codes or something like that.
8243450	8249675	And you had to use those codes to actually warp to different locales in the game as the story tells you to go there.
8249996	8252157	And that was their DRM, and it was good.
8252197	8252898	It was cute.
8253078	8256781	Jason, what I didn't like about that whole thing is that then console games started doing it.
8257022	8261766	And like, you know, if I didn't have that letter from home to dip in the water to see the secret code...
8263369	8271655	I didn't have that letter because I bought my game used and I had to call their helpline I'm like, uh, they'll dip the letter in the water I'm like, what letter?
8272016	8278801	No, the one in the manual I don't have the manual Okay, the code's 747 Well, was it that hard?
8279102	8284926	Couldn't you just tell me that the first thing or do you not get your 99 cents a minute if you give it away that fast?
8285787	8290511	People will say that DRM is a necessary evil I'll tell that person you're full of shit
8291109	8296273	By the way, Space Quest V... It's self-serving and it only serves to fuck people over.
8296533	8302397	Hold on, Nathan wanted to say something about Space Quest V. Did you also enjoy blowing up an android with a banana?
8302917	8303778	A space banana?
8304518	8311563	That was... When I was a lot younger, the BBSs were around, but that was the extent of my online life.
8311663	8312464	I love Space Quest IV.
8312484	8313985	That was as far as I could get.
8314125	8316446	I never got to the R&R world.
8316827	8319869	So as many times as I played the game, I always...
8321264	8323827	Oh, I don't even remember what that planet is called anymore.
8323907	8325689	I always got that far, and then that was the end of it.
8326350	8329153	And that was the whole game for me for about five years of my life.
8329394	8334139	I was more of a King's Quest player, and I wish to God those games would come out on Xbox Live Arcade.
8334179	8336142	Although they're on GameTap and stuff, so you know.
8336582	8339025	You're entirely wrong in your preference, but you know what?
8339065	8339846	A lot of people were.
8341896	8343817	Hey, King's Quest has that rabid fandom.
8343837	8355823	I remember about a year or two ago on this show, we had those guys do a silver lining, which was originally like a King's Quest-inspired thing, and then they were allowed to put it out if they ditched the King's Quest thing, and that whole mess that was going on there.
8356424	8358865	I can't say anything bad about King's Quest this year.
8358905	8360726	Adventure games in general were really impressive.
8360806	8362267	I just never had one.
8362307	8362967	I never played one.
8363087	8363787	Space Quest wasn't my series.
8363807	8368530	There's something sadly lacking in gaming today, unless it says Telltale Games on it.
8369090	8370691	They're the only ones doing anything, you know?
8372455	8375396	Anyhow, anything else, Jason, you want to talk about tonight before we get some other calls?
8375976	8380858	Do you guys really think that Bioshock really needs multiplayer?
8381298	8381578	No.
8381938	8383999	I personally don't think it needs multiplayer.
8384019	8385840	I think the first one was good enough as it is.
8386720	8391802	But I can see why they want to put it in the second one to definitely make it not feel like more of the same.
8392182	8396164	Because, you know, I think otherwise some people might start to say, well, it's more of the same.
8396504	8396904	You know, it's...
8397404	8398485	It's another sci-fi.
8398525	8402508	No matter what the story is or what they do with it, there's going to be people out there that say it's more of the same.
8402808	8408272	But if they throw this multiplayer curve at it, people are going to be like, oh my gosh, it's like the must-have game of da-da-da.
8408752	8409933	It almost makes me think they left it out.
8409953	8412575	It makes it just like every other first-person shooter with a different weapon set.
8414006	8422391	It's, I mean, the one thing, as much crap as I gave Bioshock, because the ending, the last hour and a half or so of it just absolutely pissed me off.
8422431	8427814	It was so boring, and then it ended with the easiest boss battle I think I've ever seen in a game.
8430235	8435278	Bioshock, what made, the best thing about Bioshock was the story.
8435438	8440841	It was interesting, it was scientific fantasy, sci-fi, and
8441658	8443419	It was a good story.
8445320	8455225	Being able to find the story, and if you actually sat down and paid attention to it... I mean, I'm not an ADD gamer, so maybe I have a little bit of a different look on the game than some other people.
8455806	8460028	But the story made that game incredible until the end.
8461028	8462109	But that was the best part about it.
8462409	8464310	And you lose all that in multiplayer.
8464350	8465051	It's more...
8466289	8468151	I really shouldn't say this, but it's more humdrum.
8468271	8471754	It doesn't necessarily mean, though, Jason, that the focus is going to be on multiplayer.
8471814	8476599	They might still have a very solid single-player mode in it, and the multiplayer might just be an afterthought type thing.
8477240	8478801	That's very true.
8478941	8486108	I just... A lot of... When you guys mentioned it, and I went article surfing, it was just like, they're finally getting multiplayer!
8486228	8487389	Oh my god!
8487450	8487530	And...
8488491	8489052	Whatever.
8489412	8494539	Well, because there's a whole audience out there that does play first-person shooters to do the multiplayer.
8494739	8497042	And, you know, it was missing for them in the first Bioshock.
8497142	8498404	Maybe they don't see the same thing in it.
8498424	8498965	I can't knock it.
8499005	8502650	It's just kind of... It seems overbearing in the pre... Yeah.
8504767	8505187	We'll see.
8505367	8507429	All right, Jason, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8507449	8508029	But you have a good one.
8508149	8508569	Thanks, buddy.
8508669	8509029	Fine.
8509089	8511291	Jeez, come on.
8511531	8513652	We try to keep it to five minutes, and you're on eight.
8514092	8514332	All right.
8515273	8515733	See you, buddy.
8516213	8516514	Bye.
8516694	8516934	Bye.
8517974	8520396	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8520496	8522637	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8523257	8526779	SSJ100Matt says, apparently not having multiplayer in a game hurts a game.
8527139	8529181	Sorry if Legend of Zelda doesn't have multiplayer.
8529441	8531102	Hey, but there was that Four Swords game.
8531122	8532242	That was kind of awesome.
8532262	8533563	Remember that on the GameCube?
8534405	8535026	I like that game.
8535286	8536346	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8536366	8536747	Who's this?
8539008	8539908	It's GS68.
8540208	8540729	Hi, GS68.
8541249	8541809	What's on your mind?
8543951	8545672	So I found out I'm playing DJ Maxx Fever.
8546732	8548913	Oh, the new one in the U.S., the one that just came out?
8549794	8550654	Yeah, the American one.
8551355	8552075	And I know you're a big...
8559446	8562691	But if you're already into the series, I can't really recommend it.
8562771	8567459	I mean, you might as well just get Portable 1 and 2 and get the full silence from both games.
8568920	8581987	I'm kind of interested in your review here, because I know you're a big DJ Maxx fan, so it's kind of interesting to hear you give this a negative review, but what if I'm somebody, because I am somebody, personally, who's not really played a lot of the DJ Maxx game.
8582007	8588911	I have a friend that's obsessed with it too, so I've seen it, I've seen a couple of the videos, I've not really sat down and spent any quality time with the game.
8589331	8593914	Let's say I'm a person who's never really seen or heard of DJ Maxx before, is this a good introduction game?
8596295	8596395	Um...
8597918	8598619	I can't really say.
8598759	8606864	I haven't played much, but... It's pretty decent, but there's one thing that's bugging me about this game, and it's the whole autocorrect feature.
8609166	8609946	What is this feature?
8611987	8625316	Basically, if you press the wrong button for a node, but at the right time, if all is on the same side of the screen as the node is, you still get the full percentage for it, and you still get some points for it.
8625997	8626077	And...
8626929	8633254	I'm on a GameFAQ with DJ Max Feverboard and I'm seeing newbies saying, oh, so you can just press any button to play the game?
8633394	8634835	So what's the point of the notes and such?
8635015	8637497	And that's why I think this thing is a bad idea.
8638318	8639919	That is kind of strange.
8639939	8642601	Yeah, because then you can just go like, do, do, do, do.
8642841	8643722	You can't turn that off?
8643842	8646224	It seems a little silly.
8646744	8656612	I mean, yeah, you get 80% of the points, but you still get full credit as far as your percentage goes, which means you can go on pressing the wrong notes at
8657362	8658351	All the time I still get 100%
8660543	8661784	percentage at the end of the song.
8691156	8704120	It's not as bad as they say, but and groovy.
8705820	8716964	I mean, it is pretty good for a release on its own, but when you compare it to the other releases, it feels kind of outdated, and there's only one or two exclusive songs, and they're not that good.
8717958	8719839	Well, that's unfortunate, I guess.
8720240	8720660	Who knows?
8720780	8723762	Maybe if it sells okay, they'll do another one.
8724003	8724463	Maybe not.
8725444	8726945	I guess a few licenses would have hurt.
8727005	8730327	I mean, hey, they did Classic Edition, which is a licensed game.
8732689	8733069	What's that?
8735151	8739294	I mean, yeah, kind of saying that, yeah, maybe a few licenses wouldn't have hurt the game.
8739354	8743537	I mean, Digimix Portal Classic Edition is licensed.
8745270	8745770	That's true.
8745870	8752573	I was saying that last week on the show, it just needed a little bit of Americanization to help it penetrate the market, even though it might have pissed some of the hardcore fans off.
8752993	8756034	It would have, in the long run, benefited the game because it would have sold more copies, but nope.
8756894	8757335	What do I know?
8758635	8760276	Well, anything else on your mind, GS68?
8763657	8764758	Not much, really, I guess.
8765018	8767318	I got Poppin' Music 13, but eh.
8768999	8771100	And, yeah, I was going to say this, but
8771818	8776642	Maximum 2 and 3 DX came out, but I don't want to talk about it because no one cares about it.
8776742	8777623	It's not that great?
8779905	8786471	It just adds a new course and has 20 more stages and that's about it, basically.
8787552	8792736	Alright, well, if fans of the series then should keep an eye out for that for more stages and all that good stuff.
8793057	8794518	Alright, GSX-8, have a good one, buddy.
8796112	8796572	Alright, you too.
8797233	8797573	Alright.
8798133	8803877	Our resident DJ Max fan calling in to give us the update on what's going on there.
8804918	8812042	I think we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line for now, so sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but we will always open it up again next week to take more of your phone calls.
8812603	8814744	I think we're going to go around and start to wrap up the show.
8815124	8820928	I know it's been kind of a quick show tonight, but you know, there wasn't a whole lot in the gaming news, and of course with the Super Bowl and everything else going on.
8821488	8823890	At least you got stripper talk, if nothing else, tonight.
8823950	8825271	So, it was a good show.
8825491	8825631	I had
8826493	8827635	Did you have fun, Rice Princess?
8828096	8829599	I had a great time.
8829699	8831001	Well, thank you so much for being here.
8831041	8832845	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8833566	8834408	Resident Evil 5.
8835137	8835877	Resident Evil 5.
8835957	8839479	Oh, I should go to Loki though first and ask if there's any last minute stories or he'll yell at me.
8840339	8841139	I'm not going to yell at you.
8841299	8842640	I don't really care.
8843620	8844521	Let's see here.
8845361	8847642	I was going to say, there's a couple things real quick.
8848242	8852524	If you have a launch date 360, it's no longer under warranty.
8853104	8859806	As of February 2nd, year 360, if it gets the three rings of death, you're screwed.
8860306	8862927	And you've got to pay $99 to get the unit fixed.
8863748	8863848	Or...
8864548	8893120	just buy a new one you know or you can just pay someone else to fix it for you for probably less if you pay the $99 to get it fixed is it a new warranty or do you have to pay $99 if it breaks the next day I think it's a one year warranty after that if mine red rings of death again although I didn't get mine I mean I would still be covered I think for a couple more months I'm not sure actually
8893578	8894098	Thanks for watching!
8909878	8933833	Pluckly I think all mine have crapped out the ones that were going to crap out I have one left that's of my original and I have my other one that I fixed so the one that fixes is actually still working very well and then I have one more that like I said that hasn't been replaced yet but all the other ones have so you know four out of six is not a good good ratio no anything else last minute stories tonight
8935780	8936220	That's it.
8936761	8940043	Alright, then Silent Nathan, thank you for being here and being so quiet.
8940083	8942105	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8943486	8947669	You're gonna want to stick with lanolin and not that aloe vera bullshit.
8949310	8949991	Okay.
8952152	8955635	My final thought for tonight is vitamin water is awesome.
8956275	8957576	Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
8960438	8960999	My head hurts.
8961819	8962640	Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.
8963320	8964061	I hope it feels better.
