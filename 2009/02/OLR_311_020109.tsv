0	21240	Today, February 1, 2009, could Wii photo printing come to the US, Gears of War PC breaks down,
21240	32360	and multiplayer comes to the next Bioshock game.
32360	33360	What football game?
33360	36360	Hey, welcome everybody to another week of Orange Launch Radio.
36360	41520	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
41520	43320	and the gamer lifestyle.
43320	49360	And we are always here every week to talk to you guys live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
49360	52320	Joining me for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts.
52320	55220	Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55220	58560	She is on a little vacation, I don't know if you'd call it a vacation.
58560	62520	I think she had family stuff going on up in the lovely state of Washington, but not the
62520	67040	parts like Seattle, Tacoma, like where PAX happens, and the part we were all at just
67040	68040	a little bit last year.
68040	73600	She's in some town called Prosser, which I think is not quite as exciting as Seattle.
73600	76920	So yeah, she's been updating her Twitter.
76920	79960	If you follow DarkSaga on Twitter, she's been updating her Twitter pretty regularly.
79960	83400	It's basically the equivalent of help me, please send help.
83400	85080	I miss Wi-Fi.
85080	86080	Help me.
86080	89840	So joining us tonight, we have a different female perspective.
89840	92080	Say hello to the one and only Rice Princess.
92080	93080	Hello.
93080	95080	How are you doing, Rice Princess?
95080	96120	Oh, I'm all right.
96120	97120	How about you?
97120	98120	Not bad, not bad.
98120	101600	Are you caring about the Super Bowl that's going on right now as we're doing the show?
101600	104880	No, but I'm caring about Resident Evil 5.
104880	108400	Rice Princess just found out that I actually downloaded the Resident Evil 5 demo and she's
108400	109400	dying to play.
109400	110640	Are you a big Resident Evil fan?
110640	111840	I am.
111840	113840	How big?
113840	116800	I've played all of the games.
116800	119800	Even four and one, all of them?
119800	120800	Yeah.
120800	124720	And if I were like a billionaire, I'd recreate the mansion.
124720	125720	How about the movies?
125720	126720	Are you a big fan of the movies?
126720	128080	I actually do like the movies too.
128080	129080	Yeah.
129080	130080	They're awesome.
130080	131680	I heard some rumor, I don't think it made the show well tonight, some rumor there's
131680	134760	a fourth one that's going to be made pretty soon.
134760	137800	Do you think it should keep going or do you think they need to pull the plug now?
137800	140960	It depends on where they take the story.
140960	143920	If they're keep, I don't know, like because this last one that they came out with was
143920	148580	an original story and it was just, I don't know, it was all right.
148580	151560	If they go back to like the game story stuff, that'd be cool.
151560	152560	All right.
152560	154560	We'll also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
154560	155560	Hello.
155560	156560	How you doing, Loki?
156560	160480	Fine, I'm trying to find the Transformers 2 trailer and apparently the link that we
160480	164640	had in our chat room, it's not working or at least it works, but it's not playing.
164640	168880	I see the real reason why people watch the Super Bowl, the commercials and the movie
168880	169880	trailers.
169880	172680	You know, the smart people would realize that you can actually watch commercials before
172680	178560	they come out on the Super Bowl, or at least for most of the trailers and, well not trailers
178560	179560	but commercials.
179560	182920	They actually have a website that had some, I was watching them earlier.
182920	183920	They suck.
183920	187680	Well, some of them suck, but most of them were not good.
187680	192560	Well, also joining us every week is the ever present fourth guest on the show, the chat
192560	197440	room and we have a acidic vampire in chat making a comment about Resident Evil.
197440	200400	Degeneration was better than the live action movies, although extinction was okay.
200400	203360	I really did like every regeneration.
203360	206920	I do want to give a special shout out to the chatters tonight because they are here during
206920	211880	the Super Bowl and so, you know, they're either football haters or they are very loyal listeners
211880	212880	of Orange Lawn Radio.
212880	216800	We only have probably about, you know, there was no Bobby tonight to lead into our show.
216800	219840	He took the night off for the Super Bowl and we probably only have, between everything
219840	222800	that's been going on, probably about a third of the usual listeners we have.
222800	226560	So I want to really thank those folks that were loyal and stay in tune tonight.
226560	232440	I also want to thank, joining us tonight in studio, say hello to Silent Nathan is here
232440	233440	again.
233440	234440	Hello.
234440	235440	Hello.
235440	237000	No, seriously, how are you Nathan?
237000	238000	How are you doing?
238000	239000	I'm fine.
239000	240160	I have a motorcycle.
240160	241760	You have a motorcycle?
241760	242960	What game do you have a motorcycle in?
242960	244720	Because I know you don't have one for real.
244720	248040	Because I would have wanted to ride in the sidecar.
248040	249040	World of Warcraft.
249040	250040	Nerd.
250040	252640	No, I'm just kidding.
252640	256080	Describe to the listeners what having a motorcycle means in World of Warcraft and how exactly
256080	257940	does it fit into the lore?
257940	266080	It goes vroom, vroom, vroom, and then you can make it jump and it's lore-wise...
266080	269680	Who cares?
269680	274200	It's a motorcycle.
274200	278000	How hard is it to get a motorcycle in the game?
278000	282480	It's not hard, it's expensive.
282480	283480	Just expensive.
283480	284480	Did you have to do a lot of quests?
284480	288400	Did you have to save a lot of princesses and storm a lot of castles?
288400	294400	I'm hoarded so I usually have to kill the princesses and destroy the castles, but yeah,
294400	299880	it's at least 12,000 gold just for vendor mats, so it's a lot of money.
299880	302240	Well congratulations on your motorcycle.
302240	306040	One day I will come back to WoW and I will ride in your motorcycle in the sidecar.
306040	307080	It'll be fun.
307080	311480	You have to come back within a month, otherwise you can't.
311480	315240	But if I stay away for three months, then somebody can use the Scroll of Resurrection
315240	318480	on me, and that's the whole plan, actually.
318480	324640	You should actually cancel your account, start a whole new account, and we can be the leveling
324640	327080	buddies and we'll get awesome mounts.
327080	331040	There you go.
331040	334480	Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks in a segment we always like to start off the
334480	336720	show with called How Is Your Gaming Week?
336720	337880	But Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
337880	339440	How is your gaming week?
339440	343740	It was still not that eventful, but more eventful than last week.
343740	350360	More Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, still playing stuff, which is, you know, it's fun.
350360	357520	I'm looking forward to the new expansion they have coming out in I think a week or so.
357520	363440	And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more Fable 2, went and downloaded the expansion
363440	364440	for that.
364440	368480	I haven't got a chance to play that yet, but I went and ran around a little bit and killed
368480	369480	a few things.
369480	371960	I don't know, Fable 2 is kind of okay for me.
371960	375640	Why I decided to download the expansion when it's just okay is beyond me.
375640	377360	I was like, I'm gonna do that.
377360	378360	Wait a second.
378360	380880	Because you're a consumer whore.
380880	383080	But whatever, it's all good.
383080	386280	So I'll probably, I'm trying to get back into that.
386280	392880	And then finally, you know, after trying everything to get Grand Theft Auto 4 to work, I had to
392880	398400	go back and do a system restore before it broke, and hooray, it works again!
398400	403240	After I had to do some more futzing around with it because, you know, I got a different
403240	407080	error message this time, but at least that was fixable, so.
407080	409660	It works again, but the question is, for how long?
409660	412920	So I'm excited about that because now I get to play with the mods again.
412920	414960	You went on such a tangent last week.
414960	419520	Oh, I'm still very disappointed with him because the fact that I have to patch.
419520	421240	They released some patch this week, right?
421240	425880	It did nothing to fix my problem.
425880	429160	And you know, I hear it's causing more problems, so whatever.
429160	434800	You want to hear something funny, and this isn't even on our show roll, apparently there
434800	444320	is issues with Secure ROM's CD activation or authentication thing that they have running.
444320	449040	So somebody had asked them, they had some problems, and Secure ROM just linked them
449040	455400	to a program that bypasses the CD check, or the DVD check.
455400	459160	So which, of course, that person posted that everywhere on the internet.
459160	467400	So now there is literally an official no DVD patch for the game.
467400	472680	So they've made it, you know, pretty easy to pirate the game, I guess.
472680	475840	Well, technically you're not supposed to be able to pirate it because you still have to
475840	480080	authenticate it and the serial number and everything like that to play online.
480080	485560	But trust me, you don't really have to because it's able to be done.
485560	487640	But now it doesn't check for the DVD.
487640	492400	So that might solve some problems, at least some people are having.
492400	497320	But yeah, I don't know, I'm interested to play the game a little bit more now.
497320	505520	Also since I believe this add-on is exclusive for the Xbox 360, however people have found
505520	510400	the models and stuff hidden within the code data or whatever.
510400	516320	So I'll be seeing how they're going to modify stuff for the PC version.
516320	518200	I don't know, PC version is this fun.
518200	519200	All the mod stuff.
519200	522360	Alright, so nuclear grenades, it sounds like you've warmed up a little bit to the PC one
522360	523360	as opposed to last week.
523360	527200	No, I still hate the way that they, no listen, I've warmed up to the fact that I can mod
527200	528200	it.
528200	533480	I am not giving them any, you know, gimmes on the fact that it's just a really poor port
533480	536800	whatsoever and the fact, the way they handled everything.
536800	540000	There is no reason I should have to do a system restore to get a game to work.
540000	542360	That's absolutely ridiculous.
542360	546120	Because that screws up a bunch of other stuff on my computer, so I have to hopefully make
546120	547920	sure everything's working now.
547920	551000	But it's absolutely ridiculous that I would have to do a system restore to get a game
551000	552000	to work.
552000	553120	Any game.
553120	555640	Even Crysis, I had less trouble running.
555640	559520	And goddamn Crysis is a bitch to, you know, work.
559520	564480	And sadly enough, Crysis actually runs better than Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's telling
564480	565480	you something.
565480	570480	And trust me, Grand Theft Auto IV is not Crysis, is definitely not pushing the graphics that
570480	571480	Crysis was.
571480	573720	I think Acidic Vampire in chat sums it up very well.
573720	575400	It's a love-hate relationship for Loki.
575400	577440	It is a love-hate relationship.
577440	580120	You love to hate it.
580120	582120	Anything else for your gaming week?
582120	584280	No, that was pretty much it.
584280	587240	I have to ask for our spin-off show, Orange Lounge Foodio.
587240	589560	You're pretty excited about the food you brought to the show tonight.
589560	593520	Can you tell our listeners about this fine new cuisine of yours?
593520	597920	It's not a fine cuisine, but they have these new things at Burger King called Burger Shots,
597920	600200	and they're basically...
600200	604040	Like when you first said the name, I was like, what popped in my head were like the dessert
604040	605720	shots from Applebee's and stuff.
605720	608160	I'm like, ew, that does not sound appetizing at all.
608160	610800	Putting a hamburger in a glass, nasty.
610800	614960	Putting hamburger and ketchup and mustard in a shot glass, that's disgusting.
614960	616960	No, they're sliders.
616960	620640	They're little mini hamburgers, basically, and you can buy them.
620640	622800	They have a two-pack and a six-pack.
622800	623800	Why would you want a two-pack?
623800	625600	You don't want to get fat?
625600	627600	I don't know.
627600	629600	They're okay.
629600	631480	They're all right.
631480	635680	This is the second time I've had them, and it's just kind of okay now.
635680	637360	It's not as good as their normal burgers.
637360	641920	You don't have the smoky, flame-broiled taste to it, but they're okay.
641920	642920	They're kind of neat.
642920	647120	Isn't it the same thing they used to have years ago, but they were called burger buddies?
647120	648120	I don't remember that.
648120	649120	It was like 15 years ago.
649120	650840	This is when I was a kid.
650840	651840	Burger buddies?
651840	652840	Yeah, something like that.
652840	654160	Like, did you play with them?
654160	656680	No, they were little, tiny, miniature hamburgers.
656680	657680	I remember that.
657680	658680	I used to love them.
658680	660160	Could I have some burger buddies, please?
660160	662080	Shut up, Rice Princess.
662080	663480	Tell us about your gaming week.
663480	664480	Back to gaming.
664480	665480	Rice Princess.
665480	666480	Okay.
666480	670560	Well, I'm going to play the demo of Resident Evil 5, and that's going to be my gaming
670560	671560	week.
671560	672560	Yay.
672560	673560	I'm going to play.
673560	674560	Yeah, very much.
674560	678880	I might turn around, and then suddenly Rice Princess is gone, and so is my Xbox 360.
678880	680800	Or your PS3, because I wouldn't...
680800	683000	I don't think they have the demo on PlayStation 3, actually.
683000	684000	Wait, what?
684000	685400	I thought it was on your PS3.
685400	688560	No, it's on my Xbox 360.
688560	690560	I don't think they released a demo on PS3.
690560	692040	I hate you, but I love Resident Evil.
692040	695520	It was exclusive on the 360 for a week.
695520	696520	Damn it.
696520	697520	Okay.
697520	699440	Well, that means if you want to wait until next week, they'll have it on PlayStation
699440	700440	3.
700440	702680	It's exactly the same game.
702680	704080	Yeah, but it's on an Xbox.
704080	707280	My hands will melt if I touch the controller.
707280	708680	I used to be like that.
708680	710680	I'm still like that.
710680	714600	And then there were a lot more games that came out, and it was a lot cheaper.
714600	716080	I'm still going to play it.
716080	718800	I'm just going to put on gloves or something.
718800	720280	Just pretend it's something else.
720280	723520	I don't know why you have this rampant hate for Xbox, but whatever.
723520	726840	I'm like, Xbox hate is so like five years ago.
726840	728400	I mean, we're all kind of over it now.
728400	730080	It's not hate, it's just extreme dislike.
730080	733560	If you go back into the early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, there used to be plenty
733560	735800	of Xbox hate when that first Xbox came out.
735800	740000	Remember the controller that was so massive that only a gorilla could use it, really?
740000	743680	But now, Xbox is actually pretty cool.
743680	745960	A lot's changed, Rice Princess, within the now.
745960	749600	Except they have never fixed the D-pad, and that is unacceptable.
749600	750600	That's true.
750600	751600	Exactly.
751600	753480	All right.
753480	754480	Let's see, my gaming week.
754480	757280	Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week, kind of a lot
757280	761040	of the old stuff, you know, Fable 2, and same stuff I've been playing.
761040	766040	Next week, though, thanks to a very, very, very kind listener, I've got a code for Left
766040	768800	for Dead now, so I'm going to be playing that on PC this week.
768800	771040	I'm very excited.
771040	775320	And to follow up a question that came up last week, there is an Orange Lounge Radio Steam
775320	779800	community out there, and I was able to find it very easy by going into Steam and just
779800	782200	searching for Orange Lounge in groups, so I joined it.
782200	785360	So there's about 30-some-odd people in the Orange Lounge Radio Steam group, so if you
785360	789040	are a Left for Dead player, you're listening to this show, I encourage you to join our
789040	793600	Steam group, because I'll probably be playing Left for Dead, and I want to play with listeners,
793600	797960	but you have to promise to be nice to me, because I suck at first-person shooters.
797960	801720	So even if I accidentally shoot you and think you're a zombie or whatever, you have to be
801720	802720	nice to me.
802720	803720	You know what they mean in that game?
803720	804720	That would be kind of fun.
804720	805720	What?
805720	808040	Because you know how they, like, mix stuff around, you know, like, Half-Life and stuff,
808040	809720	and it's all in the source engine anyways.
809720	812800	Maybe a portal gun in Left for Dead.
812800	813800	You never know.
813800	814800	That would be kind of funny.
814800	815800	What about the Gravity Gun?
815800	816800	Both.
816800	817800	You never know.
817800	818800	Yeah.
818800	823680	Otherwise, the other game I've been playing this week, kind of funny, I kind of, you know,
823680	827580	we had the whole conversation last week about how I left WoW, but this week I kind of dabbled
827580	828760	in another MMO.
828760	834360	I played Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst this week, which is funny because Sega, like, stopped
834360	835880	supporting that game years ago.
835880	840800	Well, there's a pirate server that you can play on for free, and I'm okay with talking
840800	844760	about it on the show, because Sega kind of turns a blind eye to the whole thing, because
844760	849740	they turned their servers off a while ago, so they just kind of let this thing run.
849740	850740	So it's interesting.
850740	854640	It's kind of tough to play, because they're still, like, I can't do a lot of the quests
854640	859680	because they're all in the Japanese text still, but it's Phantasy Star Online, and it's free,
859680	860680	so I can't complain.
860680	863560	I don't think I'll play it forever, but ah, memories.
863560	864720	Wow.
864720	866880	How long ago did that come out?
866880	867880	Let's see.
867880	871520	If the Dreamcast is about 10 years old, right, Dreamcast came out 9-9-99, right?
871520	872520	I think so.
872520	875640	I would say the first Phantasy Star Online is probably about 9 years old.
875640	876640	Holy crap.
876640	878080	I know, it's an old game.
878080	879080	I know.
879080	884000	But still, I mean, there's not a lot of, like, action-based MMOs like that.
884000	887000	I can't even really call Phantasy Star Online an MMO, though.
887000	888000	I mean, it is and it isn't.
888000	893080	It's not an MMO like WoW, you know, you go off, everything's like instanced.
893080	896500	It's more Guild Wars, I guess, than anything, but it's not even like that.
896500	897500	It's like action-based.
897500	898500	It is pretty cool, though.
898500	899500	Yeah, I know.
899500	900960	It's really stood the test of time, you know?
900960	904360	Even though a lot of people hate on universe, I don't mind universe.
904360	909640	I think I have Phantasy Star Online for my Dreamcast, because I remember I always would
909640	910640	play it offline.
910640	916680	I would never play it online, because I just, you know, I had dial-up at the time, you know,
916680	918240	so it didn't really make...
918240	919880	That'd be kind of hard, yeah.
919880	924600	Well, I mean, they did have a dial-up modem in, you know, Dreamcast, so...
924600	931080	Well, apparently, this server will let you connect the Dreamcast one, the PlaySta...
931080	932080	Was there a PlayStitch one?
932080	933080	I don't know.
933080	934800	The GameCube one, I know, was on there, and the PC one.
934800	938720	You can connect all those together on this one server.
938720	940800	This is Blue Burst, right?
940800	944840	You can use either the Blue Burst client or the Dreamcast client, and it's episode one,
944840	945840	two, and four.
945840	948220	You can play them all together, which I thought was kind of cool.
948220	952880	Just not the Xbox one, because the Xbox one was through Xbox Live, and so there's no way
952880	957360	you can play that anymore, because Sega shut down the server, and you can't really hack
957360	960760	Xbox Live servers without a lot of problems, so...
960760	962280	Well, you can, but...
962280	965600	Yeah, again, it's not something I think I'm gonna play a long time.
965600	968120	It's just, you know, nostalgia's pretty cool, so...
968120	972040	Because, you know, honestly, the cave level gets so boring after a while.
972040	973520	It totally does.
973520	975520	Have you even played PSO?
975520	977520	No.
977520	978520	But I'm sure it does.
978520	979520	It does.
979520	980520	It does.
980520	981520	Okay, I take...
981520	982520	I never got to the cave level.
982520	983520	Really?
983520	984520	No.
984520	985520	You just played Forest over and over again?
985520	986520	Yep, that's all I did.
986520	987520	Oh my god, you must have been bored.
987520	988920	You can do caves at, like, level seven.
988920	989920	You don't have to get that far.
989920	993560	I don't think I played Phantasy Star Online that long, because I remember I tried fighting
993560	998200	the first, like, dragon or whatever it was, and I died, and I'm like, I'm gonna go play
998200	999200	a different game now.
999200	1001920	Yeah, it helps to have friends to do the dragon, but, you know...
1001920	1004680	Remember, I was playing single player, so I had no friends.
1004680	1007240	Aww, poor Loki.
1007240	1010680	Well everyone else had PlayStation, and, you know, the only reason I had Dreamcast is because
1010680	1013520	I wanted to use our all-nighter event.
1013520	1015520	I'm like, oh-kay.
1015520	1016520	Wow.
1016520	1019200	Hey, Dreamcast are still awesome.
1019200	1022320	I mean, because of the fact that you can boot, like, there's a lot of homebrew stuff for
1022320	1025120	Dreamcast with the emulators and everything.
1025120	1032800	I was actually, I'm looking to find a, because I'm not gonna try to buy it, screw that shit.
1032800	1038560	I'm trying to find a copy of Super Runabout for the Dreamcast, because for some reason,
1038560	1045240	like, I thought of this one game that I played before, it's called Felny 1179, that was on
1045240	1048840	the PlayStation 1, and it's a pretty fun game.
1048840	1053960	It's kind of like, not really like Burnout, but it's a racing game where you're supposed
1053960	1059600	to crash into a lot of stuff, like, cause a lot of property damage, and as you'd play
1059600	1063920	through the game, you'd unlock more cars, kind of like Burnout, like ridiculous stuff,
1063920	1068440	like, you know, meteorite cars, buses, and just all sorts of crazy stuff.
1068440	1073080	But Super Runabout was kind of the same game, same type of thing, and it was just really
1073080	1074560	stupid fun.
1074560	1078380	That's a game that you really, you know, make a new one of, cause you'd be left on Burnout
1078380	1080600	with collateral damage.
1080600	1084340	So I need to find that, so I can play that again.
1084340	1086360	Quite a bit of Dreamcast love coming from our chat room.
1086360	1090560	We have Leo Shen saying, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my Dreamcast all the time.
1090560	1092080	I love that game so much.
1092080	1093240	Did you own a Dreamcast?
1093240	1096160	We did own a Dreamcast, yeah.
1096160	1101480	TGM-GS6, there's no easy way to pronounce that, says, I need to revive my Dreamcast
1101480	1102800	so I can play Border Down.
1102800	1107200	You know, they keep releasing these, like, homebrew things, like, every year for Dreamcast.
1107200	1109920	I was just thinking today, actually, while I was playing PSO, cause it got me thinking
1109920	1110920	about the Dreamcast.
1110920	1112760	The Dreamcast isn't even 10 years old yet.
1112760	1117660	You know, it's still, it's not that old of a system, all things considered, so, still
1117660	1120320	pretty interesting, all the things you can do on it.
1120320	1125040	Let me ask Silent Nathan real quick how his gaming week was, and then we'll move into
1125040	1126040	tonight's news.
1126040	1128560	Silent Nathan, how was your gaming week?
1128560	1133680	It takes a long time to make enough gold to buy a motorcycle.
1133680	1135760	So wow wow and more wow?
1135760	1136760	See.
1136760	1138560	Enough said from Silent Nathan.
1138560	1143360	Alright, quickly some housekeeping tonight, and then we will get into tonight's gaming
1143360	1144360	news.
1144360	1147360	I just wanted to say really quick, I have to further apologize to those listeners that
1147360	1151800	listen to us on Justin.tv, because we have no webcam again tonight, but here's the interesting
1151800	1153000	thing that's going on.
1153000	1158440	We actually, a very kind listener over in Japan sent us a webcam, so I want to say thank
1158440	1159440	you.
1159440	1162260	The problem with it though, when we tried to hook it up, we were able to get video but
1162260	1167480	no audio, because the video and audio was separate on it, so we thought it would be
1167480	1170480	kind of lame to just have the video thing on Justin.tv.
1170480	1174560	So I have a cord coming that's going to fix our problems, but it's just not going to get
1174560	1177640	here until this week sometime, because it's coming from New Jersey.
1177640	1183200	So I'm really, really, really, really hoping we will be back up on Justin.tv next week.
1183200	1186480	And yeah, very excited about that.
1186480	1189760	And then when you come over looking all pretty in the future Rice Princess, it won't be for
1189760	1192040	nothing, as you did a couple weeks ago.
1192040	1193040	Yay!
1193040	1194040	There you go.
1194040	1199640	Also, of course, there's no Dark Sakura tonight, but she will be back next week on the program,
1199640	1203160	and no shows off or anything coming up for us.
1203160	1207720	We're just cranking right through up until our seventh anniversary this June, if you
1207720	1209640	can believe it.
1209640	1210640	Wow.
1210640	1212440	Possibly some conventions in our future.
1212440	1214360	I am toying with the idea of going to ASEN.
1214360	1217440	Do you know it's very cheap to fly out to Chicago right now in Southwest?
1217440	1218440	Really?
1218440	1220440	It's like $99 one way.
1220440	1222440	Oh, they're having a $99 sale.
1222440	1223440	That's why.
1223440	1224440	Exactly.
1224440	1225440	So I might go to ASEN.
1225440	1226440	You should.
1226440	1227440	Just for the heck of it.
1227440	1228680	It's in May, and I know some of...
1228680	1229680	That's like the...
1229680	1231920	I've been to the East Coast, and I've met listeners on the East Coast.
1231920	1236160	I've just never been to ASEN's Anime Central, sorry, in Chicago.
1236160	1238840	I know we have listeners in that area, Chicago area.
1238840	1239840	I want to go.
1239840	1241200	I want to do the panel and the whole nine yards.
1241200	1242800	I think I'd have a lot of fun.
1242800	1244560	I'm sure Dark Sakura wants to go.
1244560	1246160	Loki's wife probably won't let him go.
1246160	1248160	Well, I don't want to go either.
1248160	1249720	Who knows?
1249720	1250720	Sorry.
1250720	1251760	We will see.
1251760	1252760	I'm going to try.
1252760	1253760	I'm going to try.
1253760	1254760	Trust me.
1254760	1256760	If I'm going to go to one show this year, it's going to be E3.
1256760	1258640	Yeah, E3.
1258640	1261560	You know E3 registration opened up this week, actually.
1261560	1263840	So we've got to talk offline about that.
1263840	1268040	Yeah, because my wife, I don't think she'll mind if I...
1268040	1271800	She will mind if I go, but she will get over it.
1271800	1274240	I still think we should take her as a special correspondent.
1274240	1275240	She will...
1275240	1277800	See, we've been talking because I have this thing through my work.
1277800	1282880	I have a $1,500 trip we've got to take before the end of this year.
1282880	1288600	So we were saying we're going to go originally to Seattle, and we're going to say, eh, it's
1288600	1290320	not really much that we really want to do in Seattle.
1290320	1291320	Go to Prosser.
1291320	1293640	That's where the party's at this weekend.
1293640	1297880	We were going to go to possibly L.A. to go to Disneyland, that kind of stuff.
1297880	1302720	But I mean, it would be around her birthday, and her birthday is the 4th of June, and that's
1302720	1303960	like the week before.
1303960	1306560	No, that is the week of E3, I think.
1306560	1307560	Oh, yeah.
1307560	1308560	Wow.
1308560	1309560	No, no, it's not.
1309560	1310560	E3 is like June 2nd through 4th.
1310560	1311560	I'm not even kidding you.
1311560	1312560	Ah, fuck that.
1312560	1313560	Hold on.
1313560	1314560	Let me look.
1314560	1315560	Want, want, want.
1315560	1316560	Dude, dude, dude.
1316560	1318560	I thought it was like the 13th or something.
1318560	1320560	Just be like, happy birthday, babe.
1320560	1321560	E3.com.
1321560	1322560	Look at all these video games I gotcha.
1322560	1323560	Entrance into E3.
1323560	1324560	I gotcha.
1324560	1325560	Goodie bag from E3.
1325560	1326560	Yeah, June 2nd through 4th.
1326560	1327560	Ah, you ass.
1327560	1328560	Oh, no.
1328560	1331800	Well, there's no way I'm going to E3 now, so.
1331800	1334560	We'll just be like, but babe, you can get a bunch of swag.
1334560	1337320	Ah, yeah, that's not going to fly.
1337320	1339760	You could walk around a bunch of, like, smelly nerds.
1339760	1340760	Yay.
1340760	1343120	Yeah, that will not fly.
1343120	1346080	You should at least try to get down for one day, get back in time for her birthday or
1346080	1347080	something.
1347080	1352160	Because, you know, the third day of E3 is always like the, I am a zombie today, and
1352160	1355920	just, I'm just going through the motions trying to pick up everything I missed.
1355920	1356920	True.
1356920	1357920	So, think about it.
1357920	1358920	Think about it.
1358920	1359920	All right.
1359920	1360920	I'll think about it.
1360920	1361920	All right.
1361920	1362920	If we can even get in.
1362920	1363920	I know.
1363920	1365360	Hey, you can pull some strings now.
1365360	1366360	You have connections, dude.
1366360	1367360	Oh, yeah, right.
1367360	1371440	No, seriously, like, back when we went in 2005, we were still kind of fledgling, but
1371440	1372440	now you can just, like.
1372440	1373440	That's true.
1373440	1378680	Because it worked at a certain game company that, I don't know if I should say, because
1378680	1382760	I don't know if the game company knows that they inadvertently let us in E3, but we got
1382760	1383760	those tickets.
1383760	1384760	Who cares?
1384760	1389160	We could bring our old badges from 2005 and be like, look, we went in 2005.
1389160	1393040	No, they specifically have made it, like, you have to reapply even if you went before.
1393040	1394040	I don't know.
1394040	1395040	Anyway.
1395040	1396040	Damn it.
1396040	1397040	We'll worry about that in the upcoming weeks.
1397040	1398040	We got time.
1398040	1399040	We got time.
1399040	1400040	We have at least till May.
1400040	1401040	All right.
1401040	1402600	Anyhow, we got to get into the gaming news tonight.
1402600	1403600	Ricky!
1403600	1404600	Get us into some gaming news.
1404600	1410720	Yes, it's not that exciting, but we may be getting a new channel soon.
1410720	1417520	Apparently, there is a trademark, well, this is, I think, coming to Europe first.
1417520	1423200	There was a trademark on the European trademark database that suggests that Nintendo is looking
1423200	1429520	to bring its DigiCam print channel to Europe and potentially elsewhere as the photo print
1429520	1431120	service channel.
1431120	1437080	And basically what the DigiCam print channel is in Japan is it's a service offered through
1437080	1443680	Fujifilm that, of course, allows you to print photos that you save to an SD card and you
1443680	1446780	can upload them off your photo channel.
1446780	1452200	Can I just, like, use my printer that lets me put the SD card right in front of the printer?
1452200	1457640	You can also customize them so that you have Nintendo themed photo albums.
1457640	1463520	You can even order business cards featuring Nintendo backgrounds in Mii pictures and also
1463520	1469080	the business cards available through, you know, Club Nintendo in Japan as well.
1469080	1474100	Yeah, I think it's kind of useless, but, you know, whatever.
1474100	1477920	New services, you know, new.
1477920	1478920	That it is.
1478920	1479920	I guess.
1479920	1483400	Is that something, you know, you're a Nintendo fangirl, Rice Princess.
1483400	1484560	Is this something you'd want to use?
1484560	1485560	No.
1485560	1486560	No?
1486560	1487560	No?
1487560	1488560	No.
1488560	1495320	But if I didn't, I might consider it, but really no.
1495320	1501080	Some other things coming to the future in Nintendo's world is the Wii Fit body check
1501080	1502080	channel.
1502080	1503080	What?
1503080	1506400	The Wii Fit body check channel.
1506400	1509520	It's going to be something that's launching on the Wii in April.
1509520	1513920	I guess what this game does, it uses your BMI data, that's your body mass index that
1513920	1520760	you get from Wii Fit, and you get the step data from personal trainers walking pedometer.
1520760	1524060	This is in Japan, by the way, because I don't think we have that game here yet.
1524060	1529000	And you get some personalized guidance from, like, health experts.
1529000	1531280	Walk more, fatty.
1531280	1532280	Stay healthy.
1532280	1537460	Or they'll probably say, you should actually play your Wii Fit game because we know you
1537460	1539920	stopped about a week after you bought it.
1539920	1543080	Now there's speculation there that, you know, this channel again has been announced for
1543080	1547080	Japan, the Wii Fit body check channel, but they also have trademarked something called
1547080	1548560	Nintendo Active Health.
1548560	1552760	That was something that was trademarked in Europe a little earlier this year, so maybe
1552760	1554080	this is the same thing.
1554080	1555080	Who knows?
1555080	1559520	I think Active Health might, it might be the DS game.
1559520	1565920	The DS, instead of personal trainer walking, it's Active Health or some sort of, I don't
1565920	1566920	know.
1566920	1570720	I could see it, you know, tying in with Wii Fit and stuff and then maybe them doing, like,
1570720	1573880	updates Wii Fit to, you know, incorporate data from that.
1573880	1574880	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1574880	1575880	Update Wii Fit?
1575880	1576880	No, no, no.
1576880	1578240	Nintendo doesn't do updates like that.
1578240	1579240	No, no, no.
1579240	1580240	They don't do patches and shit.
1580240	1581240	Well, I know.
1581240	1582240	They will release Wii Fit 2.
1582240	1583240	No, no.
1583240	1589800	Well, of course, yes, they'll do that, but I'm saying that they'll release this channel
1589800	1594000	and they'll tie in, you know, it'll be able to tie in with the DS game.
1594000	1595000	I guess.
1595000	1599680	Yeah, what, what, what extra kind of tips are you gonna get from these health professionals
1599680	1603320	who don't even, like, see you, you know?
1603320	1605320	These games do nothing about your diet, do they?
1605320	1606320	No.
1606320	1607320	I don't think so.
1607320	1609800	I mean, if you really want to lose weight, it has to be an eating and exercise thing,
1609800	1610800	right?
1610800	1611800	Me, sometimes.
1611800	1612800	Everything I've ever heard said that.
1612800	1614520	You just have to eat less calories.
1614520	1617680	That's where personal trainer cooking comes into play.
1617680	1619040	Personal trainer cooking, mama?
1619040	1623320	No, personal trainer cooking and then they'll, you know, give you recipe ideas and stuff
1623320	1629640	like that and then somehow, you know, your being fat will be attributed to your not being
1629640	1633280	good at math and that's where personal training math will come into play.
1633280	1634280	No!
1634280	1637440	I knew that was the reason why I was fat.
1637440	1642640	Um, AcidicVampire in chat says, so Nintendo is releasing this but not Mother 3.
1642640	1643640	Hmm.
1643640	1644640	Jerks.
1644640	1645640	I know.
1645640	1646640	Just kidding, I love Nintendo.
1646640	1647640	Well, is Mother 3 gonna get you in shape?
1647640	1649760	No, I don't think so.
1649760	1650760	Think of the greater good.
1650760	1651760	Think of the children.
1651760	1654720	Yes, no, would, would soccer moms be interested in Mother 3?
1654720	1655720	I don't think so.
1655720	1656720	Probably not.
1656720	1658680	But a personalized health coach?
1658680	1661840	That's, that's like what every soccer mom prays for before they go to bed.
1661840	1662840	Yeah.
1662840	1663840	So, we'll see.
1663840	1666560	Well, um, there's some pretty cool news.
1666560	1670440	This week they announced that there's gonna be a sequel to Boom Blocks coming out, Boom
1670440	1672360	Blocks Bash Party.
1672360	1675800	It's gonna have some additional levels and some other fun stuff.
1675800	1679920	But what's also kinda neat is they announced- That sounds really close to Boom Blocks Bachelor
1679920	1680920	Party.
1680920	1684720	Now that would make that game a hell of a lot more interesting, wouldn't it?
1684720	1686660	Um, yes, it would.
1686660	1689520	Too bad it's not gonna happen that way.
1689520	1692600	But apparently there's also something else that's interesting about it.
1692600	1694860	It's not gonna have friend codes.
1694860	1700840	There will be the ability to download and upload new levels and rate others, other people's
1700840	1702040	works.
1702040	1708360	And there will not be any additional security measures as far as friend's codes go.
1708360	1715680	But then again, this is an EA game, so, um, you know, maybe they're gonna have that stupid
1715680	1718640	break to sign up for, like, EA servers or something like that.
1718640	1722760	But still though, that's not friend's codes, and, um, that's pretty cool.
1722760	1727120	It's interesting it's taken this long for somebody to finally defy the friend code system.
1727120	1731120	I didn't- you know, I think a lot of us thought it was impossible, that if you wanted to do
1731120	1734260	the online Nintendo thing, you had to do friend's codes.
1734260	1738080	I think what makes this story notable is not necessarily who or what game is doing it,
1738080	1741120	but the whole fact that it can be done.
1741120	1742120	Yes.
1742120	1744960	And the other thing that's interesting, you might remember that there was that rumor before
1744960	1748280	that there was gonna be a major game that would not use friend codes.
1748280	1749280	Here it is.
1749280	1751780	Boom Blocks is a major game?
1751780	1752780	It actually is.
1752780	1754380	It is a pretty major game.
1754380	1758880	It sold really well, the first one, and it's been a pretty fun puzzle game.
1758880	1762520	I'm telling you though, the puzzle games need some tits in them.
1762520	1764320	It's- they would- Like Gals Panic!
1764320	1765320	No, no, no, no, no.
1765320	1767320	I know I've gotten into this on the show before.
1767320	1768320	Gals Panic I fully approve of.
1768320	1769320	Me too.
1769320	1770520	But not all puzzle games need tits in it.
1770520	1775140	If you will remember, Bubble Bath Babes, not a good puzzle game.
1775140	1776140	Nobody bought it.
1776140	1777200	But it was a start.
1777200	1780600	You know, Rome wasn't built in a day.
1780600	1786740	They tried, and you know, I don't know why that was never further explored, but you know,
1786740	1789920	why did Miss Nude World have to stop at 96?
1789920	1791580	I know.
1791580	1795780	And remember in Leisure Suit Larry, they came out with one like a couple years back?
1795780	1798080	Like I thought that did pretty well, didn't it?
1798080	1799080	No.
1799080	1800080	How did the Leisure Suit Larry do?
1800080	1801080	I don't know.
1801080	1802080	But I thought that was like a-
1802080	1803080	But they are making another one.
1803080	1804080	Cult franchise or something.
1804080	1805080	Really?
1805080	1806080	Yeah.
1806080	1807080	Wow.
1807080	1809800	It's just- it's on hold right now because Sierra, which is part of the Vindi Universal-
1809800	1817240	well, the Vindi Universal got bought up by Activision, and you know, all their properties
1817240	1821060	are kind of being sold off and redirected, so.
1821060	1822060	It's still in the works.
1822060	1828720	I mean, it's supposed to be- well, right now I think we had it dated for April, but I don't
1828720	1831760	think it's going to come out in April, but probably this year.
1831760	1835200	And it's Leisure Suit Larry's box office bust.
1835200	1836880	Okay.
1836880	1841080	Because see, this is the little, you know, Larry, and he has to help his uncle, Larry,
1841080	1847880	who's the original Leisure Suit Larry, and they're in Hollywood, and, oh, it's funny!
1847880	1850880	And there's like, cartoony women with big boobs, and-
1850880	1854720	That'll have sex with him eventually.
1854720	1855720	They get drunk-
1855720	1858760	Let's find an audio clip of that song from Miss World, Nude 96.
1858760	1860720	I know we used to have it years ago on this show.
1860720	1862440	Yeah, we've played it before.
1862440	1865240	I know, it's been years.
1865240	1867760	It fits the mood so well, too, for a puzzle game.
1867760	1871920	Anyhow, here's a puzzle game that's going to be coming to WiiWare, it's Bubble Bobble
1871920	1872920	on WiiWare.
1872920	1874100	I love Bubble Bobble.
1874100	1879000	No word yet if it's going to have a level 30 bug that you can't find the boss in it,
1879000	1883240	but actually what's kind of interesting about it, it's been, I guess, published in Famitsu
1883240	1888440	Magazine, and the game looks like it's gotten a bit of an upgrade, it looks like the graphics
1888440	1891920	are, you know, this doesn't look like a port of the arcade, and certainly not the old NES
1891920	1895360	version, so when we say Bubble Bobble's coming to WiiWare, I'm not talking about just a port
1895360	1900140	of the NES game, it looks like some newer version of Bubble Bobble made specifically
1900140	1901140	for WiiWare.
1901140	1905520	And, the NES game pissed me off, especially when you have that special, was it level 99
1905520	1909320	that you had to do something special to get to the levels beyond that?
1909320	1913480	Well, here's the interesting thing, it's going to be 400 stages in this new WiiWare version,
1913480	1918640	it's a full, it's going to have a full recreation of the original Bubble Bobble, some higher
1918640	1921980	difficulty levels if you are so inclined.
1921980	1925760	Here's the other cool thing though, apparently the new WiiWare one, four player local co-op,
1925760	1931280	because you might remember the original was only two, and a brand new enemy.
1931280	1932280	Just one.
1932280	1934240	Just one, but a brand new enemy.
1934240	1938940	Apparently there's going to be download content for this game as well, 200 points a pop for
1938940	1942480	the download content, no word though how much the game itself is going to cost, I imagine
1942480	1943480	probably like 800.
1943480	1944480	Four million dollars!
1944480	1949840	So, but yeah, the download content will be 50 additional stages of high difficulty.
1949840	1950840	Wow.
1950840	1953280	And a unique boss character in each one, ooh!
1953280	1957660	I think that they should go all out with this, release an external peripheral that you can
1957660	1962200	attach to the Wii via USB, and it would be a bubble blowing machine, so that as you're
1962200	1965680	playing the game, you know, it would blow bubbles at you.
1965680	1970840	I've seen those in home, on PlayStation 3, like have you seen this, like in the, randomly
1970840	1975000	in the mall on home, there's bubble blowing machines, for no particular reason, they're
1975000	1976000	just sitting there in the middle of the mall.
1976000	1978280	I think like every time you blow a bubble in the game, they should blow another bubble
1978280	1980960	out at you, I mean that would be kind of funny.
1980960	1981960	That would be pretty awesome.
1981960	1983640	That would be very immersive if you did that.
1983640	1987920	That's like a whole like 4D type of gaming I don't think has been explored yet.
1987920	1990320	Like Bubble Bobble featuring real bubbles.
1990320	1995400	It's like smell-o-vision, but better, I'd say.
1995400	1997240	You need to patent that idea, Loki.
1997240	1998240	Quick.
1998240	1999240	That's alright.
1999240	2004080	I don't think that I'm really going to get my feelings hurt if someone actually releases
2004080	2005080	a bubble blowing machine.
2005080	2008800	Of course then, the bubble blowing machine, it breaks after 30 bubbles.
2008800	2010160	That's the downside to it.
2010160	2011160	That's ridiculous.
2011160	2012160	Very limited.
2012160	2017840	Well, Nintendo revealed their launch schedule for the second quarter of 2000.
2017840	2018840	I have to read this comment.
2018840	2023400	I know I've been reading this guy a lot tonight, but the stuff he's been saying is funny.
2023400	2026280	Acidic Vampire says, Bubbles are fabulous.
2026280	2029240	Makes me feel like Amy Adams in Enchanted.
2029240	2030640	Or Glenda the Good Witch.
2030640	2031640	Nevermind.
2031640	2032640	Yeah.
2032640	2033640	I get it.
2033640	2034640	Alright.
2034640	2035640	Read the damn next story.
2035640	2036640	Alright.
2036640	2040120	Well anyways, not really, I mean, I guess the second quarter, but everything that they've
2040120	2044280	announced so far for 2009.
2044280	2045280	Not a big surprise.
2045280	2047800	Japan, they've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.
2047800	2056000	You know, they have a sequel to, well, what they call over there Famicom Wars, which is
2056000	2057800	Advance Wars over here.
2057800	2061120	DS2 is coming out sometime in, you know, 2009.
2061120	2066800	There's going to be a Tomodachi collection that's coming out in 2009.
2066800	2069400	New Picross game, it's coming out in March.
2069400	2073920	Mario & Luigi RPG 3, which is scheduled to come out over there.
2073920	2075440	Oh finally, an interesting sounding game.
2075440	2078520	February 11th.
2078520	2083520	And then on the Wii, of course they've got their new play control games, Mario Power
2083520	2088040	Tennis coming out, actually it's already come out over there.
2088040	2091280	That was January 15th.
2091280	2098040	This week there's another code R, which is Trace Memory is what they called it over here
2098040	2101400	on the DS, but that's on the Wii now.
2101400	2104320	New play control Metroid Prime.
2104320	2111560	Also Pikmin 2, Metroid Prime is coming out in a couple weeks there, and Pikmin 2 in March.
2111560	2115560	Wii Sports Resort sometime in the spring, of course that's going to be over here as
2115560	2118160	well.
2118160	2121080	Sin and Punishment 2, of course sometime this year.
2121080	2129600	Endless Ocean 2, Hoshi no Kirby, Lion Attack Heroes, that's a weird name, Chibi-Robo,
2129600	2134520	they're going to do a new play control for that in Metroid Prime 2 as well.
2134520	2138920	And then they have some really weird names, oh Cosmic Walker, I guess that's a space version
2138920	2142580	of Endless Ocean, you're kind of space walking.
2142580	2149080	And then Dynamic Zen, Spurn Smashers, and Punch Out.
2149080	2152480	So that's interesting.
2152480	2156520	That's one game that had a lot of people excited previously was Punch Out, the new one.
2156520	2159360	Sometime it's going to be coming out.
2159360	2164840	And then of course in the US, some of the stuff that's already been announced, Fire
2164840	2168960	Emblem, Shadow Dragon, that's going to be coming out in a couple weeks, Pokemon Platinum
2168960	2174280	in March, Personal Trainer Walking, remember on the DS, that might go in with that whole
2174280	2178400	rumor there that that's actually going to come out over here, that update, coming out
2178400	2180560	sometime in 2009.
2180560	2186000	Rhythm Heaven coming out sometime in 2009, actually early April for that one.
2186000	2192360	Mario and Luigi RPG 3 coming out at some point, I'm going to guess probably May for that.
2192360	2196440	How long does it freakin' take to localize a game, Rhythm Heaven's not coming out until
2196440	2197440	April?
2197440	2203360	They were teasing that one at PAX last year, they were playing that.
2203360	2210400	And then the DSi sometime spring or summer of 2009, so that April rumor might actually
2210400	2211660	come true.
2211660	2217480	And then on the Wii, we've got Mario Power Tennis coming out in March as well as Pikmin.
2217480	2219880	Those are both coming out actually I think the same day.
2219880	2223840	Wii Sports Resort sometime in the first half of the year, Punch Out also in the first half
2223840	2231920	of the year, so probably Wii Sports, I'm going to try to guess here, maybe April and Punch
2231920	2236400	Out May or June, or maybe both June.
2236400	2240680	And then Sin and Punishment 2 sometime in 2009, which looks awesome.
2240680	2249320	And then of course in Europe, they're getting Rhythm Paradise over there, which, same game.
2249320	2253000	Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine?
2253000	2254760	Which comes with two activity meters.
2254760	2260000	At least it wasn't Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me, do you know your fire walking routine?
2260000	2265920	They're getting Mario and Luigi RPG as well, Pokemon Platinum sometime in the first half
2265920	2266920	of the year.
2266920	2267920	Who killed Laura Palmer?
2267920	2269600	You better moonwalk to find out!
2269600	2274760	Kirby Superstar Ultra is also coming out over there, and then DSI Hardware sometime spring
2274760	2275840	or summer.
2275840	2281240	And then of course they're getting almost the same stuff as far as the play control
2281240	2282240	games.
2282240	2287600	Pikmin coming out February, that's surprising that they get Pikmin way before us.
2287600	2290360	Mario Power Tennis is coming out in March.
2290360	2292360	Fire Walk With Me!
2292360	2295560	Punch Out, stop it!
2295560	2299400	Punch Out in the first half of the year, new play control Pikmin in the first half of the
2299400	2300400	year.
2300400	2305320	Wii Sports Resort is coming out in 2009, right in the first half, and Sin and Punishment
2305320	2306320	2.
2306320	2311040	Another code R, so they're getting another code, and Endless Ocean 2 also coming out
2311040	2312040	over here.
2312040	2315880	I'm guessing anything that will probably have some more stuff that's unannounced.
2315880	2318720	Obviously they haven't announced what they're going to be talking about yet.
2318720	2328640	E3, and just a thought, probably not going to be interesting.
2328640	2329640	I don't know.
2329640	2330640	I guess there's a couple interesting games in there.
2330640	2335560	Unless they announce Excite Truck 2, in which case I will give them, you know, I will apologize
2335560	2337520	for everything I've said.
2337520	2342720	But unless there's an Excite Truck 2, you know, that's really the only stipulation.
2342720	2347240	Excite Truck 2, or they can get the hell out.
2347240	2352440	Well one game that you might notice is missing from Nintendo's upcoming release calendar,
2352440	2355320	and boy I hate covering this story.
2355320	2359480	File this in the bin of things that we don't really think we ought to cover on this show,
2359480	2363400	but I kind of feel like we have to.
2363400	2364680	Do you remember Bob?
2364680	2369600	Bob was the guy that locked himself in a room in his 100-day protest in an effort to get
2369600	2372680	a development kit for his game, Bob's Game.
2372680	2377080	And he aborted his protest, I don't know, so many days into it because I guess he couldn't
2377080	2381520	take it anymore, and basically destroyed his room was the grand finale of the protest.
2381520	2384080	And no, Nintendo never sent him a kit.
2384080	2387400	Well, some of the audio you're going to be hearing now in the background there is actually
2387400	2394200	some video of them defacing property at Nintendo World in New York City.
2394200	2398440	That's right, that's how they decided to get back at Nintendo for not sending Bob a development
2398440	2402800	kit is that he got some of his friends together who for some strange reason looked like a
2402800	2408560	bunch of foreign tourists that would probably have recruited Bob in the very beginning of
2408560	2409560	the video.
2409560	2410560	Yeah, I saw him.
2410560	2411960	Doesn't he look like a tool?
2411960	2417520	He just, he does just kind of, he does, yeah, he just, he looks like an asshole.
2417520	2419520	I mean, honestly.
2419520	2420720	I don't know.
2420720	2424680	But um, you just, yeah, you see these girls are going into the Nintendo World store and
2424680	2428000	everybody's filming things going on here, I don't know why they didn't call security,
2428000	2433640	but they take posters to the side of the store that say Bob's Game, and they end up, I don't
2433640	2438280	know, handing out flyers to all these people just interrupting, being generally rude.
2438280	2444400	They slip in business cards into a bunch of the different games, they put mock boxes up
2444400	2448960	onto the shelves, and they just basically, generally harass people.
2448960	2453020	And just act like assholes, really, if Jamie was here, she'd be having a field day right
2453020	2456280	now, honestly, she'd just, oh my god, I can't even imagine.
2456280	2463040	Let me add that, okay, for one, Bob's Game, great that you made a game all by yourself,
2463040	2467640	congratulations, you know what, lots of people have done that, and they have taken, you know,
2467640	2473040	their game online, whatever, and you know, we don't really hear too much about it, but
2473040	2476720	the fact is, just because you made a game by yourself does not mean it needs to be played.
2476720	2479320	Look at that, he just dumped a bunch of business cards on the floor.
2479320	2484240	Oh, what an ass.
2484240	2487200	I gotta know what the chat room thinks about this.
2487200	2491520	And then let me say the other thing, his game does not look good, and trust me, he doesn't
2491520	2493280	seem that creative.
2493280	2499120	Bob's Game, really, is that what you're gonna call it, Bob's Game, I'm sorry, I know there
2499120	2504240	is a game actually coming out by Graffiti Entertainment, they're the ones publishing
2504240	2509600	it, it was a game called Black Siegel, I forget what it was originally called, but it was
2509600	2516200	a homebrew DS Game Boy Advance game that they finally did get a publisher because they couldn't
2516200	2520580	publish it on their own, and yeah, it's not one person putting it out, but you know what,
2520580	2524760	they went through the proper channels and got their game published, because he doesn't
2524760	2530660	need to publish this game himself, he just needs to find a publisher to do it for him,
2530660	2535840	and you know, if no one's picking it up, gee I wonder why, and so they're actually going
2535840	2540220	through channels that may be a really small company, but they're gonna get it published,
2540220	2545040	and I think his game could probably get published by the same company if he really tried, but
2545040	2549880	he's an asshole, and honestly, at first I felt bad for him because he couldn't get a
2549880	2553640	development kit, I don't give a shit now, I think he's an asshole, and I fucking, his
2553640	2559560	game looks like shit, it looks like something made with the old RPG maker, and it really
2559560	2563600	does not look good at all, I would not buy this game, especially after all this shit
2563600	2564600	he's been pulling.
2564600	2569560	SSJ100Matt in our chat says, fucking douchebag, even if his game came to the DS, I wouldn't
2569560	2570560	buy it.
2570560	2575200	GS68 says, for fuck's sake, look at Pixel or Nijoro or whatever, they don't get paid
2575200	2580520	for their shit and they don't care, and says this should be an OLR stupid award of the
2580520	2583400	year, and Acidic Vampire says he's being a whiny little bitch.
2583400	2586040	He pretty much is, what is he hoping to accomplish by doing all this?
2586040	2587040	For real!
2587040	2590640	I mean, do you think anybody at Nintendo is gonna, at Nintendo, like executives, are actually
2590640	2591640	gonna hear about this?
2591640	2594680	Oh my, you're doing all of this stuff, we should publish, or, you know, make, put your
2594680	2595680	game out.
2595680	2596680	Oh, I know!
2596680	2597680	It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.
2597680	2598680	It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.
2598680	2602640	He's probably gonna release it as a ROM or something, and still no one's gonna download
2602640	2603640	it.
2603640	2604640	He put the video on the internet.
2604640	2606880	Do you know how stupid that is?
2606880	2611520	Because like now there's video out there of you essentially vandalizing the property and
2611520	2615740	making the scene here at the Nintendo World Store or whatever.
2615740	2616740	You know?
2616740	2618760	You don't think they might come after you?
2618760	2624800	I want you, Miyamoto, to come out with like the Master Sword and just like chop him in
2624800	2625800	half.
2625800	2626800	That'd be awesome.
2626800	2630280	I'm sorry, this guy does not need any more of our time, and to be honest, I don't give
2630280	2632600	a shit if his game ever gets published.
2632600	2636680	And really, you know, release it as in the homebrew community or something like that,
2636680	2637900	because you know what?
2637900	2639520	I don't think anyone's gonna give a shit.
2639520	2643400	The game doesn't look that great, okay, it has all this, you know, gameplay and stuff
2643400	2645800	in it, but it doesn't look that good.
2645800	2646920	It really doesn't.
2646920	2649080	There's no reason that this should be published.
2649080	2653280	Gameguru in chat says, Bob's been blackballed from the video game industry, and you know
2653280	2654280	what?
2654280	2659320	I think, I think the blogs need to stop giving this guy any attention.
2659320	2660320	At all.
2660320	2661320	We should too, so okay.
2661320	2663080	Go ahead.
2663080	2666120	He's a dick face, and he's a crappy game developer.
2666120	2667120	The end of the story.
2667120	2668120	Let's move on.
2668120	2672120	I just, I just want to say though, I just want to say, I want to put a request out there
2672120	2673200	to the OL Army.
2673200	2679100	If you see this guy getting any more coverage on blogs out there or whatever, please leave
2679100	2684320	a comment, email the blog, and ask them to please stop giving this guy attention.
2684320	2685320	It starts here.
2685320	2686320	No more.
2686320	2688280	Bob Chat is banned from Orange Lawns Radio.
2688280	2692320	I don't ever want to hear about this stupid idiot again, and I hope, I hope to hell his
2692320	2695360	thing gets him in trouble and whatever.
2695360	2700280	And if you see him on the street, you should kick him in the junk.
2700280	2701720	I think so.
2701720	2723320	So the OLR banishment of Bob begins here, and now with our favorite segment.
2723320	2725840	Loki would you like to start us off with the FUs of the week tonight?
2725840	2726840	Yes.
2726840	2732800	I guess I FU'd Bob because he's annoying, and honestly I watched that video clip today
2732800	2735560	and I was like, oh my god, really?
2735560	2736880	Are you guys doing this?
2736880	2739800	I mean, you really think this is going to work?
2739800	2742040	You just feel awkward watching it, don't you?
2742040	2743800	It does feel awkward, and I feel-
2743800	2745400	Like those girls have no idea what they're doing.
2745400	2749600	And it's not hurting Nintendo at all, it's pissing off the people that have to work in
2749600	2753560	that damn store, they have to clean up this stupid mess, because you're a stupid game
2753560	2757800	that's never going to get published, and is not any good anyways.
2757800	2758800	So what?
2758800	2762680	You're one person that you made a game, oh my god, you're the first person on earth to
2762680	2763680	make a game before.
2763680	2767760	There's a lot of people that make games by themselves, you know, and they put it out
2767760	2769920	on the Atari and shit like that?
2769920	2774520	That's how the whole fucking game industry worked, and it's how it became.
2774520	2778700	Just because you're one dude that makes a game doesn't mean that Nintendo has to give
2778700	2784840	you a dev kit because you think you're awesome, that you did with one person what a whole
2784840	2786280	team of people would do.
2786280	2787280	But guess what?
2787280	2791440	The game made with a team of people is probably a whole lot better, and it will get published.
2791440	2793160	Your game, not so much.
2793160	2795600	I concur.
2795600	2796600	That's it?
2796600	2797800	Nothing else to say about your personal life?
2797800	2800840	Oh, and those burger shot burgers aren't that good anymore.
2800840	2803440	I'm over- So F you today.
2803440	2806140	F you, burger shot burgers.
2806140	2809560	My F you of the week goes to the Super Bowl for cutting into tonight's live ratings.
2809560	2811360	That's always a bummer.
2811360	2814180	And then I give an F you to phantom pains I have.
2814180	2818520	Even after all those surgeries and stuff and scare I had last year, I really don't want
2818520	2820720	to have pains anymore, so it kind of sucks.
2820720	2823800	Because then it always freaks me out that it's worst case scenario, like I've got cancer
2823800	2828160	or something, and it's just, it's stupid, and I just, I just want to be healthy.
2828160	2829160	For once.
2829160	2830160	You'll be healthy.
2830160	2831160	I hate it.
2831160	2832160	I know.
2832160	2833400	Rice Princess, your F yous.
2833400	2836800	Fuck you to Lieutenant Felix Gaeta.
2836800	2842120	I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but you just pissed off a whole lot of people,
2842120	2845440	and I hope you fucking die.
2845440	2847120	I feel so sorry for that actor.
2847120	2849240	No, I'm sure he's a great actor.
2849240	2850640	He did a lot of voice work for Ronda.
2850640	2853280	You know there's people that don't know how to tell the difference, though.
2853280	2854280	Yeah, I know.
2854280	2855280	I'm not, like, crazy.
2855280	2860680	I just don't like him as a character, but I hope he fucking gets airlocks or some shit.
2860680	2864440	That must be, like, the first gay guy you've, like, really just wanted to beat up.
2864440	2865440	Yeah, I do.
2865440	2866440	Oh my god.
2866440	2867440	I would never be his hag.
2867440	2871880	I wouldn't be like, go fuck yourself out of an airlock.
2871880	2872880	I don't know.
2872880	2874960	But yeah, I'm mad at him, so.
2874960	2875960	Alright.
2875960	2878760	Uh, does Silent Nathan have any F yous of the week, or is he sleeping?
2878760	2881240	No, he's shaking, no, he's shaking his head, though.
2881240	2882240	A simple no.
2882240	2883240	Alright.
2883240	2884240	That's it.
2884240	2890320	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, you don't see Aaron from Snake 360 pulling that crap.
2890320	2891320	That's true.
2891320	2894160	I mean, there's so many great ways for poking on there.
2894160	2895160	He's nice.
2895160	2896160	I'm serious, though.
2896160	2898880	That guy is not the only guy that's programmed a game by himself.
2898880	2904240	Hell, there's been people that have made a, I think, a whole anime movie by themselves,
2904240	2908280	and you know, here are them bitching and stuff, and their movie gets made, and it looks fucking
2908280	2909280	awesome.
2909280	2912240	And I do want to clarify for the chatroom, because they were asking, even though Bob
2912240	2916080	is banned from OLR, you can still say Bobby Blackwolf.
2916080	2917080	That's okay.
2917080	2918600	You can say it.
2918600	2919840	It's part of a bigger word.
2919840	2922900	It's just Bob as far as Bob's game, and you know.
2922900	2926400	There might be a CEO or something of some company named Bob, and that's alright.
2926400	2930040	And if Bob, Bobby Blackwolf makes a game, you can call it Bobby's Game.
2930040	2931040	That's right.
2931040	2933600	You can shorten it to Bob's Game, but you know, that doesn't really work.
2933600	2936860	I would like to see Bobby Blackwolf put out a game called Bob's Game, and get it put on
2936860	2939200	Xbox Live, and then sue the other Bob.
2939200	2940200	That's what I would like to see happen.
2940200	2941200	That'd be awesome.
2941200	2944240	I'm gonna make an email to Bobby later on.
2944240	2948200	Um, oh my god, LittleBigPlanet.
2948200	2950920	You should do something making fun of Bob's Game on LittleBigPlanet.
2950920	2951920	There you go.
2951920	2952920	That'll be fun.
2952920	2953920	We'll see.
2953920	2960080	Um, I wanted to say also, AcidicVampire, sometimes our chatroom joins in on the FUs, and I don't
2960080	2962880	always read in the mall, because then we'd be here for a day, but this just made me think
2962880	2965560	of something that Rice Princess and I were talking about the other day.
2965560	2969560	AcidicVampire in chat says, F you to those damn Snuggie commercials.
2969560	2975000	It's a rope backwards!
2975000	2982760	No, I, okay, for those that don't know what the Snuggie is, we have to talk about this
2982760	2984680	for a minute, because this is important.
2984680	2985680	The hell with video games.
2985680	2988080	I want one of these for when I play video games.
2988080	2990720	Buy a robe and turn it backwards.
2990720	2991720	Done.
2991720	2997000	The Snuggie is a blanket, but it has sleeves on it, because you know how sometimes like
2997000	3003640	your arms are just like, they're under the blanket, and if you want to get some, then
3003640	3004640	your arms get cold.
3004640	3005640	Hypothermia.
3005640	3013200	So the Snuggie fixes those problems, and I want one, because I get cold really easy.
3013200	3015360	You're what's wrong with this nation.
3015360	3017120	Yeah, it's so funny.
3017120	3020360	When I saw the commercial the first time, I was like, what a great idea, but I'm not
3020360	3022800	going to buy anything I see on TV, I'll just wait until it's a target.
3022800	3024640	You know what else is a great idea?
3024640	3025920	It's called a robe.
3025920	3026920	Guess what?
3026920	3027920	It also covers your back and your front.
3027920	3030720	You make it sound like I'm always sitting around my house naked.
3030720	3033800	I have clothes on, but sometimes you need an extra layer.
3033800	3034800	Exactly.
3034800	3035800	A sweater.
3035800	3041080	Hey, I wore a robe with these clothes on right now because not only was it warm, it was comfortable.
3041080	3042080	And guess what?
3042080	3045240	It's not a fucking Snuggie that probably costs a lot of money.
3045240	3049040	And they ripped off the Snuggie off of some other guy that had something very...
3049040	3050040	The slinket.
3050040	3051040	The slinket, yeah.
3051040	3052040	Well, then I'll buy a slinket.
3052040	3054960	I don't give a shit what the name is, I just want a blanket with sleeves.
3054960	3055960	I think it's a brilliant idea.
3055960	3058520	Did you see the what the fuck blanket, the parody?
3058520	3059520	Yes, I saw that.
3059520	3060520	You saw that, right?
3060520	3061520	You posted on your live show or whatever.
3061520	3062520	Yeah, that's right.
3062520	3064000	That's like the best thing ever.
3064000	3069120	And while we're at it, cashforgold.com is a complete ripoff, okay?
3069120	3074600	If anyone can't figure that out, I mean, yeah, you send us your gold first, then I'll tell
3074600	3076000	you how much it's worth.
3076000	3078480	Yeah, we'll wait for you and everything.
3078480	3079480	We'll give you a top...
3079480	3080480	Really?
3080480	3081480	Thanks.
3081480	3082480	We'll give you a top dollar for it.
3082480	3084920	Oh, and by the way, if you want your gold back, it's already melted down, so too bad.
3084920	3087360	Tired of using regular blankets like this asshole?
3087360	3089640	Do they somehow destroy your heating bills?
3089640	3092160	Do you struggle when trying to figure out how to put them on?
3092160	3096040	Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?
3096040	3099600	Well morons, now there's hope with the new what the fuck blanket, the blanket that'll
3099600	3102120	ruin your sex life.
3102120	3103120	That's on YouTube.
3103120	3106720	She looks like a monk.
3106720	3112600	I think I actually posted a reply on Rice Princess' live journal with a picture of one
3112600	3115800	of the happy, happy cultists, because it just reminded me, because they talk about how it
3115800	3118200	looks like a cult robe or whatever.
3118200	3125960	Somebody actually replied, my parents bought one for everyone in the household.
3125960	3130560	That shit is on the ground in the corner.
3130560	3132200	I like that idea.
3132200	3133200	Give it to me.
3133200	3134200	Don't let it sit in the corner.
3134200	3135200	I was like, you should give it to Rob.
3135200	3137200	He'd use it, I guess.
3137200	3138200	All right.
3138200	3141080	Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.
3141080	3142080	Sorry for the...
3142080	3145520	The only thing that I don't like about the robe, though, is it conducts a lot of static
3145520	3152100	electricity, like a lot of static electricity, and it's not funny.
3152100	3153280	And what about the ShamWow?
3153280	3154840	That guy's annoying, too.
3154840	3157200	But that's an actual product that's good.
3157200	3158200	I mean...
3158200	3159200	Well, I've never used it.
3159200	3160200	I don't know.
3160200	3161200	Whatever happened to Sillet Bang?
3161200	3162200	That's...
3162200	3163200	Sillet Bang?
3163200	3164200	Where's the magic bullet?
3164200	3165200	It's like orange glow or something.
3165200	3166200	All right.
3166200	3167200	Enough.
3167200	3168200	Enough.
3168200	3169200	Games.
3169200	3170200	Video games.
3170200	3171200	Games.
3171200	3172200	Games.
3172200	3173200	Games.
3173200	3174200	Anyways, Gears of War PC.
3174200	3177240	I don't know, because there was a little problem.
3177240	3183320	Apparently, there is a Verisign code that has expired.
3183320	3187880	And because it expired, the game will not work past the date January 28th.
3187880	3192320	So if you want to play it, you have to set your date back to before the 28th, and then
3192320	3194080	it'll work just fine.
3194080	3199560	Epic is aware of the situation, and is working on a way to fix it.
3199560	3201000	So soon, it'll be fixed.
3201000	3205280	But right now, it's a minor inconvenience.
3205280	3208080	That's a pretty fucking big inconvenience, actually.
3208080	3211480	What if you just got this game, like, in the bargain bin at a store or something, and now
3211480	3212480	you can't even play the damn thing?
3212480	3214800	Well, then you would go online, read about it, and set your date back to before the 28th.
3214800	3216760	What if I'm not smart enough to do that?
3216760	3218440	Well, then, too bad.
3218440	3222320	Then you go back and take it back to Walmart and go, it's game no work, and then they'll
3222320	3223320	give you your money back.
3223320	3224320	Can you give me a Snuggie instead?
3224320	3225320	That's right.
3225320	3229760	Maybe I would take back my copies of Gears of War PC and get a Snuggie.
3229760	3231440	They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.
3231440	3233960	They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.
3233960	3234960	That would be awful.
3234960	3237920	They should have Snuggies that have, like, patterns on them, like, Sesame Street and
3237920	3238920	all this.
3238920	3239920	Sesame Street?
3239920	3242440	You know, all the stuff from, you know, when we were kids.
3242440	3243440	Yes.
3243440	3244440	Totally.
3244440	3248120	Or you could make your own out of a blanket.
3248120	3251680	But with sleeves, Loki, you're missing the point.
3251680	3253320	It needs sleeves.
3253320	3254760	I have an idea.
3254760	3257880	Why don't you get pajamas?
3257880	3258880	Or a jacket.
3258880	3259880	Or a robe.
3259880	3262320	Pajamas make me feel old.
3262320	3263560	Or like some socks.
3263560	3265720	What are you saying about pajamas, okay?
3265720	3269160	I have a pair of flannel pajamas that are fucking comfortable, okay?
3269160	3270240	And they're warm.
3270240	3271240	And they're warm.
3271240	3272240	Alright, look.
3272240	3277440	Gears of War didn't just make the mistake of not making a Snuggie out of their collection
3277440	3280200	or flubbing the PC version of the game.
3280200	3287400	Apparently, also, the Gears of War 2 Gold Lancer went up on Xbox Live for everybody
3287400	3288400	earlier this week.
3288400	3291080	This was something you were only supposed to get if you actually got the collector's
3291080	3292920	edition of Gears of War 2.
3292920	3295400	And when I say Gold Lancer, I don't mean a car.
3295400	3296400	It's the type of gun.
3296400	3298920	It's the type of gun that you use in the game.
3298920	3304980	Although it would be pretty awesome if you suddenly could use cars to run over the monsters.
3304980	3306480	And here's the other interesting thing about it.
3306480	3311960	According to a representative for Xbox Live, everybody who actually got the Gold Lancer
3311960	3315920	during the period that it was available, they're gonna have the item removed from the game
3315920	3317480	in an upcoming fix.
3317480	3318480	Right.
3318480	3323160	Just like they said the Fable 2 exclusive code or whatever for people to have the collector's
3323160	3324160	edition.
3324160	3326560	We're gonna find out who doesn't have the collector's edition.
3326560	3328600	We're gonna take it away from you.
3328600	3330560	Yeah, that never happened.
3330560	3334600	Apparently, also, the way they fixed this temporarily, they put the Gold Lancer...
3334600	3337760	I mean, they weren't able to remove the Gold Lancer from Xbox Live Marketplace.
3337760	3344360	Apparently, it was still there late last week, but it was being charged a price of 99,999
3344360	3345360	Microsoft points.
3345360	3346360	They do that.
3346360	3347360	They do that.
3347360	3349720	They did that before because they actually have that available and then there's also
3349720	3353880	some maps that were for Call of Duty World at War that were exclusive.
3353880	3359200	This was when they first launched that Xbox.com where you can actually queue up downloads
3359200	3360380	and stuff like that.
3360380	3362080	They had a way that if you go through...
3362080	3366800	Say you downloaded this Gold Lancer or whatever, you can go back into your history, find out
3366800	3371920	what the item or the URL is for the item posted on the internet, then anybody can go download
3371920	3373960	it or go to that link.
3373960	3380360	If it happened to be a free item, you'll be able to download it onto your system or something
3380360	3381360	like that.
3381360	3382360	Something that would be exclusive.
3382360	3384000	They did this originally with...
3384000	3388600	There was also the Banjo-Kazooie thing, the Xbox Live Arcade game that was available only
3388600	3389600	for a limited time.
3389600	3394680	However, they caught that too and they also put it, like, 99,999 as the amount for it.
3394680	3399280	You have to wonder if anybody spends the $150,000 or whatever it would take to get it anyway.
3399280	3403680	Well, there are people that buy stupid iPhone programs that cost thousands of dollars just
3403680	3405840	to have a stupid gem on there.
3405840	3406840	So...
3406840	3407840	Wow.
3407840	3408840	That's pretty sad.
3408840	3409840	Yeah.
3409840	3410840	I don't know.
3410840	3413800	I wish I had disposable income like that, but I don't.
3413800	3414800	You don't?
3414800	3418420	Well, if you did, then you could probably buy some of these new Xbox Live Arcade games
3418420	3420120	coming from Square Enix.
3420120	3424320	Of course, we talked about Yosamin Live, their puzzle game that's coming out with a little
3424320	3425320	angry...
3425320	3427240	I don't know, objects in there.
3427240	3432400	They have a little slime object that's kind of angry looking and a cross that looks angry.
3432400	3434120	It's a whole lot of angry stuff.
3434120	3437840	Actually, it's like, you know, like in Super Mario Brothers how everything has a smiley
3437840	3438840	face on it?
3438840	3442480	Everything has an angry face in this game, so that's interesting.
3442480	3446120	Some other games, of course, that are going to be coming as well.
3446120	3449740	The Crystal Defenders, which, of course, was originally a mobile game.
3449740	3452680	Some other stuff...
3452680	3455560	There are some other games that they're working on too that I didn't really mention the titles
3455560	3456600	for, though.
3456600	3460880	But they do have a lot more ports coming to Xbox Live Arcade and Square Enix is going
3460880	3463600	to start supporting it a little bit more.
3463600	3464600	So that's cool.
3464600	3466320	I don't really know what other games they have.
3466320	3470440	They had a game a while back in Itremaster.
3470440	3471440	That would be kind of neat.
3471440	3472440	Yeah, for Xbox Live.
3472440	3474440	That would be fun, right?
3474440	3475440	Yeah.
3475440	3477380	I wonder if they're still making money on that.
3477380	3478380	You know what I mean?
3478380	3479380	Like the online version?
3479380	3480380	Nah, I doubt it.
3480380	3483400	I mean, it's kind of free money at this point if they do have anybody playing it.
3483400	3487200	I mean, I'm sure it takes like one server to run the whole thing, but, you know, they
3487200	3490400	could release that as like a $10 Xbox Live Arcade game, maybe when you have to charge
3490400	3492960	a monthly fee and they still make a pretty penny off it.
3492960	3495780	They had a game, and I can't remember what the hell it was called.
3495780	3501000	It was, and I'm not even sure if it actually came out, but it was for, I think, the Playstation
3501000	3502000	2.
3502000	3504080	Might have been the Playstation 1.
3504080	3509000	And it was on a demo disc that was, I think it was the Playstation 1 now, if I remember
3509000	3510000	correctly.
3510000	3515480	It was on a demo disc with like, I want to say, maybe if it had been Final Fantasy 7,
3515480	3519680	there might have been some other stuff on there as well.
3519680	3523480	But it was a street racing RPG.
3523480	3525820	But I don't remember what it was called, though.
3525820	3530160	But I remember it had, you know, like racing in it, and it was from Square Enix.
3530160	3531160	I don't remember either.
3531160	3534080	But that would be another cool game to bring out.
3534080	3535080	Who knows?
3535080	3536080	Who knows?
3536080	3539520	And I'm sure there'll be some type of Final Fantasy milking at some point, which is not
3539520	3540520	necessarily a bad thing.
3540520	3542680	Well, they do have Crystal Defenders, which is a Final Fantasy game, so.
3542680	3544680	Alright, I guess there is that.
3544680	3550040	Hey, if you are downloading a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for popular role-playing
3550040	3554000	games, perhaps you've checked out some of the content for Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
3554000	3558360	And Bethesda actually put out a list this week of what some of the top downloaded Oblivion
3558360	3559920	content is.
3559920	3565240	And funny enough, the top downloaded content is Wizard's Tower, is the number one most
3565240	3567640	downloaded content that they have.
3567640	3572280	Knights of the Nine is all the way down to number seven, Shivering Isles number eight.
3572280	3575560	But what's interesting, I mean, because those are pretty expensive if I remember right,
3575560	3580640	but what's interesting, remember all the shit that Bethesda used to get for the horse armor?
3580640	3582880	Remember the horse armor download they put?
3582880	3586920	Apparently that content, all it was, like where is all this other content I'm mentioning
3586920	3591580	is like new levels, new areas to explore, new quests and stuff.
3591580	3594440	Horse armor was just armor for your horse.
3594440	3597080	And it was just a visual thing only, it did nothing special.
3597080	3600360	Because yeah, so and they actually charged a lot of money for this.
3600360	3603600	It was like, at the time, it was an insane amount, I don't remember how much was horse
3603600	3604600	armor?
3604600	3605600	It was like five bucks, I think.
3605600	3607440	It was like five bucks for stupid armor for your horse.
3607440	3611800	Well the thing is, that checks in at number nine.
3611800	3615920	And they claim they still sell some horse armor every day.
3615920	3616920	Wow.
3616920	3618960	Still, even after all this time.
3618960	3623560	Fighter's Stronghold is the dead last entry on the top ten list.
3623560	3627960	You can get Elder Scrolls Oblivion the game of the year edition with the expansion on
3627960	3628960	it.
3628960	3630260	20 bucks.
3630260	3631260	Not bad.
3631260	3633160	I'm thinking about buying it again.
3633160	3634600	For Playstation 3?
3634600	3635600	Fuck that.
3635600	3636600	Who knows?
3636600	3637600	Xbox 360.
3637600	3638600	I didn't catch which system it was on.
3638600	3640760	No, the game of the year edition is on both.
3640760	3643080	So both of them are 20 bucks now.
3643080	3644920	Fighter's Stronghold is dead last.
3644920	3649600	Apparently though, that could be because this thing only ranks the bot download and pay
3649600	3650600	for it.
3650600	3653120	And Fighter's Stronghold was free for a little while, that's why I have it.
3653120	3656400	So probably a lot of people grabbed it while it was free and they never needed to get it
3656400	3657400	again.
3657400	3662400	But was it an Xbox Magazine disc that actually has two of those on there that were paid download
3662400	3664880	content for free?
3664880	3665880	If you want them.
3665880	3667960	I don't know if you still play Oblivion, but you know.
3667960	3669760	There's just so much to do in Oblivion.
3669760	3673000	I mean, god, even without the expansions, I felt like they could, I mean, literally
3673000	3677840	you can just walk around the world and just walk into random ass dungeons and explore
3677840	3678840	them.
3678840	3679840	I mean, there was just so much in that game.
3679840	3680840	I, it's crazy.
3680840	3682280	I can't wait for the next one.
3682280	3683840	It'd be crazy.
3683840	3686160	So there you go.
3686160	3690520	Still all that content for Oblivion is still popular today?
3690520	3695060	Something that's popular, I think, is still Raiden.
3695060	3699800	You may remember those as the wonderful top-down arcade shooter games.
3699800	3706280	Well, Raiden Fighter Aces, I believe, came out in Japan, and it's rumored to be coming
3706280	3707680	out over here as well.
3707680	3712680	Raiden Fighter Aces actually is a collection of three different Raiden Fighter games.
3712680	3717120	They have Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighter's
3717120	3720080	Jet, all on one disc.
3720080	3728800	Well, the rumors are that Zoo Games is actually publishing the game in the US for $29.99,
3728800	3732680	and that's absolutely true, and it'll be coming out the first week of March.
3732680	3737720	Also, Raiden 4 will be coming out around the same time, actually later in March.
3737720	3740480	So a lot of good stuff for Raiden fans.
3740480	3742920	And GS68 wants to clarify two things.
3742920	3743920	He's saying Raiden.
3743920	3746980	Raiden, Raiden, whatever.
3746980	3751800	And Mortal Kombat kind of ruined it, because they called that one guy Raiden, forget it,
3751800	3753920	and says all of this is Japanese-only, right?
3753920	3754920	No.
3754920	3755920	It's coming stateside.
3755920	3758080	These are coming out in the US.
3758080	3759080	And what platform?
3759080	3760080	Xbox 360.
3760080	3761560	There you go.
3761560	3766360	And yeah, Raiden 4 will be coming out at the end of March.
3766360	3767360	Nice.
3767360	3770680	I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are very interested in that.
3770680	3776000	Also some folks interested in everything Banjo Kazooie related, and there's Banjo Tooie.
3776000	3780880	Banjo Tooie is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, apparently a little later this
3780880	3781880	year.
3781880	3786560	Probably about 1,200 Microsoft points, although that hasn't been confirmed yet.
3786560	3788220	But it is confirmed.
3788220	3789520	It is coming out.
3789520	3793400	It's slightly upped graphics and upped frame rate as well.
3793400	3796640	And Stop and Swap is coming over.
3796640	3801200	Apparently this is something from the Nintendo 64 days, where if you got some items in Banjo
3801200	3804400	Kazooie, they will show up in Banjo Tooie as well.
3804400	3808760	So not too big of a surprise, since I'm assuming the first one did pretty well for them, and
3808760	3809760	the game was already done.
3809760	3814400	They just have to do some upgrades and sell it all over again for $15, and people will
3814400	3815400	buy it.
3815400	3818680	Where there's horse armor, there's Banjo Tooie.
3818680	3822080	Okay, maybe it's not that bad.
3822080	3826080	But you know, there's a lot of people who love the Banjo series, and I'm sure excited
3826080	3829480	to play it all over again with the updated graphics and widescreen and all that stuff.
3829480	3830480	So good for them.
3830480	3835200	Yeah, well, if you're not waiting for Banjo Tooie, there are some other things coming
3835200	3837120	out this week.
3837120	3839680	That might be something you want to pick up.
3839680	3844200	I don't know, not a whole lot this week, unfortunately.
3844200	3846560	Starting things off, let's see.
3846560	3852320	We have, for the Wii, Rygar Battle of Argus.
3852320	3853320	Yay.
3853320	3860920	I don't know, it's a port of the Playstation 2 game, and then they've added some Colosseum
3860920	3862280	levels or something like that.
3862280	3864160	So yay, a port of something!
3864160	3867360	That came out like, what, five years ago?
3867360	3869440	Yeah, it was a while ago.
3869440	3871800	So that'll be coming out.
3871800	3880360	And then this week, I know there's some miscellaneous DS games, like some Imagine crap.
3880360	3884560	Imagine, crapping.
3884560	3891160	No, it's really pathetic, the lineup this week, I swear.
3891160	3895440	And then, could that be because we have Street Fighter IV coming out the week after, or is
3895440	3896440	that two weeks?
3896440	3897440	It's two weeks.
3897440	3898440	Yeah, two weeks.
3898440	3901560	Actually, the week after would be Fear 2, and X-Planes.
3901560	3903640	Oh, there's people definitely excited about that.
3903640	3904640	That's for sure.
3904640	3905640	Yeah.
3905640	3910320	Street Fighter II is next week in Japan, but I'll get to that in a minute.
3910320	3914600	Oh, are you done with the US states?
3914600	3917960	This list that I'm looking at is not very accurate, it actually doesn't even have next
3917960	3918960	week.
3918960	3922960	It just skips over next week, that's how pathetic next week is.
3922960	3929920	I'm trying to think if there's, I think Tenchu Z, or not Tenchu Z yet, Tenchu 4 on the Wii
3929920	3934000	is coming out I believe as well, at least I can't remember if that got delayed or not.
3934000	3936560	Yeah, so it's basically Tenchu or nothing.
3936560	3946800	This whole January-February period is usually pretty slow for game releases.
3946800	3951180	The Street Fighter IV thing is kind of a, I get the sense it's something Capcom is kind
3951180	3952960	of trying out.
3952960	3956160	Usually you don't see a lot of big, big games in this time frame, right?
3956160	3960280	Actually, Capcom typically releases stuff in the first quarter.
3960280	3961280	Interesting.
3961280	3963680	Actually, this year they're releasing stuff first quarter and second quarter, which is
3963680	3965480	good.
3965480	3969440	But they are pretty smart to do so, because there's not much competition this time of
3969440	3970440	year.
3970440	3972600	Although this year there's pretty good stuff coming out.
3972600	3975840	But yeah, not too much, this next week is really dead.
3975840	3980600	So we'll wait for the week after that where we actually get into the meat of things, and
3980600	3983440	it'll start picking up from there all the way through March.
3983440	3985960	Alright, let's talk about Japanese release dates.
3985960	3988920	Luckily it looks a little better over there for the Japanese release dates.
3988920	3992920	On the Xbox 360, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box set, makes this way, and I'm assuming
3992920	3996600	that's just all the special download stuff we got here.
3996600	4002120	It's the Burnout plus the ultimate party thing that they've got that's going to be a download
4002120	4003120	next week.
4003120	4004120	Basically all the extra crap.
4004120	4007640	You can get that in Japan this week on February the 5th for the Xbox 360.
4007640	4011220	Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles comes out on the 5th.
4011220	4015120	If you head over to the place, it's racing fun on the Xbox 360 this week.
4015120	4020160	By the way, Street Fighter IV is next week, but I'll remind you about that next week.
4020160	4024360	On the PlayStation 3, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box also there, as well as Midnight
4024360	4025360	Club Los Angeles.
4025360	4029580	You also get Shaun White snowboarding, and Demon's Souls is a game that's coming out
4029580	4033000	from Sony on the PlayStation 3.
4033000	4034780	It's... what are you laughing at over there?
4034780	4037400	And Demon's Souls you get.
4037400	4039360	It's apparently a pretty big release.
4039360	4041480	It's an RPG coming out.
4041480	4043000	Demon's Souls!
4043000	4047480	I sure... but... shut up.
4047480	4049640	For that, I'm not going to tell you anything more about Demon's Souls.
4049640	4050640	You'll just have to.
4050640	4051640	It will forever be a mystery.
4051640	4052640	Oh, no.
4052640	4053640	No, please, Rob.
4053640	4054640	Tells you about Demon's Souls.
4054640	4055640	Well, it's an RPG made by Sony.
4055640	4056640	I think it's pretty... alright.
4056640	4062160	On the Nintendo Wii, another code R. Kyoku no Tobira is coming out from Nintendo.
4062160	4064440	D-Terminal and AV-Cable.
4064440	4065440	That's right.
4065440	4067800	If you need a new AV-Cable, you can get that this week.
4067800	4069280	Well, D-Terminal's pretty cool.
4069280	4072160	I've been waiting for years for that to come out.
4072160	4073160	Finally.
4073160	4077160	Well, the D-Terminal's cool because, I mean, you know, if you want to hook it up to a PC
4077160	4079120	monitor, that's the only way you can do it, really.
4079120	4083200	I've got to say, though, this another code R game actually sounds kind of cool.
4083200	4084400	Is this just Lost in Blue?
4084400	4085920	No, it's just Trace Memory.
4085920	4087160	Oh, it's Trace Memory.
4087160	4089960	Oh, okay, because I got confused when I looked at the thing.
4089960	4091960	This game actually sounds kind of cool.
4091960	4092960	The first one was really slow.
4092960	4093960	You know what's weird?
4093960	4094960	I thought that game has been out for a while.
4094960	4095960	No, it's just coming out of the game.
4095960	4098840	At least I've seen it floating around for a while, but, you know, I could be wrong.
4098840	4100840	I've been thinking of the DS version.
4100840	4101840	I think you are.
4101840	4102840	Yeah, I think you are.
4102840	4105360	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, nothing.
4105360	4108840	There's one game getting a price reduction, Momotaro Densetsu 16.
4108840	4109840	That's it.
4109840	4111400	And nothing else is new.
4111400	4112680	Nintendo DS is a little different.
4112680	4117180	There is some new stuff coming out, but it's mostly like covers and pouches and things
4117180	4118180	like that.
4118180	4122960	But there is a game called Destiny Links coming out from Bandai Namco, and it's an RPG, of
4122960	4123960	course.
4123960	4130560	And you get your character and you sail forth to Amazia, the island of happiness.
4130560	4135080	That sounds like a destiny I want.
4135080	4137080	I'm not making it up.
4137080	4139800	Can't wait to get to Amazia.
4139800	4140800	Amazia.
4140800	4141920	I believe that's it.
4141920	4145480	I'm trying to look at PSP really quick and see if there's anything there.
4145480	4150920	Midnight Club LA Remix, Shaun White Snowboarding, and DJ Max Fever, by the way, is supposed
4150920	4151920	to be coming out in the US.
4151920	4155640	I think it did already hit the US, but it got delayed some places because of the snowstorms
4155640	4156640	that were going on, right?
4156640	4158280	Yeah, fucking ice storms.
4158280	4159600	Some people got their hands on it.
4159600	4161560	Hey, let's go to Europe real quick.
4161560	4164840	Since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll go ahead and read the Europe dates for you.
4164840	4170560	Now, see, Japan and the US were kind of slow, but Europe has a big week ahead.
4170560	4174960	For February 6th, they're getting Burnout Paradise on the PC, Castlevania Order of Aclatia
4174960	4180000	on the DS, Chrono Trigger finally hits on the DS for those folks in Europe, Gauntlet
4180000	4185980	on the DS, Lost in Blue 3 on the DS, New Play Control Peekman comes out on the Wii, Raven
4185980	4193280	Squad hits the Xbox 360 and PC, Rise of the Argonauts hits PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, Shell
4193280	4200960	Shock 2, fucking tongue twister, Shell Shock 2 Blood Trails comes out on 360, PS3 and PC,
4200960	4204360	and Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine on the DS?
4204360	4206680	Do you know that you're walking right now?
4206680	4211920	Isn't it funny that even when we get the crap game, so do Europe, but when we get a great
4211920	4214520	game like Chrono Trigger, they have to wait like three months for it.
4214520	4215520	You poor guys.
4215520	4216520	Well, they got Pikmin.
4216520	4222320	See, they're gonna get the port of Pikmin now, and we're gonna get the new Zelda months
4222320	4223600	before they will.
4223600	4224600	Yeah.
4224600	4225600	That's fair.
4225600	4226600	Go Nintendo.
4226600	4227600	I'm sorry.
4227600	4229840	Boy oh boy.
4229840	4235320	You know what else is equally awesome as, you know, delays and stuff like that?
4235320	4243280	Rock band receiving some brand new tracks from Nickelodeon's High School Musical-esque
4243280	4251200	movie, Spectacular, yes, there's two songs from the film, Break My Heart and Don't Tell
4251200	4252200	Me.
4252200	4258160	They're both available for the equivalent of one dollar on your Xbox Live Marketplace
4258160	4261640	or PlayStation Network.
4261640	4269720	And of course, if you happen to wait until March 31st for the DVD release of Spectacular,
4269720	4274040	there will also be a redemption code for a free download of the two songs via the rock
4274040	4275220	band music store.
4275220	4293920	And if you're curious what this sounds like, it's not terrible.
4293920	4294920	Yes, it is.
4294920	4296720	I don't think I'd pay money for it though.
4296720	4300480	It's not terrible, but it is terrible.
4300480	4303480	Shut up.
4303480	4307160	It's interesting how diverse rock band is getting, I mean, we have the country stuff
4307160	4309360	and now we get the tween stuff.
4309360	4314880	The thing is, it's not anything that you have to download, but I do appreciate the option
4314880	4318680	of being able to download something like this, because that means that they can release other
4318680	4322960	things that are of other genres that, you know, may appeal to me a little bit more.
4322960	4327400	I mean, at least they're willing to put it up there, then to just say, oh, we're just
4327400	4328900	going to put out more, you know.
4328900	4334800	The entire chat room is crying out in pain at what we just played, especially because
4334800	4338520	you won't hear this on the podcast because the podcasts are mono sound, but when it played
4338520	4342080	live, that YouTube, for whatever reason, was left channel only.
4342080	4345460	So people are like, ah, my right ear is bleeding.
4345460	4353120	By the way, you have your headset on backwards because that YouTube was left channel only.
4353120	4358960	Dark Tetsuya pours bleach on his speakers, Leo Shen, my ears are bleeding now, damn it.
4358960	4361760	Alright fine, I guess there's not a lot of people that are going to be downloading the
4361760	4363160	Spectacular songs.
4363160	4364960	But it's spectacular.
4364960	4367120	But it's spectacular.
4367120	4371520	Also Spectacular is a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
4371520	4376040	We like to pay a little respect to the classic games, and it's a little segment we do here
4376040	4378720	on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.
4378720	4384760	Of course, Dark Soccer is the one that usually does this segment, but she's not here tonight,
4384760	4387200	so we have no game that she picked.
4387200	4391080	I decided to pick one for us, but you know, I kind of picked one collectively for all
4391080	4396200	of us to kind of match, you know, there is a certain something going on right now in
4396200	4400200	the world, you know, there's that big game, I guess they throw a ball around and all this
4400200	4401200	stuff.
4401200	4405320	No, no, of course, we are taping the same day as the Super Bowl, and when you talk football
4405320	4410480	and you talk video games, there really is one classic video game you have to recognize,
4410480	4412440	and that is this week's Classic Game of the Week.
4412440	4413760	Blades of Steel.
4413760	4414760	No.
4414760	4418360	Tecmo Bowl is this week's Classic Game of the Week.
4418360	4419760	Yay.
4419760	4427440	That's right, the wonderful 8-bit sounds of Tecmo Bowl on the NES.
4427440	4432520	I chose purposefully not to do Tecmo Super Bowl tonight, I did Tecmo Bowl, the old school
4432520	4436440	game, because this is, you know, a little more of a classic, and this is, I played this
4436440	4441240	game a hell of a lot growing up, you know, and I know we like to think that Rob plays
4441240	4445360	like no sports games and hates them all, but there are a few, few and far between that
4445360	4448520	will come along once in a while to get my attention, and Tecmo Bowl was one of them.
4448520	4450280	So let's learn a little bit about Tecmo Bowl.
4450280	4454280	Tecmo Bowl was actually based off an arcade game, an arcade version of Tecmo Bowl.
4454280	4457200	I should be noted, that's not what we're citing as the Classic Game of the Week, because I've
4457200	4463000	played the arcade version in a compilation that was on the Xbox, Tecmo Classic Arcade,
4463000	4465280	and it stinks compared to the one on the NES.
4465280	4468560	It doesn't seem to move as quickly, I just don't care for it.
4468560	4472880	So Tecmo Bowl on the NES is our Classic Game of the Week.
4472880	4477720	You've probably seen this before, it was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 12, 2007,
4477720	4484440	but the original came out in 1989 after the original arcade version was released in 1987.
4484440	4489640	The arcade version had this big two monitor setup so that four people could play, but
4489640	4492600	the NES version was way scaled down because it was only two players.
4492600	4496640	You could do three modes, one player, two player, or just a coach mode where you would
4496640	4498760	pick all the plays.
4498760	4503040	The playbook only has four offensive plays, or if you're on defense, you kind of try to
4503040	4507000	pick the play that you think the offense is going to pick, and you did it with this combination
4507000	4509480	of the controller and the buttons.
4509480	4512800	Tecmo Bowl isn't a perfect game though, it was a little better than Ten Yard Fight, which
4512800	4516600	was one of the only other football games that was out at the time.
4516600	4519800	Apparently almost any pass that you throw to a covered receiver is going to end up an
4519800	4521320	interception.
4521320	4525620	If you use the New York Giants, and you use Lawrence Taylor, apparently you can pretty
4525620	4531680	much block almost all kicks, and apparently San Francisco has a play that is usually unstoppable
4531680	4536720	against almost any defense, and I used to win every time with San Francisco and I think
4536720	4538000	that's probably why.
4538000	4541560	By the way, you wouldn't actually be playing as the New York Giants though in the game
4541560	4546280	because they didn't have the licensing from the NFL to actually use the names of the teams,
4546280	4551200	so when you selected teams, you were just Indianapolis, or San Francisco, or New York.
4551200	4555920	But it was weird, they had certain teams in the game but not certain others.
4555920	4561640	For instance, you don't have, you know, the Steelers.
4561640	4565640	I don't know if that has to do with the whole NFL layup, I don't know, forget it.
4565640	4570120	But anyway, I don't know enough about football to understand the whole thing behind that,
4570120	4575360	but you do get the players, and they are all in the game, and you know, it was the old
4575360	4578960	8-bit NES days, they didn't really look any different, it's just that you had the different
4578960	4579960	names.
4579960	4583120	However, if you downloaded this on the Virtual Console version, you didn't get the names
4583120	4587800	because the licensing had expired, so they actually removed all the names from the version
4587800	4591520	that came out for Virtual Console, which kind of stinks, if you think about it.
4591520	4596160	By the way, there was also a version on mobile phones that was released in 2004, and apparently
4596160	4598600	they are bringing this series back.
4598600	4601920	Tecmo Bowl Kickoff, I don't know if this came out yet, but that was supposed to be coming
4601920	4607440	out on the DS, but I don't know if that ever did actually come out, or is still on its
4607440	4612720	way out, but I think it, I can't remember if it came out in November or not, it was
4612720	4616000	originally going to come out in November.
4616000	4620880	You know what, it just, it just isn't the old school 8-bit version, so, you know, and
4620880	4625080	I know there's a lot of people very partial to Tecmo Super Bowl, but I just, I have to
4625080	4629720	take a minute to just recognize the greatness of the classic NES version, you're actually
4629720	4630720	nodding your head, Rice Princess.
4630720	4631720	Uh, yes, it did come out.
4631720	4632720	Oh, it did come out?
4632720	4633720	When did it come out?
4633720	4636320	Uh, not too long ago, but it's available for 20 bucks.
4636320	4637320	There you go.
4637320	4638320	Apparently it just price dropped.
4638320	4640200	Rice Princess, were you a fan of Tecmo Bowl?
4640200	4641200	No.
4641200	4642200	No?
4642200	4643200	Okay.
4643200	4646200	Were there any sports games that you played?
4646200	4651680	Um, I liked this about Tecmo Bowl too, was that it had like little cinematics, when you
4651680	4655200	had to touch down, it was like high five and super slow motion because we don't really
4655200	4661080	have movies, and this halftime show, whoa, I know, cinematic halftime show is pretty
4661080	4662080	awesome.
4662080	4667760	It's like Ninja Gaiden, but with the ball, I was nodding my head because I'm concurring
4667760	4674880	with your point about like, um, paying homage to like the older original versions and stuff
4674880	4675880	like that.
4675880	4680480	Personally, if I were to pick a, you know, an NFL game that was going to be my, um, you
4680480	4685120	know, pick for something like this today, NFL Blitz, I knew it.
4685120	4687480	All right, fair enough.
4687480	4690240	Maybe next year, maybe during next Super Bowl, we'll see.
4690240	4691240	But that's it for now.
4691240	4694960	It's your classic game of the week, Tecmo Bowl here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4694960	4697920	And with that, it's going to bring part A of our show to a close tonight, but don't
4697920	4702000	go anywhere because we're going to be just right back in a few seconds with part B. If
4702000	4703960	you're listening on the podcast, it only takes a few seconds.
4703960	4706960	You hear that little doo, doo, doo, doo, and then it's right back into part B. But if you're
4706960	4710440	listening live, this is the point where we, uh, take a little bit longer of a break to,
4710440	4717920	you know, get a drink of water, use the restroom, toilet bowl, not the toilet Super Bowl.
4717920	4721160	And this will actually be, it's very special this week, our break, because this will be
4721160	4726440	try to restrain a rice princess from my Xbox 360 for 10 minutes during the break.
4726440	4728480	So we'll see how that works.
4728480	4739040	We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4739040	4742920	Hi and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the
4742920	4743920	1st of 2009.
4743920	4748160	You know, there's a big football game going on today, but we're here doing a show anyway.
4748160	4749160	It's over actually.
4749160	4750160	The Steelers won.
4750160	4751160	Apparently it was really exciting.
4751160	4756680	I guess there was like a, a big run to a touchdown or things like, you can totally tell.
4756680	4761240	I don't know dick about football when you play football, although I do love tech mobile
4761240	4764560	as you saw there at the end of part a, but we're back now with more of Orange Lounge
4764560	4769360	Radio and we have a plenty more news stories to get to dark soccer is not here tonight
4769360	4770360	if you're just tuning in.
4770360	4774000	Cause we've had people slowly tuning as, as people realize it's over on the game.
4774000	4776440	Uh, we have more and more people slowly tuning in tonight.
4776440	4777440	Dark soccer is not here tonight.
4777440	4782240	She has some family errands to take care of and lovely Prosser Washington, which I think
4782240	4783960	is towards the South of Washington.
4783960	4784960	I'm not sure.
4784960	4785960	I don't live there.
4785960	4788800	Um, but she's, she's not that close to Seattle.
4788800	4789800	That's what she told me.
4789800	4791160	It's not that close to Seattle.
4791160	4792800	Um, but we're still here.
4792800	4797160	Rice princess is here tonight, uh, helping to fill in and give us some sarcasm and wit
4797160	4800480	as she usually does, or at least attempts to do.
4800480	4803520	And silent Nathan is also here, but he wouldn't know cause he doesn't say much, but he is
4803520	4806840	here wearing his hoard hat, uh, showing his pride for the hoard.
4806840	4807840	I'm wearing my Alliance sweater.
4807840	4809920	Oh, do you two like fight for real over?
4809920	4810920	Awesome.
4810920	4815100	Oh, too bad we don't have a webcam, but we will have it next week.
4815100	4817720	Cause there's a cord coming from New Jersey.
4817720	4818720	I found out.
4818720	4819720	Woo.
4819720	4820720	Woo hoo.
4820720	4822840	All right, let's get back into some gaming news.
4822840	4824960	Loki's here to deliver the news as always.
4824960	4825960	What's up, Loki?
4825960	4826960	Uh, not much.
4826960	4831320	Um, there will be some new download content coming out for the new Prince of Persia game.
4831320	4834480	Um, this takes place after the end of the game.
4834480	4840200	It's going to be the epilogue download content and it will kind of further develop the relationship
4840200	4845400	between the two main characters and also have them, um, you know, going after our new enemy,
4845400	4846400	the shape shifter.
4846400	4848320	Are they going to do it yet?
4848320	4849560	I don't think so.
4849560	4853640	And then it's apparently the shape shifter is an enemy that takes the form of two of
4853640	4858120	Eremon's most fearsome lieutenants, the warrior and the hunter.
4858120	4862760	And it's as though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player.
4862760	4866720	It will require a particular strategy to defeat the shape shifter, rewarding the player that
4866720	4870600	takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the epilogue.
4870600	4874480	Will I get to have more conversations with the chick that always saves me from falling
4874480	4875480	to my death?
4875480	4876480	Uh, possibly.
4876480	4877480	Awesome.
4877480	4882360	And, uh, of course, you know, they're going to have the sprinting offensive and Elika
4882360	4887480	is going to get the new energized power, which will allow her to temporarily, um, temporarily
4887480	4890560	restore a piece of destroyed environment.
4890560	4891560	Huh.
4891560	4893720	That'd be interesting.
4893720	4897480	Will, uh, will the game still help me every step of the way by telling me what buttons
4897480	4898480	to push?
4898480	4899480	Maybe.
4899480	4900480	Awesome.
4900480	4902600	Uh, the download content will be available though on February 26th.
4902600	4904160	All right.
4904160	4905160	Check that out.
4905160	4906160	How much do they have price for that?
4906160	4907160	No price yet.
4907160	4910560	So, uh, somewhere between five and $10.
4910560	4911560	I'm guessing.
4911560	4917220	Well, something that does have a price, a pretty high price, 8,190 yen, they are going
4917220	4918220	to charge to this.
4918220	4920020	That's 90 American dollars.
4920020	4925680	They are charging for the last remnant on PC, and this is according to Famitsu Magazine.
4925680	4927600	There is a PC port of the last remnant.
4927600	4930520	This was a role playing game that was put on the Xbox 360.
4930520	4932200	They hit kind of mixed reviews.
4932200	4935360	Um, some of our listeners have been saying pretty favorable things about this.
4935360	4937040	I haven't checked this game out myself yet.
4937040	4941160	Um, but if you don't own an Xbox 360 and you want to check this out on PC, um, you might
4941160	4945120	be in luck because it is coming in Japan on April 9th, but it is going to have that pretty
4945120	4946120	high price tag.
4946120	4948960	And then when you count importing fees on top of that or what have you, although of
4948960	4951960	course, I'm sure if you wanted to go to darker places on the internet, you could probably
4951960	4952960	get it for free.
4952960	4956960	Um, but I don't know, you know, it's going to be all in Japanese, so who knows?
4956960	4962160	Um, apparently though, it's going to actually give you some extra stuff in the PC version.
4962160	4964720	You can speed up battle animations now.
4964720	4967880	Um, it will have more leader class characters.
4967880	4971960	You can preview equipment in the menu and you can actually switch between Japanese and
4971960	4972960	English.
4972960	4976080	So maybe you won't need to patch much more than the menus to get this.
4976080	4978360	So, and Rama is in chat and says it's a great game.
4978360	4981840	He says, last remnant, great game at comment coming from our chat room, chat dot orange
4981840	4982840	launch radio.com.
4982840	4985440	If you're just joining us post super bowl, you should come join us as long as it's easier
4985440	4990120	to install and have run than grand theft auto four.
4990120	4992360	By the way, one other quick thing I want to say about this game.
4992360	4996160	This is the game that a square enix took the unreal engine for.
4996160	4999200	Remember you might remember a few years back, there was a big news story that square enix
4999200	5001200	had purchased the unreal engine for something.
5001200	5002280	This is that game.
5002280	5007160	So you can see it in motion on the PC in the last remnant.
5007160	5012400	Apparently it was un-really disappointing.
5012400	5015240	That's a mixed mixed bag, mixed bag of opinions.
5015240	5016240	Yeah.
5016240	5020720	Well, something that might be a little bit better, hopefully are some sequels to some
5020720	5023980	well known capcom franchises.
5023980	5030240	There was some talk about brand new dead rising game and a lost planet game and that they
5030240	5034300	may possibly be multi platform.
5034300	5039200	This of course is coming from an issue of Famitsu magazine with an interview with the
5039200	5046520	capcom executive Kenji Inafune and of course he mentioned of course new dead rising lost
5046520	5047520	planet games.
5047520	5052840	I mean, not a big surprise since you know capcom dead rising did very well for them
5052840	5057660	and you know they're making a lost planet movie for god's sake so not a big surprise
5057660	5062240	that we'll see some new games and the fact that they'll be multi platform is not a shock
5062240	5063240	either.
5063240	5066440	Cool, hopefully those are soon.
5066440	5068940	Hopefully we'll see those at E3.
5068940	5071440	It's interesting to think about what kinds of stuff we're really going to see come out
5071440	5075640	of E3 this year because there's been a lot of, it's been fairly quiet all things considered.
5075640	5079160	I'm thinking this year's E3 is going to be pretty big especially with the whole return
5079160	5084520	to E3's roots even though they say not really but you know that whole thing.
5084520	5085520	We'll see.
5085520	5090500	Also, but capcom is all about the multi porting too so I'm sure if these things are coming
5090500	5093360	out they're going to be everywhere on every platform right?
5093360	5095720	There you go.
5095720	5100100	Alright let's see, let's talk about Bioshock 2 another game that's probably going to get
5100100	5101560	some attention at E3.
5101560	5104800	I'm almost positive they've got to be showing more of this game at E3 this year.
5104800	5109440	Bioshock 2 the Sea of Dreams, or I'm sorry Sea of Dreams there's no V in there.
5109440	5114040	But Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams is actually going to finally add something that was missing
5114040	5117400	from the first Bioshock and what was missing from the first Bioshock for being a first
5117400	5118400	person shooter?
5118400	5119400	Multiplayer.
5119400	5120600	That's right.
5120600	5124040	Apparently this is all according to some recent job listings that were discovered.
5124040	5128080	The Bioshock team is looking for some multiplayer gameplay experts.
5128080	5131520	They're looking for some people who know how to extend and enhance the Unreal Engine 3
5131520	5137560	with proprietary networking technology to address gameplay performance and so on.
5137560	5143240	As somebody who can deliver a robust, scalable and responsive multiplayer gameplay code and
5143240	5147300	backend services for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms.
5147300	5151480	So unless there's some top secret unannounced project going on here, you can almost count
5151480	5155340	on the fact that Bioshock 2 is going to have multiplayer in it.
5155340	5157600	Which is something the first one was pretty lacking.
5157600	5159800	Although honestly, I mean it didn't need it.
5159800	5163380	Bioshock was a hell of a first person shooter game.
5163380	5167080	You know that even people that don't play a lot of first person shooters like me can
5167080	5168080	get into.
5168080	5172760	Because it was almost like Silent Hill-ish in how scary it was, at least for me.
5172760	5174700	Kind of the psychological element of the game.
5174700	5179360	So it's going to be interesting to see what multiplayer does to all that.
5179360	5183760	Then that gets me thinking, since I invoked Silent Hill in that last story, why did we
5183760	5185400	never get like a multiplayer Silent Hill?
5185400	5187240	Wouldn't that be kind of interesting?
5187240	5190240	Well because they tried, I don't think it would work out.
5190240	5194440	I guess it wouldn't because Silent Hill, you know a lot of times is somebody's personal
5194440	5195440	interpretation.
5195440	5196440	You know what I mean?
5196440	5199560	It's usually a very personalized story so I don't think anything like that would really
5199560	5200560	work.
5200560	5201560	But it's fun to think about.
5201560	5202560	Not really.
5202560	5203560	Shut up.
5203560	5211720	Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be getting some brand new download packs in February.
5211720	5218040	The first pack is going to be the Acoustic Track Pack, which is available for 440 Microsoft
5218040	5219040	Points.
5219040	5222280	Included with that will be the song Holic.
5222280	5224280	That makes me angry.
5224280	5225280	Oops.
5225280	5226280	No.
5226280	5233200	And the Acoustic Track Pack, which will be available for 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49,
5233200	5240000	will include three different songs, including Drive by Incubus, a new slang by The Shins,
5240000	5244240	and Wonderwall, the Oasis cover by Ryan Adams.
5244240	5248240	Those are each also available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.
5248240	5249640	Wait a minute.
5249640	5253920	Ryan Adams covered Wonderwall?
5253920	5257460	Like, wow.
5257460	5258920	That's going to be bad.
5258920	5260920	I'm sorry.
5260920	5264580	I saw Ryan Adams once in concert and he was kind of a douche.
5264580	5269020	So I mean, he's a douchey guy covering a douchey song from a douchey band.
5269020	5272360	I mean, this is just like, oh, this is going to be terrible.
5272360	5273360	Sorry.
5273360	5278360	Then we have the Wings Track Pack, which is also available for 440 Microsoft Points or
5278360	5288300	$5.49, including Junior's Farm, Hi Hi Hi, and Jet, and I'm sure nothing that has to
5288300	5293080	do with the television series Wings.
5293080	5300360	Then we have the Bob Seger Track Pack, also 440 Microsoft Points and $5.49, including
5300360	5306840	that old-time rock and roll, that's awesome, Her Strut, and Get Out of Denver, which is
5306840	5310100	a live version.
5310100	5313080	An old buddy of Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa, is in chat right now.
5313080	5314160	I love me some Marissa.
5314160	5315800	I hope she comes back to the show at some point.
5315800	5320760	She's in chat right now, so Marissa Congusto, and she's saying, yes, he did in regards to
5320760	5321760	Ryan Adams.
5321760	5325480	He changed the melody, and then OMG, no, I heart Oasis.
5325480	5326480	Don't get me wrong.
5326480	5327480	I like Oasis.
5327480	5330480	I actually downloaded some of their stuff for Rock Band, but if you ever have listened
5330480	5333920	to them in interviews, they are kind of douchey.
5333920	5334920	They're straight up assholes.
5334920	5335920	What are you talking about?
5335920	5339600	But you know, hey, some of the greatest musicians were big douchebags, so, you know.
5339600	5340600	And some weren't.
5340600	5341600	All right.
5341600	5342600	Wait.
5342600	5343600	Sorry, Loki.
5343600	5344600	Oh, that's it.
5344600	5351120	Oh, OK, well, then we'll talk about PC games, and interesting that they say, at least according
5351120	5355520	to a survey that's coming out from, I believe, is this coming from the MPD group?
5355520	5356520	Yes, it is.
5356520	5363640	MPD group is saying 47% of PC game purchases are, in fact, digital.
5363640	5367800	So meaning, you know, Steam, D2D, or whatever's going on there.
5367800	5371000	So this is funny, because last week, weren't we just talking about how it seemed like the
5371000	5374280	shelf space at GameStop for PC games was little to none?
5374280	5375280	Yes.
5375280	5378040	So, kind of interesting here.
5378040	5383640	Apparently, according to the survey, 93% of PC gamers bought at least one game digitally
5383640	5385840	in the past 12 months.
5385840	5388760	71% bought four games digitally.
5388760	5389760	Very interesting.
5389760	5394360	But then I think about some of those games, like PopCap, and those types of games, like,
5394360	5397320	you know, if you go and download, you know, because I bring this up, because obviously
5397320	5401560	they're huge, casual PC games, you know, and a lot of people go to the site, download the
5401560	5404520	trial game, and then you can, you know, put your credit card number in online and get
5404520	5405760	the full version.
5405760	5407480	That's digital distribution right there.
5407480	5411560	You know, I don't think that necessarily means, like, half of all games are bought off Steam.
5411560	5412560	I don't think that's necessarily what it means.
5412560	5416280	I think it goes a little deeper than that, especially when you filter in these classic
5416280	5421760	games from a site like Yahoo Games or whatever, where, you know, you can get, you know, click
5421760	5425320	now and put in your credit card number to get the full version of Diner Dash 5.
5425320	5426320	Woo!
5426320	5427320	And it will be.
5427320	5428320	So.
5428320	5429320	Yeah.
5429320	5432600	That's kind of not surprising in a way, but interesting.
5432600	5433600	Yes.
5433600	5434600	Very.
5434600	5435600	You know what else is interesting?
5435600	5438200	I'm sure that means the shelf space is going to continue to shrink.
5438200	5441120	What else is interesting, Logie?
5441120	5447360	People finding different things about LittleBigPlanet, including some upcoming patch details.
5447360	5454960	Apparently, this was leaked out from a photo that was on Media Modicles Flickr page.
5454960	5460160	And if you look very closely, you'll notice that there is a white board with a bunch of
5460160	5464120	different information about download content and updates.
5464120	5470120	And the next one that's on the list there, which I can't quite see the code name for,
5470120	5477520	but it will include new tutorials and online creation mode, where you'll be able to work
5477520	5480680	with other players and create your own levels online.
5480680	5481680	Awesome.
5481680	5486160	And apparently, there's also going to be a new arcade pack at some point.
5486160	5488480	I don't know what exactly that is.
5488480	5489480	Arcade pack?
5489480	5490480	Yeah.
5490480	5491480	It says...
5491480	5492480	That could be all kinds of cool!
5492480	5494040	...what will include no idea.
5494040	5495680	But something else.
5495680	5496680	Yeah.
5496680	5499560	I'm trying to see code name.
5499560	5501640	What are your thoughts on LittleBigPlanet, RicePrincess?
5501640	5504800	You haven't talked a lot about it on the show, but I know you love Wii.
5504800	5506220	You hate 360.
5506220	5508420	So PS3's got to be a nice neutral ground.
5508420	5509420	What do you think about LittleBigPlanet?
5509420	5510420	I don't know.
5510420	5511920	I've never played it.
5511920	5512920	Really?
5512920	5513920	Really.
5513920	5514920	I haven't.
5514920	5515920	It's actually a lot of fun.
5515920	5516920	It was my favorite game that came out last year.
5516920	5517920	Really?
5517920	5518920	Yeah, I love it.
5518920	5519920	I don't have a PS3.
5519920	5522160	You've got to see how cheesy some of the user levels are.
5522160	5524160	I think that's how you will like it.
5524160	5529080	Go on there and play the Warcraft-inspired Onyxia's Lair level.
5529080	5530080	Oh, God.
5530080	5531960	You'll love it for how cheesy it can be.
5531960	5532960	I hope so.
5532960	5534960	I wonder if there's a Rocky Horror Picture Show level.
5534960	5535960	There should be.
5535960	5536960	There ought to be.
5536960	5537960	I'm going to search for one.
5537960	5538960	Oh, my word.
5538960	5539960	If not, we need to make one somehow.
5539960	5540960	Totally.
5540960	5542960	Where your character has to jump to the left and then step to the right.
5542960	5543960	Oh, my God.
5543960	5544960	Consistently.
5544960	5545960	And utilize the pelvic thrust.
5545960	5546960	Yes.
5546960	5547960	And utilize the pelvic thrust.
5547960	5548960	To drive people insane.
5548960	5549960	All right.
5549960	5550960	Shut up.
5550960	5551960	All right.
5551960	5554480	But all these features sound pretty awesome for LittleBigPlanet.
5554480	5555480	Yes.
5555480	5557960	So, no word to the time frame?
5557960	5558960	No.
5558960	5566080	But, again, this is based off information that's coming off of a picture of a whiteboard.
5566080	5574720	Well, still, you know, if the studio themselves put up the picture, I would actually say that
5574720	5578960	is a pretty respectable source because I don't think they're going to think to, quick, erase
5578960	5579960	the whiteboard.
5579960	5580960	We're spilling all our secrets.
5580960	5582960	You know what I mean?
5582960	5585800	They're spilling your secrets onto the whiteboard.
5585800	5587040	Sorry.
5587040	5588040	I'm laughing at chat.
5588040	5589040	AcidicVampire in chat.
5589040	5591040	Chat.onoursonstrated.com.
5591040	5592440	You're getting read a lot tonight, buddy.
5592440	5593800	He's saying a lot of funny things.
5593800	5596520	It says, Skye, play the Parker Posey level.
5596520	5598520	It's not popular, but it's great.
5598520	5599520	What?
5599520	5600880	There's a Parker Posey level.
5600880	5601880	Oh, my God.
5601880	5603560	I want to play it so bad.
5603560	5605200	I think I'm going to do that right after the show.
5605200	5606880	No, because I'm going to play Resident Evil 5.
5606880	5609520	I'm going to push you if you don't let me.
5609520	5611960	I have to put that in the queue.
5611960	5613920	Do I get to unlock stickers of Parker Posey?
5613920	5614920	I don't know.
5614920	5615920	If so, I'm so sold.
5615920	5616920	That's awesome.
5616920	5617920	Like, party girl and everything.
5617920	5618920	Oh, God.
5618920	5619920	Amazing.
5619920	5623800	Aw, or like, why is that?
5623800	5626520	Silent Nathan is now suddenly interested in Little Big Planet?
5626520	5628440	Maybe I'll go play it right now.
5628440	5629440	Right now.
5629440	5630440	Now.
5630440	5631440	All right.
5631440	5632440	Bye.
5632440	5638440	Um, hey, speaking of games that I want to play right now, I can't play this right now,
5638440	5640840	but apparently it's going to be in development.
5640840	5643160	Tron, a new game.
5643160	5644160	A new Tron game.
5644160	5648520	You know, they showed that trailer for Tron 2, or TR2N.
5648520	5650720	What they showed at Comic Con.
5650720	5654920	Apparently there is a game coming out for this whole thing as well.
5654920	5655920	This is according to Variety.
5655920	5659320	Even though there were some issues with the Disney video game company, Variety magazine
5659320	5664520	is reporting that apparently Disney is shipping to game developers a concept for TR2N, or
5664520	5666520	Tron 2.
5666520	5669680	Of course, no idea what it's going to be like or anything.
5669680	5675520	But of course this makes me think, okay, there was a Tron 2.0, and it wasn't very well received.
5675520	5680280	So hopefully whatever, but the original Tron game was awesome.
5680280	5681280	Never played it.
5681280	5682280	It's pretty awesome.
5682280	5686800	They have it on Xbox Live, and it was one of those games that was better in the 80s,
5686800	5690040	and when you play it now you're kind of like, oh, this game is better left in my imagination.
5690040	5693540	But it still was pretty cool, especially for an 80s game.
5693540	5697920	What do you think about, like, reinventing franchises?
5697920	5699920	Such as Tron?
5699920	5701440	Sure.
5701440	5703120	I'm okay with it, I guess.
5703120	5704400	I don't know.
5704400	5708320	I think especially a series like Tron needed a sequel a long time ago.
5708320	5709320	It seems a little late.
5709320	5713480	But then when you look at a series like The Goonies, or there is no series there, right?
5713480	5715040	They don't need to make A Goonies 2.
5715040	5717360	Like if they made A Goonies 2, you know it's going to be stupid.
5717360	5718360	Or The Karate Kid?
5718360	5719360	No.
5719360	5720360	Just no.
5720360	5721680	Are you talking about the movie or the game?
5721680	5723360	Oh, the movie.
5723360	5724800	The game was amazing.
5724800	5727520	That's another classic game that we need to have sometimes, is Goonies 2.
5727520	5728520	That game was amazing.
5728520	5729520	Heck yes.
5729520	5730520	Oh my god.
5730520	5732020	I thought you did that as a classic game already.
5732020	5734000	I don't know if Dark Soccer has ever done it.
5734000	5735000	I'd have to check the wiki.
5735000	5736600	But I don't think it's ever been a classic game.
5736600	5739880	I'd have to check the wiki on your own show.
5739880	5740880	Yes.
5740880	5741880	Well look, I don't know.
5741880	5744880	Look, we've done the classic game of the week for like at least a year now.
5744880	5747280	So I don't know every single game we've highlighted.
5747280	5748280	There's a lot.
5748280	5751960	But thankfully we have a wiki and the fans update the wiki because they're awesome.
5751960	5755200	Did someone let Nathan run in the house really to go play Playstation 3?
5755200	5757200	Probably that jerkwad.
5757200	5760720	Hey Nathan, you're cool.
5760720	5762080	And not a jerkwad at all.
5762080	5763080	Anyhow.
5763080	5768760	It's a neutron game in development, probably to come out with a movie if they can find
5768760	5774400	somebody to do, you know, take the financial hit for all the development, I guess, in this
5774400	5775400	economy.
5775400	5777000	Disney does have their own studio.
5777000	5779200	Yeah, but it's been hurting.
5779200	5783320	Well yeah, because they put out Turok and I mean, come on.
5783320	5787120	I could have told you that Turok's gonna suck before they even put Turok out.
5787120	5790000	And they're like, seriously, really, you're gonna put Turok out?
5790000	5791000	Really?
5791000	5792840	This is something you think is a great idea?
5792840	5795880	The economy is going downhill, what game should we make?
5795880	5796880	Turok!
5796880	5798280	It's a great idea!
5798280	5802680	Amaze Satsuma in chat wonders if Sky wants a Showgirls 2.
5802680	5807040	You know there was supposed to be a Showgirls 2, where, cause at the end of Showgirls 1
5807040	5811320	it alludes to the fact that Nomi Malone is going to Hollywood, and Showgirls 2 was supposed
5811320	5815080	to be a parody on Hollywood, like the first one was a parody on Vegas, but then the movie
5815080	5819600	came out and they decided to can the sequel.
5819600	5820600	Never mind.
5820600	5824440	I would be in full support of a Showgirls 2, but not now, I mean Elizabeth Berkley's
5824440	5826280	not gonna do it, what's the point?
5826280	5832800	The point is, that we have all these wonderful porn studios that can develop a movie now,
5832800	5837800	I mean they're doing more theatrical movies, and hell, they have all the knockoffs, like
5837800	5845560	all the TV show ones, like Not the Bradys, Not the Munsters, Not Bewitched, I don't know
5845560	5853640	what the other ones are, but, I mean, not My Three Sons, I'm not sure about that one.
5853640	5855320	How come porn studios don't get into gaming?
5855320	5857640	You know you see all these legitimate movie studios getting into gaming.
5857640	5864840	There's porn actresses that are in the gaming, but you know, not, I don't know.
5864840	5867640	There's a lot of people that love World of Warcraft.
5867640	5868640	There are.
5868640	5870080	I don't know why, but there are.
5870080	5874240	I knew a stripper who played World of Warcraft, and all the nerds would like message her on
5874240	5877360	the message board, like, oh my god, did you do this?
5877360	5881240	There's a stripper that's over at our local strip club that plays World of Warcraft.
5881240	5884840	There's probably a stripper at every strip club that plays World of Warcraft, because
5884840	5889840	everybody plays World of Warcraft, I'm just saying, though, I don't know.
5889840	5893840	Plus think about it, if you're a stripper, you know, you're working nights, you're probably
5893840	5897680	home during the day with a kid, I'm kind of reminded, I don't know if you've ever seen
5897680	5904180	the Guild, but I'm kind of reminded of Carla from the Guild, who by the way is by far
5904180	5906880	my favorite character on that program.
5906880	5913480	But the stripper that's local that plays WoW, she's a nerd, like she's an Asian girl, and
5913480	5915120	her stage name's Kitana.
5915120	5917280	Yeah, that's the one.
5917280	5919280	Yeah, that's totally the one.
5919280	5920280	Freaking dork.
5920280	5924600	Wait a minute, do we just have a six degrees of stripper here in the studio?
5924600	5927720	Like we just found out that Loki and Rice Princess know the same stripper?
5927720	5929240	Do you know that stripper?
5929240	5931160	I don't know her, but I've seen her movies.
5931160	5933680	I don't like her at a large movie or anything.
5933680	5938240	Well, I know her that well, but I know her in the biblical sense.
5938240	5944880	No, you know, when we're really bored sometimes, you know, the wife and I decided to go to
5944880	5946920	the strip club.
5946920	5949120	She wants to go again, actually, she keeps saying that.
5949120	5951760	I want to go, I keep saying I want to go.
5951760	5953600	We need to have an OLR at this strip club night.
5953600	5956680	No, but seriously, I mean, when you're getting, you know, a lot of times when you're getting
5956680	5961600	like a lap dance and stuff, it's seriously the weirdest conversations, I mean, it's like
5961600	5963000	about games and shit.
5963000	5967560	You know, you mentioned that you do a game podcast and it's like, oh my God, I play games
5967560	5968560	too.
5968560	5969560	That's so funny.
5969560	5970560	Like, how does that even come up in conversation?
5970560	5972120	Is she like, so what do you do?
5972120	5977080	And you're like, well, actually, here's the thing is because, you know, to get into how
5977080	5982760	strip clubs operate, they have to wait until the new song begins because you have, when
5982760	5987640	you're paying for a lap dance is for X number of songs and you're not just going to start,
5987640	5988960	you know, if it's in the middle of a song.
5988960	5992760	So you have to sit there and wait for the new song and during that time it's you.
5992760	5993760	So what do you do?
5993760	5994760	You know, how's it going?
5994760	5996560	You know, that kind of stuff.
5996560	6000520	And that's where the games come up because that's all I do is games.
6000520	6004080	No, the time I got a lap dance, because I went to the strip club once and my friends
6004080	6005480	like, you were there, Irene, right?
6005480	6006480	Okay.
6006480	6009920	My friends made me say which stripper I thought was the hottest.
6009920	6012920	And naturally I said the one that looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because there was
6012920	6015300	a stripper there looked just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
6015300	6019520	And she, you know, they, but they paid for a lap dance and it pretty much started right
6019520	6020520	away.
6020520	6021520	I guess the song was coming on or whatever.
6021520	6023760	Like, you know, she was rubbing her boobies in my face and the whole thing and it was
6023760	6026560	just very awkward for me, but whatever.
6026560	6031840	So finally it was over and she said, Oh, you just, you should just relax, honey.
6031840	6033480	She's like, you know, I hope you enjoyed it.
6033480	6036340	You know, you could tell her self esteem was probably hurt a little bit because I was so
6036340	6038920	nervous and I'm like, honey, it's nothing against you.
6038920	6040160	I'm just gay.
6040160	6042360	And she says, Oh, I could kind of tell.
6042360	6045280	And then she's just sitting there and she's talking to me and she's like, Oh, my roommate's
6045280	6046360	gay and I love him.
6046360	6047360	He's the best thing.
6047360	6050320	And so she's talking to me for like a whole nother song, but it was really awkward because
6050320	6053880	she, like, she had no clothes on except some, you know, a thong.
6053880	6057920	And it was, it was kind of strange, you know, I was just kind of like, just put a t-shirt
6057920	6061400	on or something, you know, an acidic vampire says, Rob loves the boobies.
6061400	6062400	Yes.
6062400	6065560	Especially when he's drunk.
6065560	6068800	Rob might be gay, but he loves all gay guys like boobies.
6068800	6069800	It's, I don't know what it is.
6069800	6071800	I guess everybody really likes boobies.
6071800	6072800	Who doesn't like boobies?
6072800	6073800	Women like boobies.
6073800	6074800	Yeah.
6074800	6075800	Women do.
6075800	6080440	But yeah, you were going to say something, Nathan?
6080440	6085960	I just want to point out though, some props in chat for the strip club with the wife,
6085960	6089160	because some folks are like, Game Guru says, wait, wait, wait, you go to the strip club
6089160	6091160	with your wife?
6091160	6092960	She loves going.
6092960	6095020	And somebody, it's not very often.
6095020	6097280	It's just like, it was a while ago.
6097280	6099000	Game Guru says your wife is the coolest.
6099000	6104560	No, we seriously, we seriously thought we were going to do this, but we were so fucking
6104560	6108300	tired from like the wedding day.
6108300	6112800	We were seriously going to go in our wedding garb to the strip club.
6112800	6115960	We were almost going to do it, but we were so exhausted.
6115960	6119240	Like during the wedding, we were like, dude, yeah, we should totally go afterwards, just
6119240	6122120	dressed up in the tux and everything.
6122120	6123120	Because that would be hilarious.
6123120	6126200	But we were just like so beat at the end of the day.
6126200	6127200	It's like, fuck that.
6127200	6128200	We're not going anywhere.
6128200	6129200	Nice.
6129200	6130200	Go sleep.
6130200	6131200	Or not fuck that.
6131200	6132200	Yeah, boobs are awesome.
6132200	6138080	Let's see, Rama says Skye, you're a hypocrite.
6138080	6141680	You have a problem with a woman in a bra and panties at a strip bar.
6141680	6142680	Hold up.
6142680	6143680	She had no bra on.
6143680	6144680	Okay.
6144680	6145680	Yeah.
6145680	6146680	Just panties.
6146680	6147680	I wouldn't even call it like panties.
6147680	6152800	When I, when you say panties, I think of like granny panties, you know, like regular panties,
6152800	6153800	not a thong.
6153800	6155520	She had like a thong on.
6155520	6156920	But she'll have you go to a R.A.
6156920	6159800	Rock, your picture show convention full of women in bra and panties.
6159800	6160800	Well, that's different.
6160800	6162280	That's why you're going there.
6162280	6163280	That's theater.
6163280	6164280	That's art.
6164280	6165280	It's art.
6165280	6167920	That's funny that you're laughing at that.
6167920	6168920	That's art.
6168920	6175440	But anyways, yes, there are a lot of people in all occupations that play World of Warcraft.
6175440	6176440	Even strippers.
6176440	6180560	It's not like, you know, oh, I strip therefore I cannot play games at all.
6180560	6182440	But yeah, porn stars, strippers.
6182440	6183880	There's a lot.
6183880	6185320	I mean, fuck.
6185320	6187280	Just read like IGN.
6187280	6190400	They do these stupid like babes of the day things and a lot of them that they put on
6190400	6194160	there have fucking, you know, game, you know, interests and stuff like that.
6194160	6198840	And you know, it's just all the more reason people think, oh my God, women, games, ooh,
6198840	6199840	got to.
6199840	6200840	Yeah.
6200840	6204200	Marissa is in chat again saying they make all sorts of terrible porn games.
6204200	6207140	Remember how I said earlier they need, why don't porn studios make games?
6207140	6210520	They make all sorts of terrible porn games, but they're usually multiplayer online.
6210520	6214320	I learned this by working in the porn capital of the world, Chatsworth, California.
6214320	6215320	Okay.
6215320	6216320	Two comments to that.
6216320	6220520	A, I should have figured that out because, you know, on porn websites, so I've heard,
6220520	6223840	you see a lot of times ads for those like multiplayer sex.
6223840	6224840	So you've heard.
6224840	6225840	Yeah.
6225840	6226840	I just heard through Loki.
6226840	6227840	Through your eyes.
6227840	6229040	That that's what you see on those sites.
6229040	6230040	And I guess you're right.
6230040	6233200	I just don't think of them because they're not really out there and about.
6233200	6237080	And B, I did not realize Chatsworth, California was the capital of porn industry, but it doesn't
6237080	6238080	surprise me.
6238080	6243320	But if you've ever been to Chatsworth, California, it's, it's, you know.
6243320	6245100	Is it better than Buttonwillow?
6245100	6246600	It's better than Buttonwillow.
6246600	6251960	It's I would say Fresno is probably better than Chatsworth.
6251960	6254640	And I like how we're only laughing because everybody else doesn't live in California.
6254640	6257000	No offense to the people there.
6257000	6258000	Wow.
6258000	6260320	Wink, wink, hint, hint.
6260320	6263600	My grandma's from there.
6263600	6265880	And her movie comes out next month.
6265880	6266880	Ew.
6266880	6267880	Ew.
6267880	6268880	Ew.
6268880	6269880	Gilf.
6269880	6270880	Gross.
6270880	6275240	And then Marissa also says, Rob can have some of my boob to play with, stress toys.
6275240	6276800	I have too much anyway.
6276800	6277800	Marissa does.
6277800	6278800	Marissa has some nice big boobies.
6278800	6284160	I would, I would definitely, you know, help relieve some stress.
6284160	6288960	Your own stress all day with her boobs.
6288960	6289960	All right.
6289960	6291640	Can we move on back into video games?
6291640	6294640	I don't know how we got on the whole topic of strippers from Tron.
6294640	6295640	Who cares?
6295640	6296640	Who cares?
6296640	6301880	Like, that was the last story we just did was Tron, I just want to point out.
6301880	6306960	And then suddenly it's about strippers playing World of Warcraft and boobies in Chatsworth,
6306960	6310040	California being the board capital of the world.
6310040	6315320	I definitely would pay good money to see a stripper that's glowing in the Tron outfit.
6315320	6316320	Absolutely.
6316320	6321400	Hey, that, you know, there's that guy on the internet, the Tron guy who wears that outfit.
6321400	6322840	No, no, no, not him.
6322840	6324960	But you'll imagine if a woman wore that outfit.
6324960	6325960	Is he hot?
6325960	6329080	I don't want to see a woman the size of the Tron guy wearing that outfit.
6329080	6330080	All right.
6330080	6334480	I can't process this much data.
6334480	6338160	Dark Knight in chat says, thank God Jamie's not here for this one.
6338160	6343280	You know, it probably would have derailed even if she was here because it's not the
6343280	6344600	fact that Jamie's not here.
6344600	6346800	It's the fact that Rice Princess is here.
6346800	6350840	Hey, I didn't bring up, wait, yes I did.
6350840	6351840	Yes you did.
6351840	6352840	La, la, la.
6352840	6353840	Let's move on.
6353840	6356800	Why do we have this whole six degrees of strippers thing going on here?
6356800	6361960	Or we just both live in the same town and both go to the same strip club.
6361960	6364600	Why am I not being invited to said strip club?
6364600	6367440	I haven't gone in like a year or two.
6367440	6369160	We need to fix this.
6369160	6370600	It's been a long time.
6370600	6373680	It's just because you go to the strip club and then afterwards you're like, that costs
6373680	6376160	me a lot of money for very little time.
6376160	6377440	Why the fuck did I do that?
6377440	6379400	And then you forget about it after a while.
6379400	6381480	You have guilty gear news, right Loki?
6381480	6387120	Yes, speaking of guilt for spending all that money in strip clubs.
6387120	6393840	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus has been announced by Axis to be coming to the US.
6393840	6398600	They're planning on bringing it out on the PS2, the PSP, and the Wii.
6398600	6405440	You may remember Axis also brought out Guilty Gear XX Accent Core a little bit earlier.
6405440	6407840	I think it was last year actually.
6407840	6414320	And this new game was planned on, I guess, coming out spring 2009, probably the latter
6414320	6416360	half of the spring.
6416360	6422920	But it's not that different from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, but Plus does feature some,
6422920	6427840	I guess, more characters and some different stuff that they tweaked.
6427840	6432640	Sorry, I was just showing Rice Princess a picture of Tron Guy.
6432640	6433640	Thank you chatters.
6433640	6435560	And then I almost vomited.
6435560	6438680	Oh, so Guilty Gear, yeah.
6438680	6439680	So it'll be coming out.
6439680	6441520	Too bad it's something new, Guilty Gear.
6441520	6446200	Or wait, that wasn't, it was something blue, I forget what they called it.
6446200	6449160	The new game, it's not Guilty Gear, but it's done by the same people.
6449160	6454440	It's all like HD, or not cel-shaded, but like hand drawn animation stuff.
6454440	6455440	No idea.
6455440	6457440	I don't know.
6457440	6461560	Alright, well let's move on to the mailbag.
6461560	6464580	It's the part of the show every week that you guys can send us an email and we'll read
6464580	6467080	it here on the show and respond to whatever's in it.
6467080	6468080	Or make fun of it.
6468080	6470600	One of the two will happen.
6470600	6474320	We invite your emails to be sent in to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6474320	6477940	Although we didn't have a whole lot this week, that's probably because our podcast feed was
6477940	6478940	behind a little bit.
6478940	6482240	But by the way, it is getting caught up, a new show just went out today, so go look for
6482240	6483240	it.
6483240	6485640	We do have at least one email to read and it's from Australia.
6485640	6488760	This is from Mike in Australia.
6488760	6493080	Mike in Australia says, hello to all in studio, Rob, Loki, Silent Nathan and Rice Princess.
6493080	6494280	Oh, he must be listening right now.
6494280	6495280	Wow.
6495280	6496280	Because he knew exactly who was on the show.
6496280	6497280	Well, hello.
6497280	6500160	I've had the opportunity to listen live two weeks in a row, which is a treat considering
6500160	6505120	during your half-time Puppy Bowl music break, it's coming up to 2 p.m., so generally I'm
6505120	6506120	at work.
6506120	6509600	Firstly, I want to ask your thoughts about some good platform games on the DS.
6509600	6513200	I don't have an Xbox 360 or PS3, so I'm stuck with the DS Lite, which is good enough at
6513200	6514200	the moment.
6514200	6517800	I've acquired Castlevania, Order of Eclatia, but haven't really gotten into yet, played
6517800	6519400	the first level or so.
6519400	6523440	I'm slowly playing through Yoshi Island DS, so if you can suggest anything similar, that
6523440	6524440	would be good.
6524440	6527280	Before I finish, I just want to say great show as always and really enjoy listening
6527280	6528360	to your shows.
6528360	6530840	Take care and hope to listen live again soon.
6530840	6535600	Mike, PS, this email is not sponsored by anyone, but for you guys to learn a new Australian
6535600	6542640	term, budgie, bud, budgie smugglers, I guess the email's brought to us by budgie smugglers.
6542640	6546840	Explanation from Urban Dictionary, Australian slang term for men's tight-fitting speedo-style
6546840	6547840	swimwear.
6547840	6551280	The lump in the front apparently resembles a budgie when it is stuck down the front of
6551280	6552280	someone's shorts.
6552280	6553560	That's a budgie.
6553560	6555160	That's what I want to know.
6555160	6556960	Is that like a Snuggie?
6556960	6560040	Oh, I bet it is.
6560040	6562120	That's like the Australian version of a grape.
6562120	6563120	I mean.
6563120	6564120	Alright.
6564120	6565120	Look, look, back to the question at hand.
6565120	6567520	How about some DS platform games?
6567520	6569600	You know, I haven't played a whole lot on DS as of late.
6569600	6573560	I just, I have this thing against playing games on DS for some reason.
6573560	6577200	I like playing games on the TV, but to help our poor guy out.
6577200	6578200	What are some games?
6578200	6581920	See, even when I'm playing the DS, I'm playing a lot of RPGs, like Final Fantasy IV or Mario
6581920	6582920	games.
6582920	6583920	Is this no good DS games?
6583920	6584920	No.
6584920	6585920	Well, platformers specifically.
6585920	6590440	Like things like Castlevania, Yoshi Island, what are some other good platform games?
6590440	6593320	New Super Mario Brothers is definitely like one of the classics if you don't have that
6593320	6594320	yet.
6594320	6595320	You gotta get that.
6595320	6596320	I'm gonna look to chat too for some hints.
6596320	6597320	Chat.
6597320	6598320	What are some good ones?
6598320	6599320	The new games that have come out.
6599320	6606400	Of course, there's the new Kirby game, Kirby Superstar Ultra, which is, you know, port.
6606400	6613800	And then there's, was it the Chase Phoenix meets Felicity.
6613800	6618040	That's supposed to be kind of like Kirby's Canada's Curse.
6618040	6622400	And then, other platformer games, I'm sure there's a lot of crappy games that have come
6622400	6624280	out that have been like platformers.
6624280	6627040	Wasn't N out on DS, didn't they release a version of N?
6627040	6628700	Yeah, that's kind of a neat little game.
6628700	6631440	That's coming out, or that's already out.
6631440	6635040	And then, you know, I don't know.
6635040	6637180	Game Guru in chat suggests Sonic Rush.
6637180	6639520	It's better than the console Sonics.
6639520	6643840	You would definitely also have to pick up the Chrono Trigger for the DS.
6643840	6648520	It's not a platform game, but it's way better than any of the games you've already mentioned.
6648520	6650720	Also a budgie is a bird.
6650720	6651720	Like a parakeet.
6651720	6653720	Oh, thank you.
6653720	6655720	Seriously?
6655720	6658200	I feel like I learn new things on this show every day.
6658200	6659200	The more you know.
6659200	6660200	There you go.
6660200	6661200	The more you know.
6661200	6662200	Alright.
6662200	6663200	There you have it.
6663200	6664200	Yay.
6664200	6665800	I don't know if any of you in the chat room do agree with Sonic Rush.
6665800	6666800	So there you go.
6666800	6669880	If you don't own that one yet, you should probably check out Sonic Rush.
6669880	6672240	Hitstun though suggests Tony Hawk's American Skateland.
6672240	6674040	It's kind of a platform game.
6674040	6675040	Sorta.
6675040	6676040	Yep.
6676040	6677040	Yep.
6677040	6678440	So there's some suggestions from us to you.
6678440	6681320	If you have an email you want to send us, mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, I'd like
6681320	6685340	to hear more international slang terms, like budgie smugglers.
6685340	6688120	That was definitely educational.
6688120	6691880	There you go.
6691880	6693340	What'd you say, Nathan?
6693340	6697320	Next time you put on a Speedo, look down and it will resemble a parakeet in your pants.
6697320	6700840	I don't think there's going to be a next time I'm going to put on a Speedo.
6700840	6705420	If I wear- On Naturale.
6705420	6710640	If I go swimming, I wear like, you know, swimming trunks, not, you know, in this country it's
6710640	6715060	not appropriate usually to wear Speedos to the beach unless you are really good looking
6715060	6719040	and I'm not really good looking, sadly, so there you go.
6719040	6720400	People do it anyway.
6720400	6721400	That's true.
6721400	6727720	The Tron guy wears that whole thing in public, so whatever.
6727720	6728720	Let's go on.
6728720	6730280	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6730280	6733960	We'll get to the Skype line soon also, by the way, you guys, Skype line opening up a
6733960	6734960	little later.
6734960	6740680	Well, here's a game if you're a fan of the Jump Superstars games that they have on the
6740680	6741680	DS.
6741680	6750440	There's a new Konami PSP brawler coming out and no word on, let's see here, what the title
6750440	6759760	is on it, but it's got- Oh, Sunday X Magazine is the- I guess it's just all the different
6759760	6765160	manga characters, but they've got, you know, Sunday X Magazine Tyson Action and it's got
6765160	6777400	everything from, you know, Samurai Deeper Kyo to Get Backers, Air Gear, what is it,
6777400	6782660	so it's basically all the stuff that's like, you know, from Shonen Sunday Weekly Shonen,
6782660	6786800	so the Shonen Jump games, so very awesome.
6786800	6798160	Project Arms, Inuyasha, I don't know, actually, you know, Jump Ultimate Stars was okay.
6798160	6803080	It was a neat fighting game on the DS, it was kind of like Smash Brothers a little bit,
6803080	6808720	but the way that you use, like, they had a bottom portion of your screen that you can
6808720	6815040	align different manga panels and you'd get different abilities and assist characters
6815040	6819480	and stuff like that based on what you had in there and you had to fit them in, so it's
6819480	6825200	almost like the sticker system on Smash Brothers Brawl, so it's kind of neat.
6825200	6826200	I see.
6826200	6829080	Boy, these Smash Brothers Brawl clones are sure getting popular lately.
6829080	6831600	I remember you brought up the one about the Ninja Turtles last week and that was like
6831600	6832600	confirmed on Monday.
6832600	6838200	Well, yeah, some of the people did Brawl, or not Brawl, Smash Brothers, so it's part
6838200	6844920	of the same team, so it's going to be very similar to that, but this game, yeah, it looks
6844920	6848400	pretty fun and we need good, you know, PSP games.
6848400	6852320	Alright, more PSP the merrier, I suppose.
6852320	6856320	Sega is going to be trying to make a new arcade game, which sounds kind of interesting.
6856320	6862360	It's called Border Break, Sega Network Robot Wars, and it's a networked robot wars, of
6862360	6863360	course.
6863360	6867960	Arcade game that's being made by Sega, apparently it's going to be shown at the next AOU show
6867960	6874880	that's coming up in Japan, 20 players in this game, 10 on 10 robot battles, so this is like
6874880	6877840	the kind of thing that is going to be very expensive, you're going to see in the corner
6877840	6881840	of a Dave and Busters or something like that, I don't think this is something you're going
6881840	6887280	to see very much of, this is like an entertainment setter, 20 mech things, that's a lot.
6887280	6888280	That's crazy.
6888280	6889280	That's awesome.
6889280	6890280	I know, I want to play it.
6890280	6892640	It's awesome, but I don't think you'll ever see one on these shores.
6892640	6895560	Just arcades aren't popular enough over here, maybe a Dave and Busters would be like your
6895560	6896560	biggest bet.
6896560	6901960	Well, you may not have to have 20 cabinets, but I mean, it still could be, you know, cool.
6901960	6905840	Yeah, it might be cool, but I don't know if you're going to see it, that's all.
6905840	6907480	It's probably going to be expensive.
6907480	6911680	I don't think there's enough arcade stuff to justify it, sadly.
6911680	6915620	So, we'll see, we'll see, but anyway, it is in development.
6915620	6919760	There's another unique game, which I'm not really sure what arcades are going to be carrying
6919760	6924680	this because it has a lot of parts that go along with it, but it's a game that's come
6924680	6929920	out, or coming out in Japan, called Block Pippo.
6929920	6936760	And what it is, it's a game that's controlled with Lego-style blocks, and you actually build
6936760	6941300	up platforms and stuff using these blocks, and there's like a giant bin below the screen
6941300	6944760	with these blocks in there, and you build platforms for the characters to run on, kind
6944760	6949240	of like Lemmings, almost, by the look of it.
6949240	6955720	It actually is being tested for the U.S. as well, under the name Brick People, but it's
6955720	6960320	very unique looking, and it's got a lot of, you know, the block things that are going
6960320	6963880	to be in this bin, and I just have a feeling, you put that in an arcade, kids are going
6963880	6970880	to be stealing that shit left and right, but it's neat.
6970880	6972440	Why can't kids just be more responsible?
6972440	6974280	That's a good one.
6974280	6977920	Yeah, Lioshin agrees, those blocks will get stolen so fast if it was in the U.S., they'd
6977920	6979840	have to be all put on those cords.
6979840	6982560	That would be a mess.
6982560	6985760	You're like, crap, I can't put these blocks in there because of all these cords.
6985760	6988760	Shit, I got stuck and tangled in these cords.
6988760	6990760	That's the game.
6990760	6992800	Help!
6992800	6997440	Interesting games spotted around the gaming blogs this week, Go Nintendo featured this,
6997440	7001840	a Wii homebrew game called Super Sonic Wii, but what's interesting about this game, I'm
7001840	7005800	actually going to try to play the YouTube footage here in studio, a little clip of what
7005800	7010000	the game looks like here, if it'll actually play, looks like it's timing out, but I looked
7010000	7014600	at it a little bit before the show, it's a game that looks just like frequency or amplitude.
7014600	7022840	It's actually amplitude, it's based off of the game Amplitude DS, which was a spin off
7022840	7026680	of Amplitude, but now they have it for the Wii, and it looks pretty awesome.
7026680	7034320	If you go to the actual website for the game, which I believe Super Sonic Wii.com or Super
7034320	7037920	Sonic.com.
7037920	7041480	There we go, there's a little clip of it.
7041480	7045160	It's definitely a scaled down, all you can hear is the audio, but I'll tell you, it looks
7045160	7049480	like a very scaled down version of Amplitude, because you don't really have the hypnotic
7049480	7054920	backgrounds that a game like Amplitude had, it looks like you only have three tracks,
7054920	7062360	but still, it's a start, it's something, it's bound to get sued, especially if that rumor
7062360	7068160	from a few weeks back that harmonics might be making a comeback with this stuff is true.
7068160	7069160	There it is, Super Sonic Wii.
7069160	7073600	Well, you can download it now, it's available out there, so if you wanna check it out, you've
7073600	7078160	got a homebrew enabled Wii system, definitely check this out, and of course if you have
7078160	7082660	a homebrew enabled DS, you can check out Amplitude DS.
7082660	7086600	Of course, homebrewing any of those systems might violate your warranty, so be careful,
7086600	7089520	and don't say OLR told you to do it.
7089520	7097440	You don't need that crap, seriously.
7097440	7104400	But there's something else that's gonna be coming out here soon, it's a new Wii game,
7104400	7110760	it's called Glacier 2, they're comparing it to Twisted Metal, except you drive down mountains,
7110760	7114960	I would say it's more like full auto, but you drive down mountains, because I mean that
7114960	7120960	was more like this game, I think, it's basically a combat racing game, and it'll have 18 different
7120960	7127480	levels, it'll feature 7 different cars, all with giant guns and weapons on them, like
7127480	7135360	any other car should have, and this is a brand new game from a company called Team 6 Studios,
7135360	7138280	and this is their first Wii game.
7138280	7142280	I don't know, looks okay, but hey, we need a good combat racing game, and since they're
7142280	7147000	not making another full auto game, this will have to do, I guess.
7147000	7150280	Actually, no, I take that back, there was another combat racing game on the Wii, it's
7150280	7158040	called DT Racer, or DT Carnage, I think, what it was, and that's a combat racing game similar
7158040	7164200	to full auto, not very good though, from what I remember, but you can try that out, it's
7164200	7168080	probably like dirt cheap now.
7168080	7174440	Well, some other games that got really cheap lately were the Need for Speed games, because
7174440	7178760	apparently they did not sell very well, the recent games they released, so EA decided
7178760	7183120	if it worked for Batman, it's going to work for us, they're going to reboot the franchise,
7183120	7186720	so they're hitting the old reset button on the Need for Speed franchise, and they're
7186720	7191560	going to release 3 new Need for Speed games in the year 2009.
7191560	7196500	What's interesting though is that the whole concept behind it, one for the core gamers,
7196500	7201000	one for the casual gamers, one for the online gamers, I think it's an interesting approach
7201000	7202500	to take with the games.
7202500	7207280	Need for Speed Shift is the game that's coming out on Playstation 3, 360, PC, and PSP, and
7207280	7212620	that's the core game, that's like Project Gotham, coming out in the fall as well, Need
7212620	7217400	for Speed Nitro, that's coming out on the DS and the Wii, which you can probably guess
7217400	7221820	is going to be the casual game, I think that's more like the original Need for Speed games,
7221820	7227000	it's also supposed to have giant head racers and car vaulting, lame, wait, car vaulting?
7227000	7230800	God, I hope this is not another fucking game, wait, wait, wait, that might just be like
7230800	7239640	a vault to actually put your car in, no, that's car vaulting, aww, stupid, no, why, wouldn't
7239640	7240640	you like that?
7240640	7245640	Well, I do like that, but you know, the fact that, car vaulting reminds me of the stupid
7245640	7252400	Cruisin game that they had come out, and that Cruisin game was a ripoff, or actually a port,
7252400	7258200	was it not Need for Speed, the Fast and the Furious arcade game, the crappy Cruisin USA
7258200	7263320	based one, Cruisin World, I don't know, no, no, the Fast and the Furious game that came
7263320	7268920	to arcades, not good, I didn't even know they had a Fast and the Furious game in the arcade,
7268920	7273000	yeah, it's not good, it's based off Cruisin USA, I think it was kind of to try and compete
7273000	7277400	with, like, you know how when you go to an arcade, one of the things you still see tons
7277400	7282320	of people playing are what, Wangan, and uh, this is not even close, that's like saying
7282320	7287520	that a turd is competing with a diamond or something, Tigerclaw says, you mean Fast and
7287520	7293720	the Furious Tokyo Drift arcade, I seen that at Walmart, yeah, it's awful, that's where
7293720	7300240	it belongs to, yeah, that's what Cruisin came out, that's actually what Cruisin was, alright,
7300240	7304240	also a third game in the Need for Speed series, not for the Wii, if the other two don't sound
7304240	7310480	interesting to you, Need for Speed World Online, it's supposed to be a free online title, it's
7310480	7314280	coming out in Asia first over the summer and then we'll get it in Christmas time, so I'm
7314280	7316840	assuming you probably have to pay for car upgrades or something, you know, probably
7316840	7320760	based off the Asian model for MMOs where it's free, but then you have to pay for the good
7320760	7326360	stuff, so, it's free, but your cars have no wheels, pay extra for the wheels, it's like
7326360	7333200	go, oh crap, can't go, by the way, the games are all being developed by different studios,
7333200	7338320	even though Black Box apparently kind of got, you know, kind of, well, pink slipped, a lot
7338320	7342400	of them did, Black Box is still working on Need for Speed World Online, at least who's
7342400	7347880	left with EA Singapore, Need for Speed Nitro, the casual one is by EA Montreal, it's arcade
7347880	7353440	racer is what they're calling it, Need for Speed Shift coming by Slightly Mad, they're
7353440	7361960	the guys that made GT Legends and Blimey apparently is on it too, GT-R2, Blimey! Wow. There you
7361960	7366760	go, lots of Need for Speed in 2009, yeah, if you're a Need for Speed fan, that is exciting
7366760	7370920	news, DarkTetsuya in chat I believe is a Need for Speed fan and says, it's supposed to be
7370920	7375920	a fourth one, yeah, there's a fourth secret one, but, I don't know, hopefully that's the
7375920	7382360	good one, Need for Secrets, and you can only play it if you find it, cause they're gonna
7382360	7389520	hide it. Alright, and then of course we have to talk about the game that has download content
7389520	7396280	coming out the wazoo, Burnout Paradise, they're actually, there's a new rumored download that's
7396280	7399720	gonna be available, actually I wouldn't say it's so much a rumor cause it's actually on
7399720	7407120	their download store, but apparently it wasn't announced yet, so, oops, but it's a Burnout
7407120	7413640	Paradise Police Cars, and they've got, you know, the actual link for it, but it says
7413640	7420360	coming soon on the actual in-game store, and they do have some screenshots, I guess, I
7420360	7427240	don't know if it's preview pics or something like that, of the PCPD cars, so maybe new
7427240	7433040	game modes, some sort of chasing stuff, I don't know, Burnout Paradise is getting fucking
7433040	7437920	awesome, and now meaning you can get the game for like 20 bucks, all the debt-free download
7437920	7441560	content and all the paid download content is coming out. Much love to those folks for
7441560	7445520	just continuing to support a game that might have gotten bashed as mediocre when it came
7445520	7451120	out, but they still just expanding and expanding on it and making it pretty awesome, so, good
7451120	7458280	for you guys. We'll see, any time frame on when that could come out? No word, but I mean
7458280	7463120	a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, like there's the Burnout Paradise, the new
7463120	7468480	cars, I think that's coming out this week, I mean probably later on, maybe this month,
7468480	7475360	possibly next, probably relatively soon. Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, then
7475360	7480520	we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,
7480520	7483360	I don't know how busy it's gonna be tonight with a lot of our regulars catching the Super
7483360	7487160	Bowl tonight, and I guess even though it's over, maybe the office or whatever they're
7487160	7491400	showing right now, you know, maybe a little drunk from all the beer at the Super Bowl
7491400	7495680	parties, who knows, but we will open up the Skype line soon. One more story tonight and
7495680	7500720	it involves a company we talk about a lot on this show, PopCap. PopCap is finally bringing
7500720	7504200	some of their games to the PlayStation Network, it actually happened this week, Bejeweled
7504200	7510200	2 finally showed up on the PlayStation Network, and there also are plans to release Zuma,
7510200	7516760	Heavy Weapon, Feeding Frenzy, and Pagle. I know Pagle's pretty awesome. Pagle hasn't
7516760	7521320	even showed up on Xbox Live yet, so I'm curious if it'll beat it to the punch on PlayStation
7521320	7527760	3, I kinda doubt it, they'll probably be released simultaneously, but there you go, $9.99 if
7527760	7533640	you wanna check out Bejeweled 2, that's one penny less than what you'll pay on Xbox Live.
7533640	7538340	I go where the bargain is. That's right. So there you have it, I don't think the game
7538340	7543160	itself is much different, I think it's all the same modes from the Xbox 360 one, I don't
7543160	7547880	know if the achievements are as hard, or excuse me, trophies, or what have you, but, there
7547880	7553760	you go. Man, I love that game. What, Bejeweled? Pagle. Oh, Pagle. Pagle's pretty awesome.
7553760	7557440	Pagle is pretty awesome. It is, I wanna play it now. So, well, you might get to play it
7557440	7563340	on PlayStation Network soon, or Xbox 360, because I know you're a big 360 fan. Alright,
7563340	7567820	so we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the
7567820	7573280	US and Canada, or you can call us on Skype, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, while we
7573280	7576240	wait for some calls to come in, because we do have a little bit of a delay between when
7576240	7582040	I say, hey, call in, and when people actually hear me say that on the radio. Loki, do we
7582040	7587920	have any last minute stories tonight? Yeah, speaking of football, apparently there's that
7587920	7595640	whole deal where the retired NFL players were not getting any money from the new NFL games,
7595640	7600200	and their likenesses were being used without, you know, any sort of compensation. Well,
7600200	7605900	they have now finished that whole lawsuit, and they are going to be getting paid out
7605900	7614080	on it. So, that's pretty cool. In the tune of $28.1 million by the NFL. Only, let's go
7614080	7620520	to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hi, this is Spazinator. Hey, Spazinator,
7620520	7628080	what's on your mind? Well, two things. First off, I just want to double check and make
7628080	7637160	sure I heard you correctly in part A. Did you see that if you had the collector's edition
7637160	7643480	of Gears of War 2, you're going to lose your golden lancer? No, only if you were one of
7643480	7647560	the people that downloaded it while, I guess, it accidentally went up on the marketplace
7647560	7651320	for free and so a bunch of people downloaded it, they want to restrict it so that only
7651320	7654540	the people with the collector's edition actually have it. So, I don't know how they're going
7654540	7657520	to figure that out. They're not going to. It's not going to happen. You don't think
7657520	7659680	they'll actually be able to figure out? No, they're not going to figure it out. Loki's
7659680	7663100	convinced they're not going to be able to figure it out, but if you legitimately have
7663100	7666380	the gold gun from the collector's edition, you're not who they're trying to remove
7666380	7672300	it from. I kind of agree about that. Because by one of the people that had bought the collector's
7672300	7676900	edition, I just hate to get my, you know, lose my feed me, you know?
7676900	7681340	Wait, hold on. I'm not much of a Gears player. What is so special about the gold gun or is
7681340	7682100	it just that
7682100	7685620	it's pretty? It's just a gold gun.
7685620	7688700	It's just bragging rights more than anything.
7688700	7692180	You know, something to say, hey, I got the special edition.
7692180	7695300	You know, it's kind of like the Iron Rich
7695300	7699300	application for the iPhone. I don't know. I kind of thought maybe it fired gold bullets or
7699300	7700820	something. Alright, what was your second question?
7700820	7704820	Well, it's not so much a question, it's
7704820	7708100	more like a stupid statement.
7708100	7712460	Well, we make a lot of those on this show, so go right ahead. Yeah,
7712460	7715740	I was just thinking, with all the talk about strippers in movies
7715740	7719140	during part A, I doubt
7719140	7724620	it'll ever happen, but someone should make a game for Xbox 360 and
7724620	7729220	PlayStation 3 where, you know, you go to a strip club and
7729220	7732260	you know, you have boobies splashing in your face.
7732260	7736660	Kind of like, I don't know, like Show of Girls type of game.
7736660	7740300	That would be called This is Vegas coming out from Midway later this year.
7740300	7743220	Awesome. What about that Playboy game?
7743220	7746980	The Playboy Mansion? Yeah, that was actually supposed to be pretty good.
7746980	7751820	It was popular. You know, the problem is a lot of these games, you know, while you might see
7751820	7755260	some boobs here and there, you're never gonna see anything pretty much
7755260	7759020	more hardcore than that on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 because
7759020	7762300	of the whole standards thing, where if you have,
7762300	7766220	you know, if your game gets rated adults only, your game can't come out on any of
7766220	7768420	the consoles. The consoles like basically forbid it
7768420	7772060	because there's too many people out there who don't understand
7772060	7776460	there's a developer who makes for the publisher who puts out on the system,
7776460	7780800	you know, people think, oh, Nintendo Wii has got this disgusting,
7780800	7784700	you know, vagina-eating game that's out on the system,
7784700	7788420	you know. When is that getting released? It's not,
7788420	7792900	because it's rated adults only, so it's not like it used to be back in the day
7792900	7796580	where, you know, remember that Nintendo
7796580	7799860	seal of quality, you know, remember how those
7799860	7803980	other companies would put out their own games without going through Nintendo and
7803980	7806540	it was kind of like a whole bootleg thing. They can't really do that now, so
7806540	7810340	sadly, I don't think you're ever gonna see real hardcore games get released, but
7810340	7813700	you would wish one of them would just let up.
7813700	7816940	Or you can just look at porn on the internet.
7816940	7820260	There was that one game, there was some
7820260	7825580	breast game that was, it was almost like DDR that had these little like circles come up
7825580	7826060	with like
7826060	7829420	arrows and stuff, and there are different moves you had to do, and basically you had to
7829420	7830620	shake this chest
7830620	7834020	and make the boobs either spin counterclockwise or clockwise or up and
7834020	7834980	down, left or right.
7834980	7840340	It was awesome. I don't know, porn on the internet's great, but I can see a
7840340	7842620	lot of potential for the new
7842620	7847020	Wiimote technology in a porno game.
7847020	7852540	Exactly. Especially if the vagina eating game was either pigs in a trough type
7852540	7855180	eating or knife and fork.
7855180	7861100	Frisbee has a great name in chat for the game, Muff Chomp.
7861100	7866460	Wow. You know, since you kind of touched on it
7866460	7868980	for a second, you know,
7868980	7873060	this is just me, you know, speaking up on yes here, but
7873060	7876260	what I'm thinking is that, you know,
7876260	7879940	game console owners should be
7879940	7883500	afraid of 8-year-old games, you know, I mean,
7883500	7887380	you know, if it means light, there should be no problems with it,
7887380	7891900	you know, it's kind of like, the best analogy I can give you is with
7891900	7896740	Amrita games, you know, there's two out there that are like completely opposite,
7896740	7900180	there's the Grand Theft Auto series and
7900180	7903580	the BMX triple X. Obviously,
7903580	7906820	you know, Grand Theft Auto games are really great,
7906820	7910460	you know, my few niece here is out there,
7910460	7913660	whereas, you know, BMX triple X
7913660	7918580	is just a full piece of crap. I gotta get BMX triple X again, I love that game.
7918580	7921500	Actually, I think my sister has it because I had it for the GameCube.
7921500	7927020	That game is awesome. Loki really has like the best family ever, doesn't he?
7927020	7931100	Like the wife goes to the GameCube, the sister plays BMX triple X.
7931100	7935380	It was a funny game, it's seriously, it's Tony, it's not Tony Hawk, it's like Matt
7935380	7936740	Hoffman's Pro BMX,
7936740	7941100	but with like nudity and stuff, and just ridiculous plotline, but it's basically
7941100	7943980	like the old school Tony Hawk game. You know what, though, Spassinator makes kind of a
7943980	7945420	good point, though, is that, you know, we have,
7945420	7949300	especially we have this whole dual thing in this country which stinks,
7949300	7950700	this whole double standard where,
7950700	7954180	you know, you could chop people in half and chop their heads off and have a
7954180	7955900	completely violent game and it's just not,
7955900	7960140	it's R or it's M rated, but heaven forbid you show a cooter or a penis
7960140	7964020	and it's gonna be an NC-17 or AO related thing,
7964020	7968140	but he makes a good point that, you know, a lot of the sex games that we've had that
7968140	7969500	come out, like the guy game,
7969500	7972980	BMX triple X, they've all been kind of crap, you know?
7972980	7976820	What we need is a good artistic
7976820	7979940	pussy eating game
7979940	7984700	to come out, and we just need it to have, you know,
7984700	7988220	a little bit of art. It'll be like Master Pussy Theater.
7988220	7992260	Master Pussy Theater, exactly.
7992260	7996740	Yeah, if you want to really kick it over the edge there,
7996740	8000340	you know, throw all that stuff in there, then just,
8000340	8003380	you know, have like a side mission where you blow up a certain
8003380	8007060	ex-flory lawyer.
8007060	8011940	I'm sorry, but Master Pussy Theater needs to be in the OLR dream games, I think,
8011940	8014940	just for the simple fact that it is that artistic
8014940	8018420	sex game that's gonna bring respectability to
8018420	8022500	sex games. I'm afraid of the fetish achievements for those games on the
8022500	8024740	Xbox 360.
8024740	8028140	Alright, Spazinator, we have to let you go. You've completely made this show
8028140	8029220	disgusting tonight.
8029220	8032740	How dare you? You're welcome. Alright, take care Spazinator.
8032740	8034900	Bye.
8034900	8038780	AcidicVampire wants to remind us there's boobies in God of War in a sex minigame.
8038780	8043140	There is. Hi, you're on Booby Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8043140	8046340	Oh, Booby Lounge Radio! How exciting!
8046340	8050060	Whoa! Hi guys, it's Jason. Hi Jason, how are you? What's on your mind?
8050060	8054220	Well, now that you mention it, I don't know that I want to explain on air
8054220	8055140	what's on my mind.
8055140	8059740	What did you call in to discuss tonight with the Orange Lounge Radio host
8059740	8062760	on this family program? As long as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly
8062760	8067580	are alive and spewing their shit, your dreams will never come true, I'm sorry to say.
8067580	8071260	No, that's not why I called in, but it was very funny. It was a very
8071260	8076300	funny anecdote to add into everything that just happened. I'm hoping somebody can answer me
8076300	8077140	because
8077140	8081420	obviously I heard this just recently and it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
8081420	8085780	Why does Gears of War need SSL and why does it stop the game from working?
8085780	8090900	The whole Gears of War broken blah blah blah. Does anybody know the technical
8090900	8091780	reason behind that?
8091780	8095380	It's because the certificate expired.
8095380	8098740	What is the certificate actually used for?
8098740	8103140	Nothing. And it blocks the game in its entirety?
8103140	8108100	Yeah, sure. I don't know. I don't play Gears of War on PC
8108100	8111780	and it's such an easy fix to set my date back, I'm like, eh, whatever.
8111780	8115900	Is it some type of thing to prevent cheating or the connection to
8115900	8117700	multiplayer mode is secure or what?
8117700	8119900	Maybe the authenticate that it's a legit copy of the game, I don't know.
8119900	8122980	It's gotta be something like that, like authenticating the legitimacy of the game or
8122980	8126300	something like that. I don't know. I don't think it has a direct impact on the
8126300	8127700	game itself,
8127700	8131220	Jason, or I think the 360 ones would have stopped working too. I think it has
8131220	8132780	specifically to do with
8132780	8136740	some type of authentication thing on the PC. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
8136740	8139660	Some kind of a phone home connection, something or other, and that's just,
8139660	8143780	that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I mean, we've heard of some really
8143780	8145260	stupid DRM, but
8145260	8149300	for crying out loud people,
8149300	8153460	it's laughable. You put the situation where you have to,
8153460	8157940	you have to have a patch. One of two things has to happen. You either have to
8157940	8158500	buy
8158500	8161980	a ridiculously expensive certificate for,
8161980	8165660	I don't know, 10 years and then you piss off all the nostalgia players.
8165660	8169260	Or you have to issue a patch every single
8169260	8173740	year with a new certificate. Well, I think this is going to be a tough lesson learned because this is a
8173740	8178420	pretty big fuck up to have your game completely stopped working. It's a bad setup. They need to get rid of that
8178420	8181620	entirely. That is a bad
8181620	8185220	mechanism. Okay, enough computer geekery.
8185220	8188700	You guys mentioned that and I just kind of...
8188700	8192620	They've been having trouble with this sort of thing way back from Monkey Island. They have yet
8192620	8198420	to get this right. If you remember way back on the really old DOS games, you used to
8198420	8200900	buy a game and it'd come with a little booklet
8200900	8205220	and at certain times you'd have to refer to page 193 line B65
8205220	8208700	or you'd have some awful
8208700	8211820	little card you have to match up with the moon on
8211820	8216660	the solstice of winter just to prove that you did in fact buy the game.
8216660	8221340	And if you lose it, you're fucked! Some of those things weren't so bad and with the
8221340	8221860	internet
8221860	8225300	I've had a lot of things be subtly replaced.
8225300	8228660	Anyways, Space Quest,
8228660	8231700	the Space Quest series came with a
8231700	8234900	brochure of sorts to explain about the game and it had
8234900	8238300	in the case of Space Quest V, which was one of my favorite ones,
8238300	8242300	it had like a star chart with constellation codes or
8242300	8245700	something like that and you had to use those codes to actually
8245700	8249780	warp to different locales in the game as the story tells you to go there.
8249780	8252980	And that was their DRM and it was good, it was cute.
8252980	8256260	Jason, what I didn't like about that whole thing is that then console games started
8256260	8256860	doing it
8256860	8260580	and like, you know, if I didn't have that letter from home to dip in the water to
8260580	8261900	see the secret code...
8261900	8264980	I didn't have that letter
8264980	8268540	because I bought my game used and I had to call their helpline and I'm like,
8268540	8271820	uh, they'll dip the letter in the water and I'm like, what letter?
8271820	8274900	No, the one in the manual. I don't have the manual.
8274900	8278940	Okay, the code's 747. Well, it wasn't that hard.
8278940	8282500	Couldn't you just tell me that the first thing or do you like not get your 99 cents a
8282500	8283900	minute if I, you know,
8283900	8288020	give it away that fast? People will say that DRM is a necessary
8288020	8291860	evil, I'll tell that person you're full of shit. By the way, yeah.
8291860	8295100	It's self-serving and it only serves to
8295100	8298500	fuck people over. Hold on, Nathan wanted to say something about Space Quest V.
8298500	8302460	Did you also enjoy blowing up an android with a banana?
8302460	8305780	A space banana? That was, um,
8305780	8310780	when I was a lot younger, the BBS's were around, but that was the extent of my
8310780	8311620	online life.
8311620	8316540	I love Space Quest IV. That was as far as I could get. I never got to the R&R world.
8316540	8320100	So I, as many times as I played the game, I always
8320100	8325780	oh, I don't even remember what that planet is called anymore. I always got that far and then that was the end of it.
8325780	8329220	And that was the whole game for me for about five years of my life.
8329220	8332820	I was more of a King's Quest player and I wish to God those games would come out on
8332820	8336220	like Xbox Live Arcade, although they're on like GameTap and stuff, so you know.
8336220	8339900	You're entirely wrong in your preference, but you know what, a lot of people were.
8339900	8344460	Hey, King's Quest has that rabid fandom. I remember
8344460	8347780	about a year or two ago on this show we had those guys- Silver lining?
8347780	8351100	Yeah, the Silver Lining, which was originally like a King's Quest-inspired thing and
8351100	8353980	then they were allowed to put it out if they ditched the King's Quest thing and
8353980	8355940	you know, that whole mess that was going on there.
8355940	8360180	I can't say anything bad about King's Quest. The Sierra Adventure games in general were really
8360180	8361260	impressive. I just
8361260	8366320	Hell yeah. I never had one. I never played one. Space Quest wasn't my series. Something sadly lacking in gaming
8366320	8368580	today unless it says Telltale Games on it.
8368580	8372820	They're the only ones doing anything, you know? Anyhow.
8372820	8376660	Anything else, Jason, you wanna talk about tonight before we get some other calls? Do you guys
8376660	8380940	really think that Bioshock really needs multiplayer?
8380940	8384780	No. I personally don't think it needs multiplayer. I think the first one was
8384780	8385980	good enough as it is.
8385980	8388980	But I can see why they want to put it in the second one
8388980	8392860	to definitely make it not feel like more of the same. Because you know,
8392860	8396340	I think otherwise some people might start to say, well, it's more of the same.
8396340	8400100	You know, it's another sci-fi. You know, no matter what the story is or what they do
8400100	8401580	with it, there's gonna be people out there that say
8401580	8404660	it's more of the same. But if they throw this multiplayer curve at it,
8404660	8407820	people are gonna be like, oh my gosh, it's like the must-have game of
8407820	8410980	da-da-da. You know, it almost makes me think they left it out. It makes it just like every other
8410980	8412860	first-person shooter with a different weapon set.
8412860	8417800	I mean, the one thing as much crap as I gave Bioshock because the
8417800	8418380	ending,
8418380	8423060	the last hour and a half or so of it just absolutely pissed me off. It was so
8423060	8427900	boring and then it ended with the easiest boss battle I think I've ever seen in a game.
8427900	8431420	Bioshock, what made
8431420	8435340	the best thing about Bioshock was the story.
8435340	8438700	It was interesting. It was scientific fantasy,
8438700	8442100	sci-fi. It was a
8442100	8448220	good story. Being able to find the story and if you actually sat down and
8448220	8449140	paid attention to it.
8449140	8453080	I mean, you know, I'm not an ADD gamer so maybe I have a little bit of a
8453080	8455380	different look on the game than some other people.
8455380	8459260	But the story made that game incredible
8459260	8462620	until the end. But that was the best part about it and
8462620	8467580	you lose all that in multiplayer. It's more... I really shouldn't say this, but it's more
8467580	8468180	humdrum.
8468180	8471660	It doesn't necessarily mean though, Jason, that the focus is gonna be on multiplayer.
8471660	8474420	They might still have a very solid single-player mode in it and the
8474420	8476700	multiplayer might just be an afterthought type thing.
8476700	8479700	That's very true. I just did.
8479700	8483860	A lot of... when you guys mentioned it and I went article surfing, it was just like
8483860	8487580	they're finally getting multiplayer. Oh my god!
8487580	8492380	Well, because there's a whole audience out there that does play first-person
8492380	8493100	shooters to
8493100	8497060	do the multiplayer and, you know, it was missing for them in the first Bioshock.
8497060	8500580	Maybe they don't see the same thing in it. I can't talk it. It's just kind of... it
8500580	8503900	seems overbearing in the pre... in everybody's view.
8503900	8507700	We'll see. Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls. But you have a
8507700	8508120	good one.
8508120	8511380	Thanks, buddy. Fine. Jeez, come on. Sorry.
8511380	8514420	We try to keep it to five minutes and you're on eight. Alright.
8514420	8521420	See you, buddy. Bye. Bye. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is
8521420	8522740	OrangeLoungeRadio.
8522740	8526900	SSJ100Matt says, apparently not having multiplayer in a game hurts a game.
8526900	8530300	Sorry if Legend of Zelda doesn't have multiplayer. Hey, but there was that
8530300	8531220	Four Swords game.
8531220	8535100	That was kind of awesome. Remember that? On the GameCube? Yeah. I like that game.
8535100	8540020	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? It's GS68.
8540020	8545780	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind? Um, so I found out I'm playing DD Max Fever.
8545780	8549020	Oh, the new one in the US? The one that just came out?
8549020	8552100	Yeah, the American one. And I know you're a big...
8552100	8556820	It's a good game on its own. I mean, I know you're a pretty good pick from Portable 1 and 2, but
8556820	8562700	as far as, like, buying it if you've already into the series, I can't really recommend it.
8562700	8567500	I mean, you might as well just get Portable 1 and 2 and get the full silence from both games.
8567500	8572260	Yeah, I'm kind of interested in your review here, because I know you're a big
8572260	8575980	DJ Max fan, so it's kind of interesting to hear you kind of give this a negative
8575980	8576900	review, but what if,
8576900	8580340	what if I'm somebody, you know, because I am somebody, personally, who's not really
8580340	8583860	played a lot of the DJ Max game? I mean, I have a friend that's obsessed with it, too,
8583860	8587300	so I've, like, seen it. I've seen a couple of videos. I've not really sat down and
8587300	8588980	spent any quality time with the game.
8588980	8592840	Let's say I'm a person who's never really seen or heard of DJ Max before. Is this a
8592840	8594020	good introduction game?
8594020	8603420	Um, I can't really say yet. I don't play it much, but it's pretty decent, but there's,
8603420	8609260	one thing that's biting me about this game, and it's the whole author-correct feature.
8609260	8610940	What is this feature?
8610940	8617580	Basically, if you press the wrong button for a note, but at the right time, the phone is
8617580	8622860	on the same side of the screen as the note is, you still get 100%, the full percentage
8622860	8628300	for it, and you still get some points for it. And I'm on a game site as DJ Max Zero
8628300	8633020	Board, and I'm seeing newbies saying, oh, so I can just press any button to play the
8633020	8638460	game? So what's the point of the notes and such, and this, I think, is a bad idea.
8638460	8639560	That is kind of strange.
8639560	8640560	Yeah, because then you can just go like do-do-do-do.
8640560	8643640	I don't really dubs it down. Yeah. You can't turn that off?
8643640	8644640	Press two buttons, I think.
8644640	8645640	This seems a little silly.
8645640	8651860	I can't. I mean, yeah, you get 80% of the points, but you still get full credit as far
8651860	8654260	credit as far as your percentage goes which means
8654260	8657260	you can start pressing the wrong notes at
8657260	8660520	all the time and still get one hundred percent
8660520	8663980	percentage at the end of the song. Well now this begs the question who the hell did
8663980	8667280	they make this game for then because you know i would think oh this is kind of
8667280	8670740	like you know a little reward for the people that have supported DJ Max in this
8670740	8673880	country you know they're going to finally release it in the US but if most
8673880	8676720	people that are interested in this game are people that have already imported
8676720	8678740	the other copies then what the hell's the point
8678740	8682620	because they didn't really put anything in this game to really woo a new audience to it
8682620	8686560	you know and if they did it's the most casual of casual players who just want to slam any
8686560	8689160	button they can to get a high score
8689160	8692600	well they had to uh... the people that imported them
8692600	8696620	you know they were real fans but this is one that they actually sent out to the
8696620	8699220	stupid american pig dogs
8699220	8705780	well it's not as bad as say butt and groovy
8705780	8706860	i mean
8706860	8710860	it is pretty good for a relief on its own but when you compare it to the other
8710860	8712200	releases
8712200	8713640	it feels kind of outdated
8713640	8714520	and
8714520	8717860	this one worked the exclusive songs and they're not that good
8717860	8722780	well that's unfortunate i guess uh... who knows maybe maybe if it sells okay
8722780	8725380	they'll do another one maybe not
8725380	8729280	i guess a few licenses would have hurt i mean hey they did positive edition which
8729280	8732600	is a licensed game
8732600	8735100	what's that
8735100	8736240	i mean
8736240	8739340	yet i don't think that you have any if you like and that's one of her big area
8739340	8740720	in
8740720	8742940	the report on the tradition is
8742940	8745240	license
8745240	8748320	that's true i was saying the last thing on the show just needed a little bit of
8748320	8751440	americanization to help it penetrate the market even though it might have pissed
8751440	8752880	some of the hardcore fans off
8752880	8755840	it would have in the long run benefit of the game is always sold more copies but
8755840	8758560	no
8758560	8762280	well anything else in your mind gs sixty eight
8762280	8763640	uh...
8763640	8768900	not much really yes i got popping music thirteen but and
8768900	8770260	and uh... yeah
8770260	8771740	i'll do the status but
8771740	8774240	maximum two and three dx came out but
8774240	8779880	i don't want to talk about it because no one cares about it it's not that great
8779880	8782760	it is a new course and
8782760	8785000	has twenty more stages and
8785000	8787480	kind of that's about it basically
8787480	8791380	alright well if fans of the series then should keep an eye out for that for more
8791380	8796040	stages all that good stuff alright gs sixty eight have a good one buddy
8796040	8798020	i did too
8798020	8803100	our little resident uh... d j max fan colin into uh... give us the update on
8803100	8804840	what's going on there
8804840	8807440	i think we're gonna go ahead and close up the skype line for now so sorry to

8810460	8812560	week to take more of your phone calls
8812560	8815460	i think we're gonna go around and uh... start to wrap up the show i know it's
8815460	8818260	been kind of a quick show tonight but you know there was a whole lot in the
8818260	8821420	gaming news and of course with the super bowl and everything else going on
8821420	8824800	at least you got stripper talk if nothing else tonight so it was it was a
8824800	8828040	good show i had quality show did you have fun rice princess
8828040	8831320	i had a great time well thank you so much for being here do you have any
8831320	8833500	final thoughts for our listeners tonight
8833500	8840260	resident evil five resident evil five oh i i should go to loki though first and ask if there's any last minute stories or he'll yell at me
8840260	8843580	i'm not gonna yell at you i don't really care
8843580	8845280	let's see here
8845280	8848180	i was gonna say uh... there's a couple things real quick
8848180	8852880	if you have a launched a three sixty it's no longer under warranty
8852880	8855680	as of uh... february second
8855680	8859080	uh... your three sixty if it gets three rings of death
8859080	8860220	you're screwed
8860220	8863500	and you gotta pay ninety nine dollars get the unit fixed
8863500	8864520	or
8864520	8869920	just buy a new one
8869920	8872780	or you just you know pay someone else to fix it for you
8872780	8874340	for probably less
8874340	8878440	if you uh... pay the ninety nine dollars to get it fixed is it uh... a new warranty
8878440	8881120	or do you have to pay ninety nine dollars if it breaks the next day i
8881120	8885400	think it's a one-year warranty
8885400	8887360	if mine red rings of deaths again
8887360	8889660	although i didn't get mine i mean i would still be covered i think for a
8889660	8892120	couple more months
8892120	8893560	i'm not sure actually
8893560	8895460	how long was the warranty three years three years
8895460	8899240	from purchase date i think mine's up in february you can well you can look on
8899240	8903560	the back of your three six you'll say when it was manufactured and then some
8903560	8907000	you know three years after that because i mean i've got
8907000	8909920	quite a few systems so
8909920	8913080	luckily i think all mine have crapped out the ones that were going to crap out
8913080	8917280	i have one left that's of my original and i have my other one that i fixed
8917280	8919780	so the one that fixed is actually still working very well
8919780	8923840	uh... and then i have one more that like i said that hasn't been replaced yet but
8923840	8925840	all the other ones have so
8925840	8930600	you know four out of six is not a good uh...
8930600	8932600	good ratio no
8932600	8936680	anything else last minute stories tonight
8936680	8940200	all right then silent nathan thank you for being here and being so quiet do you
