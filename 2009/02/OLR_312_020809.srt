1
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:24,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, February 8, 2009, will Netflix on the 360 get a premium upgrade, Time Crisis debuts on the iPhone, and is President Obama a new character in Street Fighter?

2
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I like fire Wait, we didn't hear you, is the mic on?

3
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:53,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It is now!

4
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:54,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there we go.

5
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:58,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Back from the dead to join us here on Orange Launch Radio.

6
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's been out a couple weeks.

7
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,657
[SPEAKER_09]: It was gray.

8
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:00,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

9
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:00,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Very gray.

10
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you went to Prosser, Washington.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Party Central America.

12
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:05,021
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

13
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:06,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I went roller skating.

14
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,847
[SPEAKER_05]: People did roller skating to be cool like 20 years ago.

15
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I love roller skating, but I found out something very depressing, Rob.

16
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, what's that?

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I had... The last time I went roller skating was four years ago.

18
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I went with Jessica, of all people.

19
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:21,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-huh.

20
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:22,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um...

21
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:28,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Oddly enough, having two car accidents where your hip gets injured means it's really hard to roller skate.

22
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:35,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially, you know, when you're going one way and you're having to balance with your right leg and it hurts and ow.

23
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:36,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow.

24
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I murdered myself.

25
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,129
[SPEAKER_10]: But I played lots of stuff.

26
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,791
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about that in just a minute, but I have to introduce everybody else who's here.

27
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

29
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you doing, Loki?

30
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

31
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

32
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:50,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine?

33
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:50,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

34
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:55,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Oakland all day, so you can't really recover from that.

35
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.

36
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:51,632
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to hear everything, you still probably want to watch Justin TV, but actually listen through All Games Radio at www.allgames.com where we tape every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific Time.

37
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's introduce other people we have in the studio tonight.

38
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:55,133
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some very special guests tonight.

39
00:02:56,073 --> 00:03:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start with this guy behind me here who has not been to the show before, but he's someone I've kind of gotten to know a little bit recently and had listened to a few episodes of the show and I was like, well, why don't you come be on the show?

40
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And so say hello to...

41
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Other Matt.

42
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt number two.

43
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt two.

44
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

45
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,079
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Matt two?

46
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:12,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,240
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Rob?

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty good.

49
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for asking.

50
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:16,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.

51
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've actually listened to a couple episodes of the show.

52
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:18,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.

53
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not an OLR virgin.

54
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And you weren't freaked out.

55
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:22,986
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not too badly.

56
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,688
[SPEAKER_05]: We first met when somebody brought you over to my New Year's party.

57
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:28,810
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of were talking and found out we had some things in common and so on.

58
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:31,592
[SPEAKER_05]: But you actually went away and listened to the show and weren't scared off.

59
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,133
[SPEAKER_05]: You still are talking to me, which is awesome.

60
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:36,075
[SPEAKER_07]: The next day, I went to iTunes and I downloaded a recent podcast.

61
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:38,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So within 24 hours, I was already listening.

62
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:39,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

63
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sucker.

64
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quickly, what kind of games do you like?

65
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you've never been on the show before, we usually like to ask new people, what kind of video games do you play, if any?

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I play a few.

67
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly PC gaming for right now.

68
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:55,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have an Xbox 360, but I mainly do the PC gaming.

69
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:58,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything from first-person shooter to...

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:19,699
[SPEAKER_07]: MMORPGs, everything else in between Puzzle games, Prince of Persia, things like that But lately it's been WoW and Rock Band 2 have been dominating my time Nothing wrong with that Nothing wrong with that at all WoW was dominating my time for a little while too Yes Yes, but then I quit But then we have Rock Band 2 I play a lot of as well I have a question for you Okay Do you like old PC games?

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,300
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean old?

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a fan of Loom?

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:38,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Never played Loom, but I go back as far as my online gaming experience goes back to X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, and organizing online gaming clans, if you will, with IRC Chat, and organizing that on the old school MSN Gaming Zone, if you remember that.

74
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:39,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you ever do MUDs?

75
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:40,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Do which?

76
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Do MUDs.

77
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember MUDs.

78
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Old RPG.

79
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Old?

80
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:44,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Old school.

81
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:45,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

82
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:46,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, so.

83
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:46,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

84
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Descent, when Descent was one of the first 3D games.

85
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember Descent and having it over 14 floppies.

86
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:54,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

87
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:58,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doom 2 had 6 floppy 3.5 inch diskettes.

88
00:04:58,957 --> 00:04:59,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah.

89
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:00,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I still remember all my cheat codes too.

90
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,624
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, nerds, we got to introduce somebody else who's here tonight.

91
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:11,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say this is somebody you always hear a lot about, but he hasn't been on the show too many times.

92
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:15,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But just in time for Valentine's Day, you know what?

93
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let Jamie introduce tonight's special guest.

94
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Jamie would do a much better job introducing.

95
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,221
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my personal parasite.

96
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:23,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

97
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:25,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

98
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:30,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband Dan is joining us tonight on the show.

99
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, how are you?

100
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:35,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

101
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:40,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for that wonderful introduction, wife.

102
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:46,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan is the king of gaming in our house.

103
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:49,447
[SPEAKER_09]: He has more knowledge of classic games than I do.

104
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time I want Rob to introduce me, by the way.

105
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:00,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 4

106
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:32,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I prepaid for my $150 fighting stick.

107
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, baby.

109
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:41,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're playing it on Xbox 360, though, you kind of have to have one of those.

110
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:49,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm seriously contemplating getting it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't picture playing Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 controller.

111
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting it on the PlayStation 3.

112
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even just because of the controllers.

113
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:55,134
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because I'm not going to play fighting games on live.

114
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: www.DarkSakura.com

115
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the collector's edition pre-ordered I'm going crazy I'm watching the World Warrior on loop I'm watching the Street Fighter cartoon I'm going to watch the anime movie the night before Try working in a game store where we've had nothing but Street Fighter on all the demos for like a month

116
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of game store work do you do?

117
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:46,377
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't mind me asking.

118
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:47,478
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to say what company or whatever.

119
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you can say or can't say, but what kind of game store stuff do you do?

120
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I manage a game crazy.

121
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:56,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who's listened to this show forever knows I used to manage a GameStop.

122
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:02,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's not that there's anything wrong with GameStop, other than the fact that they're corrupt and evil and hate you.

123
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:10,218
[SPEAKER_06]: But I jumped to the other side.

124
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not that it's any different.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just smaller and hates you less.

126
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:19,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do want to point out now, tonight, we do have the whiteboard in studio.

127
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:24,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can now start, finally, our list of things that suck about GameStop.

128
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to have Dan starting off the list tonight.

129
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:27,453
[SPEAKER_05]: They hate you.

130
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be writing that on the whiteboard here.

131
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,317
[SPEAKER_05]: They hate all of us.

132
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We get into our gaming week.

133
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:36,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

134
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:41,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my past two weeks of gaming have been fairly diverse.

135
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:51,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually finally got past the stupid dialogue portion of Ragnarok DS and actually got to kill four porings.

136
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, four porings.

137
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Blink, blink, blink.

138
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,391
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty fun so far.

139
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,031
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really cute.

140
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just like, dude, how do you get to Prontera?

141
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that was the only word I could read.

142
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know some Japanese.

143
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:06,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't read that much kanji.

144
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:15,617
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also finally got through the damn forest on Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

145
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was exactly what I said I had to do.

146
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,719
[SPEAKER_10]: One more level and I could do it.

147
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

148
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:39,956
[SPEAKER_10]: and then I played, we played R-Type Dimensions last night and I have to say that it's really, really, really freaking sweet especially having unlimited ships because R-Type is like freaking hard.

149
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:41,477
[SPEAKER_10]: It's R-Type.

150
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is actually harder than I remember R-Type being.

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wasn't really all that great at R-Type to begin with.

152
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:52,004
[SPEAKER_10]: But Dan and I played co-op last night.

153
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:53,324
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really fun.

154
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,385
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it wasn't last night.

155
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the night before.

156
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:57,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it was really fun.

157
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:01,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw something that depressed me.

158
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the trailer for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

159
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Civil War crap.

160
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:09,737
[SPEAKER_10]: We hated it the first time, Marvel.

161
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:10,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

162
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

163
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,121
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucked.

164
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,722
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an awful storyline.

165
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:17,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

166
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:19,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you hear me?

167
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:21,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I read your Twitters.

168
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you all.

169
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway.

170
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And then... What else did I play?

171
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

172
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:36,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I did actually play some Ragnarok Online for like, you know, an hour, and that was it.

173
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:42,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also had a minor fangasm over Star Trek Online's character trailer.

174
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:44,036
[SPEAKER_05]: That looked hot.

175
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:49,277
[SPEAKER_10]: But when it comes out, I'm making the official alien race of OLR.

176
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:50,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The OLRians.

177
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:52,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

178
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:54,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be orange people?

179
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,179
[SPEAKER_10]: No, probably not.

180
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange is a good color.

181
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:58,379
Copper.

182
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:58,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Copper.

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Copper.

184
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I insist I don't wear a red shirt.

185
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:05,631
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends though.

186
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:06,551
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no.

187
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:10,672
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are original Star Trek, red shirt is the kiss of death.

188
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:15,013
[SPEAKER_10]: If you in Next Generation, yellow is the kiss of death.

189
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:17,693
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're Voyager, prepare to suck.

190
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey now.

191
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Janeway.

192
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:24,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one.

193
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:30,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're DS9, it's the most awesome of them all and Enterprise doesn't exist.

194
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Quantum Leap to the Future

195
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of Perfect World.

196
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a brief description of what this is.

197
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:03,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not World of Warcraft.

198
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:05,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, then I'm sold.

199
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:10,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same type of game, though, but it has some pretty gorgeous environments, and it's pretty cool.

200
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:12,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can actually ride a tiger.

201
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:14,414
[SPEAKER_10]: You can ride a white tiger.

202
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a white tiger.

203
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you get the eye of the tiger?

204
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I've also decided something else completely unrelated to gaming.

205
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a pet goat.

206
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,499
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't even acknowledge it.

207
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,600
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

208
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I also decided that I want a pet goat while I was out of town.

209
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:33,466
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have my sister's if you want.

210
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:33,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

211
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she can't.

212
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: She has four.

213
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have the cool rectangular pupils?

214
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:40,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

215
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, in real life, IRL, she wants a goat?

216
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:43,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

217
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell are you going to put a goat?

218
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:47,529
[SPEAKER_10]: In the backyard.

219
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, well, you know, my sister is looking for a place to store her four goats.

220
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I want one goat so I can walk it on a leash.

221
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they suck.

222
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,076
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to do with a goat?

223
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:01,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it as a pet!

224
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What, are you going to take it out and walk it around the block?

225
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:04,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

226
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,759
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister collects animals, apparently.

227
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to ride it to work?

228
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,080
[SPEAKER_10]: No, goats are too little to ride.

229
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck.

230
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,081
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing cool about goats.

231
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: They just eat shit and then shit.

232
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they'll eat anything, so I'll just feed it, you know, Jaguar games.

233
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they do.

234
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:24,664
[SPEAKER_03]: They just process grass into shit.

235
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

236
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's Dad's Goats are Cute

237
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:52,126
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this week I didn't play hardly anything other than Grand Theft Auto 4.

238
00:13:53,808 --> 00:14:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been prepping my experience of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, putting the right mods in place so that I can go in and hopefully film something funny.

239
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:08,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little hint, I found a skin to reskin Niko to look like Adolf Hitler.

240
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's going to be fun.

241
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see what else.

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other mods, like flood stuff and crazy weapons, so it's going to be the wacky world of Adolf Hitler.

243
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe another Hitler, you know.

244
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Hitler on ice.

245
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitler in the Matrix or something, I don't know.

246
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, can I say some chat comments real quick?

247
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:37,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

248
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're on a goat kick.

249
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:44,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee, away, I think, who forgot to change her name to Bob Coffee, because they're obviously there.

250
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:47,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee says, zombie goats would be the best thing ever.

251
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be like a video game involving zombie goats.

252
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they did have Black Sheep, which was zombie sheep.

253
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:54,334
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an awful movie.

254
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:57,036
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the trailer for that at the beginning of, was it Death Proof?

255
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was actually a real movie?

256
00:14:59,677 --> 00:14:59,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

257
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:09,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft in chat says, sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell I just posted a picture of the goats in chat because I love them

258
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:18,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.orange.com My sister seriously has her goat on her Facebook as one of her pictures.

259
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:21,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not kidding.

260
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,075
[SPEAKER_03]: She had four of them.

261
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:25,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she has three now because one of them got attacked by dogs and died.

262
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,423
[SPEAKER_03]: She has three goats.

263
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,285
[SPEAKER_03]: This just proves goats suck.

264
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,688
[SPEAKER_03]: If a bunch of dogs can take out a goat...

265
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

266
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:56,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It was her boyfriend's dogs, actually.

267
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:58,005
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like Animal Farm for reals.

268
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,546
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't take care of them, and they start going feral.

269
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why they attack the goats.

270
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, because they're hungry.

271
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:10,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So she also has a bunch of birds and hamsters and shit.

272
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,752
[SPEAKER_03]: She's studying to be a veterinarian, though, right?

273
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of let her get away with it.

274
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:15,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but she shouldn't have goats.

275
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in an apartment.

276
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: She has to store them in Rio Linda.

277
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:20,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

278
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, for Rio Linda, they fit right in.

279
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:33,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways... Yes, they do have names.

280
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:34,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the names are.

281
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:38,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Rio Linda is to Sacramento, as Atmore is to Mobile, Alabama.

282
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's going to help a lot.

283
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's the boonies of California.

284
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so yeah, that's my game week.

285
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just Grand Theft Auto.

286
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to download Killzone 2 because I don't have it pre-ordered at GameStop.

287
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how will I ever get the demo that seems to be region free?

288
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:59,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll create another free account in the UK.

289
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:00,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no!

290
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I've bypassed their security.

291
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

292
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:06,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

293
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,472
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my gaming week.

294
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a whole lot to share.

295
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:15,501
[SPEAKER_05]: After last week's show, you might remember Rice Princess was going crazy over the fact that I had the Resident Evil 5 demo.

296
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually went in and played the Resident Evil 5 demo, and it was pretty cool.

297
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:20,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'll give my impressions on that.

298
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, eh, that's okay.

299
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:22,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

300
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that your impression?

301
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:25,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was just like, eh.

302
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,553
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I felt about it.

303
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil's not a series I've ever gotten into.

304
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love zombies and stuff.

305
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another zombie series, of course, that I really got into that we'll be talking about later.

306
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get this off my chest.

307
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:38,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

308
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to stop talking about this because I have to get this off my chest.

309
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:41,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been waiting all night to say this.

310
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:48,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the absolute worst Xbox Live arcade game in my entire freaking life this week.

311
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:49,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Worse than yours?

312
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:50,709
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

313
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:09,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this game was awful.

314
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't that actually a TV show?

315
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:12,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a TV show.

316
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:17,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it got cancelled like five times because the setup of the show was stupid.

317
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,738
[SPEAKER_05]: The AI in the game was stupid.

318
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: If they got an answer wrong, they would misspell words.

319
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even understand how the game worked and the clues were terrible.

320
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this game was awful.

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt myself slowly dying.

322
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

323
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, for real, right?

324
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring us some good game shows.

325
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:00,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

326
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:09,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat says, this game, S-U-C blank S. Exactly how I feel.

327
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:11,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't even be upset if they brought back Bumper Stumpers.

328
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:17,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Bumper Stumpers was kind of like, how can you have Bumper Stumpers go on and on and on forever?

329
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:18,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

330
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:19,467
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, forget it.

331
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:19,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

332
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:21,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I demand that they bring a...

333
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Game of Double Dare VXJasonXV in chat says The game show itself is interesting Games based off of game shows tend to suck though Look, I would rather play the Are you smarter than a 5th grader game All day long Than have to play 5 minutes of Merv Griffin's Crosswords ever again

334
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, with zombie Jeff Foxworthy.

335
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:47,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even... Actually, all things considered, the Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader game wasn't bad.

336
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for what it is, you know what it is.

337
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adaptation of the TV show.

338
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:53,274
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like the TV show, then whatever.

339
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:54,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably not going to like the game.

340
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,935
[SPEAKER_05]: For what it is, that live game is not bad.

341
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game was just not fun at all.

342
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:00,916
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.

343
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:03,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe because you weren't a fan of the TV show?

344
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I never watched the TV show.

345
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:07,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved the Scrabble show back in the day.

346
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I like word game shows.

347
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,242
[SPEAKER_05]: What other word... The Scrabble show was awesome.

348
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:11,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Lingo.

349
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:12,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Lingo.

350
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: These are two games I would rather see on Xbox Live than Murder, Grim, and Traverse.

351
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:22,567
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have a game that you're an audience member at one of these shows, and you can yell at the contestants and get them to do stuff.

352
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But it may or may not affect the answers.

353
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:29,551
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole 1 vs. 100 thing that's coming to Xbox Live or whatever that... What are they calling that?

354
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:29,931
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole...

355
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

356
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

357
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,092
[SPEAKER_05]: and Deekman in chat says, did you mention Left 4 Dead?

358
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check out Left 4 Dead finally.

359
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:23,355
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our listeners was very, very kind and gave... I guess they bought a four-pack together but only used three of the codes.

360
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:24,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So they gave me a code.

361
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:25,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very, very thankful.

362
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did check out the game for a little bit but not enough to give impressions yet.

363
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played enough at all.

364
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I got raped in like five minutes.

365
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how horrible I am at first-person shooters, okay?

366
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:40,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I was going down the stairs and then some big fat guy comes down the stairs and rapes us all because I don't know what I'm doing.

367
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:41,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So I...

368
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a big square and I play a little bit of WoW.

369
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:44,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on that ever...

370
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:09,890
[SPEAKER_07]: LongQuest to hit 80, because I'm a noob.

371
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have like 20 characters!

372
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not have 20 characters.

373
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one of every class on Narzul, which is my main server.

374
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:22,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny, because we do have Trekkie nerds on the show tonight, and I think every time.

375
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:27,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my characters are named after what I have affectionately called obscure Star Trek characters.

376
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:36,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for example, Kes, Seska, Neelix, Gumtu, Darmok, and if you're a Trekkie, you recognize hopefully a handful of those.

377
00:22:37,071 --> 00:23:05,352
[SPEAKER_07]: my main mages I recognize two of them as Voyager names that's right Darmok and Jameelix was really obscure he was on for like six seasons he cooked but he cooked and he didn't he was a main character he was in the opening credits he was on Voyager he was a morale officer Voyager was awesome he was a morale officer that became a security guy under Tuvok anyway so obscure because you never really think of it you think of Janeway you think of Trekkies 3 yeah Trekkies 3 exactly what's that?

378
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to ask, do you like Warp 11?

379
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:09,071
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

380
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:10,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadness.

381
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:11,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

382
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:18,656
[SPEAKER_07]: My main mage is Malak, but I had to rename him to Valerian since someone took the name when I had the transfer service.

383
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:29,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully one day Valerian will be 80, and then I will have to work on my other, as Rob calls them, 20 characters.

384
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee in chat says, I recognize all of those I fail at life, lol.

385
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We both fail at life, lol squared.

386
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,362
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

387
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:02,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, how was your gaming week?

388
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:03,669
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of stuff have you been playing?

389
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

390
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:13,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I pulled down HD Remix, the Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix, and at first I played the demo and I was like, ah, super janky, no thanks.

391
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: But as Street Fighter Mania gripped me, it was like, okay, I'll download it.

392
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually not too bad.

393
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:22,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit easier than Super Turbo is normally, so that's pretty awesome.

394
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Rob, these are the people that encourage this kind of behavior, re-releasing games.

395
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

396
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:30,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm terrible, because I also downloaded R-Type Dimensions.

397
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was... It kicked ass.

398
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:34,283
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

399
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:37,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got... I've got the remake of Bionic Manor.

400
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:38,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a remake whore.

401
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, if it's a good remake, if it's a game that needs to be remade... Some of them are really good.

402
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:42,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bionic Manor... I mean...

403
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:51,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I fully say remake it, but you gotta be real faithful and real respectful of the original material.

404
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:09,485
[SPEAKER_03]: R-Type, I'm not really sure if they changed anything to it, but Street Fighter, they just made the sprites prettier.

405
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:11,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was basically what they did with R-Type.

406
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:13,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's R-Type 1, R-Type 2.

407
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:14,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the 3D graphics.

408
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,033
[SPEAKER_06]: They added a two-player simultaneous mode, which was actually kind of interesting.

409
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:25,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're an R-Type god and you could blaze through the whole game with no problem, yeah, it's still just R-Type.

410
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,202
[SPEAKER_05]: You are an R-Type god, though, from what I remember Jamie saying.

411
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:38,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could totally dust, like, the first three levels of R-Type 1, then you get to level 4 when the game gets hard, and I mean, I don't care who you are, R-Type gets real, real hard.

412
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:43,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I could beat it on the consoles, but this, R-Type Dimensions is a hard version of R-Type.

413
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:55,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if your hitbox in that game is bigger or what, but, you know, there's a lot of shooters and stuff that deserve remakes, and so, I do encourage that, you know, as long as it's respectful to the original game, and it's a game that needs it, you know.

414
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,173
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat makes a good case.

415
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Bionic Commando remake was awesome.

416
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:02,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the Hitler head explosion in full 3D.

417
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:03,216
[SPEAKER_05]: True that.

418
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,078
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true.

419
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:05,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Very true.

420
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and get into some housekeeping tonight real quick, and then we'll finally get into some gaming news.

421
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:12,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

422
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:13,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what?

423
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few more things I want to add.

424
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:14,504
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

425
00:26:14,984 --> 00:26:15,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

426
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:17,806
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

427
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:20,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I don't think we're talking about this tonight, so I'm going to mention it anyways.

428
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The Warriors on Xbox Live Arcade

429
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:50,765
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:10,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, definitely.

431
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:12,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I think actually it's already coming, the gaming.

432
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:17,301
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to show that off at E3 this year with Avatar by Ubisoft.

433
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in 3D as well.

434
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't be surprised if it's polarized because that would make sense to me because it doesn't look that bad when you're not looking at it without the glasses.

435
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was really surprised before.

436
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:37,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just used to either the really weird blurry glasses or the red and blue stuff.

437
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

438
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:40,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, old school 3D stuff.

439
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:45,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, the polarized glasses, it was weird because I put them on and I thought, oh, this is going to hurt my eyes and stuff.

440
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:48,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, it's just looking like through normal glasses.

441
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:50,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, the effect on the screen is really awesome.

442
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:51,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a question for you.

443
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:56,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you ever, I think it's on the WiimoteHack website.

444
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,101
[SPEAKER_10]: There was the guy who did sort of the reverse by using the infrared sensors.

445
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:03,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the, I forget what they call it.

446
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't done that just yet.

447
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:06,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

448
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:08,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get my Bluetooth stuff to work right.

449
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:13,569
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean you can see the full 3D effect even just watching a video of it.

450
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:16,630
[SPEAKER_10]: They should do something that would utilize that type of technology.

451
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:26,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well they were supposed to in Boom Blocks if you remember the developers wanted to do that but they somehow someone said no and they had to take it out.

452
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:27,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

453
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:29,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was going to be a little Easter egg in there where you could do it that way.

454
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:31,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what they called it.

455
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Um

456
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:38,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Trackmania does some sort of 3D thing.

457
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:43,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's with the red-blue glasses or if it's the polarized glasses, but that would be fun.

458
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Trackmania is a sweet game.

459
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's it.

460
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

461
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's alright, that's alright.

462
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about, really quickly, housekeeping.

463
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I pretty much said all I wanted to say about the new website.

464
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that will go live for everybody, not just during the show, but everybody will get to see that.

465
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:02,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully in the next week or two, it's going to be awesome.

466
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:04,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular content, again, I'm so excited.

467
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We can actually do reviews and all that fun stuff.

468
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:06,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be great.

469
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:15,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, just make sure to keep following us on MySpace and Facebook, at the Oil Army on Facebook, and LiveJournal as well at Orange Lounge.

470
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:16,644
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Loki?

471
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:19,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking, because it is sort of housekeeping.

472
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I can get in.

473
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:42,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Special guests in is going to be difficult, but we'll see.

474
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:53,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, possibly this year we will have Nelly coming in to do her Woman That Hates Gaming review of E3.

475
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to go there for a couple days.

476
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:01,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually going to a trip for Disneyland as well.

477
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Because E3 happens to fall on her birthday.

478
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So she said, you know, I'm going to be...

479
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:13,691
[SPEAKER_03]: you know very loving and I'm gonna I'll go with you you you can go to E3 you know

480
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:38,781
[SPEAKER_03]: and all you know as long as we go to you know Disneyland stuff so I'm fine with that and go in the E3 maybe a day or two or something like that I'm very excited to get the wife that hates gaming interviews it's gonna be amazing all right so we'll see we'll see all right anyhow let's get into some gaming news like a half hour into the show and haven't gotten to gaming news yet so Loki please take it away all right well speaking of E3 um the exhibitor list has been revealed and uh

481
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:44,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people that had dropped out before are back, including Activision Blizzard.

482
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,625
[SPEAKER_03]: They are back after dropping out of the last E3.

483
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:49,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, who can blame them?

484
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:52,786
[SPEAKER_03]: The last E3 was kind of... I don't know.

485
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:56,828
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting, though.

486
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though Activision Blizzard may be there, the Blizzard portion of Activision will not be there.

487
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:06,352
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean...

488
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:14,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they did have a few things they could have shown off, like Diablo 3 and StarCraft 2, but I don't know.

489
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't really know when all that stuff is supposed to come out, so they don't really necessarily need to show that, I guess.

490
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,960
[SPEAKER_06]: What does Activision have that you want to see without Blizzard?

491
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Without Blizzard?

492
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard has everything.

493
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:31,061
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got StarCraft, they've got Diablo, they've got whatever's next for WarCraft.

494
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:33,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision's like, well, we've got Guitar Hero!

495
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

496
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:57,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the new Tony Hawk game where they're going to have an actual skateboard that you use for the game.

497
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be interesting.

498
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:00,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else they can try to sell us for $200.

499
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:01,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

500
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:07,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll see what they're going to do to innovate with Guitar Hero.

501
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:18,284
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and possibly the new Transformers game just to see if it's really sucky or not.

502
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I know the first game blew, okay?

503
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:23,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you watch the trailer that's up on Kotaku for it?

504
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:26,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it doesn't look any better than the first game.

505
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,552
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a different developer, okay?

506
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:29,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

507
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:30,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a movie game.

508
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to suck.

509
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:34,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be bad in a different way, and not all movie games suck.

510
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:34,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wonderful.

511
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:35,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

512
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Wanted looks awesome, and that's going to be a movie game.

513
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's not going to be awesome.

514
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,125
[SPEAKER_06]: You're watching a trailer, and you're like, ooh, that looks like it might be good.

515
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, Transformers, the new game trailer, there was nothing that said, I'm going to buy this.

516
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of, I mean, look at it.

517
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,841
[SPEAKER_06]: If you even spend money to rent that game, you're high.

518
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:03,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for seven-year-old boys who love the movie and have to keep on living it.

519
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:04,627
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not for gamers.

520
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:06,868
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to keep on living the movie.

521
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:07,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

522
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:10,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirate it like the rest of us.

523
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:11,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

524
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,434
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, Activision has got nothing without Blizzard.

525
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

526
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it sucks.

527
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:46,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it started off as a port of the GameCube game, and they fucked that up, and so they made it into this new game where they renamed it, and it still sucked.

528
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:52,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, speaking of porting GameCube games, who's not bitter that Pikmin is just the GameCube version with Wii controls?

529
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:54,117
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

530
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's just GX, because that game was brutal.

531
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:20,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That better be the secret in Reggie's pants at E3.

532
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:27,100
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they should be doing as one of the new play control games.

533
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Falcon Punch!

534
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:37,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, they should do a new play control version of F-Zero GX, because that would be perfect.

535
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:44,428
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of this Mario Power Tennis, really, was that such a great game that it requires... Mario Power Tennis was pretty pimp.

536
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And come on, like Strikers?

537
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:48,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Strikers is awesome.

538
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:52,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario's aggressive death soccer is like the best game to ever happen.

539
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:56,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I still, still can't, you know, believe that that game is that good.

540
00:34:57,743 --> 00:34:59,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate soccer, but I love that game.

541
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it...

542
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:08,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get that mental image now of Reggie Fils-Aimé coming out at E3 and Falcon punching us with his cock.

543
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:20,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I issue a challenge now to our listeners, especially the ones who were kind enough to do the Kutaragi Crayon eating picture.

544
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,182
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

545
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:23,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make a picture.

546
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,203
[SPEAKER_10]: We now want the Falcon punch picture.

547
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,104
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

548
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:29,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I will send someone a shiny silver dollar.

549
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:30,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it clean.

550
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:31,666
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

551
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,659
[SPEAKER_10]: That I write on in Sharpie.

552
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,420
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Falcon Punch.

553
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to something depressing to try and sedate the show a little bit here.

554
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, THQ has laid off about 100 people on their staff.

555
00:35:45,582 --> 00:35:47,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad trombone.

556
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:50,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sad trombone, but it was the mobile gaming division.

557
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:52,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean to sound crass.

558
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:55,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel sorry for those people.

559
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:58,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks to lose jobs and stuff, and the economy stinks and everything, but...

560
00:35:59,306 --> 00:35:59,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

561
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Does THQ make anything besides SmackDown?

562
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they make a bunch of Spongebob and Nintendo licensed games and Saints Row 2, which I love.

563
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, they did make Saints Row 2.

564
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:11,674
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was not so bad.

565
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, well, here's the thing.

566
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:16,560
[SPEAKER_05]: They are actually going to be restructuring the wireless subsidiary.

567
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:23,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, though, they actually closed completely the San Diego mobile studio as well and some offices in UK and Germany.

568
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They are still going to be cranking out some wireless games, though, out of Finland.

569
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:29,522
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Uni Versomo Studios.

570
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:34,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess this means, I don't know, more Worms Mobile, things of that sort.

571
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:36,984
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a mobile version of Saints Row.

572
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:38,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was any good, though.

573
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:40,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

574
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:41,905
[SPEAKER_06]: If they did, like, Worms World Party...

575
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

576
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:09,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we will.

577
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:10,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Who likes Netflix?

578
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:11,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Me.

579
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:17,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I have watched seasons 1 and 2 of 30 Rock on Netflix on demand on the Xbox 360.

580
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

581
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:31,407
[SPEAKER_10]: See, speaking of Netflix on the Xbox 360, they did a survey that went out to a few members that was asking them if they would pay a little bit extra for premium content like from cable channels like HBO.

582
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:36,949
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's sort of, I guess, rumored that it's going to be around $10 extra.

583
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't encourage them.

584
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:43,574
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I don't know.

585
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some people would be excited by it.

586
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:46,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody will be excited by it.

587
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:48,159
[SPEAKER_10]: There are consumer whores.

588
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I like the idea of offering some more of this premium content.

589
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, being able to watch the tutors on demand and all this kind of stuff sounds kind of awesome.

590
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:56,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like...

591
00:37:58,024 --> 00:37:58,905
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

592
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:25,993
[SPEAKER_05]: but independent documentaries about strippers that went to stripping because of Hurricane Katrina which yes is an actual documentary I once watched on Netflix 360.

593
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:28,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all that's going to be left is Hurricane Stripping.

594
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:29,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Premium content, good.

595
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Paying more, bad.

596
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:38,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already $9 a month for like the super basic level with the unlimited streaming which is great through the Xbox.

597
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:39,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

598
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:39,385
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

599
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:40,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

600
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:44,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got me watching more TV than ever, which is, you know, really what society needed.

601
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:48,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, it's like, oh man, don't give them any reason to charge us more.

602
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:51,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's given us Doctor Who.

603
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,254
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got up to season four now, right?

604
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:54,654
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

605
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:55,074
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

606
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:58,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only don't we have season four, but we're not paying extra for it.

607
00:38:58,696 --> 00:38:59,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It just came with the next season.

608
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:15,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be curious if you sign up for premium membership at Takeaway Subscribership from HBO, Cinemax, all that stuff, from cable subscribers, because now they can just download for a whole lot cheaper the main shows like Big Love, Tudors, other Sopranos from back in the day, those types of shows.

609
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:18,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about the Takeaway Subscribership.

610
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:25,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question, but I wonder if they would care, because they're still getting money from you watching their shows, so maybe they don't care.

611
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:26,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They still get their money one way or another.

612
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,803
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, or the cable companies are maybe losing revenue.

613
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:30,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about the hell with them.

614
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:37,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that Netflix is actually paying a certain percentage to the premium channels for content.

615
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:41,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that would make sense, or else HBO would be like, bitch, please.

616
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:46,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they pay a licensing fee for the movies that they use, but I mean...

617
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:53,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they're going to show The Sopranos every night after it comes on like they do CSI.

618
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Xlink in chatroom says, gives a very honest response.

619
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,632
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I torrent.

620
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very honest response, whether legality is questionable or whatever.

621
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dan says, why pay for what I can steal?

622
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:07,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, there's something to be said.

623
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like iTunes.

624
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people actually use iTunes when you can go out and find the downloaded MP3?

625
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:14,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find the actual MP3.

626
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have an iPhone.

627
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and the fact, how convenient is it that you can just sit there, tap a button, and you will have the full song for just a buck.

628
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:22,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's legal.

629
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:26,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get the warm fuzzies, legal, supporting the artist, all that stuff.

630
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:29,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I get the warm fuzzies doing the opposite.

631
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:30,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're evil.

632
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:32,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because you're a prevert.

633
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:32,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

634
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:33,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's not true.

635
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

636
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:40,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Netflix isn't really gaming, but at the same time, that's what people use their 360s for lately.

637
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:40,922
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I do.

638
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,104
[SPEAKER_06]: One million subscribers.

639
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend more time on my 360.

640
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:49,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, if you look what I've done the past week, on the 360, I played that horrible Crosswords game.

641
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:51,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Netflix.

642
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:55,694
[SPEAKER_05]: My PlayStation 3 is actually where I've been gaming lately because I have Prince of Persia on PS3.

643
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing that and LittleBigPlanet.

644
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:57,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing the hell out of.

645
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been my...

646
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:14,436
[SPEAKER_05]: PS3 I'm actually using my which is weird because I always thought PS3 was supposed to be the system that was going to be my all-in-one entertainment center but like I'm the complete opposite lately I don't know what the hell's up with that I use my PS3 for streaming stuff it works pretty well

647
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:15,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, who cares?

648
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on with gaming news.

649
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:21,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Gauntlet DS is potentially cancelled.

650
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is coming from, I guess, various retail sites that have been telling their customers they had a pre-order that's been cancelled.

651
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's been removed off of GameStop and some other retail websites.

652
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I know from a distributor's standpoint, I think it was...

653
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It was locked and basically put out of print, which either means that it's got a to-be-announced release date, or actually it's cancelled.

654
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:53,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's pretty much cancelled.

655
00:41:54,465 --> 00:41:55,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it possibly be in limo?

656
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, might the game be changing hands or something?

657
00:41:58,467 --> 00:41:58,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be.

658
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens a lot.

659
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, with Midway going through all the problems it's been having too, you know.

660
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for reminding me too, that that was something I gotta touch on

661
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:12,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything four player on the DS would be really cool.

662
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that you're waiting for from Midway, don't hold your breath.

663
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:38,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It pains me to say it because I love Midway.

664
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:39,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

665
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:45,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Mortal Kombat and a lot of their IPs, but that company is boned.

666
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:47,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It is too bad.

667
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:50,180
[SPEAKER_06]: They owe twice what their company is worth.

668
00:42:50,220 --> 00:43:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: The only solace that you'll get is the fact that probably the big studios that they own and the franchises will be snapped up by bigger, probably more stable companies.

669
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,665
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll all belong to EA.

670
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:09,707
[SPEAKER_06]: and, uh, or ActaBlizzard, uh, before, uh, before it's all over, but Midway is, is going down the tubes.

671
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:14,488
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta wonder how much Midway lost on that, uh, Strang, what was that, Stranglehold or whatever that game was?

672
00:43:14,888 --> 00:43:21,989
[SPEAKER_05]: They brought in that big, huge name director and they spent all this money marketing it and I didn't, I think the game made a, a poop when it landed, you know?

673
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just Stranglehold, they've just had flop after flop after flop and...

674
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:27,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

675
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:31,118
[SPEAKER_06]: They have all these great franchises and they would try to bring them back.

676
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Spy Hunter for the PS2 back in the day.

677
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And Spy Hunter was great.

678
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, oh man, we'll do Defender.

679
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Defender wasn't a bad game, but nobody cared.

680
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And their Treasures collections are awesome.

681
00:43:41,323 --> 00:43:45,686
[SPEAKER_05]: The Midway Treasure collections they did on Xbox, like the 20 old games, like Rampage.

682
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they sell hand over fist.

683
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,087
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta wonder how they could be in that much trouble.

684
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:55,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the development budgets on their not whoring out their old franchises have just been out of control.

685
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:55,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

686
00:43:56,211 --> 00:44:00,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is kind of their last hurrah, I think

687
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:16,890
[SPEAKER_05]: The DS isn't the most powerful wireless networking device.

688
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

689
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:22,535
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they had it working, or maybe they couldn't get it working.

690
00:44:24,217 --> 00:44:25,878
[SPEAKER_06]: If they could make it work.

691
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see how much you're going to need voice for Gauntlet.

692
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:35,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's nice, but it's Gauntlet.

693
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit that thing with an axe!

694
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:37,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick!

695
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:39,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Grab the treasure!

696
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:41,856
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my treasure!

697
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit dying!

698
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:43,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Elf shot the food.

699
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it, people!

700
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:54,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that complex!

701
00:45:13,348 --> 00:45:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Lego-based strategy game, basically.

702
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Loki's kind of talked about this a little bit on the show before.

703
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:19,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

704
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I?

705
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's officially now out there that you're going to be having bases that you're building and defending.

706
00:45:26,352 --> 00:45:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Lego castles, Lego's pirates, Lego's space-themed.

707
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:35,415
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have units that you can actually have pirates and space people in the same team.

708
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can mix and match all this stuff.

709
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Until there's Lego ninjas, it just don't matter.

710
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:46,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, apparently, in the press release, you can have pirate swordsmen fighting wizards and aliens, dragons battling ninjas.

711
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:49,073
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's going to be the greatest LEGO game to ever happen.

712
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And pirate ships launching broadsides against spacecraft and knights.

713
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:57,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also play this game local multiplayer.

714
00:45:57,779 --> 00:45:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, no VIP.

715
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:00,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirate ship fighting a spaceship.

716
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just ridiculous.

717
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:03,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

718
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,783
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a pirate ship got cannons and shit?

719
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The spaceship's like, I'm just going to fly higher, bitch.

720
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:09,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're dead.

721
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to make a game like this, but like not LEGOs.

722
00:46:14,113 --> 00:46:40,636
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to go old school and get like the Blacktron Legos in there no offense against the Legos but I want to see like dragons versus spaceships for real I want fucking Duplo in this shit Duplo would totally dominate because they'd just be giant indestructible blocks it'd be like tech level low but resistance is like super high and cost well cost of anything Lego is just through the roof

723
00:46:41,414 --> 00:46:43,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, it's like Construction Fighter.

724
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego versus Mega Bloks.

725
00:46:45,276 --> 00:46:48,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Legos and Duplos and Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs.

726
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:50,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen the Mega Blok Halo toys that they're doing?

727
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-uh.

728
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get like Warthogs and Scorpion Tanks and stuff all made with Mega Bloks.

729
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,721
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a franchise that someone should have jumped on.

730
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:03,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was April Fool's joke, but Lego Halo would have been sweet.

731
00:47:04,623 --> 00:47:09,105
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room is talking about like a Lego fighting game, and the Rob D says you could lose parts as you fight.

732
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:09,785
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

733
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:10,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

734
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Just knock the blocks off of somebody.

735
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,621
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

736
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:20,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego Street Fighter.

737
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:24,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Legos, did you see the pictures someone did of the StarCraft II?

738
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:26,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

739
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: That person is my hero.

740
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:30,532
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.

741
00:47:31,793 --> 00:47:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

742
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:37,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so Lego Battles coming to the DS, I believe the release date is summertime, so we'll see.

743
00:47:38,237 --> 00:47:38,438
[SPEAKER_05]: April.

744
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:39,678
[SPEAKER_09]: April.

745
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,939
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in time for my birthday.

746
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:41,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

747
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninjas and Dragons on Jamie's birthday.

748
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:45,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Who could ask for more?

749
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:46,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock.

750
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for our UK friends, I'm so sorry.

751
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:53,800
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that this game is coming out as making me laugh.

752
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:08,663
[SPEAKER_10]: They're bringing out a Coronation Street game on the DS, which is sort of like, as far as I know, it's sort of like a weird soap opera-y type show out there, kind of like, what is it, the other one, EastEnders, I think?

753
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:09,923
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

754
00:48:10,663 --> 00:48:10,923
[SPEAKER_10]: You look...

755
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't on the mic.

756
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:21,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan didn't say it in the mic so you guys didn't hear it, but he went way to cover the gaming news that matters.

757
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,394
[SPEAKER_10]: We have listeners in the UK.

758
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:24,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

759
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:32,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to point out when Loki reads release dates, he reads things like Imagine Teacher and Imagine Babies Dance Party.

760
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:33,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to cover everything.

761
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:36,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to cover everything.

762
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:37,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can make fun of it.

763
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:44,744
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be a hundred more people interested in what she's talking about than imagine, you know, sitting around and fucking yourself.

764
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:45,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what?

765
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:51,413
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were going to read release dates that mattered to me, we wouldn't be reading anything.

766
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:53,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I do my story, please?

767
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:54,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you may.

768
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,025
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the official STFU from me.

769
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:58,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

770
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, yeah, Coronation Street is really, really popular.

771
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:07,524
[SPEAKER_10]: It has 78% of the UK's television audience.

772
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:13,088
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, it's like, if you're going to watch TV and it's on, that's the only thing to watch, I guess.

773
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:24,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're doing a DS game by, I don't really know too much about what's going into the game exactly as far as the play of it will be.

774
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's supposed to be out for Christmas this year, so...

775
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, you get Coronation Street.

776
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they should do a little Britain DS game.

777
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:40,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That PlayStation 2 one was awful.

778
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:42,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did a PSP and PS2 game.

779
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:44,874
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

780
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not want.

781
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:51,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Top Gear and Doctor Who are the only things that justify the continued existence of the BBC.

782
00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:55,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.

783
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:57,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.

784
00:49:57,836 --> 00:49:58,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever that is.

785
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and Primeval.

786
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Primeval still on?

787
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Primeval, that's a good show.

788
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:07,182
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I haven't seen Primeval.

789
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:13,024
[SPEAKER_10]: The new series after Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, that's pretty decent.

790
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:14,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, yes.

791
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's actually lots of good stuff on BBC.

792
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:20,547
[SPEAKER_10]: But it really is about Doctor Who.

793
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:24,048
[SPEAKER_10]: The staple of British television, in my opinion.

794
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:25,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And Top Gear.

795
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:25,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Top Gear.

796
00:50:29,982 --> 00:50:54,976
[SPEAKER_03]: going from something on the BBC to something that's very American Godfather 2 EA has delayed the release of the game because apparently releasing Godfather 2 on the same day as Killzone 2 not a good idea so they decided to hold it off a little bit I believe now it's coming out the second quarter beginning of April probably

797
00:50:56,812 --> 00:50:57,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cool.

798
00:50:57,852 --> 00:50:58,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

799
00:50:58,253 --> 00:50:59,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too excited about Godfather.

800
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:00,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play the first one.

801
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:04,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's my type of game because it is like a Grand Theft Auto sandbox type of thing.

802
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:06,876
[SPEAKER_03]: You owe it to yourself to pick it up and try it.

803
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually is a pretty sick game as long as you don't get too much respect because then you stop being able to shake the crap out of people and make them bend your will.

804
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:20,792
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just walk into a store and grab the dude and beat him up until he gives you what you want.

805
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:22,113
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be like, oh, that's awesome.

806
00:51:23,073 --> 00:51:23,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

807
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:33,379
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm wondering if Godfather 2, because I haven't read much about it, if it takes place further in the past, like when Vito Corleone was a kid, or if it's going to be just like, oh, there's more Godfather.

808
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a continuation.

809
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:36,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not as cool.

810
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:40,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically have now online multiplayer as well.

811
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's probably mostly...

812
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly the whole attraction.

813
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer would be fun, though.

814
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can slap your friends.

815
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a Scarface, too.

816
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:54,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they did Scarface, and it was kind of like, oh, he didn't die.

817
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't die, and he did it all again because he was so happy the first time.

818
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:01,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I told him a tenner, and I'm an idiot.

819
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:03,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

820
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:06,476
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

821
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as this time when they do the portable versions, they don't make them into strategy games.

822
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:14,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Because seriously, everyone comes to my store and wants to buy the portable Scarface game.

823
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, fine, buy it.

824
00:52:15,943 --> 00:52:17,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they bring it back like 10 minutes later.

825
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:18,144
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this crap?

826
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:19,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strategy game.

827
00:52:19,946 --> 00:52:21,907
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wanted to run around and shoot people.

828
00:52:22,568 --> 00:52:23,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking right now.

829
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:30,113
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why people need to read the reviews and look at the back of the box.

830
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:31,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Dumbasses.

831
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:33,636
[SPEAKER_10]: All we have is a disc.

832
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:35,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the back of the disc.

833
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:41,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying in general, Dan, and people, you can look online and find reviews.

834
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:48,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a safe assumption that if the box looks the same and it's on the PS2 and the PSP, it should be largely the same game.

835
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,119
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not.

836
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're right.

837
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:54,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I was going to say too, I mean, we shouldn't, you know...

838
00:52:55,905 --> 00:53:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be harking too much on the UK for having a TV drama being turned into a game because after all Ubisoft is bringing out Grey's Anatomy for the DS and the Wii It's better to play a trauma center It is supposed to play a trauma center but with more drama Aren't they downsizing that team?

839
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:24,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Good developers are getting fired Sadly there's an audience for that too There are plenty of people that will probably buy that game I sold one copy of Hell's Kitchen on the Wii Once

840
00:53:26,951 --> 00:53:28,493
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not an audience for that.

841
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:31,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless they're buying it somewhere besides game stores.

842
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:32,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terrible.

843
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are they making all this crap?

844
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:36,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cooking and yelling.

845
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the Nintendo Wii, and you heard it here.

846
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:41,905
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening, one of the dozens and dozens of listeners on Orange Lounge Radio.

847
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:45,248
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening, I'm saying it now.

848
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo Wii is going to cause gaming Armageddon.

849
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:51,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the return of the Atari 2600.

850
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:53,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's shovelware.

851
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:56,501
[SPEAKER_06]: They're putting anything they can on it to try to make a quick buck.

852
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:57,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, they're making Grey's Anatomy.

853
00:53:59,193 --> 00:53:59,674
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

854
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:00,995
[SPEAKER_06]: That's terrible.

855
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:02,616
[SPEAKER_05]: It will probably be better than E.T.

856
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,078
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo DS is probably that too.

857
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It will probably still be better than E.T.

858
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

859
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:10,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, if you played E.T.

860
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:15,509
[SPEAKER_06]: when that game came out on Atari, it had music and the character was animated.

861
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:20,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you were young and you didn't understand, it didn't suck that bad.

862
00:54:20,653 --> 00:54:22,275
[SPEAKER_06]: All the people who bag on E.T.

863
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: now never even played it.

864
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:25,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play it.

865
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:28,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I fell in the hole 50 gazillion times.

866
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because you suck at video games.

867
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:31,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

868
00:54:32,263 --> 00:54:32,684
[SPEAKER_06]: E.T.

869
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:34,145
[SPEAKER_06]: was not that bad a game.

870
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:35,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Atari was arrogant.

871
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:39,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they made more copies than there were 2600s, which is terrible.

872
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:41,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Give, give, give.

873
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:42,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan.

874
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:45,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We get it.

875
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:47,916
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

876
00:54:47,936 --> 00:54:48,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you even beat E.T.? ?

877
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:52,753
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I never did.

878
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:53,393
[SPEAKER_06]: No one ever has.

879
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:55,655
[SPEAKER_06]: In the existence of mankind.

880
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:57,497
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a YouTube video of someone beating E.T.

881
00:54:57,857 --> 00:54:59,558
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube videos can be fixed, sir.

882
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:00,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

883
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, when you beat E.T., the real E.T.

884
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out, and it's actually a good game.

885
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:06,884
[SPEAKER_06]: The real E.T.

886
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: comes out, shakes your hand, and goes to space.

887
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:13,929
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was going to say... I realize E.T.

888
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:18,413
[SPEAKER_06]: is a notorious bomb, but that's because Atari produced more copies than there were a dying system.

889
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:19,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

890
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:20,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We have ghosts.

891
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I seriously think we're about ready to have Armageddon live here in studio.

892
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:50,808
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a storm going on outside.

893
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:51,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Weemageddon!

894
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:56,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That last burst of wind almost blew over the garage door.

895
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be scary.

896
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,491
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we hear outside.

897
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:02,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever you get the little awning piece from the roof, it's like...

898
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be live on Justin TV, too, when we all get blown away.

899
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:08,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

900
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm controlling the apocalypse.

901
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:13,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all fucked.

902
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:16,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I read a Turok story?

903
00:56:17,237 --> 00:56:18,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, do your story, please.

904
00:56:18,438 --> 00:56:20,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm going to read a Turok story.

905
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:20,660
[SPEAKER_10]: E.T.

906
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,562
[SPEAKER_10]: is officially banned on Orange Lounge Radio.

907
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:23,222
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.

908
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:24,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Vetoed.

909
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:26,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to say a word that I just heard.

910
00:56:26,585 --> 00:56:27,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Weemageddon.

911
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:28,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Weemageddon.

912
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You should copyright the word.

913
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:34,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Copyright, dude, Matt, you should copyright that.

914
00:56:35,116 --> 00:56:35,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my word.

915
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:36,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I said Weemageddon.

916
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:37,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're right.

917
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,182
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mats are fighting over Weemageddon.

918
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Weemageddon out of here.

919
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:44,291
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have Weemageddon.

920
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:45,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we go back on the tape, please?

921
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:46,094
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, no.

922
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:48,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, moving on, Turok.

923
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:49,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Turokageddon.

924
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:55,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Turok, of course, was reinvented recently on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and all that, and I don't know, I didn't play it.

925
00:56:55,943 --> 00:56:56,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you play it?

926
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,424
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a franchise that needs to come back.

927
00:56:58,764 --> 00:56:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, no, it didn't.

928
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently some folks agree with you, because apparently Turok 2, rumor is, it's been canned.

929
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:07,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Before it was even announced.

930
00:57:07,565 --> 00:57:10,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, this is because of some layoffs that just happened to Disney.

931
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is all kind of rumored.

932
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:14,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to do with the poor sales of the first game.

933
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:21,665
[SPEAKER_05]: But they say maybe Turok 2 will return to development someday, but a bunch of the core people that were doing it are no longer there.

934
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:22,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the sad thing.

935
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:28,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Propaganda Games that was making this game were also the people that were supposed to be doing the Tron game for the new Tron title.

936
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:30,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So they all might have been sacked.

937
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:38,632
[SPEAKER_10]: They better find people to do the Tron game, or I will personally go there with steel-toed boots and kick every last one of them in the nuts.

938
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, you want to make some money, I'll tell you how you do it.

939
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:42,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very simple, okay?

940
00:57:42,673 --> 00:57:44,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the Left 4 Dead concept.

941
00:57:45,054 --> 00:57:48,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Jurassic Park, you're surviving dinosaur attacks, and that's it.

942
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:49,677
They did that, it sucked.

943
00:57:51,938 --> 00:57:53,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that would be pretty awesome.

944
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:57,041
[SPEAKER_10]: They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game.

945
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:01,244
[SPEAKER_10]: They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game, and it blew...

946
00:58:02,156 --> 00:58:02,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It was scary.

947
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:04,258
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was the one on Super Nintendo.

948
00:58:04,278 --> 00:58:05,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That scared the shit out of me.

949
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:06,139
[SPEAKER_05]: That was crap.

950
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:08,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the Sega CD one, but the arcade one blew too.

951
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:11,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking Left 4 Dead Dinosaurs.

952
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:13,165
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be cool.

953
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:14,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down for that.

954
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:18,369
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the game that they need to make.

955
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,573
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the game that they need to make using the Left 4 Dead engine.

956
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:27,956
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to do Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.

957
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:30,198
[SPEAKER_10]: They did comics.

958
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:32,651
[SPEAKER_05]: How about goats versus dogs?

959
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:35,792
[SPEAKER_10]: How about I do my story?

960
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:37,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, how about I read a chat comment real quick?

961
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's actually some insightful stuff from chat.

962
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:46,574
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD actually says something a little bit insightful, so I have to go to chat for insightful comments tonight because no one in the studio is saying anything.

963
00:58:47,014 --> 00:58:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD says, Is it funny, or it is funny that we take it for granted that a game will have a sequel, isn't it?

964
00:58:54,684 --> 00:58:55,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Transformers

965
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:17,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's because I think if the first one makes any remote amount of money, because people aren't willing to do anything original because they want to stick to those franchises that they think are going to sell.

966
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:23,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And, I mean, thank God we have the freaky guy bringing us Noby Noby Boy or else we'd have nothing original.

967
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:25,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet they still won't bring us Guardian Legend 2.

968
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:27,174
I know!

969
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:30,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Noby Noby Boy isn't that original looking.

970
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:31,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks just like Katamari.

971
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:34,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know the video games industry is doomed.

972
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:37,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they made another Turok after Turok Evolution.

973
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And Turok Evolution, for anyone who played that game, was bad.

974
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:43,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really bad.

975
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:44,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a good game.

976
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it as bad as Superman 64?

977
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:50,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

978
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:54,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went and made Superman Returns, which was not very good either.

979
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:56,010
[SPEAKER_06]: But that wasn't a sequel to Superman.

980
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a difference between a sequel...

981
00:59:58,669 --> 00:59:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a reboot.

982
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of like what Turok, this last Turok was.

983
01:00:03,614 --> 01:00:07,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, the last Turok reboot was Evolution, and it was horrible.

984
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:11,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And Superman Returns, which was not a bad game if you only paid $10 for it.

985
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:14,740
[SPEAKER_06]: 60 bucks?

986
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,020
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

987
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,520
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 bucks?

988
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:15,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

989
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:21,285
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you could be Superman and you could like blow cars around and tear up Metropolis and that'd actually hurt you.

990
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:22,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here's a better example then.

991
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision.

992
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not play Superman 64 expecting Superman 2600 where you would fly and then be chased by the Kryptonite.

993
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Superman for the 2600 was sweet.

994
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:37,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Superman 64 managed to be worse than that.

995
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:40,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the expectations were higher.

996
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:44,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the 64 should have had a good game where you flew around and did interesting things.

997
01:00:44,822 --> 01:00:45,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, go ahead.

998
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:47,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to keep the news moving because we're like an hour into the show.

999
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's my story.

1000
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Hugh had a quick thought, and then we'll move on.

1001
01:00:51,307 --> 01:01:02,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I was going to say Activision, you know, the purveyor of fine games, decided that, you know, Pimp My Ride the game was so awesome that they're going to put out Pimp My Ride Street Racing.

1002
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Pimp My Ride the game.

1003
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Awful, awful, awful.

1004
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,335
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1005
01:01:33,715 --> 01:01:41,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Deadly Creatures on Wii, Eternal Sonata on PlayStation 3, Fear 2 Project Origin on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1006
01:01:51,787 --> 01:02:15,944
[SPEAKER_10]: King's Bounty, The Legend on PC, Last King of Africa on DS, Mushroom Men sounds hallucinogenic, that's for PC, Shellshock 2, Blood Trials on Trails, sorry, on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360, Star Ocean, The Second Evolution on PSP, and The House of the Dead Overkill on Wii, because you can't kill enough zombies.

1007
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1008
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:18,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1009
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,731
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S., there's actually quite a bit coming out as well.

1010
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:26,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear 2, Project Origin on both PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

1011
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Blades coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1012
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:34,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadly Creatures coming out on the Wii.

1013
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:36,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1014
01:02:38,314 --> 01:02:41,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

1015
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:58,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it all at that last Genesis Collection.

1016
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:01,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you play so many games and you unlock the arcade version of Altered Beast.

1017
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:04,255
[SPEAKER_06]: This Genesis Collection looks really awesome.

1018
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:08,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 40 games, some really good stuff.

1019
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:10,042
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 games for $30.

1020
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:19,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and they're Genesis games, and the Genesis is the superior 16-bit system, so obviously you don't see a lot of Super Nintendo collections.

1021
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, I'm sometimes not a big fan of these remakes and stuff, but this looks pretty hot.

1022
01:03:24,253 --> 01:03:26,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a remake, it's just a collection.

1023
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a repackaging.

1024
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:31,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sure, but I mean, a remake is, you know, when they think of 3D or something.

1025
01:03:31,499 --> 01:03:33,200
[SPEAKER_03]: LocoRoco 2 on PSP.

1026
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:40,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on the Wii and the Xbox 360, we have Onichanbara Bikini Zombie Slayers Yes!

1027
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:46,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Xbox 360, Onichanbara Bikini Samurai Squad Have you seen the cover art for that game?

1028
01:03:47,409 --> 01:04:01,478
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is so epic that they made a movie for it in Japan A theatrical movie I'm going to be so broke this week I'll bring you some cover art, it's fantastic Let's see here

1029
01:04:02,782 --> 01:04:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Jake Power Fireman, NASCAR Kart Racing, Retro Game Challenge, 8-Bit Games,

1030
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:29,136
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

1031
01:04:29,476 --> 01:04:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: House of the Dead Overkill, which will be truly epic.

1032
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect is getting re-released as a two-disc edition.

1033
01:04:36,759 --> 01:04:38,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have the download content in it as well.

1034
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be $19.99, so that's pretty sweet.

1035
01:04:45,703 --> 01:04:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see here.

1036
01:04:49,944 --> 01:04:51,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually it.

1037
01:04:51,605 --> 01:04:54,846
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of interesting, though, is also this week... Isn't Street Fighter 4 this week?

1038
01:04:55,754 --> 01:04:56,495
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's next week.

1039
01:04:56,535 --> 01:04:57,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, damn it!

1040
01:04:57,636 --> 01:04:58,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha!

1041
01:04:59,277 --> 01:04:59,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

1042
01:05:00,498 --> 01:05:10,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, also, actually, technically still this week, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, I believe, will be coming out next... 16th?

1043
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:14,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, well, no, never mind, that's supposed to be Tuesday, so that's next week.

1044
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's going to be great.

1045
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:23,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I think Lost and Damned is this week, or Lost and Damned for Grand Theft Auto 4, so that is what I'm really looking forward to.

1046
01:05:25,026 --> 01:05:25,506
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1047
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: PS3, Street Fighter 4, Skate 2, Mobile Suit Gundam, Gearan no Yabu, Axis no Kui 5, DS,

1048
01:06:19,704 --> 01:06:21,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look like there's actually a lot of stuff coming out.

1049
01:06:21,906 --> 01:06:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a game called Hidamari Sketch, Doko Demo Sugoroku X365.

1050
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:29,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have no idea.

1051
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:31,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to look at screen caps for this game.

1052
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:32,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying it is fun.

1053
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:32,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1054
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:33,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying it is fun.

1055
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like another minigame collection on the DS made up of little WarioWare-ish minigames is kind of what it looks like to me.

1056
01:06:40,587 --> 01:06:40,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1057
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:42,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that could be cute.

1058
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,391
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're all cute little Japanese schoolgirls on there.

1059
01:06:45,872 --> 01:06:51,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the Sony PSP this week, not a whole lot, but you do have Tenchu 4.

1060
01:06:51,116 --> 01:06:55,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks to be a pretty big release coming out over there this week, as well as a port of the Gundam game that's on PS2 this week.

1061
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, a pretty quiet week in Japan.

1062
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:00,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because of Street Fighter 4 pretty much dominating.

1063
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:02,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1064
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: There's your release dates for Japan.

1065
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:08,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get back into some more gaming news.

1066
01:07:09,438 --> 01:07:37,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have our Virtual Fighter Virtual Console UK news coming out actually should already be out as of Friday is Clayfighter which is on there for 800 Wii Points the equivalent of 6 pounds or 8 euros and another game that's on there is Sonic Chaos which was a Master System game and

1067
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:39,864
[SPEAKER_10]: is 500 Wii Points.

1068
01:07:41,005 --> 01:07:43,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was actually the first Sonic game that had Tails playable.

1069
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:45,007
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1070
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Clayfighter on the US Virtual Console?

1071
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,852
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can pull that down, that game is great.

1072
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:55,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped following Virtual Console a while ago.

1073
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:57,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we ever got Secret of Mana either.

1074
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:00,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Secret of Mana is supposed to be on the UK one, I thought.

1075
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, I don't think we got that here yet.

1076
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:06,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously though, Clayfighter, you can be a Clay Elvis...

1077
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Fighting a clay like Norse Valkyrie chick Helga Fighting a blob Clay fighter Come on fight them if you dare Clay fighter, great

1078
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:31,920
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a viral video making its rounds this week that supposedly was a leaked Dead Rising 2 trailer.

1079
01:08:32,881 --> 01:08:42,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know all about leaked trailers, that they sometimes tend to be not leaked by someone stealing it, but they're leaked on purpose.

1080
01:08:43,392 --> 01:08:47,396
[SPEAKER_03]: This was shot off of a screen, apparently, off a TV.

1081
01:08:48,277 --> 01:09:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: and it showed what looks to be a teaser trailer basically looks like an overrun Las Vegas type area with casinos one scene they showed someone in a giant American Gladiators hamster ball thing rolling over zombies

1082
01:09:09,705 --> 01:09:12,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to be honest, I think it's actually authentic.

1083
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:21,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it is purposely released by Capcom because the audio in it, if you notice, is actually a direct feed from the trailer.

1084
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:25,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's not just like shot off a TV audio.

1085
01:09:25,652 --> 01:09:28,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Any idea if we're going to get some multiplayer co-op in this?

1086
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:30,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what Dead Rising needed.

1087
01:09:30,735 --> 01:09:41,300
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great game, but man, if it had like, sort of like Left 4 Dead, multiple players in the Dead Rising kind of gameplay against millions of zombies.

1088
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude!

1089
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no idea what it is exactly, but I know at the very end of the trailer it actually flashes the number two really quick, and there's also another scene that you see Frank West in the Mega Man outfit again.

1090
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in a war.

1091
01:09:54,887 --> 01:09:59,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say, though, that Capcom has a really good pulse on where we want to kill zombies?

1092
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:03,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I saw this trailer and saw that the next one is in Vegas or whatever, I was like, that's awesome.

1093
01:10:04,456 --> 01:10:04,836
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt.

1094
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:07,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like when I saw the first one, it was killing zombies in a mall.

1095
01:10:07,298 --> 01:10:07,939
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1096
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:11,682
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one company that knows killing zombies, that knows slaying the undead.

1097
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:12,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Capcom.

1098
01:10:12,403 --> 01:10:13,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

1099
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:17,287
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is fake, it's an amazing fake.

1100
01:10:18,688 --> 01:10:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Capcom should do this if this is a fake.

1101
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be willing to bet that you'll see this at E3.

1102
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:27,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.

1103
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:29,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Start the buzz now.

1104
01:10:30,177 --> 01:10:34,701
[SPEAKER_03]: What better way to get people talking about it than put out a trailer that's supposedly stolen.

1105
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:39,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a demo for E3 of E3 infested with zombies.

1106
01:10:40,746 --> 01:10:42,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually would be pretty badass.

1107
01:10:42,528 --> 01:10:44,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And you killing people are zombies.

1108
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe the reverse.

1109
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:47,332
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a zombie and you're killing people.

1110
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:50,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the buzz is also starting on this game.

1111
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:51,061
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Saw.

1112
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:53,444
[SPEAKER_05]: The game.

1113
01:10:53,844 --> 01:10:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is weird because I heard before that Saw was supposed to be coming out.

1114
01:10:58,890 --> 01:10:59,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in development.

1115
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:00,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It got canceled.

1116
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:03,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently now Konami has picked up the rights to do Saw.

1117
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Brash Entertainment had started this game and stopped it Now Konami has actually picked up the rights since that other company closed down Variety was the one to actually report this The game is now going to be developed by Zombie Studios And it's supposed to come out right when the sixth Saw movie comes out this Halloween And I'm like, they really are on Saw VI?

1118
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:29,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem like something you can adapt into a game at all I mean, it just doesn't work for me I don't see how you're going to be able to do it

1119
01:11:29,474 --> 01:11:30,314
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1120
01:11:30,774 --> 01:11:34,636
[SPEAKER_06]: To the dismay of fans of it in the room, I can foresee this.

1121
01:11:34,816 --> 01:11:37,397
[SPEAKER_06]: If Konami makes Saw and it's a hit, it will kill Silent Hill.

1122
01:11:37,817 --> 01:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.

1123
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:39,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sad thing.

1124
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, well, okay.

1125
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But wait a minute.

1126
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:44,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's done Silent Hill.

1127
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:46,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, these are two completely different developers.

1128
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never really heard of this Zombie Studios before.

1129
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:49,681
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't done anything to do with Silent Hill.

1130
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, well, okay.

1131
01:11:51,622 --> 01:11:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill is actually a pretty rad game.

1132
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they made Saw, kind of like a game like that.

1133
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,804
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, I just don't see Saw...

1134
01:11:58,644 --> 01:11:59,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's going to work.

1135
01:11:59,705 --> 01:12:03,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just... Silent Hill's been on skids since 2 or 3, though.

1136
01:12:04,349 --> 01:12:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sad.

1137
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:07,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Homecoming did well.

1138
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:09,573
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing everything they can to stem the tide.

1139
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried to action up Homecoming.

1140
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:11,995
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried to do the...

1141
01:12:12,878 --> 01:12:17,641
[SPEAKER_06]: The remake, the Origins one, and, you know, that's all Konami needs.

1142
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: If they come up with another horror franchise, they'll probably put Silent Hill out to pasture.

1143
01:12:21,343 --> 01:12:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know how well Homecoming did, but I'm worried that there may not be a sixth one.

1144
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:31,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I hope you're wrong, but sadly, you might be right.

1145
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So, don't buy the Saw game.

1146
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:34,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Weemageddon.

1147
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:38,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, though, I mean, I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.

1148
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's not...

1149
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Saw isn't a franchise that's really action-packed or anything, and I mean, it's... Hey, there's Silent Hill.

1150
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, well, Silent Hill's easy... They'll just do the same thing, except for you'll be dodging, like, traps made by the Saw guy, and, you know, every once in a while you get yourself into some sort of weird ethical dilemma where you have to kill somebody.

1151
01:12:58,595 --> 01:13:00,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, actually, it sounds like they might be able to make a pretty cool game.

1152
01:13:02,418 --> 01:13:03,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll buy it.

1153
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1154
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:05,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll check it out at E3.

1155
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:06,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kill Silent Hill.

1156
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you expressed a lot of displeasure at the news of a Saw game.

1157
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:11,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you excited about it?

1158
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:14,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I will stab you in the face if you buy the Saw game.

1159
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:15,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Saw in real life.

1160
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,923
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because first of all, the concept of Saw is, well, retarded.

1161
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:23,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry!

1162
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:25,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And not very interesting.

1163
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:33,769
[SPEAKER_10]: And how can you... I guess, you know, if Nightmare on Elm Street did... You know, this is, I guess, our Nightmare on Elm Street for the modern age, except, you know, Freddy Krueger was funny.

1164
01:13:36,906 --> 01:13:39,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that they're now rebooting Friday the 13th, right?

1165
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that new movie coming out.

1166
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:41,791
[SPEAKER_09]: But Jared Padalecki's in it.

1167
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:43,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does look cool.

1168
01:13:43,192 --> 01:13:46,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The Nightmare on Elm Street, they're also doing without Robert Englund.

1169
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:48,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will not work.

1170
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:49,778
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have him without Robert Englund.

1171
01:13:49,818 --> 01:13:51,199
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not doing anything.

1172
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1173
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,681
[SPEAKER_05]: He's slowly dying.

1174
01:13:53,741 --> 01:13:55,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they can't put him in it.

1175
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:56,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

1176
01:13:57,285 --> 01:13:57,885
[SPEAKER_05]: He's old.

1177
01:13:58,746 --> 01:13:59,627
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dying of old.

1178
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:07,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, my point is that Saw is a gimmick.

1179
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:23,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Silent Hill, basically, a lot of thought went into the psychology of the game and it created its own sort of mythology around what made that universe work.

1180
01:14:23,078 --> 01:14:23,619
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1181
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:25,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in other words, Pyramid Head is not a gimmick.

1182
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,541
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a fucking rock star.

1183
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:29,743
[SPEAKER_05]: They should stop putting him in every single game.

1184
01:14:30,803 --> 01:14:38,771
[SPEAKER_10]: But my point is that, I mean, sure, if you want mindless bullshit in a game, get Saw.

1185
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:39,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

1186
01:14:39,752 --> 01:14:40,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy mindless bullshit.

1187
01:14:41,313 --> 01:14:45,117
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want a game that's going to make you think a little bit and actually use your brain.

1188
01:14:45,297 --> 01:14:46,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And possibly pee your pants.

1189
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:48,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And possibly pee your pants, yes.

1190
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for Silent Hill.

1191
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:51,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides that Silent Hill 2, Chainsaw.

1192
01:14:52,324 --> 01:14:52,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

1193
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:55,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill is superior.

1194
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,760
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with some other gaming news.

1195
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,342
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like an hour 15 into this show.

1196
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:02,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not even close to the end of it.

1197
01:15:02,883 --> 01:15:07,006
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why Dan comes once every five years.

1198
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't want to hear from me, you wouldn't have invited me.

1199
01:15:09,368 --> 01:15:10,089
[SPEAKER_04]: We like Dan.

1200
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:10,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We like Dan.

1201
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:11,109
[SPEAKER_04]: He's funny.

1202
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:16,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I invited my sweetie here and cuddled with him and said, come be on the show.

1203
01:15:16,894 --> 01:15:18,575
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, okay, and then lost his phone.

1204
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so the... We gotta go to Jamie for our next story.

1205
01:15:25,997 --> 01:15:26,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

1206
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:28,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize she hadn't done the other story yet.

1207
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:32,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

1208
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,179
[SPEAKER_10]: We were speaking earlier about series getting a reboot, so guess what's next in line?

1209
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Splatterhouse!

1210
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:47,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Which totally makes sense with Friday the 13th getting its reboot, because then you've got Dude in a Hockey Mask!

1211
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,501
[SPEAKER_10]: and freaking Splatterhouse is awesome.

1212
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:55,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the picture on the little article because I was the guy with the chainsaw hands.

1213
01:15:55,604 --> 01:16:12,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, and as we all know, the game is actually out on virtual console right now, but they're talking later this year, Namco Bondi is planning quarter three for doing a new Splatterhouse game, and there actually is an official site up.

1214
01:16:14,077 --> 01:16:24,243
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go to splatterhousegame.com, you can see some of the images from the game.

1215
01:16:25,064 --> 01:16:30,667
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the first game that lets you use your own severed limbs as a weapon.

1216
01:16:31,803 --> 01:16:41,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your arms and stuff and your skin will get ripped off as you're playing the game or as you're getting damage done to you, and your limbs will grow back, and you can actually beat people with your limbs.

1217
01:16:41,552 --> 01:16:43,214
[SPEAKER_05]: This won't be rated M or anything.

1218
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:52,043
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of controversy about this, because apparently Namco just whacked the dev team for this game, which was a California-based developer, and...

1219
01:16:53,556 --> 01:16:57,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they handed it to another team or if the game's going to be put back or in limbo.

1220
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard the Afro Samurai people might be taking it.

1221
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:04,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the arm of the developer got cut off and given to the other team to use in developing the game.

1222
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:09,889
[SPEAKER_10]: This news, though, is coming right out of New York Comic Con, which was going on this weekend.

1223
01:17:10,309 --> 01:17:10,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1224
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting that we hear the dev team gets sacked, yet they're showing it at New York Comic Con going on this weekend, which is crazy.

1225
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:19,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting.

1226
01:17:20,347 --> 01:17:21,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's the corporate world.

1227
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:22,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1228
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Fast-paced, ever-changing world of video game development.

1229
01:17:25,628 --> 01:17:26,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1230
01:17:26,028 --> 01:17:28,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's okay, because in Splatterhouse, they'll grow the limbs back.

1231
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.

1232
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:33,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week in a break.

1233
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1234
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:44,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a brand-new update that they did to fix the HDMI audio issues that they were having with the HDMI audio cable for the 360.

1235
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:51,140
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as with most updates, it seems there are some problems.

1236
01:17:51,540 --> 01:18:06,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently a lot of people are reporting that after this update was downloaded to their Xbox 360 system, that they received the brand new present of an E74 error message, which is one of the one red light problem.

1237
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:12,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny because that also happens to be not covered by their warranty.

1238
01:18:13,154 --> 01:18:13,715
[SPEAKER_03]: D'oh!

1239
01:18:16,036 --> 01:18:17,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad Trombone.

1240
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:17,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1241
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:21,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, a lot of people are pissed off at that.

1242
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:27,706
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean Microsoft developed a game console with a problem?

1243
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,127
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1244
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:30,408
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1245
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:34,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I've taken back six Xboxes in the last week.

1246
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:37,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it all because of this update?

1247
01:18:37,394 --> 01:18:38,715
[SPEAKER_06]: No, those things just break.

1248
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to update them to break.

1249
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft, don't even worry about updating them.

1250
01:18:42,638 --> 01:18:43,399
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to break.

1251
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:44,900
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at them funny and they'll break.

1252
01:18:46,003 --> 01:18:48,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the Xbox has feelings.

1253
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,226
[SPEAKER_06]: You looked at me funny.

1254
01:18:50,246 --> 01:18:53,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You used me to do all your gaming and bought stuff for me.

1255
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to cuddle.

1256
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when they ask you on the phone, was it plugged into a surge protector?

1257
01:19:03,873 --> 01:19:06,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, it was the surge protector's fault that my console broke.

1258
01:19:09,356 --> 01:19:12,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I made the mistake of hooking it up to my TV.

1259
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:14,938
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have to give out a stupid award.

1260
01:19:30,455 --> 01:19:34,420
[SPEAKER_05]: This week's Stupid Award goes to Daniel Alvarez.

1261
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,263
[SPEAKER_05]: He lives in Austin, Texas.

1262
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does he get the Stupid Award?

1263
01:19:38,305 --> 01:19:41,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he got arrested on charges of assault.

1264
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what he did, he assaulted his girlfriend with a Wii controller.

1265
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:59,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, and possibly the even more hideous crime, as reported, he's also suspected of eating her cookies.

1266
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:04,967
[SPEAKER_06]: He seriously jumped up behind her with the nunchuck strap and like super spied her with it.

1267
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:05,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1268
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:06,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's like a rat line.

1269
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1270
01:20:08,252 --> 01:20:08,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1271
01:20:27,951 --> 01:20:42,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Christina Alvarado, who is the girlfriend what happened is that she actually told the police that she was attacked by her boyfriend and the thing was she was pissed off at him because he ate her Girl Scout cookies

1272
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:49,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was pissed off because he got woke up to get yelled at about the Girl Scout cookies.

1273
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess to teach her a lesson, he choked her with a weed cork.

1274
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:53,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you dare.

1275
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:54,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

1276
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wake him up all the time for eating my stuff out of the fridge.

1277
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:01,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to kill you.

1278
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It would not be with a weed cork.

1279
01:21:04,448 --> 01:21:07,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the unofficial city motto of Austin is keep Austin weird.

1280
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:08,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That's freaking weird right there.

1281
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:12,131
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I might go ahead and lean on that one to be true.

1282
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:14,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's wild.

1283
01:21:14,231 --> 01:21:16,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And FYI, it does not appear to be made up.

1284
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:21,314
[SPEAKER_05]: They've linked to a source here that apparently says, yes, an Austin man has been

1285
01:21:21,594 --> 01:21:29,137
[SPEAKER_05]: been accused of trying to choke his girlfriend with a cord of a Wii video game controller after she became angry that he had eaten all of her Girl Scout cookies.

1286
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what the gag is, though?

1287
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:36,240
[SPEAKER_06]: For the people who don't know about the way that the nunchuck works, is that all Wii controllers are cordless.

1288
01:21:41,322 --> 01:21:44,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet that damage that any cords would not be covered under the warranty.

1289
01:21:44,063 --> 01:21:45,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if that's what the defense attorney will try to say.

1290
01:21:45,784 --> 01:21:48,565
[SPEAKER_10]: All you have to do is yank hard and unplug it.

1291
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:52,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Caramel sucks a lot.

1292
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:52,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to know one thing.

1293
01:21:52,862 --> 01:21:52,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1294
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:53,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he wearing the wrist strap?

1295
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:54,743
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, even better.

1296
01:21:54,783 --> 01:21:55,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Even better.

1297
01:21:55,204 --> 01:21:55,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it have the condom on?

1298
01:22:20,948 --> 01:22:22,509
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly... See, the match think alike here.

1299
01:22:22,549 --> 01:22:24,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say the exact same thing before Loki took the mic away.

1300
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Yes, we need to know if it had the Wii condom on and the safety strap.

1301
01:22:29,332 --> 01:22:39,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it didn't have the safety strap on, Nintendo would have... They're not... It would have been even funnier if somehow during this whole struggle of him strangling her, that somehow the remote flew into the TV.

1302
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:44,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are sick, sick people.

1303
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:47,106
[SPEAKER_06]: and it pains me to be associated.

1304
01:22:47,126 --> 01:22:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They fought over fucking cookies.

1305
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you think that was serious?

1306
01:22:51,147 --> 01:22:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: At least there were no tacos thrown.

1307
01:22:54,588 --> 01:22:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been trying to kill each other with game controllers for years.

1308
01:22:57,768 --> 01:22:59,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know this.

1309
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:00,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It dates back to the 2600s.

1310
01:23:00,669 --> 01:23:04,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Back when we had the NES Advantage, I could see someone getting killed with an NES Advantage.

1311
01:23:04,649 --> 01:23:07,910
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a scar on his back in the shape of a Clicca vision controller.

1312
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was this one time that I woke up and Jamie was just...

1313
01:23:13,704 --> 01:23:15,745
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and a power pad down onto my face.

1314
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:17,365
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been trying to kill me with the game control.

1315
01:23:17,405 --> 01:23:18,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Now she knows.

1316
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:18,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Use a Wii remote.

1317
01:23:19,006 --> 01:23:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dead.

1318
01:23:20,606 --> 01:23:21,747
[SPEAKER_05]: You fuckers have killed me.

1319
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:23,327
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.

1320
01:23:23,447 --> 01:23:26,408
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat room has a great idea for a new video game.

1321
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:27,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookie Guy versus Taco Kid.

1322
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:31,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1323
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Knight asks, does Miyamoto have to choke a bitch?

1324
01:23:38,068 --> 01:23:38,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

1325
01:23:39,289 --> 01:23:39,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1326
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:44,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to get to the classic game of the week and take a break and try to find our souls.

1327
01:23:45,051 --> 01:23:52,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to dig through the archive of great gaming and find a video game she believes all of you should be playing.

1328
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our classic video game of the week.

1329
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:57,317
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week?

1330
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:58,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorf!

1331
01:23:59,538 --> 01:23:59,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless you.

1332
01:24:00,638 --> 01:24:01,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't throw up yet.

1333
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:04,653
[SPEAKER_10]: G.O.R.F.

1334
01:24:05,434 --> 01:24:05,814
[SPEAKER_10]: G.O.R.F.

1335
01:24:05,894 --> 01:24:09,235
[SPEAKER_10]: stands for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force.

1336
01:24:10,055 --> 01:24:17,797
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very bizarre little game because it's like a version of three games in one.

1337
01:24:18,898 --> 01:24:21,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, your first level, you've got different missions.

1338
01:24:22,419 --> 01:24:24,980
[SPEAKER_10]: So going through different missions will set up your rank.

1339
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:25,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1340
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:28,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1341
01:24:29,915 --> 01:24:31,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess what you're hearing is just a bunch of shooting.

1342
01:24:32,077 --> 01:24:33,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically Space Invaders.

1343
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:34,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The first stage of GORF is Space Invaders.

1344
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,545
[SPEAKER_10]: The first level is Space Invaders with a big circular shield that you kind of have to shoot through.

1345
01:24:41,527 --> 01:24:42,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the second...

1346
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:55,470
[SPEAKER_10]: The second level is, well, like my husband was saying behind the scenes, is like Galaga, where you have to shoot the little planes that shoot down.

1347
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:58,353
[SPEAKER_10]: It had the crappiest collision detection ever.

1348
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:00,876
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't even shoot you and you'd explode.

1349
01:25:01,616 --> 01:25:02,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid game.

1350
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last...

1351
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:23,917
[SPEAKER_10]: The last level was another... Well, at least in the arcade version you had the Galaxian-type level, and you had a Space Warp-type level after that, which was the Gyrus-like level, where it's...

1352
01:25:25,298 --> 01:25:29,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of weird perspective as if you're going into the war.

1353
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:32,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of tempesty, as far as the perspective.

1354
01:25:34,645 --> 01:25:40,969
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last one is the flagship one, where actually you're going and shooting the alien ship, and it has a shield around it.

1355
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a semi-circular shield, so you have to shoot through it.

1356
01:25:44,091 --> 01:25:49,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And the game was actually supposed to be a tie-in with Star Trek The Motion Picture, but it didn't fit in with the script, so they said, uh, no.

1357
01:25:49,595 --> 01:25:54,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they put all these great 80s space games in a blender, and out comes gore.

1358
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

1359
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:06,765
[SPEAKER_10]: On top of that, it was actually saying here that it used the Votrax speech synthesis chip in the arcade version.

1360
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:08,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So it had the robot voice in it, too.

1361
01:26:08,886 --> 01:26:09,587
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty cool.

1362
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:11,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I only played this in the arcade a couple times.

1363
01:26:12,028 --> 01:26:17,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I had this on the ColecoVision, which to me is just the best version of GORF ever.

1364
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:19,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the little music it plays.

1365
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:33,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but, um, the, uh, it's also saying that the, uh, the GORF, um, hardware actually, uh, was compatible and, uh, you can switch it out for other games like, uh, Wizard of War.

1366
01:26:34,563 --> 01:26:35,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna do something here with the music.

1367
01:26:35,644 --> 01:26:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna switch to the Commodore 64 version just because I love Commodore 64 and I see that there's one here on, uh, this.

1368
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:43,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But the GORF was out on, like, a million different systems, it seems.

1369
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:44,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

1370
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:47,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was out on quite a few.

1371
01:26:53,365 --> 01:26:54,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I played this on Commodore 64.

1372
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:55,886
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks familiar to me.

1373
01:26:55,906 --> 01:26:58,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember the circular shield and all that stuff.

1374
01:26:58,326 --> 01:26:58,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1375
01:26:59,306 --> 01:27:13,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um... Basically, though, as you go through the levels and get to the end of it, and I've gotten to the end of it on the Clique of Vision, you get Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and Space Avenger!

1376
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:21,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... There was a sequel planned, called MISBORF.

1377
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

1378
01:27:24,131 --> 01:27:24,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Ms.

1379
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorf have a bow in her hair?

1380
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what differentiates her from Gorf?

1381
01:27:28,154 --> 01:27:28,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1382
01:27:32,176 --> 01:27:35,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually, I think it's cool, it was programmed in fourth language.

1383
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like fourth meal at Taco Bell?

1384
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:49,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the programmer of Gorf owns the source code, and it apparently only exists in a set of 8-inch floppy disks.

1385
01:27:51,420 --> 01:28:01,923
[SPEAKER_10]: There were versions on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Clicca Vision, the Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, VIC-20 in 1982.

1386
01:28:02,784 --> 01:28:06,245
[SPEAKER_10]: The Galaxian mission was removed from all home ports.

1387
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:12,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It was given an Atari Jaguar port just by some guy.

1388
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:15,128
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, did it as a hobby.

1389
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:19,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was taken off of the market because he didn't go for any of the copyrights.

1390
01:28:20,132 --> 01:28:21,453
[SPEAKER_10]: So, bastard.

1391
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:22,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm bored.

1392
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:24,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I want to remake GORF.

1393
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:25,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

1394
01:28:26,596 --> 01:28:31,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the current world record for GORF, recognized by Twin Galaxies.

1395
01:28:36,503 --> 01:28:37,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I watch King of Kong.

1396
01:28:37,924 --> 01:28:38,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

1397
01:28:40,040 --> 01:29:02,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I just realized a giant fart was enough to make the high scoreboard on GORF Here, let me make the scoreboard right now As Rob puts the microphone towards his crotch Anyway He also made the Guinness Book of World Records by a guy named Todd Rogers on November 24th, 1982 at Haunted Trails in Burbank, Illinois He is?

1398
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:07,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, apparently he's in the King of Kong And my husband says he looks like Ron Jeremy

1399
01:29:09,163 --> 01:29:11,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rob D's in chat going, I hate Todd Rogers.

1400
01:29:11,865 --> 01:29:12,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's Todd Rogers.

1401
01:29:13,086 --> 01:29:13,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate him.

1402
01:29:14,627 --> 01:29:18,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm paraphrasing.

1403
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:18,149
653,990.

1404
01:29:18,349 --> 01:29:20,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I want someone to break it.

1405
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:23,973
[SPEAKER_05]: That would involve playing GORF.

1406
01:29:24,553 --> 01:29:25,394
[SPEAKER_10]: GORF is fun.

1407
01:29:26,954 --> 01:29:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I am putting out a personal challenge to someone to break Todd Rogers' score on GORF. 653,990.

1408
01:29:40,007 --> 01:30:05,634
[SPEAKER_10]: it would actually be pretty awesome if you could break it with a score of 666,000 if someone whoever manages to break that will get a no prize from me will be interviewed on Orange Downs Radio and will win a shiny penny you also get in the Guinness Book of World Records though

1409
01:30:06,209 --> 01:30:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It might.

1410
01:30:06,929 --> 01:30:07,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look.

1411
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:08,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough GORF.

1412
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:10,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrong.

1413
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:10,852
[SPEAKER_05]: No, good choice.

1414
01:30:10,932 --> 01:30:15,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a game I think a lot of people have not heard of or forgot about, so bringing GORF back to the spotlight.

1415
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that old record can be shattered.

1416
01:30:18,517 --> 01:30:21,059
[SPEAKER_10]: How about a little anecdote regarding me picking that game?

1417
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:21,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1418
01:30:21,599 --> 01:30:24,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually trying to think of a good epic RPG, and I was like, I'll fuck it, GORF.

1419
01:30:26,402 --> 01:30:27,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever works for you.

1420
01:30:29,204 --> 01:30:30,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It just stuck in my head.

1421
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:34,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break while Dan and Jamie get into an argument.

1422
01:30:35,051 --> 01:30:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a break.

1423
01:30:36,652 --> 01:30:39,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything she knows about classic video games she stole from me.

1424
01:30:39,255 --> 01:30:40,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she flipped me off.

1425
01:30:41,912 --> 01:30:42,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on the air.

1426
01:30:42,873 --> 01:30:43,893
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break, you guys.

1427
01:30:43,913 --> 01:30:45,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with plenty more Orange Launch Radio.

1428
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,215
[SPEAKER_05]: We have more to come in Part B tonight.

1429
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:51,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about Indiana Jones and a great Indiana Jones game that might be making a comeback.

1430
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to finally talk about iPhone gaming, which I promised Dan we could do earlier, and a new project from Rockstar Games, which I'm sure has Loki pretty excited.

1431
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking about all of that in Part B right after this.

1432
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:04,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned, guys, with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1433
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:39,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 8th of 2009 Where we are doing the 312th episode of our show, Orange Lounge Radio We always tape live Sunday nights at allgames.com Of course, if you were listening live tonight, there was a little bit of mad stuff going on during the break We've kind of been joking throughout the evening, there's a lot of wind and rain type stuff going on outside It seemed to have knocked our network out for a little bit, because we dropped during the break Our podcast listeners won't notice a thing, because they just get that little break in between there So, um...

1434
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:40,707
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1435
01:32:05,183 --> 01:32:15,005
[SPEAKER_10]: and I know not everyone has different things so I'll pick different consoles and arcade or whatnot but I will be putting something up very soon for a high score classic game contest

1436
01:32:15,421 --> 01:32:25,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk to our web guy about that because with the new website and everything, there's now a thing where you can upload pictures directly to our website by sending this particular email address so people can send their scores.

1437
01:32:25,423 --> 01:32:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can do a little widget or something with the scores.

1438
01:32:27,884 --> 01:32:28,984
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably put something together pretty easy.

1439
01:32:29,004 --> 01:32:29,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be fun.

1440
01:32:30,024 --> 01:32:30,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still working on it.

1441
01:32:32,285 --> 01:32:38,426
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I used to do the game knowledge quiz back when I had Pump Up the Volume.

1442
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:40,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd kind of like to do something like that again.

1443
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:40,887
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

1444
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Indiana Jones, Staff of Kings

1445
01:33:11,568 --> 01:33:14,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Adventure Game, Indiana Jones, and the Fate of Atlantis.

1446
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:17,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you didn't hear that music on the feed.

1447
01:33:18,477 --> 01:33:18,837
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1448
01:33:19,538 --> 01:33:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Wii version.

1449
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:28,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good if you don't have, you know, a Scum emulator on there.

1450
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:30,225
[SPEAKER_03]: or ScumVM.

1451
01:33:30,446 --> 01:33:36,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like one of the all-time classic, you know, click-and-point games, so it's pretty awesome.

1452
01:33:37,309 --> 01:33:42,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they not doing that 360 and PS3 one that they announced?

1453
01:33:42,152 --> 01:33:42,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not right now.

1454
01:33:43,093 --> 01:33:43,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be later on.

1455
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:44,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Weak.

1456
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:49,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is also on the Wii, so maybe just, you know, multi-platform.

1457
01:33:49,817 --> 01:33:58,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's on the Wii and everything, but yeah, Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP because, you know, they can port that crap easy, so...

1458
01:34:00,805 --> 01:34:05,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, there may be another one coming out for the PS3 and 360 they're still working on

1459
01:34:07,148 --> 01:34:18,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if you would file this under WeMageddon or what you'd do, but apparently EA, they made a lot of announcements this week because they had a financial call going on this week, and apparently they are going to be porting Dead Space to the Wii.

1460
01:34:19,056 --> 01:34:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Says a quote from the call, the CEO, John Riccatello, says, Unfortunately, what you don't know is that it's going to be Dead Space Party.

1461
01:34:35,826 --> 01:34:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's actually going to be a party spinoff because they couldn't really do an actual legit hardcore game for the Wii.

1462
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:49,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, but the interesting thing about this is that they actually say also this from a magazine interview.

1463
01:34:49,111 --> 01:34:52,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, go look at Dead Space and imagine playing that game with a wand and nunchuck.

1464
01:34:52,612 --> 01:34:55,613
[SPEAKER_05]: If they improve the precision, then you could have a good experience.

1465
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:59,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, is it a hint that Motion Plus could be supported by this?

1466
01:34:59,274 --> 01:35:01,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And imagine that the graphics look slightly worse.

1467
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:03,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly worse.

1468
01:35:05,173 --> 01:35:05,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this.

1469
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:10,217
[SPEAKER_06]: If EA pulls this off, and they're a company on the upswing.

1470
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:14,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know that profits are down and they're laying people off.

1471
01:35:14,441 --> 01:35:18,984
[SPEAKER_06]: But creatively, while that's a great word, you've got to give EA credit.

1472
01:35:19,345 --> 01:35:22,067
[SPEAKER_06]: They're head and shoulders above where they were last year this time.

1473
01:35:22,807 --> 01:35:24,949
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming off of Dead Space, which was amazing.

1474
01:35:25,229 --> 01:35:26,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Mirror's Edge, which was a heck of a game.

1475
01:35:27,331 --> 01:35:29,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a bunch of great titles coming out of EA.

1476
01:35:29,753 --> 01:35:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: If they pull this off, props.

1477
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:33,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because...

1478
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:40,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We need super cool games, but man, I don't know how you're going to do it without the graphic power.

1479
01:35:41,136 --> 01:35:44,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Dead Space is a game where the visuals are just so important.

1480
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, granted, if Dead Space really is about the graphics, then whatever.

1481
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But should games really be about the graphics?

1482
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily, right?

1483
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:52,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe, maybe not.

1484
01:35:52,727 --> 01:35:54,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, play Dead Space.

1485
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:56,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played Dead Space?

1486
01:35:56,491 --> 01:35:58,312
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because it's first person.

1487
01:35:58,332 --> 01:35:59,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That game will fuck you up for life.

1488
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:03,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out, but I just know not yet.

1489
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:04,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's atrocious.

1490
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:10,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think so much of the atmosphere in that game is it's just super, super good visuals.

1491
01:36:10,592 --> 01:36:15,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say, one of the other games you mentioned, I'm not usually much of a first-person gamer, but Mirror's Edge is pretty hot.

1492
01:36:15,974 --> 01:36:16,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that game's pretty hot.

1493
01:36:16,954 --> 01:36:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things where it's like, if they tried to do that on Wii...

1494
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:48,685
[SPEAKER_06]: and they could do it right and have motion controls and stuff hey you know great more power to you the Wii needs these games you know even even if it's not about graphics which it's not about graphics if they can bring uh this game in a meaningful way to the other system uh to the Wii it would it would validate the Wii's existence because there are too many mini game collections and don't get me wrong I know for the Wii's uh mainstream target audience that's I guess what sells but uh

1495
01:36:51,212 --> 01:37:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you're just joining us live tonight here on All Games Radio, Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games, I just want to point out, that's Dan, Jamie's husband, often talked about on the show, but rarely heard from, but he's here tonight and telling it like it is from his experience working in game stores for many years.

1496
01:37:10,077 --> 01:37:23,506
[SPEAKER_10]: In other gaming news, especially in iPhone gaming news, which, you know, as a person who has an iPhone and actually plays the games on it, I still don't know what I think about having this one on there because it just seems like it would be cheaply easy.

1497
01:37:24,347 --> 01:37:34,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But Time Crisis is supposed to be coming on to the Apple App Store, actually already on there, where you can play with the finger of death.

1498
01:37:35,694 --> 01:37:36,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1499
01:37:53,905 --> 01:38:00,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting, though, at this rise of console gaming franchise classics coming on the iPhone.

1500
01:38:00,929 --> 01:38:15,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's just because it's kind of like all Namco and Konami, but just within 2009, we've had news of Katamari, Time Crisis, Silent Hill, Metal Gear, DDR.

1501
01:38:15,276 --> 01:38:16,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.

1502
01:38:16,817 --> 01:38:17,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you weren't here last week.

1503
01:38:18,237 --> 01:38:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it if you want to check it out before you buy it and spend $7 on it.

1504
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:23,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.

1505
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it.

1506
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Fog Adventure Silent Hill.

1507
01:38:28,204 --> 01:38:29,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Dungeon Explorer type thing.

1508
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:31,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So just try before you buy.

1509
01:38:31,567 --> 01:38:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

1510
01:38:32,508 --> 01:38:33,929
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there's a Silent Hill game on iPhone now.

1511
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

1512
01:38:37,172 --> 01:38:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just interesting, this whole barrage of stuff we're getting.

1513
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:43,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the Metal Gear Solid game is out yet, but we know it's coming.

1514
01:38:44,421 --> 01:38:46,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It is in the works at least.

1515
01:38:46,502 --> 01:38:47,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear.

1516
01:38:48,603 --> 01:38:50,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just interesting, I suppose.

1517
01:38:50,904 --> 01:38:57,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I was going to say another game we didn't talk about because it wasn't our show role, but Rolando.

1518
01:38:57,688 --> 01:38:58,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember that game.

1519
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:00,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Who made Rolando?

1520
01:39:26,004 --> 01:39:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That I don't know.

1521
01:39:27,005 --> 01:39:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea.

1522
01:39:27,585 --> 01:39:32,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know Aurora Faint is a hell of a puzzle game that I'm enjoying on iPhone.

1523
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:33,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

1524
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It is LocoRoco.

1525
01:39:34,431 --> 01:39:35,052
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

1526
01:39:36,433 --> 01:39:44,320
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that you won't find anymore on the iPhone App Store is the iPhone Duck Hunt game.

1527
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:51,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Nintendo lawyers have finally swooped in like a duck and plucked the game off the...

1528
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:53,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything about the Game & Watch?

1529
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:56,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the dog rose out of the bushes and laughed at him.

1530
01:39:56,232 --> 01:40:04,757
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the Nintendo lawyer, after he laid the smackdown on that stupid little company, did the Nintendo dog laugh.

1531
01:40:04,797 --> 01:40:06,638
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the Game & Watch games that were on there?

1532
01:40:06,678 --> 01:40:08,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, those may still be on there.

1533
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:09,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded a couple of them.

1534
01:40:10,841 --> 01:40:13,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the one that was free, but I didn't download any of the others.

1535
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:17,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Reggie's going to show up at your house and personally delete them off your iPhone.

1536
01:40:17,526 --> 01:40:19,327
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to Falcon Punch us with his cock.

1537
01:40:21,196 --> 01:40:48,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to give a quick shout out real quickly because we were talking about iPhone games and Namco and all their franchises not on the iPhone but on the Playstation 3 I believe a Namco collection is being released or has just recently been released and I hear it's pretty cool and you want to check it out, the Namco Museum on PS3 I think that's only in the Japanese store remember because they were tying those in also where you can get like t-shirts and shit for home I think it's going to be on it's way here pretty soon and I hear you want to check it out

1538
01:40:49,218 --> 01:40:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't come out for the 360 like last Christmas.

1539
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:56,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they had the Namco, it was a Namco arcade something for the 360.

1540
01:40:56,692 --> 01:41:04,916
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like a bunch of the Xbox Live Arcade games and then they had some other classic games and remade stuff.

1541
01:41:04,936 --> 01:41:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was supposed to be pretty good and I think it's probably pretty cheap now.

1542
01:41:07,718 --> 01:41:10,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it had some live, it was like 30 bucks and it had like 30 games or so.

1543
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:19,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, it had, it was this really weird thing because it had games you could play off the disc, then it had games you had to import on your hard drive and play as like live arcade games.

1544
01:41:20,404 --> 01:41:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1545
01:41:21,144 --> 01:41:21,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man Championship Edition

1546
01:41:39,525 --> 01:41:42,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute.

1547
01:41:42,648 --> 01:41:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com with your emails.

1548
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:49,596
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have one more story about iPhone gaming, and this ties in kind of exactly what you were saying a little bit ago.

1549
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is iPhone is growing and growing and starting to become mobile gaming.

1550
01:41:54,381 --> 01:41:55,062
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, right now,

1551
01:41:55,682 --> 01:42:02,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They are saying that iPhones are accounting for 14% of mobile game downloaders, and that was in the month of November.

1552
01:42:02,287 --> 01:42:08,812
[SPEAKER_05]: 32.4%, that's like a third of all iPhone users, say that they have downloaded a game.

1553
01:42:08,992 --> 01:42:10,893
[SPEAKER_05]: In the month of November, they downloaded some type of game.

1554
01:42:11,814 --> 01:42:15,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to put that in perspective, across most mobile phone companies, you're looking at 3.8%.

1555
01:42:18,422 --> 01:42:23,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking like 10 times as many people on the iPhone check out games.

1556
01:42:23,969 --> 01:42:32,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, is that because the iPhone games... Go back a year on this show, just go back one year on this show before iPhone apps started coming out.

1557
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:35,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Mobile phone gaming was kind of the butt of many jokes on this show.

1558
01:42:36,904 --> 01:42:40,265
[SPEAKER_10]: In other countries, mobile gaming has been just fantastic.

1559
01:42:40,785 --> 01:42:51,848
[SPEAKER_10]: But we haven't had a phone until the iPhone or the Trio or the ones like that came out that was capable of handling an actual game with solid gameplay.

1560
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:53,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me say this too.

1561
01:42:53,329 --> 01:42:57,450
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatters, chat.orangelawnradio.com, we always look at that here on Sunday nights.

1562
01:42:57,750 --> 01:43:00,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Catacos in chat room says, well, let's get serious.

1563
01:43:00,271 --> 01:43:02,371
[SPEAKER_05]: What other phone can play games on them that are that good?

1564
01:43:02,632 --> 01:43:04,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Might I mention the N-Gage?

1565
01:43:05,799 --> 01:43:07,202
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, the iPhone.

1566
01:43:07,323 --> 01:43:11,473
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPhone, you know, it amounts to what, like 3%, 30%, whatever, of games downloaded.

1567
01:43:11,493 --> 01:43:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But it amounts to 100% of the decent phone games to download.

1568
01:43:16,252 --> 01:43:19,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this, that I did have a couple of cool games on my old phone.

1569
01:43:20,995 --> 01:43:23,917
[SPEAKER_10]: It was intensely hard to play, but I did have Super Pac-Man.

1570
01:43:24,297 --> 01:43:33,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while, even as hard of a time as we gave them in the past, the Luminous one that they had on phones was pretty freaking good for a phone game.

1571
01:43:33,824 --> 01:43:39,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Doom RPG and stuff, they had some pretty intricate stuff even on the old-ass phones.

1572
01:43:39,267 --> 01:43:40,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play Bejeweled on my old phone.

1573
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:41,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1574
01:43:42,729 --> 01:43:47,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of it was a joke because it was cashing in on the Spongebob and all that crap.

1575
01:43:47,274 --> 01:43:48,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just crappy little games.

1576
01:43:48,996 --> 01:43:54,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Speakeru says, I have an N-Gage and does NES and Mega Drive emulation pretty well.

1577
01:43:55,463 --> 01:43:56,585
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only thing it's good for.

1578
01:43:56,805 --> 01:43:58,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that would be a reason to have it.

1579
01:43:58,527 --> 01:44:00,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony Hawk on N-Gage was not that bad.

1580
01:44:00,836 --> 01:44:03,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag here, guys.

1581
01:44:03,841 --> 01:44:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have questions for us.

1582
01:44:07,127 --> 01:44:10,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send in your emails and we like to open up the mailbag and read through them.

1583
01:44:10,933 --> 01:44:12,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura's going to do it right now.

1584
01:44:17,659 --> 01:44:18,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we actually get some emails this week?

1585
01:44:18,899 --> 01:44:19,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we did.

1586
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1587
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a poor showing last week, so I'm glad people listened.

1588
01:44:23,921 --> 01:44:29,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob with two Bs says there's new box art on NeoGAF.

1589
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:30,403
[SPEAKER_10]: What's NeoGAF?

1590
01:44:30,543 --> 01:44:31,044
[SPEAKER_10]: G-A-F?

1591
01:44:31,444 --> 01:44:32,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Neo games are fun.

1592
01:44:32,704 --> 01:44:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, these huge forums that tons and tons of people look at.

1593
01:44:36,545 --> 01:44:37,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just haven't been there before.

1594
01:44:38,406 --> 01:44:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because there's like a million different gaming forums on the internet.

1595
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:41,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1596
01:44:41,827 --> 01:44:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, he says, supposedly the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame is being ported to PS3, Xbox 360.

1597
01:44:47,509 --> 01:44:47,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it is.

1598
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:51,611
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, I actually bought this for PSP Wii and PS2.

1599
01:44:52,151 --> 01:44:53,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious to see the graphics.

1600
01:44:54,773 --> 01:44:56,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to see if they add some more tables.

1601
01:44:57,054 --> 01:44:58,034
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii, you know what?

1602
01:44:58,134 --> 01:45:00,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, Funhaus is on the freaking cover.

1603
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:01,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that game.

1604
01:45:02,016 --> 01:45:05,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Call Wii Mageddon as much as you want, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.

1605
01:45:05,418 --> 01:45:06,018
[SPEAKER_05]: The pinballs.

1606
01:45:06,038 --> 01:45:07,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's giving his thumbs up approval.

1607
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:09,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a pretty awesome collection of games, I gotta say.

1608
01:45:10,694 --> 01:45:13,795
[SPEAKER_06]: You like pinball, you have a 360, download Pinball FX.

1609
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:14,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

1610
01:45:15,055 --> 01:45:17,175
[SPEAKER_06]: But Pinball Hall of Fame is great.

1611
01:45:17,516 --> 01:45:20,716
[SPEAKER_06]: If they go crazy, add some new tables with the 360 PS3 versions.

1612
01:45:20,876 --> 01:45:22,637
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be awesome.

1613
01:45:22,697 --> 01:45:25,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a really good pinball collection, really good physics.

1614
01:45:26,377 --> 01:45:30,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly enough, my vote's for the Wii version because of the non-checked remote controls.

1615
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:37,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next one comes from Geekboy2424.

1616
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:40,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi guys, I have come to a conclusion.

1617
01:45:40,156 --> 01:45:40,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I have ADHD.

1618
01:45:42,916 --> 01:46:02,545
[SPEAKER_10]: along with a little bit of OCD my question for the week is how do you guys stop yourselves because the only thing that works for me is playing games when is okay I guess when I sit at my desk I can't concentrate because I can't sit freaking still help Dr. Orange Lounge sincerely Geekboy2424

1619
01:46:03,786 --> 01:46:04,306
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1620
01:46:29,406 --> 01:46:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: but if like you're for real real like you have to play video games to get around your ADD that you think you have you might want to see a doctor I'm just saying we can't diagnose that and that's a huge liability if we even tried to now that Rob has said something responsible I say self-medicate play games all the time just it's not going to kill you or anything just just play them when you're at your desk whoop out your game boy um you know if it calms you down and it makes you feel good it's not like you're doing drugs or something hook it up man

1621
01:46:57,659 --> 01:46:59,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remember to go to the bathroom once in a while.

1622
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:05,384
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was a young hyperactive child, they used to make me drink coffee to calm down.

1623
01:47:05,784 --> 01:47:12,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Because caffeine, when you're already wired up and hyper, actually can be a sedative.

1624
01:47:15,231 --> 01:47:15,451
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1625
01:47:17,492 --> 01:47:18,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not giving medical advice.

1626
01:47:18,593 --> 01:47:19,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying what I used to do.

1627
01:47:20,114 --> 01:47:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying coffee's delicious.

1628
01:47:21,395 --> 01:47:23,216
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not medical advice, by the way.

1629
01:47:23,276 --> 01:47:24,637
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just what I used to do.

1630
01:47:25,666 --> 01:47:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Liability, liability, liability.

1631
01:47:28,248 --> 01:47:30,270
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I understand.

1632
01:47:30,951 --> 01:47:34,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, um... But you know what?

1633
01:47:34,534 --> 01:47:35,395
[SPEAKER_10]: ADD is in your head.

1634
01:47:37,757 --> 01:47:38,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1635
01:47:39,779 --> 01:47:40,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

1636
01:47:42,502 --> 01:47:42,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1637
01:47:44,116 --> 01:47:52,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi OLR, I'm sending this message from my iPod Touch with a cracked screen because my smart self dropped it on the ground while going from a friend's house to mine.

1638
01:47:53,305 --> 01:47:59,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I came to say hi because I've been listening to the podcast lately and laughed about the kid that threw a taco at his mom.

1639
01:48:01,845 --> 01:48:03,448
[SPEAKER_10]: By P.S.

1640
01:48:03,668 --> 01:48:07,233
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't put any spaces or anything.

1641
01:48:07,674 --> 01:48:11,380
[SPEAKER_10]: This message came from your friendly neighborhood MySpace friend, Aroka7.

1642
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:13,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Sent from my iPod.

1643
01:48:14,406 --> 01:48:14,726
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1644
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:48,965
[SPEAKER_05]: the team at Konami of Hawaii and he was the audio director of the Xbox series and part of the reason why I'm stopping the whole show to mention this and

1645
01:48:50,782 --> 01:49:00,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of take a minute to kind of soak this all in is that I don't know if you guys remember back when we would do the podcast and the show itself, the radio show itself as separate shows.

1646
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:06,567
[SPEAKER_05]: But one year we had a big, big score that we had the Universe soundtrack.

1647
01:49:06,607 --> 01:49:12,409
[SPEAKER_05]: We premiered those songs here on Orange Lounge Radio and I think it was like Ultramix 4 at the time before anybody else got to hear them.

1648
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:19,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Stillwind who coordinated all that with us here over email and was a big part, I know, of the fan community as well.

1649
01:49:20,831 --> 01:49:49,058
[SPEAKER_05]: so I'm just kind of it does not I'm just kind of shocked and saddened to hear it and I'm sorry to depress everybody with this news but I'm just finding it out myself and this is sometimes the problems that you have when you do a live radio show is that you get live news I don't know, you know, Babani Style is a pretty respectable site, I don't see why they would lie about something like this and just, no, that would be in very poor taste, so I'm pretty sure this is legit and very sad and

1650
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to say.

1651
01:49:54,135 --> 01:50:00,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very sorry to hear this for his family and everybody and for the community that have really lost something with this.

1652
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:01,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really sad news.

1653
01:50:02,292 --> 01:50:04,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very sorry to derail the mailbag with that sad news.

1654
01:50:04,254 --> 01:50:05,555
[SPEAKER_05]: He died from a ruptured aorta.

1655
01:50:06,355 --> 01:50:07,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is very sad.

1656
01:50:09,818 --> 01:50:19,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but he did a lot for the show a couple years ago and did keep in touch a little while here and there, so I just wanted to pass that news along.

1657
01:50:21,366 --> 01:50:21,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1658
01:50:22,227 --> 01:50:28,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Please tell me the next email has a dick and fart joke or something to bring the humor back to the show because I really just killed it right there.

1659
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:28,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1660
01:50:29,648 --> 01:50:31,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, hi folks.

1661
01:50:32,029 --> 01:50:39,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I'd throw in my proverbial two cents regarding the subject of rampant fanboyism that is often seen quite a lot on the net.

1662
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:54,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I think that no matter what systems one promotes or trashes, fanboyism in any form just makes us gamers look like the mouth-breathing cheetos dust encrusted in bread Neanderthals that non-gamers perceive us, and quite frankly, this kind of thing really needs to stop.

1663
01:50:54,454 --> 01:50:55,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Big, long sentence, wow.

1664
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:06,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking as someone who has both the 360 and PS3, and a whole shit ton of other systems from previous generations, I can honestly say the following.

1665
01:51:06,423 --> 01:51:08,163
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no such thing as a perfect system.

1666
01:51:08,783 --> 01:51:14,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Either there's a flaw in the hardware itself, or there's a feature service or some other aspect that another system does better.

1667
01:51:15,245 --> 01:51:21,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, just because a given game isn't on one system of choice, that doesn't mean it's a crap game.

1668
01:51:21,966 --> 01:51:32,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Conversely, just because a game is exclusive to one's favorite system, that doesn't make the game the greatest thing since the invention of breast implants.

1669
01:51:33,449 --> 01:51:38,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Simply put, each system has strengths as well as weaknesses, good games as well as total turds.

1670
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:42,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It helps to have multiple consoles so one has that much more options for gaming.

1671
01:51:43,052 --> 01:51:43,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen to that!

1672
01:51:43,953 --> 01:51:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know what we always said on this show, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1673
01:51:50,773 --> 01:51:51,874
[SPEAKER_10]: That sums it up right there.

1674
01:51:52,554 --> 01:51:53,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Spazinator.

1675
01:51:54,475 --> 01:51:55,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamcast, yo.

1676
01:51:57,716 --> 01:51:59,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Dreamcast is turning 10 this year.

1677
01:51:59,376 --> 01:51:59,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you believe it?

1678
01:52:00,097 --> 01:52:00,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking about that.

1679
01:52:01,277 --> 01:52:01,897
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

1680
01:52:02,077 --> 01:52:04,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember standing in line on September 9th, 99.

1681
01:52:05,698 --> 01:52:09,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting, though, that we do have three very distinct consoles that are out there right now.

1682
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of them have decent games on them.

1683
01:52:11,861 --> 01:52:13,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of them have some pretty crap games on them.

1684
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:15,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You have two consoles and you have the Wii.

1685
01:52:17,352 --> 01:52:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But even the Wii, you know, the Wii's got, for a particular audience, it has games people want.

1686
01:52:23,974 --> 01:52:26,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Soccer moms and families, it's got a ton of stuff that people want.

1687
01:52:26,755 --> 01:52:38,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But the console war right now, and while it's not a war for first place because Nintendo's got that, the console war, the culture clash in gamers right now is PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360.

1688
01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:45,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like last generation, GameCube was there, but it was really Xbox versus PS2.

1689
01:52:45,662 --> 01:52:45,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1690
01:52:48,478 --> 01:52:52,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been hitting the gaming forums for a long time.

1691
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:55,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't just work in a game store, but I work in a game store because I'm a gamer.

1692
01:52:56,641 --> 01:53:01,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the fanboyism is always going to be there.

1693
01:53:01,782 --> 01:53:02,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I own every system.

1694
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean every system.

1695
01:53:04,803 --> 01:53:05,523
[SPEAKER_05]: They really do.

1696
01:53:08,084 --> 01:53:09,624
[SPEAKER_10]: In our defense, we do not own a Jaguar.

1697
01:53:11,525 --> 01:53:12,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I would if I found one.

1698
01:53:13,925 --> 01:53:25,272
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey dude, Tempest 2000 is sweet, and Aliens vs. Predator is good, Cybermorph is not too bad, but back on the subject of fanboyism, I always have my favorites.

1699
01:53:25,292 --> 01:53:31,936
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when it came down to Genesis vs. Super Nintendo, I would argue Genesis for hours.

1700
01:53:32,036 --> 01:53:35,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And my wife says Super Nintendo, they're both great, don't get me wrong, Genesis.

1701
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But,

1702
01:53:39,935 --> 01:53:40,515
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1703
01:54:02,003 --> 01:54:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: They win because we refuse to acknowledge our competition, therefore we are the victors.

1704
01:54:06,404 --> 01:54:08,345
[SPEAKER_05]: We win because our system is made by Sony.

1705
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:09,545
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also not making that up.

1706
01:54:09,565 --> 01:54:11,026
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also eating too much periwinkle.

1707
01:54:12,486 --> 01:54:15,287
[SPEAKER_05]: He's paraphrasing, but he's not making that up, what he's saying.

1708
01:54:15,567 --> 01:54:17,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're also eating too much burnt sienna.

1709
01:54:17,587 --> 01:54:20,008
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the number one Sony system on the planet.

1710
01:54:20,308 --> 01:54:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's fine.

1711
01:54:21,949 --> 01:54:23,669
[SPEAKER_06]: The company is going to try to brainwash you.

1712
01:54:23,689 --> 01:54:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, no.

1713
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:25,830
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 2 is.

1714
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:27,710
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1715
01:54:28,050 --> 01:54:28,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PSP.

1716
01:54:28,931 --> 01:54:29,431
[SPEAKER_06]: But pick

1717
01:54:30,151 --> 01:54:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick the system that you like and fight for it.

1718
01:54:32,595 --> 01:54:36,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Get on the forums and tell everyone who likes the other system that they are ass close.

1719
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:37,601
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1720
01:54:38,022 --> 01:54:39,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see more rap and fanboyism.

1721
01:54:39,925 --> 01:54:41,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Be into what you're doing.

1722
01:54:41,727 --> 01:54:43,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's dying to read the last email, Jamie.

1723
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:44,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear lord.

1724
01:54:45,996 --> 01:54:46,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Last email.

1725
01:54:47,117 --> 01:54:47,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought him.

1726
01:54:47,937 --> 01:54:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought him.

1727
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:49,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1728
01:54:49,318 --> 01:54:50,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm loving it, though.

1729
01:54:51,019 --> 01:54:52,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, I love Dan.

1730
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:58,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you one thing that Sony does win in, and this is absolutely, you can't really, I think, argue this.

1731
01:54:59,165 --> 01:55:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: If the systems were used for blunt force trauma, they definitely would win because that system is heavy and quite solid.

1732
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:10,172
[SPEAKER_03]: 360, it is pretty heavy, not quite as solid in the Wii.

1733
01:55:10,232 --> 01:55:12,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not very bad or not very good.

1734
01:55:13,334 --> 01:55:14,795
[SPEAKER_06]: You come after me with a PS3.

1735
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:16,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come after you with a 360 power supply.

1736
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see who gets who.

1737
01:55:22,058 --> 01:55:22,278
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1738
01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:23,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Fanboyism.

1739
01:55:24,939 --> 01:55:27,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, last email.

1740
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:32,383
[SPEAKER_10]: At least Dan's rambling has mean I've gotten to eat more bread and get more crumbs in my cleavage.

1741
01:55:33,443 --> 01:55:33,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1742
01:55:36,024 --> 01:55:36,244
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1743
01:55:37,205 --> 01:55:37,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you done?

1744
01:55:40,623 --> 01:55:42,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, last email.

1745
01:55:42,444 --> 01:55:43,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OLR, love the show.

1746
01:55:44,244 --> 01:55:46,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I never miss an episode on the podcast feed.

1747
01:55:47,085 --> 01:55:51,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tough for me to catch the live show because I live on the East Coast and have young twins.

1748
01:55:51,787 --> 01:55:54,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm early to work on Monday morning, blah, blah, blah.

1749
01:55:54,848 --> 01:55:58,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, what I'm saying is that I have a tough time staying up as late as the show runs.

1750
01:56:03,608 --> 01:56:10,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I love the fact that you guys, in podcast form, help me through the monotonous parts of my office job.

1751
01:56:11,796 --> 01:56:12,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen.

1752
01:56:13,197 --> 01:56:15,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Lately, I've been sad that the feed has been so far behind.

1753
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:18,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any way that you could update the feed more regularly?

1754
01:56:18,982 --> 01:56:20,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been missing my OLR fix every week.

1755
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:24,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it got updated twice last week and will be updated twice this week and will be caught up.

1756
01:56:24,945 --> 01:56:35,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're slowly catching up and, you know, again, it's kind of just the side thing of having two computers running this thing off of and I just get far behind and I'm only one person.

1757
01:56:36,115 --> 01:56:37,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're almost there.

1758
01:56:37,976 --> 01:56:43,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Regardless, I appreciate your efforts as an independent podcast and wish you many more great episodes, Boston OLR fan.

1759
01:56:44,386 --> 01:56:46,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear that a lot, that we help people through the work week.

1760
01:56:46,627 --> 01:56:50,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know it's kind of depressing when your three-hour show you relied on isn't there.

1761
01:56:50,109 --> 01:56:51,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying, guys.

1762
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:52,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get caught up.

1763
01:56:52,771 --> 01:56:53,311
[SPEAKER_05]: We're almost there.

1764
01:56:54,592 --> 01:56:55,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So, great.

1765
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:56,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the emails, guys.

1766
01:56:56,854 --> 01:56:57,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us more.

1767
01:56:57,454 --> 01:57:01,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm hijacking this, mother.

1768
01:57:01,817 --> 01:57:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week's mailbag.

1769
01:57:02,797 --> 01:57:03,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you love Dan?

1770
01:57:03,678 --> 01:57:05,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hate Dan?

1771
01:57:05,339 --> 01:57:05,719
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1772
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Revolver

1773
01:57:26,295 --> 01:57:32,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be using the Rage engine again, so very similar to what they did with Grand Theft Auto 4.

1774
01:57:33,879 --> 01:57:41,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they say that there's going to be the complete open world with strong plot lines in a massive, vibrant, rural environment.

1775
01:57:43,145 --> 01:57:46,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's supposed to be coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360, no sort of time frame though.

1776
01:57:47,827 --> 01:57:49,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that one out of left field or what?

1777
01:57:50,268 --> 01:57:50,989
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, yeah.

1778
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Dead Revolver

1779
01:58:16,332 --> 01:58:16,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

1780
01:58:16,972 --> 01:58:18,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like four years ago.

1781
01:58:18,233 --> 01:58:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1782
01:58:18,633 --> 01:58:22,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, you know, Bully's still got two, three more years before we need a sequel for it.

1783
01:58:23,936 --> 01:58:25,837
[SPEAKER_05]: But then remember when we got Excite Truck?

1784
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:27,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Excite Truck was like great.

1785
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I know Excite Truck was awesome, but I'm just saying like, dude, how many years ago was Excite Bike?

1786
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:35,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even see Excite Truck and Excite Bike as even remotely similar games.

1787
01:58:36,362 --> 01:58:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not.

1788
01:58:36,663 --> 01:58:39,704
[SPEAKER_05]: The games play completely different, but they are kind of like, you know, they do.

1789
01:58:40,164 --> 01:58:43,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me happy that Nintendo used the prefix Excite again.

1790
01:58:43,226 --> 01:58:44,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it did excite me.

1791
01:58:44,266 --> 01:58:45,187
[SPEAKER_06]: For the third time.

1792
01:58:45,687 --> 01:58:48,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You got Excitebike, Excitebike64, which is sweet.

1793
01:58:48,948 --> 01:58:50,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that's on a virtual console, it should be.

1794
01:58:51,309 --> 01:58:54,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And Excite Truck, which is actually the best driving game on the Wii.

1795
01:58:55,310 --> 01:58:56,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there with Mario.

1796
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:57,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they need Excite Tank.

1797
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:59,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude, sweet.

1798
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:01,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Because nothing excites me more than the thought of driving a tank.

1799
01:59:02,452 --> 01:59:05,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Or actually Excite Truck with like a battle mode would be pretty awesome.

1800
01:59:05,673 --> 01:59:06,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Excite Humvee.

1801
01:59:08,186 --> 01:59:09,826
[SPEAKER_03]: or, hey, let's take it even better.

1802
01:59:10,367 --> 01:59:18,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of an Excite Bike or Excite Truck sequel, just do another Excite Truck game, but like with Mario stuff, like making it like a Mario Kart off-road racing game.

1803
01:59:18,589 --> 01:59:19,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, shut up.

1804
01:59:20,649 --> 01:59:23,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't need, we don't need, Mario's everywhere already.

1805
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:24,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck 2.

1806
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:26,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be very simple.

1807
01:59:26,510 --> 01:59:28,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just a new F-Zero, for God's sake.

1808
01:59:28,711 --> 01:59:29,071
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1809
01:59:30,952 --> 01:59:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, yes, DarkSakura?

1810
01:59:31,952 --> 01:59:32,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Excite Jet Ski.

1811
01:59:34,342 --> 01:59:36,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that in Wii Sports?

1812
01:59:36,823 --> 01:59:40,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't the new Wii Sports, what do they call it, Wii Sport Resort or whatever it's called?

1813
01:59:40,185 --> 01:59:40,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1814
01:59:40,385 --> 01:59:41,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't that have a jet ski thing in it?

1815
01:59:41,465 --> 01:59:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it does.

1816
01:59:42,045 --> 01:59:42,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it does.

1817
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:43,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Wave Race 65.

1818
01:59:47,507 --> 01:59:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt is flash forwarding to E3 this year.

1819
01:59:51,289 --> 01:59:56,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelly, that's Matt's wife, Nelly interviewing Reggie, why the fuck aren't you making Excite Truck 2?

1820
01:59:59,918 --> 02:00:07,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I would totally... Sad thing is, Nelly will have no idea who the hell Reggie is, so if that were to actually happen, it could.

1821
02:00:07,512 --> 02:00:10,397
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 suggested excite butt.

1822
02:00:11,438 --> 02:00:12,540
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't drive a butt.

1823
02:00:12,841 --> 02:00:13,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look.

1824
02:00:14,739 --> 02:00:16,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1825
02:00:44,324 --> 02:00:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1826
02:01:14,561 --> 02:01:15,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll show you.

1827
02:01:15,363 --> 02:01:16,887
[SPEAKER_03]: He has some serious buck teeth.

1828
02:01:17,148 --> 02:01:18,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark skin, short hair.

1829
02:01:18,893 --> 02:01:21,099
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the whole, you know, like, but it's just...

1830
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:22,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1831
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:50,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is like a Capcom thing.

1832
02:01:50,901 --> 02:01:52,402
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like an official product.

1833
02:01:52,522 --> 02:01:54,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, but in another country.

1834
02:01:54,643 --> 02:02:05,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know in Japan, in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn, there was a character that they couldn't have anywhere else in the world because he was copyrighted, I guess.

1835
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:07,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Norimaro, right?

1836
02:02:08,072 --> 02:02:08,813
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like a comedian.

1837
02:02:09,093 --> 02:02:13,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, wouldn't it be sweet if there was a hidden American character and it was Obama?

1838
02:02:13,316 --> 02:02:13,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1839
02:02:15,592 --> 02:02:18,075
[SPEAKER_07]: What would be Obama's special power in this game?

1840
02:02:18,735 --> 02:02:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, according to DJ Dark Knight in chat, a veto uppercut.

1841
02:02:25,662 --> 02:02:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: He would have all Sagats move, so he'd immediately be God tier.

1842
02:02:29,066 --> 02:02:31,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, he would just be like, veto, veto.

1843
02:02:31,548 --> 02:02:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had this image of Sagat, but actually it's Dick Cheney, like in a special movie, waterboarding.

1844
02:02:35,733 --> 02:02:36,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1845
02:02:36,213 --> 02:02:37,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Or shooting you with a gun.

1846
02:02:37,755 --> 02:02:38,576
[SPEAKER_07]: He was Dick Cheney.

1847
02:02:39,656 --> 02:03:07,223
[SPEAKER_03]: He would start off like in Which game was it where Sagat started off holding Mike Dan and then he'd throw him aside but he'd start off and be like Bush Wasn't there like a guile move that it was a rumored guile move they'd pull out a pistol or something and shoot somebody That was like an urban fucking legend Some kid at the arcade knew a kid who saw a kid pull out a gun But now with Dick Cheney Yeah, Dick Cheney But he'd only shoot his partner in the face

1848
02:03:09,193 --> 02:03:14,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, a hidden character in this, would Hillary Clinton come out of the woodwork and mix some shit up with this?

1849
02:03:14,917 --> 02:03:15,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what her special character is.

1850
02:03:15,818 --> 02:03:17,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah Palin might come out.

1851
02:03:18,219 --> 02:03:19,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Ariel Wolf shooting right there.

1852
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, the chatroom is quick to point out, there is an Obama Japan.

1853
02:03:26,705 --> 02:03:28,986
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an Obama Japan, according to chat.

1854
02:03:29,006 --> 02:03:31,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do remember seeing that on TV when he won.

1855
02:03:31,268 --> 02:03:34,410
[SPEAKER_05]: They were showing how excited they were in Japan and all that, so...

1856
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:35,860
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1857
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, if you want to join the festivities, chat.orangelauntrader.com.

1858
02:03:38,621 --> 02:03:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And I apologize to the folks on Justin TV because I just clicked over there and I see like the chat is filling up there.

1859
02:03:43,243 --> 02:03:47,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have a death wishing says Excitebike64 is my favorite game on the N64.

1860
02:03:47,484 --> 02:03:48,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good game.

1861
02:03:48,925 --> 02:03:50,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, guys.

1862
02:03:50,205 --> 02:03:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really hard for us to watch two chat rooms at the same time and do a show.

1863
02:03:53,747 --> 02:03:55,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes Justin TV gets ignored.

1864
02:03:55,708 --> 02:03:56,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize.

1865
02:03:56,568 --> 02:03:59,129
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely join our main chat room, chat.orangelauntrader.com.

1866
02:03:59,149 --> 02:04:00,989
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll read more of your comments as we can.

1867
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:01,890
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1868
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:04,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, shall we, Jimmy?

1869
02:04:05,945 --> 02:04:06,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1870
02:04:06,165 --> 02:04:07,026
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft!

1871
02:04:07,046 --> 02:04:08,288
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gonna be some changes.

1872
02:04:08,308 --> 02:04:13,354
[SPEAKER_05]: In the next World of Warcraft patch, we'll have some class changes, actually.

1873
02:04:13,374 --> 02:04:13,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Again?

1874
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:33,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there is a no more consumable ammunition for hunters, a boost of protection spec paladins.

1875
02:04:33,376 --> 02:04:34,056
[SPEAKER_05]: For real?

1876
02:04:34,317 --> 02:04:36,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you don't have to get arrows anymore or whatever?

1877
02:04:36,659 --> 02:04:37,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.

1878
02:04:37,801 --> 02:04:38,702
[SPEAKER_05]: That's strange.

1879
02:04:39,557 --> 02:04:58,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Major improvements to the priest class, especially in group healing, general buffs for rogues and shamans, efficiency improvements for warriors and warlocks, with penalty for warriors changing stances being much lighter, plus mana regeneration being reined in across the board.

1880
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere in Arms Warrior is rejoicing.

1881
02:05:02,472 --> 02:05:05,453
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually find more information on it on WoW Insider.

1882
02:05:05,693 --> 02:05:07,174
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the specifics listed.

1883
02:05:08,015 --> 02:05:14,899
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically, they're trying to just streamline all the classes, trying to bring all the tanking classes in line.

1884
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:18,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, just trying to balance the game.

1885
02:05:18,821 --> 02:05:21,602
[SPEAKER_10]: And also make the boss fights more challenging by...

1886
02:05:22,843 --> 02:05:51,234
[SPEAKER_10]: decreasing the mana regeneration the content has not gone into testing yet it should be going in before the release in the next couple of months so keep your eyes out if any of our readers find out more let us know also in patch 3.1 there will be a new raid dungeon called Ulduar with an introduction of dual talent specializations thank god about fucking time that's the rumor

1887
02:05:51,778 --> 02:05:54,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt2, do you think this will be enough to get me back to WoW?

1888
02:06:12,762 --> 02:06:17,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, short of me paying for your account again or whatever I have to do to get you playing back to the World of Warcraft.

1889
02:06:17,226 --> 02:06:19,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually kind of think that I want to start playing again just for a little bit.

1890
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:20,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1891
02:06:20,389 --> 02:06:21,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though my last character was level 10.

1892
02:06:21,851 --> 02:06:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But as Rob pointed out at the beginning of the show, all 20 of my characters, which is really 9 of them, are all Narzul.

1893
02:06:28,738 --> 02:06:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you been gone for more than 3 months?

1894
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:35,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get you a Scroll of Resurrection because then we can get the Uber item that lets us level up really quickly.

1895
02:06:35,684 --> 02:06:36,265
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get my scroll.

1896
02:06:37,719 --> 02:06:38,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay strong.

1897
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:39,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't start playing again.

1898
02:07:01,465 --> 02:07:05,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because it's not cool to say that things cause cancer because people are dying of cancer.

1899
02:07:05,486 --> 02:07:07,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started saying that things cause cancer too.

1900
02:07:08,227 --> 02:07:09,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, wow causes electric boogaloo.

1901
02:07:10,008 --> 02:07:10,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

1902
02:07:10,648 --> 02:07:14,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow causes electric boogaloo.

1903
02:07:14,609 --> 02:07:15,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's serious though.

1904
02:07:15,289 --> 02:07:15,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't start playing.

1905
02:07:16,109 --> 02:07:19,510
[SPEAKER_06]: You know so much more about games when you don't play wow.

1906
02:07:19,730 --> 02:07:20,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1907
02:07:20,291 --> 02:07:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I play so many more games when I'm not playing wow.

1908
02:07:23,151 --> 02:07:23,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even know.

1909
02:07:23,972 --> 02:07:24,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad trombone.

1910
02:07:24,952 --> 02:07:25,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Low key.

1911
02:07:29,202 --> 02:07:42,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is totally as far away from World of Warcraft as possible, but Battlefield 1943 is now slated to come out on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and PlayStation Network this summer.

1912
02:07:43,081 --> 02:07:45,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be based on the same engine as...

1913
02:07:45,805 --> 02:07:59,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad Company, and will feature 24-player battles, and they had a few different maps, including Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima, which are based off of actual world locations.

1914
02:08:00,169 --> 02:08:07,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they actually used some of the top topography maps and stuff like that for that.

1915
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat, I guess.

1916
02:08:09,751 --> 02:08:12,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, around the same time, I believe they announced...

1917
02:08:14,432 --> 02:08:17,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well?

1918
02:08:18,695 --> 02:08:23,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Because really, if gaming needed anything besides more MMORPGs, it's more FPSs.

1919
02:08:24,998 --> 02:08:25,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.

1920
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:30,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, if I remember correctly, Bad Company 2 is right now for September.

1921
02:08:32,263 --> 02:08:35,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, TigerClaw says it's nice for them to go back to the World War 2 roots.

1922
02:08:36,105 --> 02:08:36,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1923
02:08:38,464 --> 02:08:44,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Since obviously they can't really do the modern warfare stuff now because Call of Duty has owned it.

1924
02:08:45,728 --> 02:08:49,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to go back previously because this comment is pretty funny on the past story about WoW.

1925
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:54,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat says, WoW may not cause cancer, but it can cause breakups, cheating, and marriage counseling.

1926
02:08:56,174 --> 02:08:56,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I have heard that.

1927
02:08:57,855 --> 02:09:00,037
[SPEAKER_05]: But the family that raids together stays together.

1928
02:09:00,937 --> 02:09:02,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's my counter argument.

1929
02:09:03,479 --> 02:09:04,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not going back to WoW.

1930
02:09:07,124 --> 02:09:08,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to play Perfect World.

1931
02:09:08,245 --> 02:09:09,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I said I was going to play Perfect World.

1932
02:09:09,766 --> 02:09:11,727
[SPEAKER_05]: For 30 days and you'll come play WoW.

1933
02:09:11,787 --> 02:09:14,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been off of WoW for how long?

1934
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:15,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Addict.

1935
02:09:16,811 --> 02:09:17,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even playing right now.

1936
02:09:18,032 --> 02:09:19,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Why am I trying to recruit people?

1937
02:09:19,994 --> 02:09:23,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know Matt2 is going to succeed in his efforts to try and get me back.

1938
02:09:23,777 --> 02:09:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am.

1939
02:09:25,498 --> 02:09:25,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1940
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:27,860
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a follower.

1941
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:28,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to EA.

1942
02:09:29,642 --> 02:09:30,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I am, really.

1943
02:09:31,997 --> 02:09:33,558
[SPEAKER_05]: and their conference call they had.

1944
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:43,747
[SPEAKER_05]: News about Battlefield was not the only thing to come out of it and some of the things we talked about in Part A, but also Mass Effect has been confirmed that Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

1945
02:09:43,787 --> 02:09:45,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be Xbox exclusive.

1946
02:09:45,408 --> 02:09:47,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's straight out of the mouth of CEO John Riccatello.

1947
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:50,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

1948
02:09:50,332 --> 02:09:56,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Bad Company, the other Battlefield game, will be back on consoles in the year 2010.

1949
02:09:57,758 --> 02:10:00,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So some point like January to March, but who knows.

1950
02:10:01,181 --> 02:10:01,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1951
02:10:01,701 --> 02:10:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was 2009, but I guess it's going to be delayed a lot more.

1952
02:10:06,504 --> 02:10:07,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably even more than that.

1953
02:10:08,266 --> 02:10:09,066
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Mass Effect?

1954
02:10:09,826 --> 02:10:11,788
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the other one, the Battlefield Bad Company.

1955
02:10:12,168 --> 02:10:16,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Mass Effect was a Microsoft Game Studios-owned franchise.

1956
02:10:16,611 --> 02:10:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think Bioware carried it over with them.

1957
02:10:18,683 --> 02:10:21,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing, and I bet BlackWolf in chat is right.

1958
02:10:21,304 --> 02:10:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying it right.

1959
02:10:22,124 --> 02:10:23,504
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying exactly what I'm thinking.

1960
02:10:23,564 --> 02:10:26,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiple platform equals Xbox 360 and PC.

1961
02:10:27,165 --> 02:10:28,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you that's exactly what it is.

1962
02:10:29,006 --> 02:10:30,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't mean suddenly we're going to see PS3.

1963
02:10:31,327 --> 02:10:41,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, we've also seen, you know, who knows, you might get a Mass Effect spinoff on the DS because we have seen that Microsoft is not opposed to letting their stuff go on, yeah, less effect.

1964
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Dual effect.

1965
02:10:44,971 --> 02:10:48,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing things go on the DS, Viva Pinata had a game on the DS.

1966
02:10:48,253 --> 02:10:49,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's possible.

1967
02:10:50,114 --> 02:10:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Viva Pinata, Mecha Assault.

1968
02:10:53,156 --> 02:10:57,939
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be an awesome game, like a mech game, but they're just giant pinatas.

1969
02:10:58,059 --> 02:11:00,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've done Mecha Assault on the DS, and it was not very good.

1970
02:11:01,121 --> 02:11:01,681
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did it.

1971
02:11:02,662 --> 02:11:03,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Microsoft franchise.

1972
02:11:05,003 --> 02:11:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1973
02:11:05,403 --> 02:11:05,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1974
02:11:05,683 --> 02:11:05,984
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it.

1975
02:11:06,004 --> 02:11:07,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Microsoft franchise.

1976
02:11:07,825 --> 02:11:08,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same.

1977
02:11:09,376 --> 02:11:36,777
[SPEAKER_03]: but I was completely different game but it's kind of big like some of these Mass Effect games Borderlands, I actually watched some gameplay footage of and that thing's going to be epic and I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard because it's almost like Oblivion and Fallout with just a lot more fast paced first person gameplay and vehicles and Mad Max Alrighty then

1978
02:11:37,588 --> 02:11:39,330
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1979
02:11:58,767 --> 02:12:01,669
[SPEAKER_10]: to sometime in early June.

1980
02:12:02,130 --> 02:12:08,234
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually speculating June 2nd with the non-PC versions being sometime later than that.

1981
02:12:10,856 --> 02:12:20,623
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also saying that the games they'll be released on PC and Mac and iPhone, iPhone Touch and other mobiles.

1982
02:12:22,684 --> 02:12:25,026
[SPEAKER_10]: But the release date only really goes for the PC version.

1983
02:12:26,167 --> 02:12:28,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

1984
02:12:29,195 --> 02:12:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: F.U.S.

1985
02:12:29,655 --> 02:12:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Week

1986
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to my work for deciding that I need to help back up people on the phones even though I don't get a single damn call and it'll really suck because I've been having a really bad sore throat from my sinus infection so F you to the phones and talk to the people

1987
02:13:33,297 --> 02:13:41,242
[SPEAKER_03]: FD the person that parks next to me at my apartment complex because they're parking right on the line and they haven't moved their car in like four days.

1988
02:13:41,903 --> 02:13:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it makes it almost impossible for me to get out of my car.

1989
02:13:47,006 --> 02:13:49,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I would really do some damage to their car, but someone's already keyed it.

1990
02:13:49,888 --> 02:13:52,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently they do this other places as well.

1991
02:13:52,370 --> 02:13:54,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So fuck them.

1992
02:13:55,958 --> 02:13:57,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't have a lot of FUs of the week.

1993
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:00,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a pretty good week, so FU to me being so happy, I suppose.

1994
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to, I'll say this, FU to sleeping in until noon and still feeling tired.

1995
02:14:07,583 --> 02:14:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that.

1996
02:14:08,183 --> 02:14:18,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had that where you sleep so freaking much, although that's not the case because I can go to bed until 5 last night, but I have had this happen before where you sleep so much that your eyes hurt and you're still tired.

1997
02:14:18,747 --> 02:14:19,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had that happen.

1998
02:14:19,947 --> 02:14:20,508
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.

1999
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:21,128
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to that.

2000
02:14:22,294 --> 02:14:23,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, do you have any FUs of the week you want to share?

2001
02:14:24,195 --> 02:14:27,296
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to people who get bent about pushed release dates.

2002
02:14:27,856 --> 02:14:29,116
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other shit to play.

2003
02:14:29,996 --> 02:14:31,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Find a different game.

2004
02:14:31,797 --> 02:14:32,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

2005
02:14:33,237 --> 02:14:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Those dates don't even exist for you.

2006
02:14:36,178 --> 02:14:37,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are for retailers like me.

2007
02:14:38,039 --> 02:14:41,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know when they're coming out and I know when to start pushing the product.

2008
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:43,540
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not even supposed to know them!

2009
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:44,420
[SPEAKER_05]: F you all.

2010
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:47,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, we just have to work in this segment somewhere in the show.

2011
02:14:48,221 --> 02:14:48,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You die.

2012
02:14:49,242 --> 02:14:49,942
[SPEAKER_05]: You die twice.

2013
02:14:51,229 --> 02:14:52,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you get Electric Boogaloo.

2014
02:14:53,791 --> 02:14:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to being alive.

2015
02:14:55,993 --> 02:14:56,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, too.

2016
02:14:56,773 --> 02:14:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share?

2017
02:14:58,274 --> 02:15:02,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't thought this far ahead, but I guess FU to Weemageddon, the potential

2018
02:15:03,208 --> 02:15:07,250
[SPEAKER_07]: and Penny Weemageddon that may cause more console wars with each other.

2019
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:11,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Jerry Breckenheimer movie that will follow called Weemageddon.

2020
02:15:11,632 --> 02:15:12,013
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2021
02:15:12,033 --> 02:15:13,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever his name is.

2022
02:15:13,353 --> 02:15:14,634
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll make millions upon millions of dollars.

2023
02:15:15,034 --> 02:15:20,657
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do agree that there are two main primary consoles in the Wii for that one special demographic.

2024
02:15:21,258 --> 02:15:23,239
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to you for stealing my stolen work.

2025
02:15:24,299 --> 02:15:27,701
[SPEAKER_07]: F you because you thought of that first and I happened to say it.

2026
02:15:28,919 --> 02:15:29,579
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not even copyright.

2027
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:30,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said.

2028
02:15:30,099 --> 02:15:32,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I stole it, and then you stole it from me.

2029
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:33,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, F you both.

2030
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And you stole it from him.

2031
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: F you both.

2032
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting back into the news.

2033
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:37,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki doesn't even want it anymore.

2034
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:37,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2035
02:15:37,861 --> 02:15:39,361
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll add a prefix to F you.

2036
02:15:39,621 --> 02:15:40,361
[SPEAKER_10]: S-T-F-U.

2037
02:15:41,821 --> 02:15:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

2038
02:15:44,062 --> 02:15:44,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2039
02:15:44,982 --> 02:15:45,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2040
02:15:45,782 --> 02:15:46,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any more gaming news?

2041
02:15:46,942 --> 02:15:47,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

2042
02:15:47,642 --> 02:15:47,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2043
02:15:48,062 --> 02:15:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I'm going to now copyright Super Weemageddon.

2044
02:15:56,644 --> 02:15:57,644
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Weemageddon.

2045
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:02,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a game that will not be featured on the Super Wii Mageddon 64 will be...

2046
02:16:06,147 --> 02:16:07,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest Galactrix.

2047
02:16:07,867 --> 02:16:08,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2048
02:16:08,228 --> 02:16:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they do manage to port those Puzzle Quest games to everything.

2049
02:16:11,628 --> 02:16:12,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad.

2050
02:16:12,389 --> 02:16:14,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be on Super Wii Mageddon 64 already.

2051
02:16:14,529 --> 02:16:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be coming out on DS, PC, Xbox Live Arcade.

2052
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:23,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the PC version is coming around on February 24th.

2053
02:16:24,031 --> 02:16:28,973
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox Live Arcade date is unconfirmed, but you know me being the guessing man that I am.

2054
02:16:29,793 --> 02:16:33,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say since the... I don't know.

2055
02:16:33,614 --> 02:16:33,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe...

2056
02:16:37,951 --> 02:16:39,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest is cool.

2057
02:16:39,112 --> 02:16:41,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really afraid you were going to say it was cancelled.

2058
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:42,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cancelled.

2059
02:16:42,636 --> 02:16:43,196
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2060
02:16:43,717 --> 02:16:44,718
[SPEAKER_05]: What, no Atari 2600 port?

2061
02:16:44,798 --> 02:16:47,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cancelled for Christmas, and Christmas is cancelled as well.

2062
02:16:48,822 --> 02:16:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest is awesome.

2063
02:16:49,923 --> 02:16:50,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Hanukkah!

2064
02:16:50,563 --> 02:16:53,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Although where the Galactrix thing comes from, I don't even know.

2065
02:16:53,868 --> 02:16:58,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Galactrix comes from the fact that the game is different and it's set in space now.

2066
02:16:59,733 --> 02:17:01,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And they changed the engine.

2067
02:17:01,254 --> 02:17:03,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's the whole hexagonal thing.

2068
02:17:03,315 --> 02:17:04,817
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's pretty cool, actually.

2069
02:17:04,837 --> 02:17:06,878
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've played the demo, it's pretty addicting, I think.

2070
02:17:07,178 --> 02:17:11,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put friggin' Puzzle Pirates on Xbox Live Arcade games.

2071
02:17:12,242 --> 02:17:13,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

2072
02:17:13,764 --> 02:17:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

2073
02:17:14,564 --> 02:17:16,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really meant to be a portable game, though.

2074
02:17:17,186 --> 02:17:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Pirates would be an awesome DS, like MMO.

2075
02:17:19,928 --> 02:17:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see playing Puzzle Quest on my 360s.

2076
02:17:23,393 --> 02:17:25,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But I could totally see playing that on the PSP.

2077
02:17:27,970 --> 02:17:41,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Also out of EA, some other news, it's not related to Puzzle Quest, but one other little piece of news that's out of EA, apparently they are now going to be getting the Bourne series over there, or I guess what's going on, it's not just really the Bourne.

2078
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:46,364
[SPEAKER_05]: What's happened, they've picked up the rights to publish games that are based on Robert Ludlam stories.

2079
02:17:46,464 --> 02:17:48,846
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the guy who made the Jason Bourne series.

2080
02:17:50,187 --> 02:17:53,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the first game in the series is going to be made by Starbreeze Studios.

2081
02:17:53,590 --> 02:17:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on exactly what that game is, but

2082
02:17:56,192 --> 02:17:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt Damon!

2083
02:18:14,451 --> 02:18:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: They all do very well, yes, because of Matt Damon.

2084
02:18:20,353 --> 02:18:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: What other books has he written?

2085
02:18:21,994 --> 02:18:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not really familiar with... It is a Bourne title they're working on, by the way.

2086
02:18:25,475 --> 02:18:28,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with The Bourne and end with, like, something.

2087
02:18:29,216 --> 02:18:30,697
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bourne Cakery.

2088
02:18:33,278 --> 02:18:33,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2089
02:18:35,178 --> 02:18:35,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2090
02:18:35,839 --> 02:18:36,859
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bourne Cooking Mama.

2091
02:18:36,999 --> 02:18:37,499
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know.

2092
02:18:37,739 --> 02:18:38,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you have it.

2093
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:42,741
[SPEAKER_05]: EA has picked up the Bourne rights and who knows what else from the same author.

2094
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:45,851
[SPEAKER_10]: The Bourne Oven.

2095
02:18:46,351 --> 02:18:50,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this idea of picking up rights to authors' stories, though.

2096
02:18:50,192 --> 02:18:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine J.D.

2097
02:18:51,813 --> 02:18:52,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Salinger rights getting picked up?

2098
02:18:53,013 --> 02:18:54,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have the Catcher in the Rye game.

2099
02:18:54,513 --> 02:18:56,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we've had Discworld games before.

2100
02:18:57,254 --> 02:18:58,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Roald Dahl gets picked up.

2101
02:18:58,475 --> 02:19:01,076
[SPEAKER_05]: We could finally have Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the game.

2102
02:19:01,496 --> 02:19:02,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be pretty amazing.

2103
02:19:05,117 --> 02:19:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It was certainly better than that shit-tastic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory game they put out a couple years ago.

2104
02:19:09,678 --> 02:19:11,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm picking up the rights to the Bible.

2105
02:19:13,863 --> 02:19:16,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, those little offshoot companies already did Bible Adventures.

2106
02:19:16,904 --> 02:19:17,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

2107
02:19:20,666 --> 02:19:23,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if, like, God's rights are for sale.

2108
02:19:24,548 --> 02:19:25,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I pick the... Call it a thought.

2109
02:19:26,908 --> 02:19:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I pick the... I'm so glad you didn't have a mic when you said that.

2110
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:37,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I pick the rights to the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

2111
02:19:38,852 --> 02:19:40,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to do a Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

2112
02:19:41,194 --> 02:19:44,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, I'm buying the rights to the articles in Playboy.

2113
02:19:46,518 --> 02:19:52,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, if you want to make a badass game, license the Oblivion Engine and the Bible.

2114
02:19:53,162 --> 02:19:54,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And just combine them.

2115
02:19:55,044 --> 02:19:56,705
[SPEAKER_03]: How fucking nuts would that be?

2116
02:19:56,985 --> 02:19:59,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as Frisbee puts in the chat, SuperChristPuncher64.

2117
02:20:04,754 --> 02:20:06,875
[SPEAKER_05]: FlyingSpaghettiMonster

2118
02:20:32,008 --> 02:21:01,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children I said not religion For some people, Final Fantasy VII is a religion Because people need lives At any rate, the Blu-ray edition of the movie will have a dub soundtrack Which is why I'm importing that bitch And not because Final Fantasy XIII demo is going to be on there at all Oh no, not for that or anything

2119
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: No, never for that.

2120
02:21:03,538 --> 02:21:04,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to have it option.

2121
02:21:05,779 --> 02:21:07,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

2122
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:16,983
[SPEAKER_10]: But it actually, if you do buy that Blu-ray version though, it's going to have the English voice track.

2123
02:21:17,963 --> 02:21:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you download the HD Final Fantasy XIII trailer on PlayStation 3?

2124
02:21:23,385 --> 02:21:23,565
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2125
02:21:23,825 --> 02:21:26,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously think I got a boner from watching that trailer.

2126
02:21:26,706 --> 02:21:27,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty hot.

2127
02:21:27,867 --> 02:21:28,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Noise.

2128
02:21:30,808 --> 02:21:33,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hearing way too much about cocks on this show tonight.

2129
02:21:35,253 --> 02:21:37,016
[SPEAKER_10]: At least we've had a mention of boobs.

2130
02:21:39,138 --> 02:21:42,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of cocks, Guns N' Roses Chinese...

2131
02:21:46,707 --> 02:21:49,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Loki just won Best Transition Ever.

2132
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:50,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

2133
02:21:51,371 --> 02:21:55,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy album is coming to Rock Band this spring.

2134
02:21:57,737 --> 02:22:00,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no word on the price, but it's coming.

2135
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:03,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, it's going to be delayed.

2136
02:22:04,643 --> 02:22:07,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming, actually, February 28th, so...

2137
02:22:09,529 --> 02:22:18,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, also, Rock Band is going to be getting some new download content with the re-release of Pearl Jam's 10 album.

2138
02:22:19,357 --> 02:22:24,081
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have a code for three bonus tracks in Rock Band.

2139
02:22:24,721 --> 02:22:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Brother Alive and State of Love and Trust

2140
02:22:41,855 --> 02:22:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band has cost themselves some serious cool points.

2141
02:22:44,837 --> 02:22:49,701
[SPEAKER_06]: First was the janky way you had to pay $40 for ACDC Live, which you can get for $30 now.

2142
02:22:50,201 --> 02:22:52,322
[SPEAKER_06]: The second is the whole Chinese democracy thing.

2143
02:22:52,863 --> 02:22:53,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

2144
02:22:53,763 --> 02:22:56,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit trying to stuff these giant packs on us.

2145
02:22:56,805 --> 02:22:57,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terrible.

2146
02:22:57,806 --> 02:22:58,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible stuff.

2147
02:22:58,607 --> 02:22:59,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Making us buy CDs.

2148
02:22:59,727 --> 02:23:00,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put them up on the network.

2149
02:23:01,008 --> 02:23:01,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

2150
02:23:01,529 --> 02:23:06,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese democracy thing is going to be on the network.

2151
02:23:06,412 --> 02:23:07,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, that just sucks.

2152
02:23:07,873 --> 02:23:08,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited about Pearl Jam.

2153
02:23:08,473 --> 02:23:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That is their single best and only fantastic album.

2154
02:23:38,936 --> 02:23:45,942
[SPEAKER_10]: That is one of the last CDs that I have ever owned that every damn track on it was fantastic.

2155
02:23:45,962 --> 02:23:48,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we seriously get a Journey album right now?

2156
02:23:48,164 --> 02:23:48,784
[SPEAKER_10]: No shit.

2157
02:23:49,785 --> 02:23:50,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

2158
02:23:50,346 --> 02:23:52,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not that Pearl Jam isn't good.

2159
02:23:52,347 --> 02:23:53,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that Journey's better.

2160
02:23:53,849 --> 02:23:54,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2161
02:23:54,489 --> 02:23:58,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't want to buy 10 again so I can get three rock band songs.

2162
02:23:58,892 --> 02:24:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, there's an egregious dearth of Journey.

2163
02:24:02,915 --> 02:24:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: There needs to be way more of it.

2164
02:24:05,137 --> 02:24:06,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Every Journey song would be great.

2165
02:24:07,539 --> 02:24:07,959
[SPEAKER_05]: For real.

2166
02:24:07,999 --> 02:24:10,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they need to be selling at Walmart is the Journey game.

2167
02:24:10,481 --> 02:24:11,522
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the one that's on...

2168
02:24:13,725 --> 02:24:15,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway you want it, that's the way you need it.

2169
02:24:15,986 --> 02:24:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great, but I mean, there's so more, so much more.

2170
02:24:19,687 --> 02:24:30,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and you know, you know we love our music game roots, and we have to mention music games whenever we see new ones, but I don't know if this one exactly would qualify.

2171
02:24:30,650 --> 02:24:32,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game called D-Pad Hero.

2172
02:24:32,991 --> 02:24:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, there's so much love out there for Guitar Hero and everything that this whole thing started that they have actually made a

2173
02:24:40,573 --> 02:24:41,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Retro D-Make.

2174
02:24:42,154 --> 02:24:42,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a remake.

2175
02:24:42,994 --> 02:24:43,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you feel.

2176
02:24:43,915 --> 02:24:44,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you love remakes.

2177
02:24:44,695 --> 02:24:46,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you feel about D-Makes, though.

2178
02:24:47,276 --> 02:24:48,176
[SPEAKER_05]: D-Pad Hero.

2179
02:24:48,496 --> 02:24:48,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2180
02:24:48,877 --> 02:24:51,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Guitar Hero, but you use the D-Pad to play the game.

2181
02:24:52,278 --> 02:24:56,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, there's actually a little video that leaked on YouTube here.

2182
02:24:56,740 --> 02:25:00,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't say leaked, but they actually put it out here kind of showing how the game works.

2183
02:25:00,702 --> 02:25:06,284
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're hearing the noises in the background there, that's what I'm trying to load here in studio, although it's kind of having a hard time buffering.

2184
02:25:07,004 --> 02:25:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so sure you said D-Bag Hero at first.

2185
02:25:09,747 --> 02:25:10,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Douchebag Hero?

2186
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:16,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that would play exactly the same way.

2187
02:25:16,053 --> 02:25:16,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what?

2188
02:25:17,214 --> 02:25:18,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

2189
02:25:19,056 --> 02:25:22,119
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not D-Bag Hero, D-Pad Hero.

2190
02:25:22,139 --> 02:25:22,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2191
02:25:24,554 --> 02:25:25,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Annunciate.

2192
02:25:26,075 --> 02:25:27,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I just need to clean my ears or something.

2193
02:25:27,395 --> 02:25:29,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I don't know why the video's not working, but it's not.

2194
02:25:29,936 --> 02:25:34,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently you have all these different... But the thing is, is that you actually... You guys know he's making that up, right?

2195
02:25:34,638 --> 02:25:37,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually get these music things in NES style.

2196
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:43,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So it actually has, you know, speaking of Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine, that you can actually play in, like, it's NES style.

2197
02:25:43,441 --> 02:25:44,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2198
02:25:44,762 --> 02:25:48,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to see if we can get a... Because they actually have this, too.

2199
02:25:48,223 --> 02:25:48,463
[SPEAKER_05]: They have...

2200
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:53,784
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger in this game as well by Daft Punk.

2201
02:25:53,805 --> 02:25:56,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if one of these other videos will work here a little better.

2202
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:05,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, here's a little... And these little things fall down.

2203
02:26:05,695 --> 02:26:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like you actually hold the D-pad in a certain direction when you push the button.

2204
02:26:09,598 --> 02:26:11,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does have a little bit of a challenge to it.

2205
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:14,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And there actually is a little audience that rocks out.

2206
02:26:14,323 --> 02:26:16,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Like see, there's like one guy bobbing up and down there in the background.

2207
02:26:21,061 --> 02:26:22,102
[SPEAKER_05]: This song is awesome.

2208
02:26:24,485 --> 02:26:26,887
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually a pretty faithful remake of the song.

2209
02:26:31,812 --> 02:26:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And Amaze Hatsuma in chat says, once teabag hero.

2210
02:26:35,456 --> 02:26:38,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

2211
02:26:38,559 --> 02:26:40,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Featuring an all Madonna soundtrack.

2212
02:26:40,321 --> 02:26:40,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2213
02:26:41,762 --> 02:26:42,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

2214
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:43,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2215
02:26:44,753 --> 02:26:45,133
[SPEAKER_05]: New York Comic Con

2216
02:27:15,810 --> 02:27:17,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I had a lot of fun.

2217
02:27:17,871 --> 02:27:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is the first Comic-Con I went to, because this is the first time I've been back in New York for a long time.

2218
02:27:22,514 --> 02:27:32,160
[SPEAKER_08]: But Comic-Con has kind of turned itself into a normal comic convention, into just a whole geek fest of everything.

2219
02:27:33,521 --> 02:27:37,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, this year, they kind of expanded the game section.

2220
02:27:37,664 --> 02:27:40,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So now half the convention is more so video game stuff.

2221
02:27:40,762 --> 02:27:44,451
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a lot of new games there that I was excited to play.

2222
02:27:47,116 --> 02:27:47,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

2223
02:27:47,576 --> 02:27:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it's practically turning into the San Diego Comic-Con, because they don't really talk about comics at the San Diego.

2224
02:27:52,541 --> 02:27:55,203
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they do, but a lot of it is Hollywood panels.

2225
02:27:55,684 --> 02:28:00,268
[SPEAKER_05]: When I heard there was a Sarah Silverman show panel at Comic-Con, I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with comics?

2226
02:28:00,388 --> 02:28:00,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

2227
02:28:01,749 --> 02:28:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: We read comic books, so we should have a panel.

2228
02:28:04,191 --> 02:28:05,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2229
02:28:05,072 --> 02:28:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Comic-Con has long since been perverted away from comics.

2230
02:28:08,235 --> 02:28:08,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.

2231
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:09,476
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's okay.

2232
02:28:09,516 --> 02:28:11,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We like gaming, so that's pretty cool.

2233
02:28:13,659 --> 02:28:24,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to point out, guys, as well, since we are kind of getting used to this whole new Skype setup, they can't hear the Skype calls on Justin.TV, and that's just one of the downsides to the way things are wired now and having the better sound quality.

2234
02:28:24,162 --> 02:28:29,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So sadly, if you want to hear both ends of the call, you have to be tuned in to All Games Radio where we're tuning in live.

2235
02:28:29,584 --> 02:28:29,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

2236
02:28:29,984 --> 02:28:33,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see if we can fix that in the future, but can't do it right now while we're on a call.

2237
02:28:34,245 --> 02:28:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us about the types.

2238
02:28:35,545 --> 02:28:37,206
[SPEAKER_05]: What games did you guys get out there and actually play?

2239
02:28:38,114 --> 02:28:43,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there were, actually, you know, to tell you the truth, it was very, very easy to play a lot of the games.

2240
02:28:43,416 --> 02:28:48,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I was surprised because, you know, I went there on Saturday where it was a busy, busy day where everyone was there.

2241
02:28:49,898 --> 02:29:01,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I actually, you know, I had to wait about like 15 minutes probably per game to hit up a game, but, you know, I could spend the entire call talking about every single game there, but I'll just talk about three.

2242
02:29:02,083 --> 02:29:02,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2243
02:29:03,504 --> 02:29:06,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The three that I got a chance to play were

2244
02:29:07,455 --> 02:29:10,157
[SPEAKER_08]: MadWorld, which is coming out for the Wii.

2245
02:29:12,319 --> 02:29:17,443
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone hasn't seen it, it's kind of like if Sin City was a Wii game.

2246
02:29:18,804 --> 02:29:19,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2247
02:29:20,346 --> 02:29:23,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a nice departure from Wii Mageddon, which has been talked about earlier.

2248
02:29:24,289 --> 02:29:25,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about this game before.

2249
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:26,070
[SPEAKER_05]: MadWorld, Dan?

2250
02:29:26,211 --> 02:29:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: MadWorld.

2251
02:29:26,671 --> 02:29:28,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to check it out last September.

2252
02:29:28,913 --> 02:29:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty hardcore for a Wii game.

2253
02:29:33,601 --> 02:29:37,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of got a Killer7 vibe, if anyone's checked out Killer7.

2254
02:29:37,765 --> 02:29:39,907
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's hyper-violent.

2255
02:29:40,087 --> 02:29:44,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all black and white except for when you're laying out some carnage and then you get a lot of blood.

2256
02:29:45,852 --> 02:29:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely one of the coolest titles for the Wii.

2257
02:29:47,973 --> 02:29:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think, Matt?

2258
02:29:50,876 --> 02:29:51,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was great.

2259
02:29:51,637 --> 02:29:56,361
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the first... They had a challenge in the game where...

2260
02:29:57,836 --> 02:30:25,420
[SPEAKER_08]: you basically have to shove guys into a pit and every couple minutes a giant thing just drops down and crushes everything in the pit so it was funny like every single time you throw a guy in they get crushed like a pool of blood slowly fills up and more guys you throw in there they start drowning in the blood it's a pretty brutal game you know it might get me to buy a Wii game interesting alright that's a pretty hearty endorsement what else did you check out?

2261
02:30:26,716 --> 02:30:33,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Another game which I think Loki would be interested in is Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS.

2262
02:30:34,224 --> 02:30:35,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard this was out on the floor.

2263
02:30:35,726 --> 02:30:36,306
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

2264
02:30:38,328 --> 02:30:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: When I originally heard they were going to make a Grand Theft Auto DS game, I was kind of skeptical, but

2265
02:30:45,436 --> 02:30:46,696
[SPEAKER_08]: One, I got a chance to play it.

2266
02:30:46,736 --> 02:30:50,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to admit, it's a pretty good game.

2267
02:30:51,097 --> 02:30:58,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of goes back to the old top-down GTAs, like GTA 2.

2268
02:30:59,059 --> 02:31:03,460
[SPEAKER_08]: The animation is very smooth and everything.

2269
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a lot of cute gimmicks in it.

2270
02:31:07,481 --> 02:31:12,482
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're calling for a cab, you basically whistle into the DS for the cab.

2271
02:31:14,463 --> 02:31:43,961
[SPEAKER_06]: it's got a lot of cool things like that is there any special thing for like when you want to like get the hooker to blow you in the shooter you gotta like hold some money up in front of it and crinkle the dollars together seriously though if you want to see what Grand Theft Auto is going to look like when it's like on Nintendo 64 there you go Chinatown Wars baby they got a little thing in there where it's like Dope Wars if you kind of remember that from old handheld calculators and all that

2272
02:31:44,913 --> 02:31:46,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope Wars was awesome.

2273
02:31:49,177 --> 02:31:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, anything you want to say about the Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?

2274
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:54,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm planning on playing it.

2275
02:31:54,802 --> 02:31:55,502
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the third game?

2276
02:31:56,844 --> 02:32:02,669
[SPEAKER_08]: The third game, which I consider was the best game there, was the Ghostbusters game.

2277
02:32:04,390 --> 02:32:05,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard some good things about this.

2278
02:32:05,751 --> 02:32:07,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us a little bit about the Ghostbusters game.

2279
02:32:07,213 --> 02:32:07,593
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it like?

2280
02:32:08,732 --> 02:32:13,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what they had, well, you know, it's kind of like what everyone seems to think it is.

2281
02:32:13,536 --> 02:32:17,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks, it feels like Gears of War, but with Ghostbusters.

2282
02:32:18,239 --> 02:32:19,520
[SPEAKER_06]: What version did they have there?

2283
02:32:20,882 --> 02:32:21,802
[SPEAKER_08]: They had every single version.

2284
02:32:21,822 --> 02:32:24,825
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the PS3, the 360, and the Wii version.

2285
02:32:24,845 --> 02:32:27,527
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii version is the only one that looks different.

2286
02:32:27,567 --> 02:32:33,291
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of, like, looks a little more cartoony than the others, but it's just as fun.

2287
02:32:33,551 --> 02:32:35,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I managed to get to play the Wii and the 360, so.

2288
02:32:38,735 --> 02:32:47,819
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I heard that the Wii was like an FPS version where you use your remote to capture ghosts and your nunchuck for movement.

2289
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:51,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the 360 version is more like a third-person shooter.

2290
02:32:53,102 --> 02:32:55,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you basically use the nunchuck to throw the trap.

2291
02:32:56,764 --> 02:32:58,925
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

2292
02:33:01,266 --> 02:33:05,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Matt, I've been letting you do all the talking, but Ranma, did you go too?

2293
02:33:05,308 --> 02:33:06,008
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you check out?

2294
02:33:07,148 --> 02:33:11,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I was mostly in the dealer's room, but I was able to check out one game.

2295
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:15,473
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a game that everybody loves, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time.

2296
02:33:15,893 --> 02:33:20,456
[SPEAKER_14]: It was there to celebrate the 25th shelliversary of the Ninja Turtles.

2297
02:33:21,072 --> 02:33:22,253
[SPEAKER_05]: The Shelliversary.

2298
02:33:23,033 --> 02:33:27,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard there was like an old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine there.

2299
02:33:27,795 --> 02:33:28,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there was.

2300
02:33:29,076 --> 02:33:32,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was crowds upon crowds for people to jump in and play.

2301
02:33:32,797 --> 02:33:42,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that sad that with like all these new games that are making their debut there, like, you know, you have what, like Jumpgate and Prototype and Mad World and WrestleMania and Conduit.

2302
02:33:42,742 --> 02:33:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: People are like lining up to play TMNT 2, the arcade game.

2303
02:33:46,783 --> 02:33:48,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Because quality persists.

2304
02:33:48,204 --> 02:33:48,604
[SPEAKER_05]: For real.

2305
02:33:48,624 --> 02:33:48,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right.

2306
02:33:48,964 --> 02:33:49,765
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an amazing game.

2307
02:33:50,998 --> 02:33:52,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be in line playing that.

2308
02:33:54,184 --> 02:33:54,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, Star Trek Online.

2309
02:34:21,665 --> 02:34:22,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Supernova 2 New York Con New Turtles

2310
02:34:42,649 --> 02:34:47,073
[SPEAKER_14]: The new Turtles game, I'm not sure if they had it on out front.

2311
02:34:47,293 --> 02:34:47,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think so.

2312
02:34:48,174 --> 02:34:49,315
[SPEAKER_14]: They just kept advertising it.

2313
02:34:49,415 --> 02:34:52,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know it's pretty much from the people that did on Smash Bros.

2314
02:34:52,478 --> 02:34:55,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Bro, so I think this is going to be a good title that they're working on.

2315
02:34:55,901 --> 02:34:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see.

2316
02:34:56,461 --> 02:34:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little skeptical because some of the Teenage Mutant Turtles games are kind of ass, but we'll see.

2317
02:35:00,005 --> 02:35:01,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody see Hawks?

2318
02:35:02,327 --> 02:35:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on display.

2319
02:35:02,967 --> 02:35:03,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got to play Hawks.

2320
02:35:04,188 --> 02:35:06,110
[SPEAKER_08]: How was it?

2321
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:09,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a very polished Ace Combat.

2322
02:35:09,233 --> 02:35:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

2323
02:35:11,169 --> 02:35:12,610
[SPEAKER_08]: and yeah, it's a lot of fun.

2324
02:35:12,851 --> 02:35:14,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I like shooting things with jets.

2325
02:35:14,972 --> 02:35:18,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so really quickly guys, then we're going to let you go because we've got to get some more calls because we're kind of running long tonight.

2326
02:35:19,176 --> 02:35:21,438
[SPEAKER_05]: But best thing you saw at Comic-Con.

2327
02:35:22,199 --> 02:35:22,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt.

2328
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:29,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Aside from the Ghostbusters game, this new game called Prototype, which is coming out for the 360 and

2329
02:35:32,684 --> 02:36:00,494
[SPEAKER_08]: it's everything what Spider-Man Web of Shadows should have been it's just really brutal and free roam New York City mutant thing, it's really great alright, and Ranma, best thing it has to be a tie number one, the Ninja Turtles arcade machine and number two, the attempt at breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest amount of video game cosplayers in one setting did you break it?

2330
02:36:01,804 --> 02:36:02,024
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2331
02:36:02,244 --> 02:36:02,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The record was 342.

2332
02:36:02,785 --> 02:36:05,406
[SPEAKER_14]: There was 90 of us.

2333
02:36:06,947 --> 02:36:07,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

2334
02:36:07,247 --> 02:36:07,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter 4 there?

2335
02:36:07,867 --> 02:36:08,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe next year.

2336
02:36:09,288 --> 02:36:10,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose I think it was.

2337
02:36:10,969 --> 02:36:11,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2338
02:36:12,009 --> 02:36:12,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it.

2339
02:36:12,570 --> 02:36:14,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't your favorite?

2340
02:36:15,251 --> 02:36:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?

2341
02:36:16,251 --> 02:36:18,252
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saying Street Fighter 4 was there and it wasn't your favorite?

2342
02:36:19,653 --> 02:36:19,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2343
02:36:20,253 --> 02:36:21,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I didn't see it there.

2344
02:36:22,315 --> 02:36:22,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Runtime.

2345
02:36:23,495 --> 02:36:23,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2346
02:36:23,875 --> 02:36:24,936
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do that at Fonamay.

2347
02:36:26,981 --> 02:36:31,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to talk to him and see if we can get that done because that title's got to come back to the US.

2348
02:36:32,482 --> 02:36:33,603
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do this in front of me.

2349
02:36:34,703 --> 02:36:35,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Break the records.

2350
02:36:35,723 --> 02:36:41,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I go, if you see pictures of us at the video game shoot, you'll be seeing me in the background holding up a giant Super NES.

2351
02:36:42,965 --> 02:36:43,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2352
02:36:44,745 --> 02:36:46,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, two quick last things.

2353
02:36:46,346 --> 02:36:48,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm posting pictures in the chat regularly.

2354
02:36:48,886 --> 02:36:49,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2355
02:36:50,467 --> 02:36:52,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, one very last thing.

2356
02:36:52,627 --> 02:36:55,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Expect a care package of swag.

2357
02:36:56,070 --> 02:36:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you guys are the best.

2358
02:36:59,132 --> 02:37:00,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fans.

2359
02:37:00,533 --> 02:37:02,655
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even have to go to these events and we get goodies.

2360
02:37:02,955 --> 02:37:03,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

2361
02:37:03,535 --> 02:37:04,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much.

2362
02:37:05,236 --> 02:37:05,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a problem.

2363
02:37:05,797 --> 02:37:06,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, kids.

2364
02:37:06,717 --> 02:37:07,078
[SPEAKER_05]: See you later.

2365
02:37:07,238 --> 02:37:08,539
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2366
02:37:08,979 --> 02:37:14,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of our fans doing nice stuff for us, I would like to personally thank IkumaJP for the box of puka.

2367
02:37:15,023 --> 02:37:19,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I do still have some of the nom-noms in the house if you guys want some of the nom-noms.

2368
02:37:19,126 --> 02:37:20,086
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to go to the phones.

2369
02:37:20,126 --> 02:37:21,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2370
02:37:21,027 --> 02:37:21,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2371
02:37:22,608 --> 02:37:24,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

2372
02:37:24,269 --> 02:37:25,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2373
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:27,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Two quick questions.

2374
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:39,685
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Xbox 360, do you know if there's a hard drive available that's bigger than 120 gigs?

2375
02:37:40,705 --> 02:37:41,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

2376
02:37:41,726 --> 02:37:42,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of time, though.

2377
02:37:45,967 --> 02:37:51,530
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask is because I hate to see it, but my hard drive is running out of space as it is.

2378
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:51,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Also,

2379
02:37:54,867 --> 02:38:05,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, can you think of any retro games that you would like to see released for any one of those three systems, or are you pretty much all set?

2380
02:38:05,729 --> 02:38:08,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, run that by me one more time?

2381
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:20,812
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while retro games are kind of big, and they're constantly getting released for all three of those systems, whether it be Wii, Virtual Console, the PlayStation 3, or...

2382
02:38:22,466 --> 02:38:24,027
[SPEAKER_00]: and XBLA.

2383
02:38:24,147 --> 02:38:30,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you think of any game that you would like to see released for Y03 or are you pretty much all set?

2384
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:32,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 10.

2385
02:38:33,391 --> 02:38:35,131
[SPEAKER_06]: What, that will be released or that was released?

2386
02:38:37,352 --> 02:38:39,613
[SPEAKER_06]: You would like to see released.

2387
02:38:40,674 --> 02:38:42,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 10 at some point would be awesome.

2388
02:38:42,274 --> 02:38:46,476
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as they stay with the Mega Man 9 series and do a Mega Man 10, that'd be great.

2389
02:38:46,676 --> 02:38:51,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man 9 was awesome for all three systems but of course was the best on the Wii because it was just the most...

2390
02:38:52,261 --> 02:38:55,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Authentic, retro, like new retro experience.

2391
02:38:57,208 --> 02:39:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that, I mean, I'm not surprised, but Bionic Commando Rearmed would be really nice on the Wii, you know, if they decided to do it.

2392
02:39:07,016 --> 02:39:24,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think the game that needs to be remade that was out before its time and I mean I know that I hate this game and I hate the fanboys for it you know like although I approve of fanboyism and go for it love what you love I really think that the game that needs a remake needs it for anything powerful enough to run it is Final Fantasy 7

2393
02:39:25,836 --> 02:39:26,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I definitely agree with you.

2394
02:39:26,776 --> 02:39:28,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to see a remake of VII, you know, because...

2395
02:39:51,954 --> 02:39:53,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love that game.

2396
02:39:53,135 --> 02:39:56,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have my copy of it anymore.

2397
02:39:56,578 --> 02:40:00,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if they ever do release the game again, you know.

2398
02:40:00,661 --> 02:40:02,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it for anything but the DS.

2399
02:40:03,143 --> 02:40:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because the DS would just basically be able to do it as it originally was.

2400
02:40:09,008 --> 02:40:10,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for taking my call.

2401
02:40:11,169 --> 02:40:12,290
[SPEAKER_05]: You are welcome.

2402
02:40:13,891 --> 02:40:14,512
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good one.

2403
02:40:14,692 --> 02:40:15,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Spazinator.

2404
02:40:15,453 --> 02:40:15,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2405
02:40:17,335 --> 02:40:20,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Final Fantasy 7 would fit on Xbox Live Arcade.

2406
02:40:20,297 --> 02:40:22,438
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only problem I see going on with that.

2407
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:23,038
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

2408
02:40:23,179 --> 02:40:23,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2409
02:40:23,459 --> 02:40:26,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know if they wanted to make it, Microsoft wouldn't make an exception.

2410
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:26,701
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2411
02:40:26,781 --> 02:40:27,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we got another call.

2412
02:40:27,921 --> 02:40:30,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, this is DSMaster25.

2413
02:40:30,943 --> 02:40:31,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's on your mind?

2414
02:40:33,665 --> 02:40:34,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Not much.

2415
02:40:34,786 --> 02:40:38,268
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a PSP 2000, but it's kind of fluky on me.

2416
02:40:38,328 --> 02:40:39,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I buy it used.

2417
02:40:40,669 --> 02:40:46,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I find this ironic because your name is DSMaster yet I'm looking at your logo on Skype and your call is about a PSP.

2418
02:40:47,438 --> 02:40:48,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Please explain.

2419
02:40:49,619 --> 02:40:53,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I was desperate for one because I wanted Skype and everything.

2420
02:40:54,441 --> 02:40:56,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I figured, why not buy a PSP?

2421
02:40:56,842 --> 02:40:58,443
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically I did.

2422
02:40:59,143 --> 02:41:00,783
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanted what game?

2423
02:41:01,464 --> 02:41:03,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to use Skype, reportedly.

2424
02:41:04,545 --> 02:41:09,907
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Skype zones were not in America, so the only other option was a PSP.

2425
02:41:11,688 --> 02:41:12,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2426
02:41:12,628 --> 02:41:12,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2427
02:41:12,989 --> 02:41:16,490
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically, I bought one used.

2428
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:26,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have this crack in my screen, and now my start button, my select button, my home button, all that doesn't work.

2429
02:41:26,982 --> 02:41:28,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like you have a broken PSP.

2430
02:41:29,703 --> 02:41:32,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend replacing it with a new working one.

2431
02:41:32,563 --> 02:41:37,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Preferably a 3000 series, because if you want to use Skype... He said he bought it used.

2432
02:41:37,725 --> 02:41:38,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious.

2433
02:41:38,325 --> 02:41:39,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you buy it used at GameStop?

2434
02:41:39,685 --> 02:41:39,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2435
02:41:39,925 --> 02:41:40,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Sad trombone.

2436
02:41:48,769 --> 02:41:53,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, did you buy it like that, or did you buy it nice and you've made it like that?

2437
02:41:54,572 --> 02:41:56,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you bought it like that, take that puppy back.

2438
02:41:57,293 --> 02:41:59,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully you were smart enough to buy the extended service on it.

2439
02:42:01,936 --> 02:42:07,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I was dead broke by the time I bought the PSP, so I didn't have any money to buy the extended service.

2440
02:42:07,879 --> 02:42:09,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I was pretty much screwed.

2441
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:11,741
[SPEAKER_12]: What was wrong with the PSP now?

2442
02:42:11,761 --> 02:42:13,422
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just a sad trombone call.

2443
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:18,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the home button.

2444
02:42:25,001 --> 02:42:33,428
[SPEAKER_15]: The volume buttons The screen brightness I'll repeat what I said Do they not test these things?

2445
02:42:33,528 --> 02:42:45,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do they not notice Scratch on the screen Or a big crack on the screen I mean, because I know when you have to go trade stuff in There's like, does this shit work?

2446
02:42:45,578 --> 02:42:53,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and here's the deal You're about to get an education As to the inside workings of used game stores They get ranked

2447
02:42:55,226 --> 02:42:58,109
[SPEAKER_06]: On how much they get traded in.

2448
02:42:58,229 --> 02:43:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of times they'll let crap slide.

2449
02:43:00,772 --> 02:43:02,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they get ranked on selling you stuff.

2450
02:43:03,214 --> 02:43:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to try to foist it on you.

2451
02:43:06,397 --> 02:43:11,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there are game stores like mine where if you bring me a system, man, I'm looking for a reason to say no.

2452
02:43:11,042 --> 02:43:12,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm a jerk.

2453
02:43:13,298 --> 02:43:14,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2454
02:43:34,588 --> 02:43:35,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

2455
02:43:57,165 --> 02:43:57,546
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

2456
02:44:18,194 --> 02:44:21,937
[SPEAKER_06]: and then maybe they'll get some good people in there and you can have another good game store.

2457
02:44:22,738 --> 02:44:27,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Dawn Strider does not actually endorse this thing.

2458
02:44:27,142 --> 02:44:29,564
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not endorse it officially but you know they're all down with it.

2459
02:44:30,385 --> 02:44:31,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm down with it.

2460
02:44:33,308 --> 02:44:39,934
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you're telling me is basically go back in there because my 30 day guarantee is already passed.

2461
02:44:40,493 --> 02:44:42,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I bought this on December 22nd.

2462
02:44:43,656 --> 02:44:46,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you know, the buttons and stuff not working?

2463
02:44:46,558 --> 02:44:49,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, which buttons are not working on there?

2464
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:57,367
[SPEAKER_15]: The home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and the sound equalizer.

2465
02:44:57,787 --> 02:44:59,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

2466
02:44:59,869 --> 02:45:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop, stop, you guys.

2467
02:45:01,250 --> 02:45:03,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so basically all the buttons on that bottom row, right?

2468
02:45:03,792 --> 02:45:06,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, except for start.

2469
02:45:06,094 --> 02:45:07,375
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the only one that works.

2470
02:45:08,317 --> 02:45:08,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2471
02:45:29,528 --> 02:45:34,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you chopped it game crazy, we give you a 90-day guarantee without you even paying any extra money.

2472
02:45:35,134 --> 02:45:35,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, nice.

2473
02:45:35,995 --> 02:45:36,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the thing.

2474
02:45:36,776 --> 02:45:37,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Plug, plug, plug.

2475
02:45:37,858 --> 02:45:39,660
[SPEAKER_05]: For what it's worth, your call sounds great.

2476
02:45:40,936 --> 02:45:42,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be funny with the PSP system.

2477
02:45:43,979 --> 02:45:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you could do one on them where you buy a new system and swap it for the broken one.

2478
02:45:51,066 --> 02:45:52,467
[SPEAKER_06]: You sold me a busted system.

2479
02:45:52,607 --> 02:45:58,393
[SPEAKER_06]: They're serial numbered, but I mean, you know, if you want to try a fast one that's on you, I can't tell you to do that or not tell you to do that.

2480
02:45:58,413 --> 02:46:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up to your quality of being a human being.

2481
02:46:02,096 --> 02:46:05,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But, oh, hey, I won't say I've never done anything like that.

2482
02:46:06,727 --> 02:46:10,616
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm going to wait until I get money and then I'm going to buy a 3000.

2483
02:46:13,435 --> 02:46:13,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Go back.

2484
02:46:13,995 --> 02:46:16,356
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'll use this one for emulators.

2485
02:46:16,736 --> 02:46:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good idea.

2486
02:46:18,636 --> 02:46:29,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the advice, too, would just be, you know what, go in, anyone else that finds themselves in this situation, go in, be nice about it, don't be a dick, because no manager is going to want to do favors for you if you're a dick.

2487
02:46:29,638 --> 02:46:32,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in, be nice about it, and see if they'll do a favor for you.

2488
02:46:32,758 --> 02:46:34,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not, run them over with your car.

2489
02:46:34,419 --> 02:46:35,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But your other idea was great.

2490
02:46:35,879 --> 02:46:38,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if, like Loki says, there's a ribbon cable in there.

2491
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:40,140
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like taking crap apart...

2492
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:45,144
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're out of warranty and can't get any help, take that puppy apart.

2493
02:46:45,465 --> 02:46:46,906
[SPEAKER_06]: PSPs are awesome inside.

2494
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:49,690
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with them.

2495
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You can like blow up their batteries and like lose pieces, change the color of the buttons.

2496
02:46:54,635 --> 02:46:56,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just turn them into lasers.

2497
02:46:56,858 --> 02:46:57,619
Yeah.

2498
02:46:58,596 --> 02:46:59,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

2499
02:47:19,048 --> 02:47:23,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the issue, because all of a sudden the buttons won't just die, it's the ribbon cable.

2500
02:47:24,151 --> 02:47:26,853
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the janky things about used PSPs you gotta watch out for.

2501
02:47:26,893 --> 02:47:33,138
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but basically what happened was, I bought it and all the bottom row buttons were working just fine.

2502
02:47:33,918 --> 02:47:39,081
[SPEAKER_15]: And then a month or so after, I was listening to you guys in the shower, okay?

2503
02:47:39,342 --> 02:47:40,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, so now it's our fault.

2504
02:47:43,597 --> 02:48:08,708
[SPEAKER_15]: basically I'm trying to change the volume and I'm reaching through the shower curtain and I think I might drop some water but I don't know okay now wait a minute now this is all on you buddy you broke your PSP okay keep this one for you in the shower and keep it away from the water I'm just curious is this an OLM verse that you've been listening to in the shower I'm just curious

2505
02:48:10,419 --> 02:48:16,345
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do want to use it in the shower, they do sell waterproof cases you can put on the PSP.

2506
02:48:16,545 --> 02:48:20,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DSMaster, we gotta let you go to get some more calls.

2507
02:48:20,188 --> 02:48:21,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, if that's your thing.

2508
02:48:21,329 --> 02:48:22,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you all soapy?

2509
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:29,897
[SPEAKER_05]: DSMaster, good luck to you.

2510
02:48:30,498 --> 02:48:34,001
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do get a new PSP, keep it out of the bathtub.

2511
02:48:34,693 --> 02:48:41,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, by the way, the only reason why I bought this one was because I was speculating about the scan lines on the 3000 model.

2512
02:48:41,515 --> 02:48:43,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I figured it's not so dangerous.

2513
02:48:43,436 --> 02:48:44,816
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all the same, it just has a lock.

2514
02:48:45,676 --> 02:48:46,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2515
02:48:46,737 --> 02:48:50,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck, PSP, DS Master, whoever you are, and have a good one, okay?

2516
02:48:50,938 --> 02:48:52,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, bye.

2517
02:48:53,018 --> 02:48:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2518
02:48:53,559 --> 02:48:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that guy's ever called in before.

2519
02:48:54,999 --> 02:48:57,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have been a first-time caller, so that was a good call.

2520
02:48:58,460 --> 02:48:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the...

2521
02:49:02,848 --> 02:49:03,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good times.

2522
02:49:04,009 --> 02:49:06,630
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to do at least one more call here and then wrap up the show.

2523
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:08,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2524
02:49:08,331 --> 02:49:08,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2525
02:49:09,552 --> 02:49:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Deathwishing.

2526
02:49:10,593 --> 02:49:12,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hi, Deathwishing.

2527
02:49:12,874 --> 02:49:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a first-time caller too, aren't you?

2528
02:49:14,795 --> 02:49:15,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2529
02:49:16,476 --> 02:49:16,956
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2530
02:49:18,897 --> 02:49:24,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of disappointed with a lot of stuff I see in this year for gaming.

2531
02:49:25,501 --> 02:49:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: In this year of gaming?

2532
02:49:26,642 --> 02:49:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2009 in gaming?

2533
02:49:28,283 --> 02:49:28,723
[SPEAKER_05]: How so?

2534
02:49:28,823 --> 02:49:30,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because it seems like there's nothing to look forward to?

2535
02:49:30,644 --> 02:49:31,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it just started, but like...

2536
02:49:32,921 --> 02:49:35,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't know, this summer seems a lot more droughted.

2537
02:49:35,643 --> 02:49:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can already tell this summer's going to be a major drought for gaming.

2538
02:49:38,825 --> 02:49:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it might be that everybody's trying to keep it in their pants until E3?

2539
02:49:42,088 --> 02:49:49,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of one thing I've been trying to tell myself, as much as I might be lying to myself, is that maybe people are trying to keep it in their pants until E3.

2540
02:49:49,754 --> 02:49:53,877
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta remember, games and game developers are like plants.

2541
02:49:55,218 --> 02:49:56,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And their water is money.

2542
02:49:57,079 --> 02:49:58,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no money out there right now.

2543
02:49:59,161 --> 02:50:00,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So, things are quiet.

2544
02:50:00,822 --> 02:50:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

2545
02:50:03,032 --> 02:50:06,153
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta actually think, this summer there's not gonna be crap anyway.

2546
02:50:07,414 --> 02:50:21,979
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta look towards the fourth quarter and, you know, they're not gonna be making announcements about the fourth quarter until mid-spring when they've gotten through the Street Fighter 4 and the Resident Evils and the Killzone 2s because we got some... I mean, if you actually think about it, this is a great spring for games.

2547
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:24,140
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some just...

2548
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:27,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, AAA titles for every system.

2549
02:50:28,281 --> 02:50:31,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo had a great Christmas, at least in the States, with the Wii.

2550
02:50:31,222 --> 02:50:33,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're having a lot of trouble in Japan.

2551
02:50:34,923 --> 02:50:43,225
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, I think that, you know, if you look at a lot of the release lists and whatnot, there's a lot of cool stuff coming out for everybody.

2552
02:50:43,866 --> 02:50:44,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Skip the summer.

2553
02:50:44,986 --> 02:50:48,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a big title or two, but I mean, it's not going to blow any wind up your skirt.

2554
02:50:48,687 --> 02:50:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just start.

2555
02:50:51,148 --> 02:50:51,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

2556
02:50:52,088 --> 02:50:53,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Look to the fourth quarter, man.

2557
02:50:54,028 --> 02:50:55,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where all the big games are.

2558
02:50:55,369 --> 02:50:59,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan does have a point because our economy is in such shit right now in the U.S.

2559
02:50:59,909 --> 02:51:00,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're calling for the U.S.

2560
02:51:00,910 --> 02:51:11,792
[SPEAKER_05]: or wherever, but the thing is that it seems like on this show, week after week after week, we've been reporting this studio has closed, this studio has closed, this studio has closed.

2561
02:51:12,072 --> 02:51:15,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So, damn, we're kind of lucky to be getting any games at all at this point.

2562
02:51:15,132 --> 02:51:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I do kind of agree.

2563
02:51:17,053 --> 02:51:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that same frustration as it's like, you know,

2564
02:51:19,733 --> 02:51:20,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2565
02:51:44,413 --> 02:51:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamers get spoiled.

2566
02:51:45,493 --> 02:51:47,635
[SPEAKER_05]: They expect big releases every month.

2567
02:51:47,695 --> 02:51:50,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe because Hollywood spoils us.

2568
02:51:50,597 --> 02:51:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big movie every week.

2569
02:51:52,239 --> 02:51:56,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't get me started on movie chains.

2570
02:51:56,602 --> 02:52:01,305
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not in the first two years of any console's development cycle now.

2571
02:52:02,246 --> 02:52:05,689
[SPEAKER_06]: They've all proven what they have to prove, except for Sony.

2572
02:52:05,709 --> 02:52:06,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Sony's lineup.

2573
02:52:09,952 --> 02:52:11,294
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2574
02:52:25,137 --> 02:52:26,178
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

2575
02:52:49,933 --> 02:52:50,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2576
02:53:09,196 --> 02:53:11,799
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's Ryu and Ken and one's Hadouken and one's Hadouken.

2577
02:53:11,819 --> 02:53:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a Hadouken.

2578
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take off a third of your life.

2579
02:53:15,403 --> 02:53:18,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Tyson takes off all your life with one punch.

2580
02:53:19,388 --> 02:53:23,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't dodge all those punches, you can't even block them.

2581
02:53:23,913 --> 02:53:24,874
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes Shang Long look like a sissy.

2582
02:53:27,617 --> 02:53:28,297
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we have now?

2583
02:53:28,337 --> 02:53:30,057
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Obama with the veto uppercut.

2584
02:53:31,298 --> 02:53:35,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I fought Akuma last night in HD Remix, and I got beat uncontrollably hard.

2585
02:53:35,859 --> 02:53:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least I could hit him.

2586
02:53:37,199 --> 02:53:38,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Tyson, punch out.

2587
02:53:38,539 --> 02:53:39,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Your ass is grass.

2588
02:53:39,959 --> 02:53:43,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Put in 007-373-5963 in the password.

2589
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:44,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Fight Mike Tyson.

2590
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:48,001
[SPEAKER_06]: If you beat him, then I'm going to give you your props.

2591
02:53:48,981 --> 02:53:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2592
02:53:49,441 --> 02:53:53,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, let me ask this as well real quick for what it's worth.

2593
02:53:54,002 --> 02:53:54,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a 360 owner?

2594
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:56,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do own a 360.

2595
02:53:57,021 --> 02:54:00,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it still work?

2596
02:54:00,463 --> 02:54:04,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, honestly, I'm on my second 360 and I had it from release.

2597
02:54:05,796 --> 02:54:06,817
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2598
02:54:27,973 --> 02:54:54,011
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know when you consider that in the retail world you know we get poop as well like Fusion Frenzy and that fucking Crosswords game that I played this week it was god awful you know you get a lot of that stuff there's some pretty cool stuff that comes out too so if you're feeling like damn I need a fix of something new check out the community games you might not see anything that's going to blow you away but you might see something that you know a neat concept for a game that keeps you entertained for a little while which is you know what a game should do and when you consider those those community games are dirt cheap

2599
02:54:55,468 --> 02:55:23,509
[SPEAKER_06]: it's something and look past the big franchises Bionic Commando which is coming out in a couple months a month or so looks great Mad World which we talked about a few minutes ago is mind blowing Halo Wars is actually pretty fun you know there's a lot of stuff coming up this year but maybe it's not Devil May Cry 5 maybe it's not Halo 4 just you know let that stuff let that stuff lay for a while you know they're going to rehash it they're going to spit it at us there's going to be a marketing blitz

2600
02:55:24,009 --> 02:55:50,194
[SPEAKER_06]: there's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 and 6 and 8 and 10 but here's your chance to branch out try some new games just because they're not beating you down with another AAA title doesn't mean there aren't super high quality games by great developers who still have jobs, knock on wood and we'll be blowing you out of the water and like I said, look to the fourth quarter because there are big names announced especially if you don't have a Sony God of War is going to be blamed a little bit better

2601
02:55:55,557 --> 02:56:00,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to close out the show but thanks a bunch and thanks for tuning in tonight we appreciate it love you

2602
02:56:03,212 --> 02:56:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

2603
02:56:04,613 --> 02:56:05,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you too.

2604
02:56:05,453 --> 02:56:06,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you too.

2605
02:56:06,654 --> 02:56:06,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2606
02:56:06,954 --> 02:56:09,155
[SPEAKER_09]: We have last minute stories.

2607
02:56:09,615 --> 02:56:09,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

2608
02:56:10,215 --> 02:56:11,156
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have some last minute stories.

2609
02:56:11,176 --> 02:56:12,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to make an outbound call real quick.

2610
02:56:12,836 --> 02:56:13,577
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an important one.

2611
02:56:13,597 --> 02:56:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: We do want to do one more call.

2612
02:56:14,737 --> 02:56:16,678
[SPEAKER_05]: This is outbound because this is important.

2613
02:56:16,698 --> 02:56:24,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get this person on the show and unfortunately the way our Skype is set up, we have not been able to get like incoming, we just get bombarded with everybody which we love.

2614
02:56:25,081 --> 02:56:30,144
[SPEAKER_05]: We love the fact that so many people are trying to get through but there is somebody we wanted to talk to that couldn't get through and we want to talk to him now.

2615
02:56:30,224 --> 02:56:30,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Deke, are you there?

2616
02:56:31,889 --> 02:56:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm here.

2617
02:56:32,249 --> 02:56:32,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you guys hear me?

2618
02:56:32,870 --> 02:56:33,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not bad.

2619
02:56:33,370 --> 02:56:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Tired.

2620
02:56:33,671 --> 02:56:33,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1030 here.

2621
02:56:52,547 --> 02:57:17,894
[SPEAKER_05]: so far yeah I've only heard maybe one little thing wrong with it and I'm pretty sure that's got to do with the database move from the old website forums to the new one and so that should be pretty easy to take care of I was honestly thinking in the back of my mind that the site would have to be reset like I was like okay we'll just have to start over with forums you know our news will probably have to start from square one and I was like ready to accept that and then when I looked at the new site today I was like holy crap he got everything migrated from the old site that was pretty impressive so props to you

2622
02:57:18,766 --> 02:57:19,467
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2623
02:57:35,410 --> 02:57:36,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm going to keep track of that.

2624
02:58:03,456 --> 02:58:04,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure nobody kind of abuses it.

2625
02:58:04,798 --> 02:58:06,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see cocks popping up all over the place.

2626
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:07,321
[SPEAKER_05]: No cock shots!

2627
02:58:08,061 --> 02:58:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura on break took a picture of me eating jelly beans just randomly and uploaded them to the thing.

2628
02:58:13,528 --> 02:58:14,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So what should I hold up?

2629
02:58:14,689 --> 02:58:15,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how about cookies?

2630
02:58:15,710 --> 02:58:19,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hold up cookies for this and we'll send it right to the website right now.

2631
02:58:20,636 --> 02:58:23,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I just posted one of myself posing next to the website a couple of minutes ago.

2632
02:58:24,640 --> 02:58:24,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2633
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:25,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

2634
02:58:25,841 --> 02:58:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

2635
02:58:26,621 --> 02:58:32,343
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very excited about it and we hope to have it launched maybe next weekend even or something.

2636
02:58:32,403 --> 02:58:37,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as soon as we get some of our new authors on board because I know Tiara's getting ready to write some game reviews for us.

2637
02:58:37,925 --> 02:58:40,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited and we're going to have regular content again.

2638
02:58:40,886 --> 02:58:42,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just tinkle.

2639
02:58:42,567 --> 02:58:43,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited.

2640
02:58:44,988 --> 02:58:45,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in here.

2641
02:58:46,268 --> 02:58:52,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Deke, thank you so much and please send our thanks along to your family as well who I know have had to put up with you working on the site.

2642
02:58:52,931 --> 02:58:53,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

2643
02:58:54,680 --> 02:58:55,000
[SPEAKER_05]: No worries.

2644
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:55,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, guys.

2645
02:59:24,454 --> 02:59:25,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's going to do it.

2646
02:59:25,895 --> 02:59:27,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to wrap up the show.

2647
02:59:27,315 --> 02:59:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype.

2648
02:59:28,796 --> 02:59:33,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of you were getting through, but I also was very happy to hear some new callers get through tonight.

2649
02:59:33,518 --> 02:59:35,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty awesome, so thanks and shout out.

2650
02:59:35,499 --> 02:59:39,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to the guy who ate up all the time because his system was broken because he was using it in the shower.

2651
02:59:39,281 --> 02:59:39,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Well done!

2652
02:59:42,282 --> 02:59:46,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Justin TV things actually kind of helped us get some new listeners, so I'm really excited to get back on there.

2653
02:59:47,425 --> 02:59:53,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think watching a radio show is that exciting, but we'll see what we can do about the TV in the future.

2654
02:59:53,508 --> 02:59:55,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll get a Switch box and actually play games.

2655
02:59:55,809 --> 02:59:56,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what we can do.

2656
02:59:56,509 --> 02:59:58,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure something out.

2657
02:59:59,171 --> 03:00:03,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fix it so the audio, you can hear everything next time.

2658
03:00:03,333 --> 03:00:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy.

2659
03:00:04,113 --> 03:00:10,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Just splitter out your speaker out and then into the... They don't want to hear about the wires.

2660
03:00:10,456 --> 03:00:10,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll make you

2661
03:00:11,857 --> 03:00:12,398
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2662
03:00:28,456 --> 03:00:31,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, but anyway, that's for another time.

2663
03:00:31,478 --> 03:00:33,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2664
03:00:33,379 --> 03:00:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a three-hour show this week, but that's all right.

2665
03:00:35,720 --> 03:00:38,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I first off want to say, Matt, too, thank you so much for being here.

2666
03:00:38,961 --> 03:00:40,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry you didn't get to say more tonight.

2667
03:00:40,762 --> 03:00:40,982
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2668
03:00:41,002 --> 03:00:42,823
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll talk more about PC games in a future week.

2669
03:00:42,843 --> 03:00:44,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You will come back and join us again, correct?

2670
03:00:44,364 --> 03:00:45,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Dan's fault, yes.

2671
03:00:45,304 --> 03:00:45,705
[SPEAKER_07]: No, yes.

2672
03:00:46,325 --> 03:00:47,265
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had a blast.

2673
03:00:47,285 --> 03:00:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me.

2674
03:00:48,126 --> 03:00:49,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And PC gaming is more my niche, but yeah.

2675
03:00:51,248 --> 03:00:53,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us, and we will do more PC gaming in the future.

2676
03:00:53,149 --> 03:00:55,630
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been a lot this week, and we've actually got the emails.

2677
03:00:55,650 --> 03:00:57,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you guys talk more about PC gaming?

2678
03:00:57,251 --> 03:00:59,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I was like, Matt 2 probably sent one of those emails.

2679
03:01:00,453 --> 03:01:02,195
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to come to the show a little more often.

2680
03:01:04,096 --> 03:01:11,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say, though, for the folks out there who listen, who can't join us in studio, how is it different when you're listening to it on the iPod and when you're here in studio?

2681
03:01:11,881 --> 03:01:13,802
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a great way to kill, too, to

2682
03:01:14,443 --> 03:01:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 hours of my afternoon at work, which is quite spectacular.

2683
03:01:18,274 --> 03:01:19,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality's good, easy access.

2684
03:01:21,002 --> 03:01:22,323
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it different being here live?

2685
03:01:22,443 --> 03:01:23,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, being here live?

2686
03:01:24,063 --> 03:01:27,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It's colder in the garage because my office is a balmy 72 degrees.

2687
03:01:28,765 --> 03:01:29,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely different.

2688
03:01:29,806 --> 03:01:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely a lot of wires around.

2689
03:01:32,467 --> 03:01:33,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun.

2690
03:01:33,147 --> 03:01:39,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, at times I feel like I'm a little behind the times with all the wealth of knowledge that's in here.

2691
03:01:40,510 --> 03:01:41,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the noob.

2692
03:01:41,790 --> 03:01:44,912
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we started talking about WoW updates, I felt cool again.

2693
03:01:45,812 --> 03:01:49,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Dan's pointing at me, he's about to say something profound.

2694
03:01:49,174 --> 03:01:49,814
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll work on you.

2695
03:01:49,834 --> 03:01:51,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in the world of WoW, you are the king.

2696
03:01:53,415 --> 03:01:56,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, possibly, but no, there are people that out DPS in the tank.

2697
03:01:56,937 --> 03:01:57,417
[SPEAKER_07]: In here, anyway.

2698
03:01:57,497 --> 03:01:58,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, in here?

2699
03:01:58,178 --> 03:01:59,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool, I'll take that title.

2700
03:01:59,818 --> 03:02:02,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, sometimes I hear a term in WoW, and I'm like, I know what that means!

2701
03:02:02,740 --> 03:02:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: DPS!

2702
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:03,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet!

2703
03:02:04,060 --> 03:02:08,302
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had a blast, thanks for having me, and I look forward to next shows where you'll have room for me.

2704
03:02:10,422 --> 03:02:12,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, what can I say?

2705
03:02:12,143 --> 03:02:14,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for being here and bringing your input.

2706
03:02:14,343 --> 03:02:15,823
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatters love you.

2707
03:02:16,203 --> 03:02:18,184
[SPEAKER_05]: They want you to be a regular guest on the show.

2708
03:02:18,524 --> 03:02:19,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Please come back again, Dan.

2709
03:02:19,584 --> 03:02:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a lot of fun.

2710
03:02:20,404 --> 03:02:25,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if your wife is a little pissed you keep taking her microphone, maybe we'll get two mics on the couch next time or something.

2711
03:02:25,745 --> 03:02:26,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't bet on it.

2712
03:02:26,825 --> 03:02:31,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not pissed.

2713
03:02:31,506 --> 03:02:31,826
[SPEAKER_10]: She's fine.

2714
03:02:36,843 --> 03:02:39,344
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a butt face, okay?

2715
03:02:39,684 --> 03:02:40,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

2716
03:02:41,025 --> 03:02:42,905
[SPEAKER_05]: He told her the mic was off even though it wasn't.

2717
03:02:44,666 --> 03:02:46,887
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts?

2718
03:02:47,047 --> 03:02:48,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a story.

2719
03:02:48,327 --> 03:02:48,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a story.

2720
03:02:48,727 --> 03:02:50,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even ask for last minute stories.

2721
03:02:50,248 --> 03:02:51,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm such an asshole.

2722
03:02:51,268 --> 03:02:52,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you are, Bob.

2723
03:02:52,109 --> 03:02:53,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickly, DarkSakura.

2724
03:02:53,829 --> 03:02:57,931
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a guy named Danny Johnson, 14, of Grapevine, Texas.

2725
03:02:58,011 --> 03:02:58,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

2726
03:02:59,691 --> 03:03:05,692
[SPEAKER_10]: who actually set a new world record in Guitar Hero at a Guinness World Records event in Manhattan.

2727
03:03:06,772 --> 03:03:13,694
[SPEAKER_10]: He scored 973,954 points playing Dragonforge's Through the Fire and the Flames.

2728
03:03:13,794 --> 03:03:18,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I read otherwise, he actually broke a button while doing it.

2729
03:03:19,715 --> 03:03:22,875
[SPEAKER_07]: He broke his blue button and he was mad at himself that he didn't hit 100%.

2730
03:03:22,955 --> 03:03:23,735
[SPEAKER_07]: He only hit 99%.

2731
03:03:25,656 --> 03:03:26,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll link the video in the chat room.

2732
03:03:32,133 --> 03:03:33,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

2733
03:03:33,976 --> 03:03:35,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just some real quick stuff.

2734
03:03:35,538 --> 03:03:38,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Namco's planning on rebooting the Dead to Rights franchise.

2735
03:03:39,944 --> 03:03:40,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear God, why?

2736
03:03:42,631 --> 03:03:43,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2737
03:03:44,332 --> 03:03:45,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, I guess.

2738
03:03:45,974 --> 03:03:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other stuff.

2739
03:03:48,956 --> 03:03:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently some dude threatened to blow up the Bomberman devs because he had a problem with his Bomberman game, I guess.

2740
03:03:57,982 --> 03:04:04,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It sent them 11 terrorizing emails during a four-month period before the company finally decided to do something.

2741
03:04:05,588 --> 03:04:07,930
[SPEAKER_03]: He was unhappy with the quality of Hudson products.

2742
03:04:08,190 --> 03:04:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just getting into the spirit of things.

2743
03:04:09,911 --> 03:04:10,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2744
03:04:10,792 --> 03:04:12,073
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more contribution.

2745
03:04:16,745 --> 03:04:21,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Telltale Games is bringing Wallace and Gromit to PC and Xbox Live Arcade this spring.

2746
03:04:21,128 --> 03:04:21,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about that.

2747
03:04:21,668 --> 03:04:22,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds awesome.

2748
03:04:23,749 --> 03:04:29,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing, and this is completely retarded, but PlayStation 3 apparently is going to start supporting AmbX.

2749
03:04:31,715 --> 03:04:32,295
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is that?

2750
03:04:32,555 --> 03:04:36,936
[SPEAKER_03]: AmbX is a stupid little thing that you plug into your... It's right now for computers.

2751
03:04:37,276 --> 03:04:43,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It has colored lights that change colors depending on the scenes that are in your game.

2752
03:04:43,377 --> 03:04:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's also fans that blow hot and cold air at you and it vibrates and craps.

2753
03:04:48,658 --> 03:04:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

2754
03:04:49,118 --> 03:04:49,998
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be cool.

2755
03:04:50,498 --> 03:04:51,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and craps.

2756
03:04:52,059 --> 03:04:52,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And craps!

2757
03:04:53,379 --> 03:04:55,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say, hey, this sucks shit.

2758
03:04:59,140 --> 03:04:59,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2759
03:05:00,711 --> 03:05:02,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be a feature in Excite Trucks 2.

2760
03:05:03,533 --> 03:05:04,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the truck's crap.

2761
03:05:06,616 --> 03:05:07,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why not?

2762
03:05:07,816 --> 03:05:13,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You see those guys that drive down the freeway and they have the balls hanging from their trucks?

2763
03:05:13,561 --> 03:05:14,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

2764
03:05:14,842 --> 03:05:15,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they can crap too.

2765
03:05:16,103 --> 03:05:17,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't justify that behavior, Rob.

2766
03:05:18,505 --> 03:05:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the most vile thing possible.

2767
03:05:20,886 --> 03:05:24,329
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have that on the back of your truck, take it off your truck and choke yourself with it.

2768
03:05:27,231 --> 03:05:27,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

2769
03:05:28,372 --> 03:05:29,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Please die.

2770
03:05:31,149 --> 03:05:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one quick last minute story or I'm going to get the crap kicked out of me by Travis and John over at Under Sedation Live.

2771
03:05:39,634 --> 03:05:42,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they're down to like, I want to say like 32 games or 16.

2772
03:05:42,876 --> 03:05:43,376
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are they at?

2773
03:05:43,396 --> 03:05:43,376
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.

2774
03:05:43,736 --> 03:05:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: They're down to like the top.

2775
03:05:48,899 --> 03:05:49,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2776
03:06:15,017 --> 03:06:18,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We got engaged in theory on Valentine's Day.

2777
03:06:45,097 --> 03:06:46,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I did on Valentine's Day?

2778
03:06:47,159 --> 03:06:50,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Sat home and cried and ate Lean Cuisine.

2779
03:06:50,142 --> 03:06:51,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I did.

2780
03:06:51,543 --> 03:06:52,144
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2781
03:06:53,245 --> 03:07:00,312
[SPEAKER_10]: But ours was really cool and nerdy because we were watching UHF and eating French bread with spinach dip and drinking Munchweizitz wine.

2782
03:07:01,210 --> 03:07:11,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say one of the coolest Valentine's Days I had was when the ex and I went to the Star Trek tour at Long Beach.

2783
03:07:11,455 --> 03:07:13,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty nerdy-tastic Valentine's Day.

2784
03:07:15,717 --> 03:07:16,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people get married.

2785
03:07:16,597 --> 03:07:18,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people boldly go where no man has gone before.

2786
03:07:18,638 --> 03:07:19,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you do?

2787
03:07:19,298 --> 03:07:20,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Which kind of are the same thing.

2788
03:07:23,700 --> 03:07:24,020
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2789
03:07:24,601 --> 03:07:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats to Travis.

2790
03:07:26,441 --> 03:07:26,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucker.

2791
03:07:27,833 --> 03:07:31,816
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, Jenna's the real sucker, actually, in that relationship.

2792
03:07:31,956 --> 03:07:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we love them.

2793
03:07:33,137 --> 03:07:34,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I missed the bachelor party.

2794
03:07:34,438 --> 03:07:34,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out.

2795
03:07:35,719 --> 03:07:44,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, thanks to all you guys for tuning in and listening to us, whether it be on Justin.TV or on All Games Radio or on the podcast when it gets updated, which, you know, will be sooner than usual.

2796
03:07:45,247 --> 03:07:46,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

2797
03:07:46,207 --> 03:07:47,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next week.

2798
03:07:47,068 --> 03:07:48,669
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do it all again next week, right?

2799
03:07:49,370 --> 03:07:51,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now everyone knows what my home life is like.

2800
03:07:51,812 --> 03:07:52,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck yeah.

2801
03:07:52,733 --> 03:07:52,993
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2802
03:07:53,833 --> 03:07:54,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickly, final thoughts.

2803
03:07:55,074 --> 03:07:56,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get final thoughts.

2804
03:07:56,055 --> 03:07:56,936
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2805
03:07:57,881 --> 03:07:58,722
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what you're doing.

2806
03:07:59,622 --> 03:08:01,864
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is Warp Core Breach.

2807
03:08:02,004 --> 03:08:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Yum.

2808
03:08:02,625 --> 03:08:02,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2809
03:08:04,046 --> 03:08:05,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a Cage Match song.

2810
03:08:06,287 --> 03:08:06,548
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2811
03:08:06,748 --> 03:08:07,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it.

2812
03:08:07,268 --> 03:08:16,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

2813
03:08:16,996 --> 03:08:17,696

2816
03:08:22,259 --> 03:08:23,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Please leave us a nice review somewhere.

2817
03:08:24,261 --> 03:08:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, Super Weemageddon.

2818
03:08:27,768 --> 03:08:30,529
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2819
03:08:31,049 --> 03:08:34,310
